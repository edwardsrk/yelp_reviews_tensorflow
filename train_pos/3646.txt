b"Hooowww have I not written a review about this place yet?! I'm dying to stand up on my soapbox! The fiance\xc2\xb4 and I have come to Okra twice now, and both times we've sat at the bar (everyone knows the bar is the best place in any restaurant). Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).Some highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!Next, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.On to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.Lastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...The pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).The donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*One pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find. The sign is on 7th so you might be tempted to pull into the parking lot where it is, but you have to turn down Palo Verde (small side street) to get to it - it'll be on your left."
