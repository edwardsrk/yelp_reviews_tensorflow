b'Let me start off by saying that I\'ve been coming to Vegas for 20 plus years. I\'ve stayed in many hotels and I\'ve had horrible experiences in most of them... This time I   reluctantly decided to stay at the Flamingo. It\'s the oldest hotel in the area so it CAN\'T be as "good" as the others, right? Wrong. By far the best hotel I\'ve stayed at in Vegas. Where Trump had wonderful rooms but no casino, Flamingo came in with a wonderful room AND a Casino. Where Treasure Island had horrible service and crappy rooms, Flamingo came in with wonderful customer service and a wonderful room. My room was clean, comfortable and neat. Every person working there greeted me with a smile. And the biggest plus of all? The Flamingo let me bring my dog and let me walk her anywhere except for the casino and pool area. Plus, plus, and PLUS. From now on every time I visit Vegas I will only stay at The Flamingo. Screw the rest of these modernized barf hotels. Stay where the REAL Las Vegas history remains....  Thank you Flamingo ........and Margaritaville (for the massive hangover)... ;)'
