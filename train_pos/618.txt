b'Great locally owned restaurant!  Very nice location at the Metropolitan.  Huge dining room, including private dining rooms in the back and a great patio overlooking uptown Charlotte.  The goat cheese appetizer was delicious and my steak was cooked to perfection.  The staff was super friendly and the owner as well as the manager came over to check on us during our meal...which was much appreciated.  I will be back!'
