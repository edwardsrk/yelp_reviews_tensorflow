b"My husband and I walked in right as the doors opened and were greeted immediately. Everyone was very welcoming and we loved the decor. Our server Tony offered us the daily specials, answered all our questions and even made suggestions. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had the pretzels with cheese for appetizers. They were the best we've ever had! Our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. Loved everything! Everyone should give this place a try when downtown. They'll be thrilled with the atmosphere, people and most importantly the awesome food!!!"
