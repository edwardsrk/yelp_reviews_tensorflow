b"We got this deal merely for sleeping, we weren't looking for entertainment. That is what the strip is for. I got a deal for this hotel for two nights and in total spent $150. I was very satisfied. The hotel itself has everything you need to feel at home and more. One downfall inside the room was that the balcony was not open so we couldn't take in the view. It came with a jacuzzi bathtub and rainfall shower head! The kitchen was a plus although we didn't use it. Check in was quick and easy and so was check out. I wish I would've bought more groupons for this hotel but I didn't know what to expect. I will be back again that's for sure :) also it's like a minute drive down flamingo road to the strip, not bad at all!!! And they have complimentary shuttles to the strip at the Palms to Caesars Palace, research stuff before you complain. It is was a good stay."
