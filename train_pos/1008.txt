b'This a great little neighborhood sports bar.  It\'s our go-to place for UFC events.  The place is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we\'ve always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).  We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don\'t charge a cover fee for UFC events & sometimes have coupons, it\'s not too bad.The food isn\'t 5 star amazing, but it\'s pretty solid for a joint like this.  We\'ve tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we\'ve been visiting Augie\'s.  For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks & pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.  Their wings are run-of-the-mill & sadly they don\'t offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it\'s a soft medium IMO).  The burgers & sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.  The best things on the menu are the ribs & pizza.  The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they\'re super tender with a sweet sauce & fall off the bone.  The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie\'s.  If fact, I\'d even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.  The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce & cheese they use.  It\'s definitely worth a try.  Pro tip - order it "well done" to get a nice slightly charred edge.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.  It\'s simple, but good & surely plentiful.All in all, we\'re lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.  They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place.'
