b'DeLuca\'s is a Pittsburgh landmark with a great reputation... and I found it to be "all that and a bag of chips."  Get there early... as it gets packed on the weekends.  There is no wait list, so you need to get in line.  Once seated, I found the wait staff was very attentive.The food was delicious and I will look to return here next time I\'m in the Burgh.   Loved the Pittsburgh Slam with 2 eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and French Toast (Lingonberry Preserve & Lemon).The Coffee is good and the menu has a lot of interesting dishes for both breakfast and lunch.  As I was here for breakfast, I hope to go back soon to explore some of the other dishes.'
