b"We got a GO Room with a Strip View and were so impressed! It was a really nice room. PLUS, it is such a good value! Last time we stayed at Caesar's Palace, and this was actually better. The upsides: we had a view of the fountains at Bellagio and the Paris eiffel tower -- so cool:), there was a nice lounge/love seat for admiring the view from the floor to ceiling windows, there was a fridge and coffee maker, clean and very comfy bed and pillows, modern and nice tv, bathroom, etc., super-easy access from room to strip (you did not have to walk far) and perfect strip location, the pool was laid-back, fun and big -- We loved it! The one slight downside is it's a bit older casino, but it is not run down, and it was nice to have access to the food court -- for late night snacks or non-expensive food choices. We try to stay in different places each time we head to Vegas, but this was such a nice room, location and amazing value, we may have to come again!"
