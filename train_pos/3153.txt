b"Awesome customer service! I finally upgraded and got so much help. The sparkling female there was so nice. She explained the difference from my old device to the new one I just decided on. She helped with flavors (bc with the upgrade the flavor tasted different than what I'm used to) she helped balance it out and made sure I left liking what I had. Above and beyond. I've tried a few shops in the area but this is the ONLY one now!!! Thank you."
