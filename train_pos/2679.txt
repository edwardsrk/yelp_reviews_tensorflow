b"Shamrock Burger is an eastern Scarborough institution. It's one of those places where they serve fries which actually have potatoes in it, burgers which actually have meat in them. The food is pretty hearty, the people are usually pretty nice. It's fairly simple food, made well. Proving, sometimes simple is good."
