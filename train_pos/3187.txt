b"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I'm a bit of a sucker for Irish fare in general, but the atmosphere here takes it a step further. Small and intimate with dark woods and nice artistic accents. I've had just about everything on the menu and the only thing I was unimpressed with was the roasted chicken. Definitely try the fisherman's stew! It's sooo goooood. The corned beef and cabbage is amazing, the shepherd's pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful. They do a great snakebite too (which down in Chambana is Guinness and cider, not Guinness and Harp)"
