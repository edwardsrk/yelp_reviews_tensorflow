b"We were out of town on a business trip and looking for somewhere local but not too pricy to eat. We found a flyer for this place in the door of our hotel room so we decided to give it a shot. The inside of the place is a total dump but don't let that fool you! We ordered three pizzas, two pepperoni and one meat lovers. Also I had the turkey sandwich. The pizza was fantastic!!! The crust is thin crust but it's yummy! The cheese and pepperoni are really yummy too! Good quality cheese. The meat lovers was amazing too! The turkey sandwich was pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that I didn't know it came with onions (the menu only says it comes with cheese) and I don't really like onions but what ever because after I bit into one I just took them off. Overall would highly recommend this place if you're in Vegas and looking for a good pizza place or a mom and pop restaurant to support.P.s. The prices are fair too it was $20 for a medium pepperoni and a turkey sandwich"
