b"Not sure if I saw anything related to a 'bakery' but definitely this place serves great authentic tacos like the ones you would get from a taco truck. I had both the chicken and carnitas tacos - actually went with the 4 tacos, beans, rice and soda special for $5.00. What a deal! I'd take this over a $5 footlong anyday.A sign says 'best nachos' in Las Vegas. Not sure I would go that far but can definitely agree the carne asada nachos were good and for the price $6.75, can be split between 2 people.Interesting decor and wooden tables inside, 'hole in the wall' strip mall atmosphere. Would definitely return for more tacos!"
