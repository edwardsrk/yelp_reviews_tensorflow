b'We were in Henderson for 3 nights. Found the Rose Garden online. It is on a side street and not in a new, fancy area. BUT the food was absolutely wonderful! My husband ordered  Chicken Kon Po and I ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. I was delighted when it arrived and had the goodies that restaurants use to serve: the yummy sauce, peppers, onions,carrots and pineapple!  And such a nice presentation on a tray. The restaurant is older but nice inside and the staff was very gracious. We live in N.C.  and will probably never get here again but that will be our loss.'
