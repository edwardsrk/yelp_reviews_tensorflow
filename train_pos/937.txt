b'Great drinks and an exceptional happy hour.  Had a Grey Goose dirty martini and the Ahi Tuna plate.  Both excellent.  The Ahi is not as good as PF Changs which I think is the best non-Japanese restaurant Ahi.  I did see a midget and that makes me happy.  Those little upside down bowling pins for legs.  Her big-sized friends lifted her up onto her chair where she was stuck when her friends went to the bathroom.  Little Barbi purse.....I could go on.  They just make me smile.  Caused me to stay and get another drink just to enjoy the scene.'
