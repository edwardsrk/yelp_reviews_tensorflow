b"This place should really decide whether or not it wants to be an Outback Steakhouse or a premium steak house as advertised.  First things first, the service here was top notch from everyone from the hostess the busers, the waiter and the manager.  They were attentive without  being annoying, fast, and pleasant to deal with.In regards to the food, the wife and I shared an appetizer of shrimp and cheesy grits which were both cooked and season perfectly.  For the main dish I had their signature dry aged steak and my wife had the fillet.  Both steaks were cooked to our request and tasted great.  The wife's fillet was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth.Here is the con.  The resturant advertised itself as high end charging premium prices.  Their website stated that the dress was business casual.  When I pay 195 bucks for two people to eat I expect great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  And the last thing is the reason I can't give it five stars.  I have nothing against tee shirts and cargo shorts, in fact that's how I dress normally...just not when I go to a place with a dress code.  They allowed guest to come in wearing torn t-shirts and baseball caps and people that were so drunk they couldn't stand without assistance.  I'm all good with that...if I'm eating at an outback steak house."
