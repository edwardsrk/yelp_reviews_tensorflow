b'Very sweet romantic little corner restaurant with excellent service, food & ambiance. Would highly recommend for a nice romantic date or to have a quiet dinner with a friend with beautiful ambiance. We had a steak and fish and they were prepared deliciously and fresh. Prices were very good for such a high quality meal. The restaurant accommodates about 25-30 seated plus there is a small bar. This place could easily be rented out for an intimate gathering as well.'
