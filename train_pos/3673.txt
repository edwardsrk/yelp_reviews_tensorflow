b"I visited PMI Green Valley today for an annual mammogram. From the front desk to the mammogram itself, the staff at PMI is absolutely wonderful. My tech (Emma) was patient, informative, and best of all, very personable and funny. I've had several positive experiences with this imaging center in the past but after today's visit, I can't recommend this imaging center high enough."
