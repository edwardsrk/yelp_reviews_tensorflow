b"Solid thai food in Old Town!  My uncle turned me on to this place a few years ago and I try to make it here at least once per visit.To start:Siamese Kisses - I would consider these a thai version of shu mai with chicken instead of the traditional pork.  Six small dumplings stuffed with chicken and shrimp are paired with a chili paste and a soy sauce with green onion.  Very good appetizer for sharing!Entrees:Chicken Panang Curry - Probably my favorite on the menu.  It's loaded with flavor and spice and has plenty of chicken in it!  Put that over some rice and I'm in heaven.Drunken Dragon Noodles - I want to love it, but it just seems like another version of phad thai.  They consider it to be phad  kee mao, but I've never had phad kee mao with phad thai noodles.  I love it with the wide noodles.  I also thought the sauce should've been a little sweeter and there were way too many bean sprouts.  Flavors were decent, but I'll try something else next time.Dessert:Mango and Sticky Rice - This stuff is so addicting with the condensed milk on top!The service is outstanding and I love the atmosphere (even if it isn't very traditional Thai decor) and especially enjoy sitting on the patio if it's not too hot out."
