b"Eden Nails & Spa has the biggest selection of gel colors that I've ever seen. They have so many different colors, glitter, gradients and really cute nail designs/charms. I'm happy that I found this place and made an appointment instead of paying double the price at the hotel I stayed in. A man did my pedicure, I didn't get his name, he was quiet, which was nice because I was able to relax.  Jenny did my manicure and she was very nice, fun to talk to and I hope she's working the next time I am in Las Vegas. I paid $70 for gel manicure with two small jewels and a regular pedicure. Several people have complimented my nails. I love it!  Tips:Open early (9:00 am - 10:00 pm)Nail designs are $5 for small and $10 for large"
