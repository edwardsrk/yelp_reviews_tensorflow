b"Love the decor, service, food and drinks! This is great little spot for a date night or small group of friends. It's got a a very intimate feel.  We started out with one of their signature cocktails. A little on the small side for $10 but very good.  We moved on to Oysters, tuna tartar, and beef carpaccio. The oysters came with two different dipping sauces that were lighter than a cocktail sauce but big on flavor. That mixed with fresh squeezed lemon and the oysters tasted superb!  The tuna tartar was served with delish waffle fries that were lightly sprinkled with a red pepper. Last we had the beef carpaccio. It was served with these amazing seaweed crisps, arugula, and cherry tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and a drizzle of olive oil( I think, at least that was the base for whatever was drizzled on there...good none the less) I was full and happy when we finished.  The service was great as well.   :"
