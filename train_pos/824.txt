b"We went there on a late Sunday afternoon to try their dim sum and did not regret it.We tried maybe 10 to 15 different dim sum varieties including the deserts and it was delicious and seemed fresh.My personal favourites were the BBQ pork pastry, the deep fried mashed taro balls and the tiny bee desert. The interior is interesting with dimmed lighting. I caught myself looking at their nicely decorated shelves all the time which had also interesting lighting. The service was not too bad although the waiters aren't the friendliest folks.We will definitely go back."
