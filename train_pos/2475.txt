b"Love coming to Pink Taco every time I come to Vegas.The chips and salsa could constitute a meal on their own. It comes with three different salsa options and the tortilla chips are made fresh. For an app, the sweet corn tamales are amazing, I absolutely love the chicken tostada salad and get it every time. Also greatly recommend the drinks, the pina colada is my favorite.Service has always been great, all the staff is very friendly. Ambiance is nice with fun decor. Definitely a little loud though but it's a great place for happy hour and catching a football game.The only downside is there is always a line out the door, and I don't think you can make reservations. So get there early!"
