b"I am fortunate enough to work in Inglewood so I can enjoy the Dragon Pearl for lunch anytime I like. The owners are lovely! They are always smiling and friendly. The Dragon Pearl has a fantastic lunch special. The portion is a fair size...enough for 2 lunches actually! I LOVE the Szechuan Beef! It's not that sticky, sweet mess you get in dingy food courts. The beef is so incredible tender and the vegetables are always perfectly cooked. Just the right amount of crunch from the broccoli... Yum! They also have a delicious Wor Wonton soup. Perfect for those chilly fall days."
