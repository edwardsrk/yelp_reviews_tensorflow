b"I do enjoy wreaking a little havoc on the strip from time to time. The people watching is good, the scenes are cool and window shopping is excellent. Plus I find myself frequenting the strip to get to casinos, clubs and restaurants, I can't stay away for too long.It's a great place to just sit and watch a lot of entertaining shit go down and blend in with the crazies if you're up for it, but after dealing with a lot of idiotic drivers and drunk tourists on the strip I dread driving on it. The taxis run you off the street and typically drive like jerks. The pedestrians rule the strip, but that doesn't mean you have the green light to prance around like a tourist fool. Oh you're crossing the street when you shouldn't be and you got hit by a moving vehicle? Sorry, not sorry.If people watching bores you, the street performers are always out full force on the weekends, just make sure to tip them if you take a photo of them/ with them - if not, get ready to be professionally mean-mugged or verbally assaulted. Or you can be cool and take a picture for free with a bum - your choice. There are a lot of free sights to see - I always enjoy a classic Bellagio water fountain show, it never gets old. Also, the Volcano fire show at The Mirage is pretty thrilling and heats things up, literally!The beloved strip is best enjoyed at night, all of the glimmering lights, cascading banners and marquees, make it that much more magical and worth the trip to the strip. You either hate her or you love her, but she will always be my special, dirty girl."
