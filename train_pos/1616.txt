b"Surprised to see the negative reviews. This is one of my favorite Vegas places. Great food and I've never had service issues there and I've eaten there maybe a dozen times. If you're skeptical, take a chance and go. I've never had a bad experience.I especially recommend the mini wontons in hot chili oil appetizer and the eggplant in szechuan garlic sauce entree. Service is accurate and prompt.A reservation is not a bad idea for a large party, but my wife and I walked in at 645 on a Saturday night and got a table right away."
