b"Hidden gem of a restaurant that you would definitely pass by if not for a local Yelper (Bozan) who has inside knowledge of how amazing the specialty beef noodle soup is here. Really it sure is outstanding for Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The broth is wonderfully rich in flavour. So rich yet not salty and a great mix of tender fall off the bone meat plus Shanghai bok chop with a chewy noodle. If you are into pho you must try this soup as its different yet flavour is out of this world!  A bowl of soup on a cold fall-winter day is an amazing way to warm up the body. They also offer a hot chilli sauce to zip it up another notch if spicy is to your liking. The restaurant is simple yet decor is clean and comfortable. The husband and wife team do also special Taiwanese cookies which we got to sample the pineapple filled ones which were a pleasant finish to a big bowl of soup. Service was friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant on the visit so we had more personal explanations of their culture with some jokes thrown in.Price wise it's extremely inexpensive at around $10 a bowl. The crew that came left with full tummies and content satisfaction. The menu is small but you can sense they care to serve you their home cooking plus dedication to delivering a top notch meal! I haven't found many places in MTL that specilaze in Taiwanese food. There is not a huge offering on the menu as they have mainly Chinese dishes plus some Sushi but the soup is out of this world!  I'm definitely coming back to sample more dishes of the menu specifically speaking their stir fry's."
