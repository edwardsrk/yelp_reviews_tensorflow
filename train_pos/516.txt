b'this is probably in my top 3 favorite bars in montreal. they typically have metal playing and they have awesome d\xc3\xa9cor. very cool paintings on the wall that are all for sale. the bathrooms appear to be a wreck and are completely covered in graffiti and stickers, however its actually very clean. the only reason I couldn\'t give it 5 stars is that the beer selection is pretty terrible. they really only have light beers which really doesn\'t cater to the taste of me or any of my friends. also the bouncers seem like theyre just constantly looking for a reason to kick someones ass which tends to make me feel pretty uncomfortable. the guy at the door was nice, it was just the 2 pacing around constantly that seemed to be giving everyone "make my day" type of look.'
