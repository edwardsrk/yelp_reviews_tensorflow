b'Beautiful hotel and in response to other reviews I thought it smelled fine. Rooms were clean and ready for an early check-in. The lobby was a little cold but kind of expected it since the atrium was huge. The only improvement would be to temperature check your breakfast buffet line more often, my wife said everything was cold and that was even after they brought out a fresh batch of breakfast potatoes.'
