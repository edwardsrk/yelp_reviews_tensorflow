b"One of my friends was in from out of town so I brought her here.  Everything we had was delicious and the wait wasn't bad at all, we must have come in before the dinner rush.  We ended up trying the fried brussles sprouts, which were delicious. The Saganaki on the menu says it is flamed, but either the girl forgot, or they just don't truely flame it, so was kind of disappointed.  The Fried meatballs which were divine.  And the yellowtail Hamachi melted in my mouth. The drinks were very tasty as well, they had a granny smith apple cocktail that could be dangerous, as you couldn't taste the alcohol in it, so we ordered two. ;)In all, loved this place, will definately go back again."
