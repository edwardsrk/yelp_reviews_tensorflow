b"For being a craft beer bar, the kitchen was surprisingly on point. The quinoa bowl, especially, was fresh and full of delicious veggies. Put a couple of fried eggs over it, drown it in hot sauce and call it a day. Or at least call it a filling and healthy lunch. There's plenty of indoor and patio seating and the live music (two dudes on guitar / vocals during our visit) added a nice touch of audio. Also, TV's everywhere for The Sports. Extensive beer menu and full bar + all you drink brunch mimosas. I didn't have a chance to try any of the house brews but managed to find a delicious Irish stout by SD-based Mike Hess. Plenty of California and Arizona craft brews to choose from. We popped in for lunch before a spring training baseball game so I can't speak to what this place is at night, but it was a great midday choice to relax and enjoy some tasty food and beer."
