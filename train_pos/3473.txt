b"If anyone is looking for quality electrical work, choose Next Generation Electrical Technologies. They have performed work twice now at my residence and have exceeded all my expectations. Most current job was switching outdated lights in garage to LED lights mounted to ceiling. Not only did they come early, they did the work in record time and I didn't have to wait all day! They called first to make sure I was home, awesome follow up!  Thank you Next Gen for providing quality customer service."
