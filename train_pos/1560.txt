b'My daughter and I had a couple of the beef and lamb gyros.  They were wonderful.  The meat was tender and juicy,  the bread was soft and pliable.  The only thing that I could find wrong was the tazeki sauce could have used some more spices, it was kind of blah.  We would go back.  Service was great too.'
