b"This place was more of a lounge then anything else, but really nice inside. It would be better to get bottle services, that way you don't have to stand around because most of the seats are reserved. The girls just got lucky to find seats, what a blessing. They also have free champagne from 11-12 on Fridays, same as for Saturday but you had to get on the guest list.Great music and a cool hang out for such a small place, great mix crowd."
