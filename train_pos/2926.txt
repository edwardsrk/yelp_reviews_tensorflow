b"Have only been here twice but good place to grab a drink and the pho and Vietnamese rolls were pretty tasty, although I would say this is a bonus to being in the bar - not the reason to go here. Pizza is just there but frankly I didn't go for pizza either. Owner is very friendly and works hard for her business! But as others note - this is first and foremost a bar."
