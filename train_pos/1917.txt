b'OMG! Went tonight and the baby back ribs were not on the menu!! They still made them for us but said they will be "phasing them out". Please mister manager or corporate person re-think this. If you take the ribs off the menu my wife won\'t want to go as often!! You are gonna lose customers!! Save the Baby Backs!!'
