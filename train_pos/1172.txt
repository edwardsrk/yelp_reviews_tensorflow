b'Wonderful experience. I loved everything we ordered from the shrimp and grits to the "drunken" opha fish. Don\'t miss the jalapeno-corn side dish. The cocktails are very imaginative - I tried their take on a pimms cup. The atmosphere here is very hip, loungy and dark. Our bartender was a little obsessed with another couple and it required us waving him down each time we needed something, but I\'m sure service at the tables is better.'
