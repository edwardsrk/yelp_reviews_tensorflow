b"Went here last Friday night with my wife, after several recommendations from friends.  For the most part, we were not disappointed.The ambiance is fine, and the service was friendly.They had Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout on tap. Already off to a good start.For appetizers, we had the cheddar-bacon biscuits.  They were very good, and the orange-jalape\xc3\xb1o butter that accompanied them was interesting.  The biscuits were as good with and without the butter, but with the butter the flavor profile was much different.We also had a four cheese and pancetta grilled cheese sandwich. It was heavenly. bread was soft, the cheese was gooey, and the pancetta gave it a delicious saltiness. It comes with a tomato soup that is fine, but sort of overpowers the sandwich.  I recommend eating them separately.For our entrees, I ordered the meatloaf special and my wife ordered the cast iron skillet chicken.  The cast iron skillet chicken was the biggest disappointment of the night.  It wasn't bad, it was just mostly unremarkable.  The biscuit stuffing that came with it was superb, however.But oh, the meatloaf.  I'm still thinking about the meatloaf.  I didn't think it was possible to like meatloaf this much.  It's made with beef and veal, and the result is the most tender meatloaf I've ever had.  I would almost describe it as creamy.  If you go here and they have the meatloaf on special, at least one person at the table should get it.For dessert, we had some of their house made ice cream.  We ordered the milk chocolate ice cream, which was darker than we expected.  We like dark chocolate though, so it turned out great.  The ice cream has an almost pudding-like texture--it seems closer to gelato than traditional ice cream.  It was a great ending to a great meal.Basically, everything but my wife's entree was fantastic, and even that was certainly fine.  The prices are a bit steep, but they're not at all unreasonable.  We will definitely be going back here."
