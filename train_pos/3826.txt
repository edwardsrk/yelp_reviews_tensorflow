b'I went very close to closing time but the staffs were extremely friendly. They have amazing Banh mi. If you are a meat eater you definitely should try the grill pork Banh mi. The pork is tender and moist. The bread is warm. I had the vegetarian banh mi and it was delicious. I am glad they open near the University. They are generous with the portion. Amazing Thai tea.'
