b'Had early Friday night pre-theater dinner here. Once we got a waiter\'s attention the service was very good. Attentive with good suggestions but not intrusive. Casual open air atmosphere, causal but lively ambience, perfect for dinner with friends. My wife & her friend enjoyed a "prickly pear margarita" not too sweet very tasty!  Excellent food overall chips and salsa were fresh. Guac was tasty & paired well with the chips. We had 3 dishes perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely spiced a bit messy but worth it. Nice fresh updated take on classic fare. Will certainly go back!'
