b'It was my first time eating breakfast here and it was good. The croissant was just like the ones in Paris with a touch of sweetness on top. I had the croissant breakfast sandwich and it was good. The ham was not warm but it was tasty.  The mocha cafe was one of the best I had. I will be returning for more.'
