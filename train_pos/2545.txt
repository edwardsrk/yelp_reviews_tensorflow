b"This was our second time visiting Pisces and I have to say it was so much better this time! I'm not sure if my last visit was just a bad night for them or if what I ordered this time around was just a better choice,but it was pretty awesome.Our server Alex was knowledgable and very attentive. I will say that they move really fast (which can be great if you have to be in and out quickly)but for people who, like myself, prefer to wait between appetizer and entree and really have a chance to talk with my guest and mull over the menu, it's kind of rushed. The menu is very detailed, so extra time is needed to see it all.What we chose- The lil bastard roll, a shrimp tempura and avocado roll topped with a crab salad and crunchy bits of onion. It's a very generously sized roll and had great flavor. We also got the crispy spicy tuna which may be one of my new favorite sushi rolls. Spicy tuna flash fried in tempura batter- mine was perfect and not cooked all the way through, so the tuna had great flavor and texture. Our very favorite was our appetizer- cucumber salad. It had raw tuna, avocado and of course cucumber in a light Asian dressing. Could have eaten it all night! Everything was very fresh and delicious! Overall we really enjoyed our quick trip to Pisces!"
