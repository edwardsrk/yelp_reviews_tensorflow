b'Dinner for 4 on a Saturday night. We got there a bit early and the place was starting to fill up. The decor and the ambiance are tip-top. The menu is very unique. An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings - Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well. We had a mix of entrees. Scallop special (only 4 scallops, but well done), Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami (spicy and delectable), Kimchi Fried Rice (a bit salty, but well done), and the Roasted Pork Noodles (very tasty). I think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there. N*joy'
