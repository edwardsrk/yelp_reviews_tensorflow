b'This little place is so cute! i honestly loved the intimate/ family owned atmosphere. Its Quiet and the service is great. The chef is really nice too.I only came in here for a fast fix so i only tried their kiss of fire roll, another roll which i dont remember the name of and some garlic edamame..The kiss of fire is absolutely amazing!! it super spicy though but it doesnt take away from the flavors i am definitely coming back for this roll.The second roll was good too but it was really limey and im not into that too much but still very delicious! their tuna is greatOnly thing is that i probably wouldnt do AYCE here because i didnt see alot of variety for my taste.. but they do have 50% off any roll when you do a la carte dine-in which i think is great'
