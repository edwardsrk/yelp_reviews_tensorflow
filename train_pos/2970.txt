b"I am rating this place against other 24 hr cafes, that is why it gets four stars. It is one of the better diners in Vegas.The appetizers were good. Mango relish on coconut shrimp was good, slaw was okay.  The sliders were good, lots of flavor.  The best thing about the meal were the crab cakes. Some of the best crab cakes I have had. Full of crab, no filler, good tasting crab.  The horseradish cream and jicama slaw they served with them were a great complement.  Definitely get the crab cakes. The French onion soup was good.  Good broth and excellent onion flavor.  My father in law got the meatloaf, it wasn't good. The flavor was there, but the texture was horrible. I got the demolition burger. Good amounts of corned beef, they overlooked my burger, asked for medium served well. The burger as a whole was tasty and very big.  My wife got the salmon tostadas. She liked them a lot, the coleslaw that comes with it not so much.  She said the tortillas were very crispy and the salmon fresh."
