b"Generally, I don't stay at suite types of hotels but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  My brother found it for all of us to stay at while in Madison for my uncle's funeral.  It's a little further out of town than I normally like but it's five minutes away from TownEast Mall and places to eat so it was perfect for the occasion.Right off the bat, because I have Hilton HHonors card, I got 500 bonus points and a chocolate bar and a bottle of water from the staff.  That was exactly what I needed.The room is large and had a fridge, microwave and a dishwasher.  None of which I needed but good to know.The free WiFi was such a joy and it was fast too.  Plenty of space to lay out my laptop and external hard drive.  Bed was comfortable although i did get bit up by something - fleas maybe. Flat screen was new with plenty of channels.The free breakfast was also good - cereals, oatmeals, bagels, fruit, muffins, coffee, OJ - all perfectly suited for us.After the funeral we returned and all of us sat in their 'family room' to play cards and have some cocktails.  Everyone was totally cool with that.I imagine that in the spring and summer this hotel stays very busy.One thing though, for some reason, they are not listed on the wall at the airport for their shuttle service.  You might want to call in advance.If I ever travel with a large group to Madison again, I'm sure we will stay there.  I highly recommend it!"
