b"Service was good, my drinks never left empty and our table got checked on often. The only thing I like out of 5 items I ordered was the hainanese chicken rice and the pig ear. Chicken wings was decent. The chicken noodle broth is a little bland to me. The mushroom dish off the app is too salty. Squeezed some lemon juice helps. Overall I'm happy with the meal. Definitely recommended their famous chicken rice."
