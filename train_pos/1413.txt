b'South Indian is always my fav for freshly made vegetarian dishes! Ordered the rava masala dosa, with a side of idli and vada. Sambhar was a bit thick for my liking, the chutneys were good, so overall all flavours were a good blend. Made the mistake of doing take-out, so the food was a bit soggy by the time I got to it. Best to enjoy in the restaurant. Tons of free parking on site. Reasonable prices and prompt service.'
