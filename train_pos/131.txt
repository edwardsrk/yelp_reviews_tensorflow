b'Great service!! Friendly staff! The Vegan selection of sandwiches is great! I got the Meatless Mike, Vegan style, with Creole Onion Kettle Chips. It was so delicious!! I just wish they had a larger selection of healthy natural beverages but I settled for the country time lemonade. Next time I will just bring my own drink but I would definitely visit again! Great place!'
