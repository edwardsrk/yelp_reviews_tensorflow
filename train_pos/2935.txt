b'First time staying here since they reopened. Very retro 50\'s vibe: very quiet and relaxing. Great pool area because there are no "slides, lazy river, etc" so mostly adults. Staff was very attentive. Bar menu: food is too eclectic. Throw some standards on there! I can tell you: room service food: horrible. Breakfast was bland, requested syrup twice for pancakes, never got it. For the price, you expect better. That said, wouldn\'t hesitate to come here again.'
