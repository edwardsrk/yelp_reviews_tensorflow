b"This place is awesome! I recently took my puggle in to get a nail grind and the staff was amazing. The girl that did her nails was sweet and patient and Ginger is not an easy one to deal with. Unlike most of us ladies she does not like getting her nails done.I got a tour of the place and the dog wash stations are pretty cool, there was every make and model of dog there getting their groom on.I can't wait to take Ging back to giver her a proper bath (and they have a blow dry station)!"
