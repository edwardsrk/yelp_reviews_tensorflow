b"The dumplings are to die for! I've gone twice now and the food has been fantastic each time.The restaurant itself is a small, cute space. That being said, you're always within a food of another table. Private conversations are probably not best had here. My only complaint was the last time I went, every 30 seconds a chef making dough would SLAM it onto the counter. It sounded like a gun shot. It made the meal really unappetizing when you're jumping every 30 seconds."
