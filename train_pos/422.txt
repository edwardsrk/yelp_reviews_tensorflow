b"We walked in 15 minutes before the doors opened for lunch on a Tuesday and were the only ones there.  By the time we left 90 minutes later, the place was packed and the line wound outside and around the corner.  And with good reason.  She started with the sweet potato soup.  It was perfection in a bowl. Sweet, creamy without being heavy.  My goat cheese queso fundido with blue corn tortilla strips was cheesy, slightly spicy, with more than enough chips. Really tasty.She had a Mesa burger, which might be the best burger she ever had.  Cooked exactly as ordered (rare),it was thick, juicy and loaded with flavor.  Even the bun stood out.My cornmeal crusted chile relleno had a delicious crust loaded with great corn flavor.  The pepper itself could have spicier to my taste, but the cheese and sauce inside blended perfectly-a well presented lunchtime treat.We both preferred the burger, but not because the chile was bad in any way.  The burger was just that good.We'd return."
