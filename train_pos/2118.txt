b'The burgers here did not disappoint... The food is 5 stars. We had a Bang Bang with house made fries and a TNT with quinoa salad. All absolutely delicious. Cooked to perfection on soft buttery brioche buns.  Bang Bang sauce is like a gourmet version of "secret sauce". Fast casual setup; order at the counter and take a seat. Good local, but limited beer selections.  The place itself is nothing fancy, simple booths, random background music... No atmosphere at all really.  But that\'s not a reason to dine somewhere anyway. The price point is perfect. Will definitely be back for more burgers!'
