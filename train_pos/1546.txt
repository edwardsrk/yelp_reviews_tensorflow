b'The ambience and customer service was amazing.  The menu also boasted of traditional culinary fare.  However, we had the two most popular items: 1. A pork in spicy red sauce with tortillas and 2. A chicken burrito.  Both times were just okay.  The portion was good and the taste was decent, but I expected a little more considering the amazing decor.  A few more seasonings and/or marinade and it could be a winner! Thank you for the hospitality!'
