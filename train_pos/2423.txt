b'Tasty food and large portions in this strip mall restaurant that i would never have found without Yelp. Sure, you can go to the fast food place next door but if you want something hand cooked and not mass produced, here you go.I opted for the Hawaiian Chicken, which arrived to my table about ten minutes later. A huge piece of grilled and sweetened chicken, a large portion of sticky white rice and a pile of macaroni salad. The chicken was good and hot, plenty flavorful and went well with the spicy sauce from the squeeze bottle that was provided.Sweet tea and Pepsi products from the soda fountain.'
