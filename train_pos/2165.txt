b'The first time I went to Harris Grill, I had been living in Pittsburgh for about a week and was on a first date. A year later, my love for Pittsburgh, my date, and Harris is unwavering. I\'ve gone to Harris about twice a month on average since, whether it\'s because friends or family are in town and I want to go someplace that\'s both fun and has an approachable menu; because it\'s 11 p.m. and I need to go someplace where the kitchen\'s still open yet it isn\'t overwhelmed with a party crowd; or because I want to enjoy happy hour food paired with an extensive beer list.I haven\'t been dazzled by everything on the menu, but I generally think the food is good to very good for the price and atmosphere. The only thing I really haven\'t liked there was the "Lasagne Aubergine," or eggplant lasagna, which I thought was too salty and generally unappealing the one time I had it.On the "okay" list: chicken quesadilla (also a bit too salty), spinach dip, and totsGood: pierogies, vegetarian chili, Jamaican jerk wings, and macaroni and cheeseVery good: "The Clogbuster" (what I consider to be a real salad, not some pathetic bar "salad" with a bunch of fatty things atop two pieces of iceberg lettuce--this one has a bunch of root vegetables, peppers, et cetera)Love: turkey burger, "Macaronis et Fromagede Langoustine" (seafood mac and cheese), and dry-rub bacon wingsThe Harris staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive (even during busy times that are typical of nights, weekends, and happy hours). The bar really isn\'t big enough for the kind of crowd it draws, and it can get pretty packed and noisy, but when the patio\'s open, it helps relieve some of that crowdedness. Oh, and the parking on and off Ellsworth is a nightmare. Still, I think it\'s worth a visit for anyone who\'s looking for a no-fuss night out.'
