b"I really enjoy this course.  Desert and water landscape.  Not to difficult for me as I am far from being a pro.  The staff is really friendly.  The only problem I have is I never see the beverage carts.  You have to stick up from the gift shop because you are not allowed to bring your own and I think I've seen a beverage cart once in the 10 times I've played here."
