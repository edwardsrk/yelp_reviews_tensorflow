b'I wanted to try something new, and didn\'t want to see my high-school sweetheart on the other corner. Now I\'m coming back to review LT, and I see "update review". Wait, have I met this one before? Definitely a lot has changed since then and I didn\'t even recognize it.The breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I\'d say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don\'t get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don\'t mess around with portions. I\'d say its a solid 4/5. I haven\'t had as much Tex Mex due to living in NE, so I might be overinflating, but I also think the carne asada could use some work. It all balances.'
