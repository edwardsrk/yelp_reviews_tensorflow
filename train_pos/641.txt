b"You should not go unless you have a reservation. We went unplanned b/c we were in the area. And granted it's a nice basement, but you kind of feel second class getting relegated to the basement. Sitting next to a flat screen playing college basketball doesn't scream fine dining. But maybe that's my fault b/c the rest of this review is positive. Our food was cooked very well. Great flavors and selection (meatless friendly options, etc.). I had the delicious sea scallops in lobster sauce (I only got three though). I think I would have preferred traditional gnocchi as opposed to the semolina, they were a bit doughy. But they did soak up the sauce well, so maybe that's why, obviously Zack Bruell knows more than I do. My wife liked her risotto. The service was professional. But for the price there are better Italian options not far away."
