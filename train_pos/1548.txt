b'A soul-inspired restaurant with a soul-warming mission. Reserved a table for two to catch up with a friend for dinner. Service with a smile, menu is the right length to provide options and focused so that they deliver good quality. Bakery looked even better so would be interested in trying something from there for breakfast sometime. The tables were full when we were there on a Tuesday, and it can get a little loud when full (likely due to tile floors).'
