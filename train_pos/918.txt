b"A nice little quaint Italian restaurant. It's family owned and they take pride in making amazing delicious Italian dishes. The service staff is friendly and very attentive. Pizza crust is the closest I have had to NY style pizza. Good sauce and fresh toppings. Their pasta sauces are delicious.  Will definitely keep coming back. I would recommend."
