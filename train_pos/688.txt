b"Tried it after being open less than 2 wks. Was disappointed they didn't have their liquor license yet to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.Food was very flavorful. Decor and ambiance was great away from that front window area. Loved the Baba ganoush and never had to ask for more bread. The salad was great too but too large. Share one next time. The kibbe was not at all what I have had all of my life - very different flavor of herbs and somewhat dry. I'd try something else next time.Service was way above average, especially in Las Vegas."
