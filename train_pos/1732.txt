b'Definitely something I would recommend if you\'re looking for a nice, upscale dinner but with a comfortable environment. The restaurant itself is quaint and cozy. The staff was very friendly and well-versed on the menu. Portion size was actually very decent for the price. Not a load of food like at the Cheesecake Factory but enough to keep you content. Definitely would recommend the "Bone Marrow Appetizer" if you want to try something unique... yes, you read that right. It\'s bone marrow from a cow! Crazy good actually when you spread it on the included crostini\'s. *PLUS: complimentary WARM bread with butter.'
