b"With a party of 7, we booked a reservation for 6 and was easily added on an extra person when we got to the restaurant. Overall, food was prettttty good, but service was lacking for what the price of the restaurant. Service felt a bit disorganized. Let's start with their complimentary Baguette with jam and butter. Love their baguette - light, crisp, and perfect with their jam. I could just eat this for the meal. Cheese platter was one of the best I've had - it came with cow, sheep, and goat cheese; hard, medium, soft; mild, semi pungent. My favorite was the truffle cheese - oh man, the truffle flavor was strong. Along with the cheeses were honey comb, walnut, sliced apples, and delicious bread crisp with dried fruits. Pair the sweet offerings with the Cheese, it was a perfect flavor medley in the mouth. Moving onto my Omlette Du Jour - I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting a fluffier omlette, but I think my eggs were a bit over cooked. French Onion Soup was divine - the soup was reduced, the caramelized onion flavor really shined through, a bit salty as French Onion soup tends to be, cheese was perfect."
