b"Only absolutely Lovely things to say about LOV! This place has the feels... you know the feels, when you need a bohemian, tropical vibe on a freezing Montreal day, yeah, those feels! The inside is super tropical, yet minimalist and clean. I'm talking clean lines, white on green on pale green. It is a floral masterpiece. There is ample seating, you would never guess from the way it is tucked into a quiet part of bustling downtown Montreal that it would be so SPACIOUS! This is a great place for groups. The food was delicious as well! I'm always in the mood for a delicious vegetarian meal, and this menu has been curated well. I met my buddy from Austin for a light dinner on a Tuesday evening. I started with a Mango/ turmeric lasso- which I'll admit was my least favorite part- WAY too much turmeric and not enough mango flavor. We had the quinoa fritters to start which were absolutely delicious! I need to learn how to make these. I had the LOV Burger with onion rings and loved every bit of it. My partner and buddy ordered two very good dishes, one was a zucchini squash dish that I don't see on the menu and I can't remember the other one. The food is what knocks this rating down a star. While my burger had no faults, the other two dishes didn't wow anybody. Still willing to go back here with some of my vegan/ veggie friends who visit Montreal."
