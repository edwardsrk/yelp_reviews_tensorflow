b"Harry's is good food in a great location.  The service is top notch, the menu choices substantial and quality is excellent. The bar area is lively with quality top shelf drinks and interesting apps.  Dinner here is so good, you need your appetite and wine palate ready.  I have only had good experiences at Harry's. Need to go more often!"
