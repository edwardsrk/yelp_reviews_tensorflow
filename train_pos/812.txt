b'This is a good place. However, you must understand. This is Vegas/Henderson and fresh seafood is not readily available. Their food here appears to be pre-breaded and frozen. You place an order and they pull the food out of the freezer and drop into the fryer. The selection is large and the quality is good. If you like seafood, this is the place for you. I loved their hushpuppies. Nice and oniony flavor. My biggest disappointment is bottled dressing. Yech. How hard is it to make fresh dressing? Give them a try. They are worth the money. Fast, friendly and good food.How much else can you ask for?'
