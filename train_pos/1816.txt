b"Tomo has great ambience and great food, however my only complaint which seems to be a problem every time I visit is their service is horrible! One time we waited for  15 minutes after being seated for our drink order. A few days ago our waitress was very nice, however she completely forgot half of our order. And when reminded she still didn't come back with everything, so we told her again. I understand things get hectic, but this seems to be a reoccurring problem, even when they are completely dead.. But again, great food, which is why we keep coming back.."
