b'First time here.  Checked in and got the pepperoni cheese stick for FREE.  It was great. The service was very welcoming as they checked to make sure if everything was ok. The dining area was roomy and my son had room to stretch his legs and did not felt pressure to just sit there-felt very welcoming. Ordered chicken wings with garlic ranch. Omg so glad we did,  it was amazing. The chicken was crispy with a nice crunch with every bite and did I mentioned the garlic.  It was so delicious!The XL pizza was huge with a crispy crust and a soft bottom texture that was not overly oily with every bite.  The topping were really tasty with half of it topped with pepperoni,  black olives, and sausages.  The other half had pepperoni,  onions,  and bacon.  To spice it up we asked for jalapeno on the side.Will definitely return.'
