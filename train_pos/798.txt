b"This place is on its way to earning 5 stars.To make a long story short, Spencer needed another trip to the vet - an emergency appt. We called yesterday to get in today and they did it - no problem and no extra charge. We even switched times on them 3 times and they were pleasant and very accommodating about it.The best part though was the staff and Dr. Stan Howard. He is great with animals and really knows his stuff. Spencer was thoroughly examined and then we even spent time discussing his diet and other concerns. Dr. Howard is very friendly and pleasant. He is a very happy person who really appears to enjoy his work. This time I got to scope out some more of his credentials and learned that he was educated partly at the University of Pennsylvania - a very prestigious college. I enjoyed my visit with him and he took care of Spencer - top notch! He knows a lot about Wheaten Terriers  and their special dietary needs and allergies. He also treats many of the show dogs in the area too, so he seems to know a lot about all the show breeds. After this visit, I felt very confident in trusting my dog's health care to him.Spencer will soon be back (as soon as he heals) for his grooming and for the dreaded neutering. I hope after that visit I can give them 5 stars.And btw, he is unbelievably reasonable for an office visit and worked so well with us on addressing all of our concerns. I am really pleased!"
