b"Get your Pho fix at Little Saigon. I've been here several times now, & never had a bad meal. Nothing fancy here, just good big steaming bowls of Pho, along with the boba drinks I love. The soup is always good & hot, with lots of meat, as well as a side dish of accompaniments such as bean sprouts, limes, holy basil & sliced fresh jalapenos. The service is quick & what the staff lacks in english communication skills, they make up for in smiles, prompt service, quality, & quantity. The boba drinks feature nice smooth starchy balls that are softer than some of the other places I've tried. The coconut is my favorite. It cools the mouth & throat after powering down a spicy bowl of this wonderful soup. #35, steak, brisket, & tendon is my go to order. I've also tried the fried rice here, & it was top notch. The only reason I didn't give Saigon 5 stars is because the cleanliness left a little to be desired, & the beef balls were a bit too chewy. But don't let appearances fool you. There's a reason that there are several locations of this Pho restaurant. They do it right."
