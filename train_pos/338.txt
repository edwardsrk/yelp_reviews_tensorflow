b"A true French eatery. I've been here for brunch, and had La Bastille, a wonderful savory vegetarian crepe. Make sure you take a box of macarons to go! They are the real deal.The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that it is a little too French - the portions are very small for the prices. A nice treat for myself once in a while."
