b'I was really look forward to go to a Bobby Flay\'s restaurant but after being there i think the food was little bite over rated. The food was good and everything was great but it just wasn\'t what I thought it could of been. The food itself was pretty normal nothing really "in your face" or "has haves". The sauce in itself was just to die for but than Bobby is a master saucer.The pricing was normal not too bad for vegas.Service was nice and friendly but could be a little more personal.note: mean reason I put 4 star is b/c of Booby. If it was another places it would have been 3-3.5.'
