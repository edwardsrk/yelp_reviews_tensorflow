b"FYI -- the map location is a bit misleading.  The actual course is at Kenneth J Sims Park in Euclid, OH, just north of where the map shows it.Great 18-hole disc golf course.  Official 'holes' are setup with relatively good course markings.  Arguably the first few holes are the best as they run along the beach and include nice grassy fairways surrounded by trees on either side.  Once you get to the back 9 you end up with more 'field holes' where there is no distinct shape to the fairway.  A few of the holes are in heavily wooded areas so bring a spare disk or be prepared to hunt."
