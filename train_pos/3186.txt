b"What a great cocktail bar! I'd never spent time off the strip in Vegas, but I was staying in Downtown for a work trip last month when my friend and I came across Velveteen Rabbit. Vegas gets a bad name for being super kitschy and touristy, but there are places like this bar that are so refreshing and change my whole perspective on what the city has to offer. I loved the inventive menu and the back story of the bar's inception. One thing I loved about it most? It's classy, but not snooty."
