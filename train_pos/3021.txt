b'I have been coming to this sweet little place for years and think they deserve my compliments.The food is french in a not too serious and snobbish way. The wine is best enjoyed outside in the evening overlooking the "lake". They have live music (jazz guitar or piano) outside in the evenings most nights as well. Probably,one of the more romantic night spots on the west side. They also have a fantastic lunch menu, with a lobster salad croissant that is true bliss..... mmmmmm....Look them up for their specials, like wine tastings and discounted days.'
