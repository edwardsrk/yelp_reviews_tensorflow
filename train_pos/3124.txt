b'Food is FRESH, great service and the cost is very affordable. They have a great selection of items to choose from. We have 3 kids and as you know, kids can be picky eaters. Because they have such a good variety there is something for everyone....even the most picky eaters. All and all, I highly recommend this Dining establishment. Dave Sac CA'
