b'ORDER In (Delivery) ReviewI discovered this place from the front desk of the airport hotel and they recommended it highly. I called to place my order for Delivery to my room. They were very accommodating.Won Ton Soup - nice broth and tender won tons.Chicken with Diced vegetables and Cashews - again, fresh vegetables were used, and good sized pieces of chicken.Crispy Beef - much like a Ginger Beef, nice serving of Beef with a sweet chilli sauce. Very tasty.Broccoli in Garlic sauce - came with peppers,Onions , Broccoli was not over done.All in all for Delivery , this was really good. I am used to going to Authentic Asian in Vancouver. This hit the spot, and they also sent me a nice tub of Chilli Oil because I like it Hot.'
