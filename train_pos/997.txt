b'Excited to try this new place, we stopped in for lunch on our way from Pahrump to Costco in Las Vegas.  My wife had a bacon and cheese sandwich and I had a chicken breast with garnishments, both on7 grain bread.  The sandwiches come with a fresh side salad, which was good. The Chi Teas had way too much ice and not enough tea. The service and ambience of the place are good, including the old Ford F5 stakebed truck backed up to the patio and the historical pictures displayed around. This is a great place for mountain bikers, bikers, and tourists to stop in for some food and refreshments.'
