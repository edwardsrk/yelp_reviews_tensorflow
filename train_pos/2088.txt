b'Stop in and grab to Layered Oreo Sundaes took same lady that made them rung them up employees was nice and greeted us. Took about 5mins to make them both they came out good but maybe a lil too much fudge which cause the ice cream to melt too quick for the kids but still good. Shop was clean as well as the table nice and quiet on a Tuesday.'
