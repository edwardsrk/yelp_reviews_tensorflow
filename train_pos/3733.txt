b'The fried chicken is perfect- very crispy and the flavor of the coating is great. The bbq sauce on the side is just the right amount of sweet. The collard greens and mac and cheese that came with my dish (the "Late Night") were awesome as well. The pre-meal biscuits with jam and rosemary butter was 10/10. I really enjoyed being in a restaurant where the music also isn\'t loud and you don\'t have to shout over one another to have a conversation. Friendly and timely service to top it off. Overall, an excellent place, highly recommend!'
