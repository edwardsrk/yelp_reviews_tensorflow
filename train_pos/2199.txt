b'Love hitting up food joints that are authentically Piitsburgh! Kind of hard to eat a sandwich with fries and slaw in the middle on soft slices of bread, but once you understand the history and tradition of the sandwich it magically tastes better!Not exactly family friendly but they do have high chairs and can accommodate a large party'
