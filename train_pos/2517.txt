b"Been here a few times over the past month and i have to say: THIS PLACE IS DA BOMB! I'm not personally vegan, and this place still holds a sweet spot in my heart. My only problem, sometimes it can smell a bit like a gym inside, but there's chairs outside so problem solved. Check this place out if you're looking for some good dessert."
