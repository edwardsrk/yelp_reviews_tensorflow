b'Great place to stop for the Badger game! A great Wisconsin friendly place in Vegas. I would come here again. Burger was big and juicy. Service was a bit slow, but there were a ton of Badger Alumni here for the game. The Alumni Association runs raffles and has stickers and tatoos, etc. Fun place. Filling food. Friendly service.'
