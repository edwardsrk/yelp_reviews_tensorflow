b"When I went to school at Pitt, Taiwan Cafe was one of my favorite places to eat. Their lunch specials are delicious, cheap, and filling; what more can you ask for? I'm particularly fond of the General Tso's tofu (yes, it's not at all authentic, but it's still really yummy and you can get it spicy.) Unfortunately, I moved away, but whenever I make it back to Pittsburgh, I always stop by here. And although I haven't been going to this restaurant regularly for almost two years, when I stop by on a visit, the people here still recognize me. Now that's customer service done right. So in short, there's nice people and great food, and I can't recommend this place highly enough."
