b'Sorry, Elara! This review is super overdue. Elara is a great "hideout" tucked away, yet still right around the corner, from all the Vegas action. It\'s by no means a grand spot on the Strip, but it\'s a good quality hotel. I stayed with a small group in a one-bedroom suite that had a kitchenette and plenty of lounge space, and a fold-out couch. The best part about Elara is the fact that it\'s still convenient and central to the strip. Right downstairs you\'ll find access to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile shops and restaurants. Can\'t top the location.Also, if I recall correctly, this place doesn\'t charge resort fees. That aside, its rates are still very affordable. Would recommend!'
