b"Just to get it out of the way, I don't have any experience with Malay cuisine. I do like Asian cuisine in general, and spicy food as well. The wife doesn't like spicy food as much as myself, but isn't afraid of it anymore.The wife and I started with Roti Canai. The tortilla-like bread was fresh and warm. The menus says crispy, but I didn't get that. It was more like a tortilla fresh from the griddle to me. Good, but unremarkable. The curry sauce was delicious. I'd gladly eat a bowl of it as a soup, in fact, I did just that once we were out of pancake to spoon it onto. I'd definitely get it again, though I'd ask for it to be spicy.I got the Pad Himmgpan with chicken for dinner. A nice mix of meat and veggies. It's not a wet dish, so all the flavor is on the food, not leaving much for your rice. The flavor was great, the menu said it was spicy, but the spice was moderate at best, the only bit of heat coming from the jalapeno slices cooked in to the veggie mix and the non-edible red peppers. Normally I'd ask for it hotter if I went back, but the flavor of this dish was so good I'd be afraid of any additional heat coming from the addition of something that would throw that flavor off. The chicken in my dish was exceptional. I'm pretty harsh on chicken in Asian cooking, as it often comes off rubbery and tasteless. This chicken was tender and flavorful. I liked this dish enough that I will have a hard time not getting it when I go back.My wife got the Curry Laksa, an enormous bowl of noodles and veggies in the curry sauce our app was in, though it seemed less spicy. She enjoyed it, though the sauce was probably too thin to carry much flavor to the noodles. If she got it again, she might skip the noodles entirely.The service was fast and friendly and the food was good. I definitely want to drag my wife back and try it again."
