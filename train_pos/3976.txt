b"My daughters love this place especially the Little Xtremers 5 & under section. They recently did construction on the whole place and it's fantastic. We had my oldest daughter's bday party here and the party host, Rayni, was fantastic. They took care of everything, all we did was show up have fun and leave! Definitely recommend this place for moms looking for something to do with their kids."
