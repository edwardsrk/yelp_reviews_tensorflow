b"This is a really fun place, especially considering there was no wait and everywhere else around was an hour and a half wait! We wish we'd seen the specials on the board when you first walk in because there was a lot more to offer than what is on the menu (Standard British pub fare) The staff was awesome, yummy food, prepared beautifully!"
