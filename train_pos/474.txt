b"We came here on a recommendation from some other foodie friends knowing we were Top Chef fans & loves Booby Flays style of cooking. It did not disappoint! I had the blue corn lobster tacos as a starter followed by the pork tenderloin, both were fantastic but I was stuffed! The serving size was HUGE for me, especially knowing I was going out later...big meals kinda make me wanna zzzzzzzz... anyways. Yum. The place is really good. The only negative, and this just my personal preference, was that it was very noisy. So if you are looking for a quiet, romantic spot for dinner? This isn't it. But go with an appetite when you do!"
