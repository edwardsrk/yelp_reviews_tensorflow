b'Wanted to try a new place for Pho Thai and found this on yelp. Ordered the Pho Thai, Spring Rolls and a strawberry banana shake. The food is good but the service is lacking. Has to ask 2x for drinks to be refilled and also request our check. Very quiet place, not many customers. The food is good just not sure how long they will be around. They are currently providing a 50% discount on all food items. I asked if this was a Friday special  the response was no we are doing this for the next 2weeks. Thought it was a little weird? May go back just for the value!'
