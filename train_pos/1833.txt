b'Somehow we were miraculously seated right away on Labor Day.  Our server, TJ promptly greeted us and got us our waters and my ice tea.  Our orders were taken and the hot bread arrived.  Salads followed shortly afterwards.  TJ was on fire! Our meal arrived after a short wait I ordered the filet with a grilled lobster tail.  everything was cooked as requested.  Tea refilled!  This was a positive experience thanks to the fact TJ was attentive and our meal was cooked appropriately'
