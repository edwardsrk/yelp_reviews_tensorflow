b"Night out on the strip it's a must you stop by here if you are a steak lover.  The service is flawless! The drinks are impeccable!  The food makes love to your palate!The amazing things I put in my mouth:Bluepoint Oysters:  Fresh, cold, horseradish, lemon slices, chili sauce, and if I wanted Tapatio trust me the service is so amazing that they would have found it!Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail: The definition of Jumbo, excellent cocktail sauce with plenty of kick, and perfectly chilled.Surf & Turf:  This entree is my food soul mate! This dish makes fatties sweat, makes red meat junkies shiver, makes sea lovers quiver, and foodies cream their seams! Filet Mignon, Maine Lobster, and served with this delicious drip off your lip herb lobster sauce.  Made for the King of kings!!!!!!!!Went with a bottle of Moet & Chandon, my glass never was filled by me, as a matter of fact I think the service here is telepathic.  Every time I even thought of serving myself more, POOF like magic the waiter would be right there.  The waiter went as far as cleaning off the table every single time he took a plate or brought a plate.  The best part is he never interrupted conversation.Definitely an excellent experience, one that will not be forgotten."
