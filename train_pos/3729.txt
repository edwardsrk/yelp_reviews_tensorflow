b"Loved this place! I'm a Las Vegas resident and my regular sitter went MIA last minute. I called Love & Care Sitters less than 24 hours before they were needed and a great sitter showed up the next afternoon. Our sitter was extremely punctual and professional. She sent me pictures throughout the afternoon to keep us updated. The price was a little more than what we were used to, but hey, you get what you pay for and they were definitely worth it. Will use again!"
