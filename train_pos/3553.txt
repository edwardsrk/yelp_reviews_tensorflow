b"Great show. It is a very fun show and it is truly very interactive!!! It is definitely for adults and if you get offended easily then don't go. It is definitely a bargain and a great time. As far as the seating I would definitely do more towards the front. It is a better view and a lot more fun to see everything up close. Grab a drink and have a fun time!!!"
