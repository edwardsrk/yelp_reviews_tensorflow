b"I'd definitely return for the ice cream, food was not awesome...but what makes it great is the small arcade in the attached room.  Perfect for my 2 and 4 year old to play fun games and no worries of them escaping or being trampled by older kids like at Peter Piper Pizza.  We'll be back!  Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in old town with little kids!"
