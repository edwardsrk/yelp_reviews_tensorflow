b"We have tried the food from SuperFarm at several events...the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market and the Gilbert Food Court.  Last night we were in Gilbert and tried their Green Chili burger.  Wow...my favorite taste of the night!  The burger itself has such a savory succulent juiciness...and the green chili added a nice amount of heat.  Also have had their breakfast burrito which was yummy.  I like the service they provide also...letting you know about the ingredients they use, their farm you can visit, and bringing out the dish to you if you have to wait."
