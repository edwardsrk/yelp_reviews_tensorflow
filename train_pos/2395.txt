b"Duck poutine pizza. Of course, that is what everyone is talking about. I'm still thinking about it the next day. It's one of those dishes that is perfect for the great white north. The kind of food you need to fatten up before the great hibernation. If bears could, they would order the duck poutine pizza before they slept for the winter. And after a lunch of this pizza I needed a nap. It's definitely worth a trip to Bannock to eat this deliciousness especially if you need to bulk up for a long cold winter."
