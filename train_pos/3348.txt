b"I don't think there's ever a great time to take your car to get it fixed, but I will admit this was pleasantly seamless. I felt compelled to write a great review because looking at some of these posts I get the impression a few people may not have been to some of the other places in town. I'm a bit old fashioned when it comes to my vehicles and only use dealer parts. My service adviser Sean was helpful and explained the entire process thoroughly. Took a tad longer than I wanted to wait, but just as soon as I'm writing this my service adviser is bringing my keys."
