b"Came up to Cleveland with a good friend of mine and my girlfriend but didnt arrive until 1:30am and had no idea where to go to drink, most of the bars in the area were ID'ing at the door and were filled with people wall to wall which isn't what we're into at all, but we spotted this bar that wasn't overly occupied (visibly through the windows) so we stopped in. We ended up staying until it closed, they had decent prices for the city on shots and beers. They have a deal of 5 beers for $15. Apparently they have food as well but we weren't able to get any due to the kitchen already being closed. Met a few people who had been to our home town before which was cool. This is a nice chill bar with a calm atmosphere and nobody getting all rowdy, from this experience anyways."
