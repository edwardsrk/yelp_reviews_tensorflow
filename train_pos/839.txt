b"Great wings and awesome salad! LolWent here with a group of friends. I made the reservation on a Sunday and didn't really feel like I needed it as it wasn't too busy. Got sat down quickly and our friends slowly started arriving.The wings are a little bit more pricey than other wing nights elsewhere around the city but perhaps it's because of their selection and gluten free options! Either way I definitely think its worth it. The wings were a great size, not too small and not on steroids. They do have drummettes with the wings too so they are not ALL wings in case you were wondering.I ordered salad too with my order. Neat concept where you are able to pick whatever unlimited free toppings! This was awesome as I don't see too many places do this and the serving size was definitely for sharing! Some toppings are a buck or two. The dressings were great too! Overall, casual atmosphere. Seems like a great neighbourhood pub with more healthy options than other pubs. I like what they are doing here and will definitely come back...especially for Sunday wing night"
