b"Dr. Grade delivered both of my children via c-section.  The first one was an emergency c-section in the middle of the night and she arrived so quick! The second one was a planned c-section because I chose not to risk any complications.  We always enjoyed seeing Dr. Grade and trusted her decisions. Her nurse, Diselle, is a real sweetheart too. The only downfall was a long wait time for visits. We referred a few of our friends here, and they both complained about long wait times.  We usually scheduled our appointments first thing in the morning which helped getting us in and out quicker. If you can schedule ahead of time and get them as early as possible you are better off. I would still recommend Dr. Grade, and we're happy she was our doctor."
