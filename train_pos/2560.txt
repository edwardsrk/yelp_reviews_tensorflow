b"Really liking the vibe here.  I like how the bar and lobby start to blend with a full house.  It is definitely a cocktail joint and the beer on tap continues to grow.  Have been about twice a week since they opened.The food offers a wide variety to choose from and I like that many of the apps and entrees are created for a sharing environment. I've worked my way thru the menu pretty quickly.  Here's some suggestions:*Starters*Tater TotsDeviled EggsWarm Mixed NutsCitrus OlivesRoasted BeetsHeirloom Tomato Salad (Tasty, but 3 slices was not worth the price)*Main Dishes*Mac N CheesShort Ribs    (The gravy boat dish is cool, but the rib needs to be cut into smaller pieces)*Dessert*Cheese Cake with Tortilla Ice Cream   I'm not the biggest fan of dairy, but Tortilla Ice Cream is great!All in all, I'm happy with the cocktails and apps at any hour.  You do pay for the upscale environment to be downtown, but I feel it's worth the experience.  The elevated view out of the windows is a spectacular over the city.The biggest perk is you can head upstairs to Lustre's rooftop bar for a night cap.  You'll see a lot of the same staff working both bars.I recommend for anyone especially the Scottsdale crowd before catching a game"
