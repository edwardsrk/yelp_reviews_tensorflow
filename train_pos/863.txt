b"I've been a client now for five years since we moved into the area. They have a very friendly staff, a full range of services, and great selection of polish colors. They are pretty busy on the weekends so I recommend an appointment, but they also take walk-ins. I don't go to anyone in particular, just whomever is available when I stop by."
