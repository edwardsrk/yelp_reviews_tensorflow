b'I saw some of the reviews on here and I was expecting something terrible but it went great with the Keith Urban concert. The concessions are way overpriced but you go anywhere like this and the concessions will be through the roof. I give it a great rating as the parking was awesome, the sound was great and the traffic wasnt too bad. The only reason why it wasnt 5 stars was because the security was awful with letting the drunks really take over at some points in the midway'
