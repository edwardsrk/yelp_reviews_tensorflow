b"This is definitely one of our favorite places to grab a drink and enjoy the strip in a sunny location. We've been here on a nice, hot day and a nice, super windy day. View is great. There's lots of seating. However when it's windy, it's super windy up there. Loaded tots were delicious. Drink s\xc3\xa9lection is good. You have to ask for refills for soda but overall a good experience."
