b"Very typical Chipotle location. Good food, but my one concern is the employees. They always seem to be in a rush and don't seem too concerned work customer service. Not to mention, there's always so many of them standing on the line, which causes confusion and a backup in the line. Other than that, this location is fairly consistent with other Chipotles."
