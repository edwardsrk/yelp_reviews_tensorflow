b"Seafood. If your one of those guys, like me, who would rather have a buffet of some decent food over a barely half-filled plate of some fancy schmancy stuff, you may not want to go to a seafood joint that's landlocked. I mean, let's be honest, a seafood buffet is where it's at, and to find one it can be somewhat difficult in the Charlotte area. However, at Steve's, there are some damn filling portions of decent food if I must say so myself. Seems they pride themselves on their deep fried dishes, but that was expected. They also have healthier seafood options.Service was great. Waitress was very attentive to the needs of our table. Venue is fairly loud, d\xc3\xa9cor-wise, but adds to the feeling of being down at the beach. And what can be better than that?"
