b'This is really a hidden gem in Richmond Hill. My girlfriend and I were craving pasta tonight, so we resorted to Yelp and found this place in the nearby. We ordered the Penne Al Vodka and the Baked Lasagna take-out.When I got to the place, I was a little skeptical as there werent any customers. The place looked cozy and comfortable though! Got the food and brought it home. Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of "You can\'t judge a book by it\'s cover". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn\'t see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. I will say though, the online menu prices are outdated. The actual prices are a little more expensive (at least for the lasagna).Can\'t wait to try this place again.'
