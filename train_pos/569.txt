b'Great food at a reasonable price! Service was also great. Most meals come with hash browns or grits and pancakes or toast. I got something simple, but easy to mess up. 2 eggs over medium, hash browns, pancakes, and sausage links. Sausage links were juicy, flavorful, and fat. Hash browns were thinly sliced potatoes and were mostly crispy. You can pay extra to upgrade plain pancakes to one of the flavored ones.'
