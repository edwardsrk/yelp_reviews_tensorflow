b"H&M consistantly has clothes that I like, for reasonable prices.  It's usually one of the 1st places I'll hit when I'm out shopping.  This location is much bigger than the H&Ms I've been too... it even has baby clothes!  So what was wrong?  Well, I was shopping with a guy who's a size 'L' and they barely had his size in the style and color he wanted.  Most of the things he found he couldn't get or had to choose another color in because they were out of 'L'.   I haven't shopped this location for girls as I normally shop in Cali but, I hope this doesn't happen to me too if I go back!Might see ya there."
