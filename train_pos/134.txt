b'My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we had dinner here. We were expecting good food but after eating our meals this was my favorite meal in Vegas! The prime rib was cooked perfectly! The salmon was delicious! The service was absolutely great as well! We made reservations for the same day which was very accommodating. Our table was ready even when we got there 30 minutes early.'
