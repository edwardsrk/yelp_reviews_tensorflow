b"How is my review only the fourth? I came by happenstance, and am pleased I did. I told the hostess to bring whatever the cook wanted to put together, and the meal I had (spicy lamb) was great. A previous review hit it on the head: authentic. The food was flavorful and they use good cuts of meat. I had a huge dinner for under $12, and the lunch specials are even cheaper. If I was going to school in Charlotte I'd be eating here regularly. Very friendly and helpful staff, will return on my next trip."
