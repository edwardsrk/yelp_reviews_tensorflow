b'Trying to escape a snowstorm, I stumbled across this shop on my way home. In particular, I was drawn to their small, but highly curated and exceptional selection of VERY well made European shoes from Portugal, as well as their handcrafted and architectural jewelry made from leather. The owners provided exceptional customer service and for what I ended up coming away with (2 pairs of boots and a beautifully minimal statement necklace), the prices were more than reasonable.If you are someone who has a more progressive fashion sense and are looking to compliment that with tailored pieces and great quality leather...make this a stop on your way home.'
