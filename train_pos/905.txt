b"Frozen yogurt became a fad because it's healthy.  I'm just into it because it's just darn delicious.  During the summer I came to this Red Mango frequently because I worked at the same shopping center.  It was always clean and in tip top shape.  The workers there are also wonderful.  Never have I gone in and seen a sour face from an employee.  They're always polite and helpful.  I feel like they never judge me either when it I seem to have my cup half full of mochi and half full of frozen yogurt.  I will say it again, Red Mango is just so delicous!  They have a lot of toppings.  I like that I can balance the sugary sweets with some fruits too.  The only downside of Red Mango being small is that they do not have a very wide selection of flavors.  It's okay, I still love it there."
