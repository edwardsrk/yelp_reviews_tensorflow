b"Finally tried this bakery which has been on my list for quite some time during the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour.I'm giving it 4 vs. 5 stars because with all the hype and praise, I thought it would have more selections.  It's a rather small bakery with a small selection.  Mind you, what they do have and what I tried was very good; I was just expecting more.I had a chocolate \xc3\xa9clair and some almond concoction.  Both were excellent.Staff is friendly, helpful, and efficient so if there's a line; be patient.  It goes fast and is worth the wait."
