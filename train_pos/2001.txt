b"This is another standard DD so there's not much else that can be said but it's a personal favorite because it's located right in my office's business park so it gets an extra star for convenience.I must say that their drive-thru has been consistently efficient and the cashiers have been very friendly. For about a month or so, they were out of the Girl Scouts Coconut Caramel flavor which was a personal bummer but, I'm happy to say, it's back in stock.They are located right next door to the Jimmy John's and share parking spaces with them. They are easy to access right off the road via multiple entrances/exits.Our office is in the midst of a move so I will miss them when we're gone!"
