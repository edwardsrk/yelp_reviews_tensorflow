b'One of my favorite places in Cleveland and the prospect location is my favorite. Fast and friendly service, rather spacious and love the decor. The El Jefe is my favorite taco on the menu and they come up with some pretty kick ass specials each month. The chicken and waffle taco was divine and I loved the peach guac they had last month. Margaritas are great and they have a full bar as well. Overall, this is my go-to spot. Highly recommend!'
