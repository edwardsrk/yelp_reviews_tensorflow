b'We were one of the first into the restaurant, a large group of about 15 on a Friday night. Food was hot, delicious and constant and service was great! Favourites included: garlic sirloin, signature steak, cornbread and of course the pineapple! Several times during the meal they checked to see if there was anything we wanted more of.Live music was a nice treat.We were reminded two hours after arriving that it was time to leave due to the time limit.'
