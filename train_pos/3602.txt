b"I have known USA Collision for the past decade or so. They have always been consistent, and consistently excellent in their workmanship and long lasting results in quality.I would say body shop work is one of those things in life that last as long as you own your vehicle. To put it into perspective, from the time you get your car back after the repairs are done from an accident, and until you either sell or trade in your car, you'll know with certainty if the work was not done right.If the repairs were performed at USA Collision, I know with certainty that I will never know from looking at the vehicle, that, it was in a collision.Well done, guys!"
