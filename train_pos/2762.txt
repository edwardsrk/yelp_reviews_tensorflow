b"I can't sing higher praises of these guys.  My 30k mile Versa had developed an idling problem.  I took my car in for routine maintenance and asked if they would have a look at the problem.  They performed the routine maintenance I requested and although I was a little bit taken aback by the price for the inspection ($100-$200 based on what they had to do) I have trusted them for quality service on other vehicles.  They did a diagnostic and the problem was a misfire on cylinder 2.  They went out of their way to call my dealership to see if the problem was covered under warranty, which it was.  As it turned out Nissan had to replace my engine.  This mechanic could have chased the problem from sensor to sensor and fuel filter and ignition etc etc but they didn't, they found the correct path for me to save money and get my car running perfect again.  After that Matt who is the friendliest and most helpful person you will EVER meet at a mechanic offered to take my car to the dealership and pick it up for me, free of charge.  He even knocked off most of the inspection charge because they quickly realized they wouldn't be doing the work to repair it.  There are cheaper mechanics out there but the quality of service here not only made my experience much better but ended up saving me potentially thousands of dollars worth of repairs that were ultimately covered under my warranty.Although there is a small premium to get work done here (there are shady mechanics that will do jobs for less) the customer service by itself, let alone the quality of work, honesty and integrity of the staff are well worth the marginal pricing differences.  Keep up the good work!  Always glad to support local businesses!"
