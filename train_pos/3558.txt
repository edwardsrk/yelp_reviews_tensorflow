b"There is a good reason this shop has 5 star ratings.  This is my second time using them I am very pleased with the work they performed.  As the case from my previous visit, my car was properly diagnosed and I was promptly called with details on the repairs.  I have owned this particular Mercedes for 10 years and do most of the work myself.  I knew what the issue was with my car before I took it to them, so I can with confidence say that they are honest with the repairs they recommend, and they are done properly.If you have never seen this shop before, it is clean and orderly.  The last time I visited,  the bays where filled and they where working on some old SL's which was nice to see.  Instead of going to the dealer come here and like myself you will end up being a repeat customer."
