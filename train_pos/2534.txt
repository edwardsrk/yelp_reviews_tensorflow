b"The soup's on! The lentil soup at this place is killer. It has this tang to it that I love. I once tried to cajole the server into telling me what they put in it, and he said he would ask the chef, but he flaked on me. Anyway, I eventually de-constructed it. All the food I've tried here is high quality. Tandoori was nice as well as the curry dishes. Staff is generally quite cordial and friendly and its never hard to get a table."
