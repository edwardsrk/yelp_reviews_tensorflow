b"My husband has been suffering from GI problems the last couple months. His Doctor referred him to see Dr. Chen. Booking an appointment was a breeze plus super nice staff. No attitude, no rudeness! :) The wait prior to the appointment was short. The website has all the forms you need which in convenient. He'll be have a procedure soon so I completed his pre-op paperwork using the website. The website was easy to navigate. Will update post after procedure!"
