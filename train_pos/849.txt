b'This place gets packed.  The food was decent. Better than what I though.  The service was efficient. 10 bucks for a liter of beer is a bit pricey. Share one that way it does not get warm.The sour kraut balls were amazing. Pot roast was nice, walley had a bit to much breading. And the wiener schnitzel was good.  Most people could get away with sharing a meal.'
