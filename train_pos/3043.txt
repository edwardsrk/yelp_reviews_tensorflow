b"We love Cafe Americano! We've been a couple times for lunch and have had Eric S. both times as our waiter. He was unbelievably attentive, kind, and efficient! The food both times was amazing. As with anything down at the Strip, the food can seem pricey, but the quality and the amount of food you get is worth every penny! My favorite thing is the Short Rib Nachos. Also love the atmosphere. Highly recommend for anyone that has a stomach and is in Las Vegas ;)"
