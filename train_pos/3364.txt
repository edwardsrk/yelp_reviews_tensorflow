b"Love!! The yogurt is so so yummy and the employees are friendly and fun. I'm an addict. My only, albeit small, complaint is that the employees are a tad too quick to dust-buster up any toppings that spill from the bowls...kinda makes you feel bad for using them. But not that bad. Oh, and more outside seating please! All in all, divine!"
