b'Kid friendly environment, noisy atmosphere & great service. Love that the salsa was fresh chunks of tomatoes & corn. The chips were a bit hard & thick. Avocado pasta salad was delicious- definitely order it again.  Tofu tacos were perfect. My 5yr old liked her shrimp kids meal. Beer batter white fish was heaven for your mouth....moist fish with oh so good batter. Plenty of seats inside or outdoor patio.'
