b'food was good, but menu is really small, normal prices (for vegas). if you cant get a table sit at the bar they have a full menu.portion size is small so sample the items and reorder what you like! the quesadilla was pretty good, taco were kinda wack.also really close to pure so good for a pre party snack'
