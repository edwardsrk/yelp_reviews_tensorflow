b"When you want sushi in the area, Lan Sushi is currently your only option, but thankfully they do everything just right.I have many friends who go to Lan Sushi so frequently (because they like it so much) that the hostess knows them all by name. I find the owner (or head chef, I'm not sure) always has a friendly smile going on when I go in, which feels especially warm when he walks out to give you a complementary hand roll while you wait for your meal to go.The sushi's good quality, but smaller than what I'm used to. For a meal I'll always order two dishes from Lan, which usually does the trick.tI don't recommend eating in the restaurant. You can, and I have, but it's pretty pointless. It's a takeout shop and the atmosphere doesn't really help you enjoy your food or your company (people are always coming in and out of the store right beside you and are all just ordering or standing around and waiting for their food. So just take it to go and enjoy it at home."
