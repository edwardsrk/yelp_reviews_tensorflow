b'This is the date night location of choice when my friend Marie comes downtown. We like to sit at the bar, order a drink and catch up. The service is always great and the bartenders are friendly and informative. We usually grab an app and split then go straight for the carbs. The pasta dishes are great. We mix it up every time and are never disappointed. Date recommendation: grab a table, a drink, the cheese board and then your pasta or entree of choice. Enjoy!'
