b"I have nothing but great things to say about Brew Tea Bar. Hands down one of the BEST Boba places in Vegas. I've been here so many times that they know me by name. I've tried their milk teas, slushes, hot tea, & crepes. You can't go wrong with getting anything from here. I will say that the salted foam that they put in some of their drinks is an acquired taste that I have not yet acquired. But, that's just me though. They have a stamp card too so you can get a free drink after you buy 10. I easily went through 2 or 3 of those cards. :)"
