b"This is probably the best Moe's in the area which explains why it's always busy and other ones are always empty.  The people are friendly here, they don't skimp on the burritos, and they have the freestyle Coke machine.  Their sanitation scores are typically far and above other Moe's in the area too.  It's not gourmet or authentic Mexican, but for $5 on Monday for a huge burrito, chips, and a drink, you can't go wrong."
