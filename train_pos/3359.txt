b"Tried this place on our way back from the CAK airport. Craving Mexican and yelp had pretty good reviews, so why not? Obviously love the chips and salsa after being seated! I ordered the carnitas tacos with salsa and onions and cilantro. The tacos are doubled wrapped and stuffed with meat! I turned one taco into two and couldn't even start on the second two. My mom ordered the same thing and was able to finish two. I took home three of the tacos and had lunch for 3 days! Also enjoyed the fried beans! My dad ordered one of the soups and really enjoyed it. My husband loved his dish with rice, cheese, and chicken - he's a little more basic with his Mexican food."
