b"We recently took our almost 2 year old daughter there and she enjoyed it a lot.  It was a really cool place and the price was definitely worth it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the younger kids area is small, which is normal, but they allow up to 6 year olds.  A small kids area should go to about 3.  The difference in coordination and development is huge in those ages and the 4-6 year old were running around dominating the area when there is plenty of other places that they could be playing."
