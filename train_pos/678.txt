b"We always stay at The Orleans when we go to Vegas with our kids. We rely on the Cafe quite often after being out and about all day...and into the night, sometimes. We didn't know that the Cafe had been renovated since our last visit so we were a little nervous. Well, no need to be nervous...they had a better choice of menu items and the service was just as good as it always was. Eileen was exceptionally good. She was funny and friendly and the service was great."
