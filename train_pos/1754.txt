b"This place used to be amazing. I came about once a week for nearly 6 months. Always the freshest ingredients and unique sub choices.  The past 3 times I have came its not as good.  Don't know if the management or employees have changed but its just not up to par. The sandwiches are sloppily made. All 3 times I got brown avocado instead of green. Also they were out of banana peppers or jalapenos everytime. For me this is key to a good sub.  Still a 4 star joint cause of the uniqueness and its gotta just be a matter of time till they get it together again. I say give it a shot if you are in for a casual lunch with unique selection of subs.****UPDATE**** The owner contacted me directly. Apologized for the poor experience. Then invited me to come back for another meal. All the problems had been remedied and the food was better than ever. Glad they keep on top of everything. Great food, Great Owners."
