b'So I was in dire need of assistance in moving and attempted to call the other "highly rated" movers only to be greeted by down right rude people. I\'m sorry you\'re all booked but how the heck am I suppose to know that?! Any who i then found five star moving and I\'m so blessed I did! From beginning to end these guys were on point. They were so professional and friendly it made the nightmare of moving a breeze. Love that they pick up the uhaul for you, all you have to do is be packed and ready to go. My upstairs  one bedroom was packed, moved in AND assembled in my new apartment in 2.5 hours! Everything was handled like it was their own and safely delivered! These guys busted their butt me in the heat, I kinda felt bad so I turned on the AC for them lol. If and when I move again, I\'m def choosing this company again!!'
