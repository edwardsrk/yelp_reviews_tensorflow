b"I was introduced to Panera when I first moved to Missouri in 2001. It was a standard out there for office party treats or a mall lunch. When I moved back West, it was nice to see it again.When my daughter went to high school, I used to call in and have her Friday lunch treat ready for me to pick up. It was nice that they had lunch items ready to pick up before 11:00 AM. If we have houseguests, I usually pick up an assortment of bagels and pastries then replate them, which always goes well and you don't have to cook in the morning;).The pastries and bagels are good, especially the scones and is well complimented with a plain cup of coffee. One household and office fave were the French toast bagels, as they were the first to go. I'm not too fond of their specialty coffees that are sweet. In my opinion, they are a bit too sweet. The location is off of Eastern and there is ample parking. You can always call in your order if you are doing take away. It's very convenient.ALSO, take advantage of their Panera card. You do get free items like a pastry or bagel. With the card, you also get a free birthday pasty which I took advantage of today."
