b"Great shop. This is more of your traditional Vegas style antique store. But you will also find some non Vegas things too. The owner is very nice and even offered to deliver our purchase for free. If you buy more than one item he is very willing to work on the price with you. We walked out with three items and are very happy!Follow them on Facebook to see what new stuff they got, but I have noticed some of the items already in the shop and then I will see it on FB a few days later, so it's not posted the same day they get it in.Sometimes they close up early though, so call first or don't be mad if they're not there.We'll definitely be back!"
