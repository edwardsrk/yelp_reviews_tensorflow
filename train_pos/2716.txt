b"Updating my review since I've tried more items on their menu. The Big Buford is still my favorite, but it's inconsistent but always enjoyable regardless. Tonight I ordered 1 checker burger which was decent and a chili cheese dog that I enjoyed add well be ordering again. I also decided to try their chicken sandwich and it was good! The total came out to $6.02 with an apple pie thrown in, I thought that the price was really really really good for the amount of enjoyable food and great customer service I received."
