b'The BF and I rode our bikes here today and we were thoroughly impressed. This place is close to my apartment and fairly convenient. The inside is cute, pretty modern looking. The girl who was working there was friendly and explained all of the drinks to us without making us feel like we were putting her out. I was just going to get toddy, but ended up getting a specialty drink. I got the almond joy (coconut mocha) and the BF got the Charlie Chaplin (white and dark chocolate mocha) both with nonfat milk to make them healthy (lol!). We both thoroughly enjoyed our coffees. Mine still had a strong coffee flavor and was not overwhelmed by the sweetness of the other flavors, it was soooo delicious...still thinking about it now.... I can only imagine how good it would be with whole milk. Anyway, this place has serious 5 star potential, but I need to make a second visit to determine that. Hooray GreaterThan Coffee!'
