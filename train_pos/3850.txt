b'Jim showed up with a huge smile and a "sorry for intruding" attitude when he came by to move the 1912 Lyon & Healy piano I restored. Shared custody means it bounces back and forth from house to house... long story. Jim has a great spirit and makes you feel like everything is going to work out fine.  I\'ve never worry about the condition of the piano, I know he\'ll take great care of this antique.  Plus, I rebuilt it, I know how bullet-proof furniture made from that era is.Now if I could protect my emotions so securely with the loss...Thanks Max Piano moving'
