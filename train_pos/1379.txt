b'I came for the Sunday brunch prix fixe menu - you get one appetizer and entree with a classy cocktail. I made reservations online a few weeks in advance, and the restaurant, even with decent indoor and large outdoor (with heat lamp) seating, became pretty packed. For the appetizer, I was able to try the Granola, Fruit and Yogurt, the Tomato & Basil Bisque, and the Mushroom and Celery Root Puree, and all were equally delicious. The mushroom and celery root puree I was a little wary of, but it was delicious. For the entree, I tried Steak and Egg, Sea Scallop Fry, and the Braised Lamb & Eggs. The portions were substantial and the flavors were all there. The runny yolk with the steak and lamb were glorious. They also have other standard brunch entrees, such as a benedict and waffles, but I felt like this was something you can get anywhere.Overall, really satisfied with the brunch we had. The outdoor seating was beautiful, and the heat lamps kept us pretty warm in the winter.'
