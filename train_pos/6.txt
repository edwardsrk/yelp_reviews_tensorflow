b'In the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day. It\'s quite hard to see, if you don\'t know it\'s there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it\'s an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn\'t until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.Here\'s the pizza we ordered:Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it\'s heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more "special" toppings instead.Shall return, and/or try other locations.'
