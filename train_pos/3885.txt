b'Cambodian cuisine is definitely not one of those common cuisine you would pick when someone ask, "What you wanna eat?" (Don\'t say I don\'t know....!)  However, now you can say how about Cambodian?  Yes, the one and only one Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix is here!  We had a group gathering here for dinner (NAAAP) and the food was delicious!  I can\'t say the actual name, but I\'ll use my best Engrish - Beef & Shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango.  Okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine, but no dude....it was awesome.  Found out Cambodian cuisine is not spicy like I thought it would be.  Our service was great, this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - Kudos!  Ambience was really homey - I gather if I lived in a Cambodian household that is....  The decors were originally from Cambodia purchased by the owner (Yut).  I didn\'t want to touch anything; felt like I was in a museum.Towards the end of the night I start to make dessert - yes "Me" was cooking!  They showed us how and what ingredients.  Needless, to say I didn\'t perfect the art, but it still passed and was yummy!  Take that Chef Ramsey! - Enjoy!'
