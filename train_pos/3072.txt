b"I normally don't bother with dealing health stores but I have wanted to try out a hydrogen peroxide therapy to help detox the body and I didn't want to wait 5 days for shipping from amazon and this place popped up.It was relatively close to where I was and whole foods doesn't carry the 35% h2o2 so I stopped by here. Even though the parking was horrible, the store was pretty open and I was greeted by the owner (or I think it was the owner) and he was very friendly.I asked for my 35% food grade peroxide and he had some, and it was way cheaper than paying for it on amazon.5 stars for being clutch, and for having cheap prices. This is a mom and pop store, check them out if you are in the area."
