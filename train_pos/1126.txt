b'I went here with my best friend for dinner after work. The lady who took our orders was very informative and friendly. I ordered the "Gangnam Style" burger and it came with a side of fries. Burger was juicy and the flavors were on point, but kinda small and needed more veggies or toppings. The fries was perfectly seasoned and crispy. They also sell local beer there which was an extra plus. Kind of on the expensive side for a burger and Noda beer it costed me almost $18 bucks.'
