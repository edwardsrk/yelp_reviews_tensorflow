b"This place is super nice and has a really cool trendy ambience, which is something you don't see often with Mexican restaurants. Came here with a big group friends and they were playing pretty loud Latin top 40 which was really fun for us but would maybe not be a great place for a date nightThe food and drinks were a bit pricey but the flavours were definitely there and from my little knowledge of Mexican cuisine it did seem pretty authentic! I got the stuffed pepper which was around 20$ I think but it was delicious and I would totally recommend it! All in all a really cool and authentic place that I would recommend"
