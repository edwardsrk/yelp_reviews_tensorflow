b'I have to add an extra star. It would be pretty silly for me to keep returning over and over to what I referred to as "mediocre staples". I am comfortable with it, though. I have since tweaked what I order to come with white rice which is rather good and now that they give you a fortune cookie with the check instead of the almond cookie, I am now walking away much happier. I can finally recommend this great little restaurant.'
