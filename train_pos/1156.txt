b'A co-worker had Recommended Nick\'s to me.  So about a week before the flood, I found myself in Calgary and decided to check out Nicks.The restaurant itself is large inside.  We chose to be seated in the bar section so we could watch the hockey game.  No problems there.We both ordered pizza.  I had the "Nick" special - ordering the smallest of the three sizes (10 inches).  When it arrived it had about 6 full sized slices.  The crust was decent - much better than chain pizza crust.  There were a lot of tasty toppings, and I was full on about 4 slices.  My pedometer said I was at 12,000 steps for the day with about another 3,000 to get back to the hotel so I downed the next two slices.  We also ordered ice cream for dessert.  Its not on the menu as an option but our waitress was more than willing to make it available.Overall, I would definitely repeat my next time in Calgary.'
