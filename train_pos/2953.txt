b"This is a cute place in the downtown area of Champaign. It is always busy on the weekends and the service is good. My only issue was that the menu was kind of all over the place. There was traditional bar food mixed in with Thai as well as pasta dishes. Just didn't seem coherent to me I guess. Overall, it was a good experience."
