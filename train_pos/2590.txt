b"El Diablo dish for brunch is amaaazing. Great atmosphere! Try the pims carafe.  The only negative content I have is,  that if you go by yourself they won't seat you. .. They'll tell you to go to the bar even if there's no spots open.I found that to be a bit weird, but it was busy, so maybe that was the reason."
