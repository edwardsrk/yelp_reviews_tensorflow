b"Went here for a date night - had heard of this place but didn't know where it was located and was pleasantly surprised to find it in the Southside off the beaten path. I'm not much an italian-food lover but this place has changed my mind. I ordered the duck - and it was absolutely amazing! Our waiter was fantastic - helped guide us to some of his favorites while explaining some wine pairings. The ambiance was warm, inviting, and still intimate. I will definitely be back here."
