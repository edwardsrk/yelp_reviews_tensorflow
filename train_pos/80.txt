b"On a recent trip to Westgate our friendly tour guide suggested we get pedis here.  This place did not disappoint, taking all 3 of us on the spot and plunking us down in their luxurious (aaahhh ) massage chairs and getting our feet soaking right away.It had been about 6 weeks since my last pedi and I was due.  In my opinion, this place was superior to the Aveda spa I had last visited. True confession, I had a little fall in Old Scottsdale the day before on unsteady footwear so my foot was twisted and painful.  The lady worked my feet perfectly, although a bit painfully.  But good.  I walk a ton and have calluses on the pads of my feet that really needed attention.  My feet are in much better shape now - pretty!A bonus for us was the owner, who was a big football fan and confessed he'd bet on the Vikings to win the Super Bowl.  Then we talked Packers - the local team that has our hearts!The best was the price.  The pedicures started for a mere $32.  I paid $40.  One of my friends got paraffin and paid more.  Well worth it for this luxury!Thanks again for the great treatment!"
