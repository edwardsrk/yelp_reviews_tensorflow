b"Target is my go to for toiletries, cleaning supplies, and candy runs before the movie. This particular Target is a nice stop on my lunch break. The ladies room is always clean and the scent in there reminds me of Fruity Pebbles, odd I know. Every now and again, I see decent deals on athletic wear and cosmetics.  You get 5 cents off for each reusable bag you use.  Shelves are generally well stocked. The store as a whole is pretty clean although some areas appear cluttered.  There's a Starbucks and Pizza Hut at this location.   I've had positive experience with customer service.  One time, I was here to purchase items from a registry, but their kiosk was down.  One of the associates took her time to show me how to pull up the registry on my phone.  Granted, the WiFi was poor that day, but the gesture was greatly appreciated. There is plenty of parking here and the lines move quickly."
