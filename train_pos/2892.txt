b"One of my favorite places for tacos and margaritas. They seat you fast and it's great for a group. A lot of their food is on the sweet side which isn't my favorite but get the shrimp and ahi tuna tacos. THEY. ARE. SO. GOOD. Also 2 tacos is plenty, I usually can't finish the second one. The pomegranate marg and the one with blood orange  so yummy. Loving coming to this place"
