b"Okay, I've read all the reviews.  I know the Scottsdale Nordstrom well.  If you are going to buy a bra anywhere, please do yourself a favor and get one of their professional bra fitters to measure you, They put you in a bra that will actually fit you.  You will never buy another bra again without consulting a professional fitter.  For the shoes, Try to find to better shoe selection any were in the Phx, Scottsdale area. In 20years I have never had a bad experience with rude sales people in the shoe department.  When it comes to makeup, try MAC, you will LOVE the lipstick.  The only guy to trust is the lovely and very sweet Mike!  Mike will start you off with great lips, and within weeks, without any pressure, you will be transformed into a more beautiful you, all with the sweet, loving and attentive Mike.  No pressure from Mike.  You have to tell him what YOU want!  He is just that great!  When it comes to the clothing departments, I will admit that  I too am a little disappointed.  The array of clothing choices that should be available just aren't.  Sort of same old same same old from one department to the next.  I would like to see Nordstrom think outside the box a little more.  For shoes, Bra's and MAC make-up with Mike ONLY give it a go!"
