b'Loved going here for happy hour. They had the BEST cucumber salad, I could eat ten bowls a day. Went there once a few weeks ago craving some sushi and salad, parked, walked up to the door, only to find that they had CLOSED. Went next door to Humble Pie and the guy at the front said they shut down January 1st. My heart sank. This is the second Sushi joint that has closed in the past few months. Ten on Tatum was equally amazing and had great food. Sad day when great sushi bars close because the chains get more business, even if their overpriced food sucks.'
