b'I had wanted to try this tailor for some time and recently walked in with expensive jeans I needed hemmed.  I had read somewhere that the original hem could (or should) be retained so as not to spoil the "look".  When I mentioned this to the proprietor, he told me they could absolutely do this, but assured me they could reproduce the original hem for substantially less money.  They were able to do the work immediately, and the results were great.  The length was perfect and the new hem indistinguishable from the original.  While I was waiting the five minutes for the job to be completed, another customer dropped in and had major alterations performed on a new suit - the results were impressive.  The location is spacious and there is comfortable seating.  The price for my alteration was less than any other place I\'ve frequented.   On an earlier occasion, a friend and I took a well-worn leather jacket in for a repair estimate.  The tailor, who is obviously extremely talented, polite and personable, was honest about what could be accomplished and what the repairs would cost.  While we didn\'t use their services then (we threw the jacket out), I really appreciate a business that values honesty over a cash grab.  These guys are great.'
