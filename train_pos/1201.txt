b"12/3/16- we went to return sheets that had a tear in them and while we were very upset with the wait for Brandy (the only manager on duty in textiles it seemed) we are extremely pleased with how she handled our issue and our temper (it was a very long day). The holidays aren't easy on anyone in retail and she took everything in stride. She was clearly the only one responding to the numerous calls of help coming in but stopped to remedy our situation. Thank you"
