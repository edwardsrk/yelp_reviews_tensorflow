b"If you want breakfast food, go to Eggyday Noodles.To dine by the river, I recommend Estuary Noodles. And if you wanna see a stage production about how the nation is being lied to and manipulated, try Edgyplay Noodles. If you want a place to pull your Greyhound Bus into at the terminal, try Emptybay Noodles. And if you are feeling horny, try Entryway Noodles. But this is none of these.What to get: Mango Milk Tea w/ Pudding and Lychee Jelly.What not to get: A drink much better than your friend's because it might make them jelly.What else: Where did that cute Mango?How to improve: Offer small sizes in bubble teas, and make them a slightly better product.Erryday Noodles is not the kind of place I'd come erryday, especially not for Bubble Tea because, well, I don't want my stomach to be the size of Pittsburgh. I have yet to try their food but one of these days, I shall.At first I was going to give them 5 stars for bubble tea, but over the year or two since I first tried it, I've had a thousand bubble teas and my taste has become somewhat more refined. All I can say now is that it's good, but not amazing. I'd put several (including Love Yogurt, I-Tea and Sumi's) significantly ahead of it in the Burgh Bubble Battles.Speaking of Bubbles, the tapioca itself in here is a bit rubber and tasteless even though the drinks are pretty good. Milk tea is average but some of the other products taste better, such as Mango Milk with Pudding and Lychee Jelly. I do like the prices, which are larger than anywhere in the area, and for less money. I also love the service at EN, which is always friendly, prompt, and courteous. And if you just came here for a cup of tea, don't bother. You should have gone to Earlgrey Noodles."
