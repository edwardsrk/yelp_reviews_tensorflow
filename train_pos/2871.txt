b"I've only been here during their late evening happy hour from 10-2 AM but this is a great spot for some food and drinks. Usually I order their flatbread pizzas or quesadillas which are both pretty good in my opinion, though the flatbread pizzas seem to be better. They have a great drinks selection of course and is a great spot for happy hour due to the atmosphere. It's nice to be able to hang out and relax here.Outside of happy hour this review might be different, but from simply reviewing their happy hour I can say that I'm a fan."
