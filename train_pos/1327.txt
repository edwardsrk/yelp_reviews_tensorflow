b"This park is located on the West side of town which is out of my way. Nevertheless, I make the drive a few times a week or at least on weekends.As many others have noted, this park is HUGE. It has a walking/running track, tennis courts, a basketball court, and a long grass field which can used as a soccer, baseball and a football field.It's nice watching kids play, couples jogging and dog owners walking their dogs. Hearing laughter and playful sounds from people at the park is always welcome.Personally, one of the main reasons I come to this park is the views it offers from the top overlooking the field below. It also gives you a great view of the sunset as the sun settles down behind the mountain.Another reason why I frequent this park, it's because I write songs as a hobby and this setting helps me relax and rest while thinking of lyrics to write.Anyways, there is plenty of parking on the north and south side which both lots can be access through Decatur and Tropicana.It's quite pleasant and shall continue my visits to this scenic place. So for those of you who enjoy going to parks but haven't made it to this one, check it out. Charlie Frias Park might become one of your favorites."
