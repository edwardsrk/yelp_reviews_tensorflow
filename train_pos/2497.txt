b'I got my order to go. My veggie pie was ready when I arrived. The price was very reasonable. The place was clean, had a fresh and trendy appearance, and outside seating if desired.I came here because they have a vegan pizza that is made with hummus instead of fake cheese! I thought this was so awesome, but you can see from the picture that the hummus is just mainly piled on top in the middle instead of spread uniformly over the pizza as a base. So basically you eat the pizza with veggies on it, and then take a spoon to the center to get the hummus. All of the ingredients tasted good despite the awkward assembly. Service was bland... Not rude...But never smiled. Regardless, I give this place a thumbs up because it offers real vegan pizza!'
