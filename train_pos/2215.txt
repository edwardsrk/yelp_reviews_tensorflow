b"I came here with some friends for wing night and was not disappointed!The atmosphere is friendly, the service was fantastic and the wings were good. They also had some good beers available (Beau's is one of my new favourites). I asked for the spiciest wings, of course, and they were pretty spicy, but nothing crazy. They also had dry wings, which I was kind of regretful for not getting. The fries are great! They're sort of bistro style with the skin on. One of my dining companions is allergic to dairy, wheat and eggs and was super happy to be able to find a wing place that does them without breading.Monday is wing night, where wings are 50% off. They have food specials every night of the week.They also have a bunch of screens for you to watch sports if that's your thing, and also a few banquets so it's easy to talk to your friends, if that's your thing. I'd be back again if I were in the area."
