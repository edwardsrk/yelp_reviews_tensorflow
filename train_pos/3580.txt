b'Got my haircut today by Crystal and I love it! I booked an appointment last night around 5pm through Yelp so i wasn\'t sure exactly what I would be getting. I asked her to give my fine limp hair some body and fix up my bangs. She did exactly what I hoped and my hair feels so much healthier! Crystal was so pleasant and spoke to me without any of the pretense that can accompany conversations with some beauty professionals. One of the owners came over and spoke with me for a bit and he was so kind as well. These interactions were super appreciated in what is probably one of my last "lady" days before having my first baby. I will gladly be back and already recommended Crystal to my bff!'
