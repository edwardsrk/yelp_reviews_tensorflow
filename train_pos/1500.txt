b"I got a chance to enjoy my second visit in 2 years to Planet Dailies. This venue touts the largest menu in Vegas and provides a fun, casual environment to dine in. I had the chicken avocado sandwich which was yummy. Our waiter was really nice and chatty. He made sure we had everything we needed and answered questions about the voluminous options. It's kind of like the Cheescake Factory where you can basically get anything you want. This is an economical and convenient option for eating on a budget. One quick note, we bought vouchers for $3 for 50% off the total bill at the same day ticket kiosk. Enjoy!"
