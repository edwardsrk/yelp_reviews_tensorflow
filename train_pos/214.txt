b"I get why it's highly rated.  I too recommend it.  The Thai is good (its at the same level of decent nyc Thai) and the seafood soup as well.   Service was very good, tho my pad Thai and soup came out at the same time (but that's not the reason for four stars - I sparingly give five stars).  Overall, good experience and I'll come back."
