b"This place is truly some of the best fusion of American and Vietnamese fusion food I've ever had. Located about fifteen minutes from the vegas strip, district one is superb at bringing intense flavors to each customers dish.Some of the dishes they are known for are the oxtail fried rice, the oxtail pho, the Mekong soup ( I believe it's made with beef, shrimp, fish balls, and pork. Also there known for the Grilled squid and the fish tacos. So when my wife and I took out friend there we offered half the menu, Lol...with no regrets. We had to eat the oxtail fried rice, pork buns, grilled squid and a few other entrees. The oxtail fried rice was a bit salty but very unique in texture and taste. We enjoyed it and would definite try it again. The grilled squid had ok it had a few to much of a burnt taste to it and I couldn't enjoy it like I thought I could. The fish tacos we ordered didn't come with soft tacos like I was hoping they would. They were very small in size and reminded me of fried wontons. Although the fish was very small the fresh vegetables on it had great flavor and was refreshing for my tastebuds. All in all we were satisfied with our good and the staff is very nice and attentive here. They provided excellent customer service and had no problem helping us with our orders and offer us their sound advice about dishes.Overall we had about six dishes and our bill was about seventy dollars and that's before the tip. The serving sizes are decent and filling. Another great aspect about this location is that there open from 11am- 3pm everyday. That's definitely great when you wanna late night meal and don't wanna deal with the crowds."
