b"While enjoying a nice run along both sides of the river, I passed through this park.  It's definitely a nice place for a run (not hemmed in by prisons and highways like the path on the other side).The paths are wide and there are benches and sculptures to sit on and see, respectively.  During my afternoon run I saw a lot of people walking their dogs and enjoying the views of the river.  It looks like they are still doing some work on it and some parts of the path were not as even as I would like, but they really did a nice job here."
