b'Came here to sample some of their new additions to the dim sum menu.  Really enjoyed it and will be back again.  Food: We ordered the "Big Red Po" tea which is not usually offered at other dim sum places which was nice.  I like this tea flavor a lot.  The dim sum menu selection is average but the quality is nice.  Dishes were unique and the taste was wonderful.  See pic for some of the unique items that I enjoyed.  For savory dishes, I especially enjoyed their seafood pancake and sticky rice. For the sweet dishes, the dumpling was very unique sitting in a tart with a pineapple bun on the top.  The pink leaf wrapped dessert tasted as great as it looks.  The Napoleon cake was huge.  It looked nice but I wouldn\'t order it again.   Service: We were a large group so we sat inside the rooms.  It was nicely decorated and lots of places to hang up our jackets and comfortable seating.  However, most of the servers spoke mandarin and would refer us to 1 server who understood us (even though we spoke Cantonese and English).'
