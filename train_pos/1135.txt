b"I went here on the second weekend it was open. I was just there for drinks, but I didn't notice any growing pains. The atmosphere here is amazing!! The inside is decorated so well and it has a beautiful outside area. They have a good selection of unique beers, but prices are slightly above the average beer in the area. I'm excited to taste some of their own beers once they are released."
