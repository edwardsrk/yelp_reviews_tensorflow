b'One of the few true Cowboy bars left in Arizona, and this place is a run down and rusty house of fun.  The food is good, especially the Friday night fish fry, and the beer and food is inexpensive and well made.  A Green Bay Packer bar, the place hops on Sundays.  Go there, dress casually and have a nice time.'
