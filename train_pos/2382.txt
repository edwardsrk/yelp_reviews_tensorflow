b"I went for the fish, but I'll definitely be coming back for the barbeque.  The cashier was very friendly, and the prices are just right.  I had the 2 piece cod basket which came with a generous side of my choice ( I had potato salad) and 2 hush puppies.  The pieces of fish were huge and too hot to handle right away, which gave me plenty of time to enjoy the potato salad.  The potato salad was average, but the fish was superb.  The only downside is the location.  It is on the NE corner of Jefferson and 24th Street.  With the light rail, you have to make sure you are on the left side of the light rail or you will end up taking a detour.  There is also a large homeless population in the area.  Otherwise, I really hope this place survives so I can go back for more."
