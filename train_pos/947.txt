b"I've been here on numerous occasions and love the work that these nail techs do! I often go to Lili for shellac manis. She does an amazing job with nail shape and my shellac polish lasts up to 3 weeks without any chipping or peeling ... which is a rarity for me. Recently I got a pedicure and gel nail extensions by Coco, as I was going on vacation and my nails were really REALLY short. The extensions lasted two weeks, with only one nail coming off by 2.5weeks. However, as I was on vacation I was using my hands a lot and am generally not very gentle with my hands. So 2.5 weeks with no complaints is good enough for me! Overall I love the staff and love this salon. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because their prices are slightly more than other nail salons in the area. But considering the quality of service and work that I receive when I come here, I'm completely okay with paying a bit more."
