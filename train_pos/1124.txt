b"One of the best authentic vietnamese joints in town. Wish they had something like this in the East end where I live.All food options (pho, com, bun) are excellent and flavourful and fast. Two people can get stuffed for under 20 bucks.If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you'll be a happy camper.Rule of thumb when it comes to viet food: good if owner is viet, mediocre if owner is chinese-viet, and run away if owner is hongkongnese.And stay well west of yonge."
