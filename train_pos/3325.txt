b"Culligan Total Water Treatment Systems is really a great company to work with and I love their service! We have one of their products at work (a counter-top, plumbed water cooler) that was having some issues. I called in and spoke to the nicest gentleman who was able to get me through to who I needed to talk to, and then Reed was able to get a tech out the very same day. That's almost unheard of! The tech who showed up was very friendly and knowledgeable and was able to get our older machine swapped out quickly. I was very impressed at how efficient he was. The service is great. The product is great. And the price is great! No complaints. Definitely recommend!"
