b'Good SE Asian cuisine, and a great spot for lunch in the second half of the week. Kind of picky about split checks. Similar to Ha Long Bay down the street, but the I prefer the appetizer selection here. Egg rolls are a winner. Reasonable lunch specials, but sometimes I wish the portions were larger. Overall good value though.'
