b'Came here because I wasnt feeling well. The admin was sympathetic and waited to charge my co pay until after I had seen the doctor. I was seen within 10 minutes by the nurse. About another 10 minutes or so later I was seen by the Doctor. What a lovely, caring woman. She was honest and stated what she assumed the issue was but said because they didnt have the proper equipment (Cat-Scan) to check me and know for sure that I should go the ER. She waived my co-pay and I took her advise and went straight to Summerlin hospital. Thank you for your honesty, attentiveness and kindness. You are appreciated.'
