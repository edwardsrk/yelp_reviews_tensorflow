b"I found this place by accident while trying to find a different Thai restaurant, but I'm sure glad I wound up here. I stopped in for a lunch special which came with soup, rice, small fried spring roll, and entree. The soup was rather plain and unimpressive  the stir fried beef on the other hand was quite tasty. The sauce they used was delicious. And when I said I wanted it spicy, they sure made it spicy! Good on them. The employees were all very nice and accommodating as well. Highly recommended."
