b"Can't beat the recliners and location.  I just saw Oceans 8 on opening night and had no problems. I could order the seats of my choice online and pick where I want to sit ahead of time. Also, parking is never a problem and there are some decent food/drink options for before or after the movie.  This is my go to spot for a movie and every time I go has been a great experience."
