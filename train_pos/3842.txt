b'Just stopped here for a quick lunch. The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!'
