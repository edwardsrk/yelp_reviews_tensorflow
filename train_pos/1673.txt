b"I've been looking for a nice spa to have my nails done and I noticed this place in the same plaza as my husband's music lessons. It is immaculately clean and there is no smell of acetone like some other nail salons. I had a pedicure and reflexology massage on this trip and it was wonderful! So relaxing I fell asleep during the reflexology massage. $60 for the treatment and I came out feeling energized and my feet and skin look and feel wonderful. I will definitely come back and try a manicure."
