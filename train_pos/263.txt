b'Wow  wow wow. Great ice-cream and pure fun to eat.   Our group ordered the following combos1. Cookies and cream cookies with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with hot fudge on top2. Peanut butter cookie and white chocolate macadamia nut with butter pecan and Heath bar bits3. Chocolate chip cookie white chocolate macadamia nut salted caramel fudge ice cream with Heath bar piecesThe ice cream is rich and thick.  The cookies are satisfactory. The chocolate chip was similar to a basic  Toll House recipe. Which I find rather boring   The blandness of that type of cookie is a good platform for the ice cream The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had chunks of strawberry cheesecake in it. The taste was excellent The butter pecan was lacking in flavour ..... Would give that flavour a miss next timeThe real winner was the salted caramel fudge ice cream. The caramel was so warm and inviting and then the super huge chunks of fudge were amazing. The heath bar tipping added that extra toffee taste the was "the icing on the cake"The fudge on the strawberry cheesecake combo didn\'t add much to the dessert. Also made it near impossible to pick up. Although ordered on the side (if possible ) and dunking the cookie ice cream creation sounds rather like a good option. The servings are really generous and the three of us left with a sugar overlaid. Next time I am going to share one'
