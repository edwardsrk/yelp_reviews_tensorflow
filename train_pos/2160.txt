b"What a cool spot!! We went in to celebrate my husband's birthday in a party of six. The entertainment was on point, with singing and dancing to some great 90's tunes.They took quite a while to bring out drinks, and we were all ready to drink so that was a bit of an oversight on their part. Service overall was not constant, other than the water boy who kept us hydrated (appreciate that in Vegas!)The sushi was good, and drinks were great. We even did sake bombs at the end, which was fun with the way they do it.I would definitely come to this place again!"
