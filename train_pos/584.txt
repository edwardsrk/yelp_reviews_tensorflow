b'Pretty much in the middle of nowhere, Pole Position Raceway was a place I wanted to try out.  Close to the Palm, Pole Position was small, but still had plenty of turns to try power slides and to go 40mph unrestrained.  12 laps seemed to go by rather quickly but was still fun overall.  The fact that it was indoor was also nice since my group decided to go to Vegas during the hottest time of the year.  Thank god for AC.'
