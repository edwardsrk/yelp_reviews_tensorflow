b"The food here was ridiculous, stupid good, whatever the cool kids are saying. Bottom line DAYUM. My wife and I wanted to try this place simply because we watch way to much of the cooking channel, and we love Bobby Flay! We did the dinner pairing. My wife had the Sophie's salad and I started with the tiger prawn tamale, yum! Main course was 16 spice chicken for my lady and I had the Ancho chilie salmon, both stellar choices! My wife had to pass on the dessert since they pretty much brought out the largest portion of chicken ever served in a restaurant. Being the gluten for punishment that I am I went in on the coconut cake, it was extremely decadent! Even though we didn't have a whole lot of interaction with our server, the entire staff worked as a team which made for a pleasant dining experience."
