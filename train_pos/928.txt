b"We walked in and the place was really warm, I'm not sure if their AC went out but man was it uncomfortable in there, shout out to the kids working behind the counter because I hardly wanted to wait in line in that heat let alone move around.  The service was pretty slow, partially due to the people in front of us not knowing what they wanted, they were out of a lot of items on the menu and also it's brand new and there's bound to be growing pains.  I was really surprised there was no one on duty that seemed to be in charge, there was no one there to help the employees along or try and get the line moving faster.  We got our bowls to go and the food was great, it really made up for the fact that the service was slow and it being hot af.  I would recommend putting more sauce on top of the lettuce just because it was really dry, I ended up just removing the lettuce altogether, my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the kale, I didn't think he would be...I'm not even sure why he got that on his bowl to begin with lol.  All in all we would eat here again.  There's A LOT of poke spots opening up so I hope they get it together quickly."
