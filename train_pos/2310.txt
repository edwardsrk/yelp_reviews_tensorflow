b'This is the northest part of Newmarket, and it is needed to have one up here.  Did the drive thru. The lady was professional and quick. Treated my colleagues so I ordered 4 sets of coffee and muffin combo.  The order came wrong as one of the coffee was supposed to be 1 Milk only, but they added sugar.  They just opened within this month and a half so the staff needed more practice.Parking seems inadequate as it was filled up already.'
