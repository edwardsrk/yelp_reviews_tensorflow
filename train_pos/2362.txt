b"booked two rooms here through priceline...when we got to the hotel they couldn't even put us in rooms next to eachother. thankfully they let us upgrade to a one bedroom with a suite attached. couldn't imagine it any other way--we opened all the doors at it was like we were in a two bedroom suite :D we hardly left the hotel, everything you need is right there!"
