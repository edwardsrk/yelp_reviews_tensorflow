b'Very good apple fritters and buttermilk bars! The apple fritters are nice and crispy with big chunks of apples. The buttermilk bar was so moist with just the right amount of sweet. The people were friendly enough. I think I still prefer lamars for location and atmosphere, but the donuts are equally delicious.'
