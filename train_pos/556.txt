b'Great place for a kids haircut, all of the techs are very good with kids, professional, friendly and very skilled. Love the online check in. One downside, the place is very dirty. The carpet is so filthy that my 10 month old grand daughters bare feet were black with dirt and covered with hair from just standing up to the play table for the kids. Carpet needs to be vacuumed and cleaned more often or get rid of it and replace with tile. Very unsanitary.'
