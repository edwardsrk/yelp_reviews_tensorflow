b"i drove all the way across the dessert to have... korean bbq. ive had the honey pig in ktown/LA and this place was very very comparable, with the bonus of having NO WAIT!what i ate:- pork belly: you cant come to a place named after a pig and not have any pork. pork belly was oh so tasty- beef tongue: yum- galbi: very well marinated, and very very tender- fried rice: i know youre full, but trust me when i say, ORDER THIS. your stomach will say it's full, but you keep putting your spoon out for just one more bite. and then another bite. and then another. and then you look down at the grill and realize that its all gone! oh noes! oink oink!*TIP* we ordered meat a la carte, but if you get one of the combos, the fried rice comes out as part of the meal and you dont have to order thispros:- no wait! im used to the LA branch where the wait can be atrocious (at least ~45 mins)- service was pretty good for an asian place. the ding dong bell on the table really helped- owner was so sweet. it was chuseok, or korean autumn festival so she gave us traditional sweet korean rice cakes for dessertcons: - small tables. the grill pan dominated the table leaving very little room for the banchan and other things to eat. but seriously this is such a trivial complaint.would i come again? if i was in vegas and craving kbbq, sure"
