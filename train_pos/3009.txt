b'Everything that my husband and I tried today was amazing. I am glad I got to try something different of what I normally would because i was really pleasantly surprised. We also order one sushi roll because we had to try at least one and we loved it! Definitely will be coming back to try more things. Place is really small, and there was only one server, but we came when it was really slow and the service was pretty fast. All in all very happy we got to try this place out.'
