b"I visited Monty's on my way out of the state.. Once I stepped inside I'd wished I wasn't leaving and that I owned an SUV instead of a 2 door sedan... They have so many amazing things that I wish I could have purchased. The ladies there were very friendly and helpful. Was greeted promptly when I entered the store and felt very welcome. If I ever decide to move back to AZ I will definitely stop in and purchase a few things."
