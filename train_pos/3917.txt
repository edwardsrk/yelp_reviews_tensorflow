b"Definitely the best coffee house I've ever frequented, and I used to frequent this place a lot back in the days when I'd have to hunker down with my 6 novels a week for school.  Tons of tables, lots of menu options, yummy bakery case stuff, ready copies of The Onion, cool, friendly staff, and walls covered in ever-changing artwork for sale by local artists.These peeps know how to make a skim chai latte like no other."
