b'Had the shawarma plate ($12.99). The meal came with salad, pita, pickles and pickled peppers. The meat was thickly sliced, which differs from the typical thinly slices of chicken from other sharwma joints. There was a choice between rice and potatoes. I got the rice and it was amazing. Would come back when I am craving for sharwmas again'
