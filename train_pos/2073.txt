b'Cool place.  Took my wife and son to the recline and dine (movies.) Overall, pretty cool spot to check a flick.  Prices are decent, the place is clean, and comfortable.  I like the idea of reclining on a chair.  Seats recline and food is served here.  Based on previous reviews I was afraid to order food from their pizza place so I have no opinion on the food.  The movie experience was great though.'
