b"Two of the three flavors of gelato we got (Salted Caramel and Chocolate Hazelnut) were excellent. I regretted ordering the Vanilla; it was quite mediocre and tasted freezer-burned. However, the place looks promising. Some other people ordered these cool-looking, fancy gelato cones with cookies stuck in them. I was jealous! I'd go back for sure and next time I'm getting one of those cone thingies!"
