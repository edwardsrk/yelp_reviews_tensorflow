b'Solid Chinese restaurant with a good variety.  They cover a range of Chinese cuisines but do a good job.  Free tea on the table.  Chicken with Chili Oil was pretty good.  Lamb with Cumin not so good.  The lamb had too much sauce.  I normally order this at Sichuan restaurants and it is drier.Asian Legend is a solid choice in the area and I would go back.'
