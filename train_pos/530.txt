b"Oh how I would of loved to have a Sharky's while I was in my late teens and 20's, those days when I was into my full-blown organic phase. Actually my 78 year old SoCal father would love this place and I should recommend it to him since he is the quinoa and brown rice type Filipino- I'm serious here. Although I do not subscribe to an organic lifestyle anymore, I do appreciate it and do like having options.I came to Sharky's with a friend for an early dinner and ordered the Wild Salmon Lite Burrito. It's a wheat burrito filled with grilled wild salmon (not farmed), poblano organic brown rice, nori seaweed, cucumber, avocado and chili sesame seed oil. On it's own it is a bit bland but the salsa bar has a lot of different salsa to make that salmon burrito your very own. I tried different salsas and all of them were fresh and really kicked my burrito a few notches. The burrito was very filling and I ate only half of it but maybe I was talking to my friend and got distracted. Either way, Sharky's is a great concept for those who are looking to have an organic lifestyle and eat out or for those who would just like that option even if it is for a night!"
