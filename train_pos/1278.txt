b'I have decided that all the flower are buy to give as gift are going to be addible. It just makes for a better gift, not only to the arrangements look beautiful you can even eat them, better than throwing away dead flowers.I come here often and I have never been disappointed, the best thing to do is to order your arrangement on line and pick it up at the locations near you. This location is on my way home so it is convenient for me. The flower shaped fruit look great, and it is a creative use of the fruit plus you can cover them in chocolate. Just about anything covered in chocolate can be made better! The prices are very reasonable for fresh fruit, there are a lot of styles to choose from and they will hand wright a card for you. This makes a great gift for any occasion.'
