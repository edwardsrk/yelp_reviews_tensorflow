b"I have been going to this place for a few years. They made a point to know my name and it gives me the warm and fuzzies! I would say everything is good except I am not a fan of cold spring rolls. I love the presentation of the pho...you get a friggen salad to make your own little creation. The mango chicken is awesome and something I crave often. They make a great Mango spicy shrimp salad that rocks with a little kick. And their Chicken fried rice has ruined me for so many others. It is so good that I can't eat it anywhere else! Great for Carryout or dine in."
