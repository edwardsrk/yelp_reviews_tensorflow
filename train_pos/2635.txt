b'Tops is the oddball little neighbourhood dive bar/sports bar that I would be happy to call my local watering hole. Cont\'d below, but first off - As far as pizza goes, Tops are total champions! Super heavy yet not greasy, and loaded the hell up with tasty toppings, Tops does pizza right. We got the New Yorker half and halfed with the Spartan pizza. Steak bites, mushrooms, green pepper, onions and bacon stripes [sic] (actia;;u there were a tonne of spelling mistakes on this menu - @yycist would have a hayday) meets donair meat and banana peppers. It\'s unruly delicious. It\'s also close to $40 for an XL (14").a Worth it? Yeah, we both had leftovers.You start getting north and what happens? Unfortunately the bars get further and further away. You\'d better hope you live next to a fits-all bar that fits you. Or, you know, you could just live a lifestyle that doesn\'t involve having a close to home spot where you can drink, eat, and befriend the other drinkin\' eatin\' locals... But I don\'t even want to entertain that as a possibility...Now I say sports bar/dive bar. On first look, Tops is surprisingly nice, sporting a giant guitar in the roof. On the ground, the bar counters shadow the outline of the giant guitar. Where the fretboard is, is a long bar height table good for conversational seating for up to 8 people. But for some reason I can\'t help but think that it is merely lipstick on a pig... Maybe it was the human feces smeared along and adjacent strip mall glass door, and then piled on the sidewalk below, as I approached Tops... Maybe.But Tops can\'t be blamed for that, it wasn\'t even their business! Well, yes it wasn\'t their business, but can they be blamed? Ehn, I have a feeling that\'s a different story altogether... I don\'t yet know the denouement.'
