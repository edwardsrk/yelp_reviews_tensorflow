b'This is a really great find!! I am not sure if the off season and the cleaning of the pool brought lower prices but the $$$ is certainly not true. I paid $85 per night in July. It is well kept, nice added features, cute patio, a very nice lobby with high back couches and chairs all over, with free happy hour wine. They have 2 pools, one is a sand beach feel. They also have nice fire pits at nite with smores each night. Staff were very pleasant. Patio and Adirondack chairs are a comfortable feature. Beds are comfy with down comfortable and pillows. Tub is not great but if you are not here to take a tub bath, all is good. Two separate mirror areas for getting ready is an added feature. They have ihome alarm and ipod set up for music etc. The only thing I could say as a negative is that there is a minor smell to the room each time you come in. Oh and a free shuttle to all the restaurants and 5h Avenue. Pleasant drivers. Convenient location to Old Town and a great Hotel.'
