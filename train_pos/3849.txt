b"I haven't been to Eddie V's since their relocation from DC Ranch to the Scottsdale Quarter, but I sure wasn't disappointed. I could not try ordering anything else besides the Parmesan-Encrusted Sole and it has not changed it's culinary explosion of flavor one bit. The experience was romantic, the atmosphere was wonderful with a live musician, and we absolutely adored our waiter, Michael. I definitely wish we had more of an appetite leftover from our entrees for the dessert options, but after two side dishes, an appetizer, in addition to the entrees we were filled to the brim. We will definitely return."
