b"I have played Bear Creek many times the past 10 years...they have always had a friendly enough staff and, now, apparently a new greenskeeper from the past year or so...don't really know, has sharpened the venue quite well.  As an avid golfer, I can say the course has never been better.  One of the gents at the course explained they use a four seed variant for their fairways and they yield an excellent blend of playablity and 'roll'.  They were top notch for certain.  The greens have always been an issue for me, until now!  They rivaled those of a Whirlwind or Ocotillo with just a touch less speed.  Very nice indeed!!  I'd give if a '5' but don't care for the lack of water stations along the course.  When I'm ready for a drink..well, you get the idea!  Ready to play again."
