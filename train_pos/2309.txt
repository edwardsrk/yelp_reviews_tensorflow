b"If I'm not at Bazic, I'm here. My friends and I used to bounce back and forth between Zizzy and Bazic at least once a month. I even threw a birthday party here one year! Zizzy has a great happy hour and good selection of songs for karaoke. The only downside lately is that God awful sewage smell! I hope they take care of that soon. :/"
