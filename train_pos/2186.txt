b"This place has been around for DECADES, and yet, it's popularity has never waned. This place always has a line, and the parking lot is always full. When I visited, there were absolutely no booths available for seating. The interior decor takes things back old school. Ice Cream and Milkshakes are the most popular items, but burgers, fries, and more are sold here as well. I had the Cookies & Cream Milkshake for $4.25, while my boyfriend had the Cookie Dough Ice Cream on a Waffle Cone for $3.50. I was thrilled (but not surprised, because I had read plenty of reviews ahead of time) to receive a giant scoop of ice cream on top of my tall shake! The milkshake part was a bit watery, as if there was more ice than cream. The ice cream scoop, on the other hand, was absolutely delightful! However, I think my boyfriend chose the better flavor of the 2. His flavor came with mini chocolate chips, in addition to the cookie dough, and this made the flavor even better! His ice cream was incredibly creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness, and his scoop of ice cream was so humongous, it looked absurd! I know what I'm getting next time!"
