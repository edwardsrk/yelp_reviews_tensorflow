b"Wait wasn't bad considering the huge crowd of people outside the place. The food came out quickly and my husband and I loved both our plates. The French toast was bomb.com and he got the breakfast special. Servers were nice. My first time there, and an annual trip for hubby(spring training) Will be back next time I'm in the area!!"
