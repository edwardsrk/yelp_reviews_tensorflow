b'I too was an O Premium water  client. So i was a bit bummed when they sold out to Sparkletts.  However, they have proven themselves many times over.   I am very happy with their water delivery and their service. They even started giving us a case of bottled  water along with our water service. The only draw back as to why i did not give them 5 stars is they are very hard to reach on the phone and it takes a long time to get anything done with the billing. But, other than that all good.!'
