b'Out of all the places to choose from in Chinatown this place is awesome. The pad Thai is what I usually get to compare to other Thai places. If they do this well the rest of the menu usually follows suit. Great flavors in the pad Thai and the Thai tea. Loved the pot stickers sauce. Definitely will be returning again.'
