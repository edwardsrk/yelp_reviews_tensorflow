b"These guys were fantastic! I  had an oddly shaped framed mirror that had broken.  I had all but given  up on the beauty. Nobody would would cut a new mirror because of it's odd angles and curves.They cut a new mirror according to the frame and I had my beautiful mirror back on my vanity. I had to pay a pretty penny but it was worth it! They were very professional and courteous."
