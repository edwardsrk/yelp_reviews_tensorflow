b'My rating is purely on the food and not on the service at all.  Every time I come into town for business I make it a point to stop here and eat because the food is outstanding. I had the Ahi tuna. This is the first time that I had Drue as a bartender and maybe he was just having a bad day but someone needs to explain to him that a smile and being friendly is all part of bartending. Everyone has a bad day but when your job involves customer service you have to suck it up and put a smile on your face.'
