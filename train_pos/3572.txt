b'Some of the best cookies I have ever eaten. I am a big fan of oatmeal cookies and my favorite so far is the oatmeal peanut butter chocolate chip! Yummm!It is a chunky cookie filled with lots of good stuff and tastes like just out of the oven. The owner says they do mail orders and also gluten free.The shop is charming with unique one of a kind items. Owner is friendly and welcoming. The shop seems like a comfy place to sit and enjoy your cookie and tea. Maybe next time I will try their cookie sundae with ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce.'
