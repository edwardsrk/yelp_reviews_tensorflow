b"Having just moved to the area, Casey's has been such an amazing place to have available.  They truly have a little bit of everything available 24 hours a day.  Everybody who works here has always been so friendly and helpful. Their pizza is also really, really, really good.  It's my favorite so far in the area.  Who would've thought???  We have only done carry out up to this point, but they do now offer delivery.  Delivery hours are 4:30 p.m. - 10 p.m. There is a delivery fee of $2 per order with a minimum purchase of $10 required. Forms of payment accepted include major credit cards, cash and check."
