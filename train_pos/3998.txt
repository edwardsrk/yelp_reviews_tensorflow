b"Harrah's is really smoky with about the worst ventilation anywhere.  But the theater has good AC.  Once the show starts, the door closes and this is a true non smoking show.  If you get there early you get the best seats (but have to breathe Harrah's air for a little bit).This is a terrific show.  Mac has got a self-deprecating style of humor that is great.  Some sexual innuendo, but still family friendly.  It is not a 'kid' show - don't let the fact you don't have kids stop you from seeing this show. His magic is fun.  I was laughing the entire time.Mac is great with his fans after the show, even for those that didn't buy his magic sets or books.  He's especially great with the kids who come to see his show.At $30, it is hands down the best deal on the strip.  I can't recommend this enough.  Go see it."
