b"We came to Henderson after a horrific experience at Fairway Chevrolet. Patrick was our salesman,  Joe and Tony handled the sale without any hassle. I felt I was treated with respect and honesty. We liked them and will defiantly drive the extra miles to Henderson.  Thank you guys. After being treated so poorly at Fairway I'm happy that we took a drive to Henderson. Your customer service is awesome."
