b'Went in the other day because I bought my mom some concert tiks. This place is getting 4 stars because after the name change, a little TLC and some good marketing this place has great potential. They had a cool space ship futuristic looking bar area I liked. Also, Sarah at the box office was a total sweetheart. Next time I buy tickets it will definitely be from her.'
