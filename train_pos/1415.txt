b'I am surprised to see bad reviews here as we had a great, albeit huge, meal! We decided on the chef\'s tasting menu which seemed like a good deal but turned out to be too much food, at least for me, my husband finished his.The first course was a small amuse bouche that was just a spoonful of a melon prepared by the chef.  From there you get to pick a first, a second, a third and either a half of a side or a dessert.  I picked the shinshito peppers as my first while my husband had the heirloom tomato salad.  The peppers were very good but after looking at other tables I wished I had ordered the "corn bones" as they looked really, really good.  For my second I had the gnoochi sardi that was phenomenal and would have been plenty as an entree.  My husband had the brussel sprouts, also good but not entree size.   For our third, I had the lamb burger and was immediately disappointed that I ate all my awesome gnoochi as there was no way I was going to finish the burger.  We got a half of animal style frites which were good but the egg was a bit more cooked than I would have liked plus my gnoochi had an egg on top too which made the second egg a bit much.  Since we both had the tasting menu we split the one half of the frites and then split a dessert for the other.  I picked the peanut butter crispie.  Good but next time I\'ll try the popcorn as it also looked good.'
