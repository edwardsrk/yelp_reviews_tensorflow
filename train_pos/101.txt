b"I've been a regular at Sport Clips since my first review (Nov 17, 2016) of the Arizona Pavilions location in Marana.Since then I moved to Chandler and have been a customer at this location for a few months now.The price for a haircut at this location is a little higher than I was paying in Marana. However, I still believe it is a good value due to the quality of the service.I also appreciate the fact that they usually have more staff on duty than the Marana location and so the wait time is shorter, especially on busy Saturday mornings."
