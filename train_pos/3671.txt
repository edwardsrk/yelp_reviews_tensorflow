b'This is a place you can drive by 1,000 times and not think twice but, take our advice and pull in! It is completely worth it! The staff was super nice and the food is totally different than what most of Charlotte offers! Using your hands for utensils and having homemade honey wine! Great experience that will keep us going back!'
