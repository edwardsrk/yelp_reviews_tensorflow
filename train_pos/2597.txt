b"Great sushi. We were recommended I love Sushi by chance. Met a couple at Egg Works (another great restaurant for breakfast). They told us about I Love Sushi and we tried it later that night. Really fresh fish , which is as anyone knows is hard to come across in the desert. Service was quick and very attentive. Drinks never went empty and sushi chef couldn't wait to fix us something else. Try it out if you are in the area. It's a bit pricey but worth the $$."
