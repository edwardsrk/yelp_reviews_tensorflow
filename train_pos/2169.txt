b"Great Prices On Some Hidden Deals....I got 2 Zegna Suits when I was here for 70% off which was a great find! I wish they did the alterations here, but I brought them to a local tailor to get them properly fitted. You really cannot complain when you get $1500-$1700 suits for $420-$580 each! I looked around a bit for some shirts and things but I am a bigger guy so I need tall clothes and they have lots of normal little guy stuff here. They have a massive selection of women's goods. I like this location in the Premium Outlets, for some reason it's an inviting shopping area and stays pretty nice throughout. Stop in for a look... Who knows what deals you might find!"
