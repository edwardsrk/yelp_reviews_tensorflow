b"Sunnys chicken fingers are good. A couple of times they were dry. It was take out so i didn't know until I got home. We were disappointed!On average though, Sunnys has good food.I recommend calling your order ahead of time. They're usually pretty busy, at least that's been my experience. The lady who takes the orders has always been nice as well."
