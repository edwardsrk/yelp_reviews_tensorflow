b"This is an awesome, cheap family diner! Such nice people run the place and they're very good for what they do. It's basic stuff - bagel with egg and cheese, omelettes, egg salad, soup, etc. Good diner food that comes out decently quickly. The donuts are also very tasty and there is always a trivia question for a free donut if you get it right!"
