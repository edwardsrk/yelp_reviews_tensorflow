b"The food here was sooooo good! I wanted some Dominican food but being in another country, I didn't know how it would taste. The food was perfect! The menu was simple and had all the classic dishes, the atmosphere was a home-like feel and the area was very family oriented. When we travel back to Canada, we're definitely coming back here!"
