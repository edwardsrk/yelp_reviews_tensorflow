b"There are numerous Vietnamese restaurants in Mississauga but this one always seems to be on people's top five best. I have been here in the past but I decide to do a review based on the last visit over the Thanksgiving long weekend. I had the pho with beef flank, tripe and tendon.Overall it was a good meal. The portions were large indeed. Lots of noodles and plenty of beef strips and tripe. Tendon was smooth and tender. However the biggest win is they sprinkle very little cilantro! Overall a place to visit when you are in Mississauga. And only 7 mins drive from Square One."
