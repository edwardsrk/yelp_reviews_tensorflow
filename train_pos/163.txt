b'Good food all around. The meal begins with complimentary sides as most Korean restaurants are known for. In addition to the usual sprouts, kimchi, etc. Island Style also gives you boiled peanuts which were a nice touch. I went wth cold noodles half and half for my meal. I really liked the dish, with each side offering a nice taste. I wish it could have been spicier but in the end I was contently full and very happy with my choice. $14 for the dining experience was well worth it. The restaurant itself had a very mom and pop feel and seemed authentic in every aspect. A very good option for eating in the area.'
