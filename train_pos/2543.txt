b"I had a stay-cation at the El Cortez over the weekend with my husband. It was awesome! These are things, as a local, will keep me coming back to visit:- Clean and didn't smell smokey: The casino has been around since the 1940's and it's last restoration was about a decade ago but it wasn't the dingy, smoke-filled mess I imagined it would be.- Vintage, Classic Vegas vibe: From the yellow-tinted windows to the live piano player tickling the ivories at the main entrance behind the cool-looking vintage car, I felt like I was in a mobster movie.- Conveniently located on Freemont East: Awesome bars/restaurants are within walking distance. We were able to visit The Gryffin, Commonwealth, Evel Pie, and Eureeka over the weekend without moving the car from the parking garage (which, by the way is free when you show your room key)!- Great eats inside: It's a small place so eating options are limited but Siegel's 1941 is open 24 hours (ask for the $10.95 prime rib - it's not on the menu but it's a $10.95 prime rib!) and Naked City Pizza never disappoints."
