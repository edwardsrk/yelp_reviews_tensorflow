b'This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, if not anywhere. Every aspect is well thought out and perfectly executed. My husband and I have eaten here twice, both times have been amazing. We spent our honeymoon in Spain and visited San Sebasti\xc3\xa1n, the home of Spanish pintxos. This restaurant always reminds me of that amazing trip. The food is well executed and delicious. The last time we went we stopped in on a whim expecting to either not get seated or maybe wait for a bar seat. The staff was so accommodating, they were able to fit us in the dinning room by chance. Service is superb. Highly recommend the pickled cauliflower, amazing dish.'
