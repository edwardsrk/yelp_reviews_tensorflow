b"I've been looking for another nail salon after a previous one botched it really badly and needed them removed. After seeing the good reviews, I wanted to try this out. Facility: Mostly clean when you walk in. They use a fresh towel for each client which I like, but do not use new files & sponges nor do they sanitize the drills before each client. I also do not believe they wipe down the tables with any alcohol after each client, but the table looks clean when you sit down. It seems rare these days that nail salons would practice good hygiene because money is tight. I got a gel polish removal and a basic manicure. It started out with Jenny that filed the gel down, but got up halfway to tend to another client that walked in, then Nancy came along and finished the service up. I'm not bothered by it much, but wish there was some communication because I was a little confused as to what was going on. Total cost was $31 paid with cash. Nancy did very well in getting all the polish off, shortening the nail and filed them down really nicely. My cuticles were well attended to and trimmed just a little of the dead skin. She made a lot of detail and went back when something was amiss. The hand massage was quite nice as well and my hands and nails came out looking very moisturized and great. One star was taking off because they can really improve on communication skills between the client and nail tech. Everyone is super quiet and not trying to make any conversation at all with the client. It seemed quiet awkward very awkward and eerie in the salon. The client next to me was trying to make conversation, but the nail tech only replied with one word answers. Also, when I got up to leave after finishing the drying station, no one bothered to say goodbye to me and only one of them put cuticle oil on my fingers. It felt like I was appreciated as much? All in all. It was pretty good and I will be back later."
