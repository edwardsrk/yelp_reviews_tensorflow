b"Was there in a Friday night for oysters and cocktails. Not happy hour proces but the oysters are great. Bartender crafts wonderful drinks and is helpful in suggesting others. Not a sports bar (tv is tiny lol was fun watching people try to see the score) pricey but excellent drinks. Nice place alone or small group can't see it being a large group spot at all."
