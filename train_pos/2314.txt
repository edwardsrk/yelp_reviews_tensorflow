b"The hotel was nice, as soon as you pull up, it looks as good as the strip hotels, however its much cleaner and nicer.There were dinner hotspots and an active casino.The clientele and the staff were pleasant to be around. The rooms are spacious and clean which is hard to find in Vegas. We didn't want to leave!I really enjoyed the view. The window was large, the bottom half of the view is of the roof, however the sprawling mountains were glorious during the sunrise and sunset. This hotel is well off the strip (10 min drive) and allows for the limitless views."
