b"I stay here every time I'm in town and love the property. I always upgrade my room and the view doesn't disappoint. I love being able to avoid the hastle of being on strip while still being right by the strip. And I've never had anything but positive experiences with the staff when I need them for something. I'll keep coming back!"
