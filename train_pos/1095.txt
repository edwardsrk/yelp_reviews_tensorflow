b"They're new and a breathe of fresh air. Very nice ambience and the waitress is courteous and helpful.  The food is delcious too.  The meat was not too crisp and not too tender but just right. We liked it so much, we even took a lot of it to go. I couldn't stop eating it afterwards.  It's a Halal restaurant so I hope they don't get a liquor license.  Then they will have many many Muslims in the area come over for feast. They deserve to be recognized.  My only regret is I didnt book my birthday dinner with friends here instead of the hakka restaurant a few doors down which was an epic fail this time."
