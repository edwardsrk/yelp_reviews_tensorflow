b"I had my hair done yesterday at another salon, by a different stylist. The results were, to say the least, not favorable. What I had asked for was not what I received. I was in a panic as I have an outing planned for Saturday and could not wait the week that the stylist wanted me to wait. My coworker referred me here. I called made appointment, was scheduled today after work and I found Christina A. She literally is a color genius! She turned my orange, uneven hair into exactly what I wanted and what I've been told by many other stylist since moving to Vegas, would take multiple sessions to achieve. They were WRONG! My hair feels healthy and shiny and is the color I have been wanting. I am so happy that I found her and will NOT be going to anyone else. Her prices are super reasonable too! And she makes you feel comfortable and walks you through the whole process. Thank you for fixing my hair Christina!"
