b"If only all fast food resembled the lovely cardboard boxes at Smoke's Poutinerie, we'd feel a wee bit different about this degenerate category of consumption. Though the calories and fat are still present, there's just something more attractive about the packaging and contents of this type of quick meal than a paper-wrapped burger or a bucket of greasy chicken.A small portion will more than fill you up, packed to the brim with well-cooked fries, loads of gravy and cheese curds. I don't know why we are slacking on the poutine in the US, but someone needs to get on this and open up a poutinerie in the states. Or maybe not...as I would just end up eating here the whole time, adding to my ever-expanding waistline."
