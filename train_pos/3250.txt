b"Yesterday was my first time at Sakana and I thought it was a great place. It's not on the strip, it's about 20 minutes off the strip. The service was well, the waitress would come around often. The food was delicious. A must have is the summer crunch. The best part is the all you can eat deal. You pay $25 and get as many rolls as you want."
