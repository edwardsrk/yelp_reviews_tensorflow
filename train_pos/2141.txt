b'It\'s in the middle of the strip which is why I keep coming back. They have done a lot of renovations since the last time I was there. The rooms are nice. They aren\'t super fancy or anything but I mean really, how much are you in the room anyways. They moved Cut and took away one of my favorite little crappy "get steak and eggs at 3 am" place. The rooms are very accessible as far as getting to the strip and back. Honestly, best bang for your buck! For 6 nights, it was $380 and that was me making reservations 3 days in advance and in summer!'
