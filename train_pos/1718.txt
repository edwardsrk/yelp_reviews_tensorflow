b'The food is very good. we are fans of the chicken gorgonzola and the veal toscana.  the linguini and clam sauce is good.  garlic knots are very good.  Fried calamari is excellent, plain but high quality.  the bread is outstanding.The waiter and the staff are outstanding.  They go far out of their way to help you if you have food problems.  My wife can not eat black pepper.  They have always made sure her food is without it and even the cook double checked every thing she was using.  I have not had that kind of service for a long time.It does not look prepossessing when you walk in, but once you get back to the dining area it is very nice.  It is quiet and very comfortable.'
