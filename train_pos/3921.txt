b"I went here today for lunch and i was pleasantly suprised with this quaint hidden gem. I love mediterranean food, so this slight chipotle spin on a classic was clever. You have 2 options bowl or wrap. I'd pick bowl if your a tad hungrier. Hummus, greens, protein, and unlimited toppings made for a very hearty meal. It was my first meal of the day at noon and kept me full until 7pm! I also gave the cinnamon twist pita fries with peanut butter hummus a go and was impressed with flavor, just not so much texture. The pita fries where I expected them to be soft were hard. But overall i felt like this was a delightful meal satisfying and refreshing. Its far from where i live but i will definitely make the drive!"
