b"Saw Slipknot /Lamb of God/Bullet for my Valentine/ Motionless in White last night freaking amazing show! Parking was free and easy but we were an hour early. Security did good getting us thru...pat down and made us take all lids of water bottles. We were general admission lawn and lots of space to stretch out . Clearly there's gonna be pot smokers everywhere..we were fully surrounded and people never asked to put it out at any point. People were lighting up and roaming around with it in broad daylight.  This generation seems to have no fear of the law.  Guess they knew security wasnt going to be around. ..during the whole 5 hour experience we saw security just once escorting someone out and medics walked by twice. Good time good venue!"
