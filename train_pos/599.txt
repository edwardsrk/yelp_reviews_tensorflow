b"This hotel is right behind Planet Hollywood and used to part of Planet Hollywood before Hilton took over. We chose to forgo the $15 valet and self parked but it was a pain because the garage was packed and the walk to the hotel took a good 7+minutes. The front desk workers were friendly and checked us in quickly. I got the 1 king bed suite. It was extremely spacious and modern. The bed was large and comfortable. Flat screen tvs in the living room, bed room and bathroom were pretty cool. There was a fantastic view of Vegas from the room. There was a small kitchen plus a hot tub! The wall insulation was perfect because we didn't hear any noise from our neighbors. The negatives are the $15 valet service, $10 wifi fee,check out time is 10am and they wouldn't give us a late checkout, but the most annoying thing were the thick, pillows that were extremely uncomfortable. It took me a long time both nights to get in a comfortable position. So bring your own pillows.Overall, I would stay here again because the rates are very cheap for the accommodations you get."
