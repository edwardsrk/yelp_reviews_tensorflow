b"On the rare occasion I make the drive all the way over here, I always want to check out new places to eat, so I saw this one and saw what good reviews it had. At first I thought it was a more dine in place, but it's kind of like chipotle but Mediterranean style. I got the chicken bowl with hummus veggies and the spicy sauce they have. It was really good, and they also had sugar free drinks which were tasty as well. The chicken was alright, I'd probably skip that next time and just stick to the veggies. Cool concept good food and service was good too."
