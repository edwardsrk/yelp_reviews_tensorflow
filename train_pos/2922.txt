b"Small location with highly professional staff. Lots of gift options and an impressive case full of single pieces like truffles, dipped fruit, and clusters.The menu includes Godiva soft serve and their Truffelata beverages. I had an assortment of truffles which were all delicious.A little pricey, but for Godiva quality, I don't mind. My only complaint is the lack of seating. The soft serve looked amazing, but it would melt taking two steps outside into the Vegas heat. A couple of chairs along the window would be an excellent addition."
