b"Another great Port of Subs experience! The XL #1 on white with double meat! That's a beast of a sandwich and great value!!! FYI, a 2 foot sandwich is just a really good deal on two 1 foot sammys. But you can top them differently so sharing is possible, easy, and probably recommended! :)Oh, don't forget to pick up a Port of Subs loyalty card and register it. Every $100 gets you a free footlong sub of your choice and registering it online earns you a free small sub during your birthday month."
