b'How can you NOT love a store that is filled with clothes that have sayings such as "I only cry when ugly people hold me" or "When life gives you lemons, squirt people in the eyes"..??This place is a playland for the fun, the kitschy, and the yeah...just a little mean.They have tshirts, shorts, baby onesies, pajamas..also keychains, compact mirrors, lip gloss. Whenever we come to Vegas, I have to come home with a D&G shirt, it\'s so hard to just choose one...I could easily get a little outta control. "Oops, I almost cared" or "I can tell your bag is fake" are ones I have eyeballed on numerous visits, but still passed up. This time I got one for my better half too. Control Freak with an old-school gaming remote control on it.D&G is the new black.'
