b"This was our first time here tonight. I haven't had a pedi in 6 months.... And it's been years for my husband... Yes years.When you first walk in... There's an odd smell I couldn't put my finger on. Turns out it is paint. They are doing some sort of construction here.I am glad I made an appointment. There have been at least 6 walk ins in the hour that wr have been here.Their polish is pretty disorganized, and hard to navigate through. There are four shelves with it just everywhere. I was successful in finding something sparkly.They use a lot of OPI product here. Their deluxe pedi that we are getting is 55minutes for $40. It includes a scrub and a white tea mask.The massage wad decent, and not rushed. Staff was friendly when we asked about the thai place next door (stick e rice) .Feet feel smooth. Husband is relaxed. What more can you ask for.... Besides dinner"
