b"Checked this place out on a late night hunch with a buddy and let me tell you. This places is straight fire! I'm not just talking about heat levels either. We got a small sampler in which we tried the fried chicken with green onion, blazing chicken on a skillet with sausages and an order of kimchi and oyster fried rice. The fried chicken was so crisp it was unreal. The meat was still moist and succulent. The flaming chicken was tasty, well-spiced and flavourful too. The sausages weren't the main event so I give some leeway on their generic processed feel. The fried rice was also excellent, a little stingy on the oysters, but to be expected. Overall I'm definitely coming back for the fried chicken - it makes a nice alternative to chicken wings and beer. Just a heads up though, don't expect late night Chinese food prices, this place isn't cheap."
