b"Discovered Tryst (Organic) Cafe shortly after it opened about 2+ yrs ago. Have had breakfast, lunch & dinner there. They have organic everything - food, beer, wine, even vodka - which is what drew me at first. Also many gluten free choices.They've had their ups & downs with service, but it's usually good. The happy hour is limited and should be improved in both hours & choices.My wife & I both love their Seered Ahi Tuna Salad, it's fantastic! We both want and need a good organic cafe in the area and hate to see the pizza place next door packed while the healthy restaurant is lightly filled. Help Tryst thrive!"
