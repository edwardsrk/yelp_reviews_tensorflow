b"View is amazing! The black swans swimming in the lake are sooooo beautiful and happy! So maybe I did just took some bread from the basket and fed the swans. lol. They did look hungry.When you walk into the restaurant, you really are not in the restaurant. The 1st room is the wine shop, huge selection of exotic and very pricey and hard to find wines. I did have the fortune to meet one of the owners, and she's definitely a wine enthusiast, and possibly a botox enthusiast as well. We got a seat right by the window, and a nice sweet lady came to take care of us. She was easily one of the best waitresses I've had: super attentive, sweet, patient, and anticipated our needs before we even opened our mouth to ask. Very lovely and very intelligent. I got the foie gras appetizer which was nothing short of amazing, both in flavor and presentation. The crab salad was very fresh, light and very refreshing on a hot summer day. I got the duck entree, and that was cooked perfectly and flavored just right. Last but not least, the chocolate lava cake was so pretty, and tasted even better. Definitely recommend, and for sure check out the wine shop."
