b"We weren't what sure what to expect from a 1:00pm comedy/show.  Maybe we weren't expecting a lot since the tickets were very reasonable (expecially through one of those half-price tix places) however we thought the show was great.  Glad we noticed the good reviews here on Yelp. Definitely a good choice to fill a couple of afternoon hours if you want to get off the casino floor."
