b"I visited the Maple Leaf lounge in the domestic terminal and had a good experience. The lady at the front desk, Karen, was really helpful and spoke great French! The breakfast menu was simple, but satisfying; they had non-dairy milk options upon request (why not self-service like the rest?), which I appreciated. The only bummer to my visit was the lack of power outlets. Somehow, each chair had a lamp next to it, but no outlet available. People definitely want to charge their devices while they're waiting for their flights, and that seems like a realistic upgrade that could be made to this lounge."
