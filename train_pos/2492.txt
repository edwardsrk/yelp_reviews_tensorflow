b'Wow, are they ever ready for X-mas! The front door area inside is super jammed with stuff but it is not as overwhelming once deeper inside the store.I could not believe how low the prices were here! I had not been to a Jysk in years.My friend and I found everything we went in looking for and more. The staff were super friendly and helpful. No line upon check-out but midweek, midday is key I think to a successful shopping trip, if you can swing it.Some great sales are happening here too. Buy 2 votive candles, get 1 free was one I took advantage of. The scents were quite nice. 99 cents each! Bonkers! My friend found the duvet cover she was looking for, for $12 - it was $24 at Ikea.I also got the BEST bathrobe ever, softest in the land for $10! I rushed home to wash all the ones I am now donating and getting rid of!Given how low the price tags are here, I am not necessarily convinced quality is A1 depending on your purchase but I have never had any issue with anything I have bought at a Jysk before. Worth the gamble IMO.Now, if only I could say their name properly!'
