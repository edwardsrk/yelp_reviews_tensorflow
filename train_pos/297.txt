b"As someone who doesn't like the taste of salad (generally), but who isn't anti-vegetable by any means, I gave their signature Stetson chopped salad a try, and I'm a convert--so, so good!  The salad has a lot of elements to it, which give it great texture and keeps it from getting monotonous, as each bite is a little different in flavor but still cohesive.  My husband really enjoyed the burger he got at lunch time (we didn't see it at dinner time).  It had a lot of good flavors going on and was cooked well.  It was also a massive portion!  We've tried their truffle macaroni and cheese, which my husband said was decent, but I didn't love; too bland, no truffle taste at all, and too loose for my taste."
