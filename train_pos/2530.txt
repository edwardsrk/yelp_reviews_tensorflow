b"I am so glad that I found Platinum Entourage.  To update you on my hairstyle and cut, I had from the end of June. The scent of the jasmine essential oil Heather put in my hair lasted for more than week.  Whenever I style my hair for one day and let run for a day or two until I wash again, it's perfect.  A great atmosphere , pretty hair salon, and really  professional service."
