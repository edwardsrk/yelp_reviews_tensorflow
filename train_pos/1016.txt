b"My family and I made reservations at Ann's Chophouse for my brother's birthday on a Saturday night. I had the smothered and covered chicken, which was topped with provolone cheese and fried peppers. It came with two sides so I had the mashed potatoes and a salad. Other people in our party ordered a steak, ribeye, ribs, chicken Alfredo and lemon pepper chicken. Everyone enjoyed their meal! Our waitress, Jodi, was friendly and quick when it came to serving our table! She brought out warm rolls and butter before our meals - and they were delicious! We all said that we would definitely go back here for another meal."
