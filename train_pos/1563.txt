b"Not sure where all the negativity comes from about this place!My kids and I were forced out of our Condo due to a flood and were put up here for a few nights:- Booked last minute and got a great price on the room!- Upon arrival the clerk was extremely courteous. The lobby was clean, the parking lot is monitored with security cameras and plenty of lights.- Room was immaculate and well stocked. Tons of storage space. Safe in the room. Iron and ironing board in the room. Fridge, microwave, coffee maker and coffee as well.- Breakfast was actually much better than I expected: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast and English muffins, tons of pastries and a waffle maker, juices and coffees, milk.Free WiFi, computer provided 24 hours in the lobby, snack bar in the lobby (overpriced but that's to be expected). Pool area with hot tub - seemed clean- Easy access to the 101 and a bunch of places to eat. Down the street from the hospital (if needed).Not sure what else is expected for a place that's less that $80/night...I mean come'on peeps!"
