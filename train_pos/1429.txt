b"Came here for lunch. There was four of us and between us four, we each ordered the pulled pork quesadilla and tropical paella. The Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla had spicy slaw, tomato, Machaego cheese and cucumber aioli. Everything had it's own flavors, but I wasn't a big fan of their slaw. I think it would have tasted fine without the slaw or perhaps up the taste for the slaw. It just had a sour taste and didn't go well with the pork.The Tropical Paella had chicken, chorizo, mussels, shrimp, bay scallops, sugar snap peas, pineapple and red peppers. This dish was well flavored and the pineapple gave the dish a great touch. There was chunks of everything everywhere, I would say they need more rice with all that stuff! =)We also had an order of Jamaican Jerk Wings with cilantro cream- this was very tasty. The wings were seasoned well and the sauce went very well with the dish.Overall experience, this place was very tasty and would come back. Service was quick and friendly."
