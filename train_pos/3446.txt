b'From the service to the food this place is always on point. My favorite is the gyro plate with rice and a salad with their special made creamy dressing. Ooo and do not forget the homemade hot sauce! I absolutely love this place. We frequent this place at least three times a month since moving to Vegas in April. I would eat here daily if I could, yep it is that good.'
