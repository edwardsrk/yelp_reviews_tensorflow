b"The food and vibe here is outstanding. It's definitely a place where I'll be taking all our friends when they come into Madison.For starters, the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. If you like buffalo sauce, it's a home run. Meatballs - pretty tasty themselves, but the red sauce is magical. Entrees:The pizza sauce is perfect. While I love a good wood fired pizza, the steel pan pizza is Madison's pizza. I mean spotted cow in the dough? It's a thicker pizza with a cheese baked onto the outside of the dough. The black mushroom truffle wood fired and Calabrian sausage pizza were the two our table tried.Dessert:The only dessert currently in the place is the pizza cookie, but it's all it needs. A partially baked cookie covered with vanilla ice cream. Drool... The entire table can share it and it's a whopping $5. Get 1 per 4 people and you're set.There's a lounge downstairs, amazing beer selection, and much more I could talk about. Check it out. You won't be upset."
