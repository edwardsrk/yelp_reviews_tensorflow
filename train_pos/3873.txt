b"WONDERFUL! My family stopped by today after church. What a delightful place. Luci's had some delicious food and afterwards we went to Splurge for some delicious Gelato. It was a bit warm, Arizona Summer, the trees have misting systems as well as plenty of shade. Grass and a small splashpad. What a delightful getaway from the big city we live in."
