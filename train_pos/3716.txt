b'Food - YES! Not much on the bar part; but the care taken for the preparation of our food today was unparalleled. I ordered the catfish special today - panfried to excellence, the coleslaw (homemade, not outta plastic container) was extraordinary. Also ordered were the open-face turkey sandwich and turkey sliders - reports were great on them too.We will be back for the food for sure.'
