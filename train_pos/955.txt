b"This is just the kind of tavern/pub/bar that Bloor Street needs.As others have stated, the decor is quite classy without seeming cheesy. The little patio over Bloor looks great as well. Overall, a great ambiance in here.I had the double hamburger, and it was sublime. The beef was tender and juicy and all the topics were top quality. You pay a few dollars more per main here than at one of the chain pubs, but it's still great value. Generous portion sizes and lots of fries too!There's a good selection of beer, and it looks like some mean cocktails as well.The service was excellent, and I was quite impressed with this tavern."
