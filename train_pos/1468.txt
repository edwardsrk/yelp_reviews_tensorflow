b"Great decor (dark and ornate, with a bit of a steampunk theme to it), brilliant cocktails, and extremely tasty food.Best tater tots in the southwest. Not that I've had too many upscale tots to compare them to. Nevertheless, they rocked my mouth-world. There was only one thing I didn't like about this place: the server tried to up-sell me a side dish, claiming that everything was a la carte; this was not at all accurate. My veal cheeks came with a perfect portion of potatoes and veggies. Maybe SOME entrees lacked sides, but mine was not one of them. Unless that server's primary ambition is to make the world a fatter place, I think he might be better suited to the sale of used cars."
