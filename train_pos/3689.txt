b'I am not a person for Buffets unless I am in Vegas but I was totally blown away f=by this place!!! First of all just the deco of the place was one big investment as the had it all in there including the Eiffel Tower, Greek wind mill, part of china and italy. Then there was the food and since I am careful what I am eating they actually had lots to offer. plenty of veggies, 7 different types of pizza. A complete turkey which I had but they had roasts of all types. Which I was told are slow cooked over night.Chinese food was good esp. the spring rolls which I have a friend who makes and these were exactly like his.The owner gave me a complete tour of the place which seats 800+ yes 800. He told me saturday nite he is full. They even had private rooms for conference or weddings etc...Out door on the roof for the summer. Mind blowing. Everything is cook in house.I will be back.'
