b"Solid Sushi Spot in Henderson one of my favorite sushi rolls called the Johnny roll which is crab and cucumber wrapped in cucumber which is amazing the other is the jackpot roll that has these little flakes that make it crunchy and super tasty very good I would highly suggest anybody trying it. Rainbow roll is very fresh very good all of their sushi rolls are incredibly fresh and really tasty. The only downside to this place is that it's a way off the beaten path so you Gotta really want to go to it!"
