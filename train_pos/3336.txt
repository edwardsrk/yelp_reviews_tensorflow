b'This was by far our best coffee experience in Vegas. We just moved here a week ago and have been all of the top rated places. The employees were great atmosphere good and the coffee was awesome. My sister in law ordered a "golden milk" (?) I think that is what it was called. Super good too. We will be back this week to try the food'
