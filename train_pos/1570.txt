b"Hey, remember when this place opened?  It was like a revelation-- no longer do you have to go to Capp's Comics & be stared at like you were a criminal just because you were a 13 year old kid buying TMNT sourcebooks & Robotech VHS tapes!  Anyhow, I've never been a comic collector, so I can't speak to that, but I bought many an RPG manual here, once upon a time."
