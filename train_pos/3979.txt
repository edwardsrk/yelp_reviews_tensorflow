b'What a surprise.Walking up from the outside, I was a little disappointed about the place - thought it would be "outdoors", when it\'s in the center of a non-descript strip mall.But once through the automatic front doors, you\'re transported into a cozy wine celler at first, then through to the comfy restaurant/outdoor seating area.  Totally not what I had expected from the looks of the exterior.  From moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  You can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.  Had heard the food was good, which is why we came - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  A few dishes of note:-Buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that\'s poured on.  Not the case here.  Crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.  -Croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  Love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  Thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  Yum.-Lobster salad croissant: There\'s something really good about home made pastries and bread.  No corner cutting here.  Fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.  The kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.  Overall a great experience.  Highly recommended if you can stomach the drive into the heart of sSummerlin.'
