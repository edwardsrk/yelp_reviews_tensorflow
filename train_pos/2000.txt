b'I usually stop by Lee\'s Sandwiches before/after doing my grocery shopping at Lee Lee (right across the street) depending on how hungry I am.I like Lee\'s because they keep it very clean and organized inside.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches (not just banh mi) and other assorted goodies, plus a bevy of drinks to quench your thirst.Their ingredients and bread have been fresh every time I\'ve gone in, and what this results in is me stuffing my face, all the while going "nom nom nom", and thinking about the ladies from the Nom Nom Truck...oops sorry, I\'m daydreaming again!If you\'ve never had banh mi, you might think that it is weird to get a bbq pork sandwich with parsley, carrots, pickled radish and sliced jalapenos, but I implore you to try one.  You just might not go back to regular sandwiches.The only downside is that they only take cash, but then again, it ultimately saves you some dough (worth it!).  If you\'re like me and would rather just not eat than pay an ATM fee, you might not care, but they do have an ATM machine (or two, I\'m not sure) if you forget to bring cash.'
