b'I took my girls here for mani/pedis to celebrate a birthday. The facility is clean and bigger than it looks. They have the cutest pedicure chairs just for kids and they offered them ice cream! Celina did my pedicure and she did a great job. The hot stones are awesome with just the basic pedicure. They also have different "flavored" scrub for your feet. It is a little bit pricey but my kids loved it. My gel manicure wasn\'t the best and is already chipping les than a week later, but if you\'re going for pedicures, it\'s a great place.'
