b'I ate here twice on my trip to Las Vegas last weekend and enjoyed my meal both times. My uncle is a local and he goes here a lot. It was a very casual environment with lots of wood furniture and a few TV\'s (I\'m not a fan of TV\'s in a dining area, but my uncle appreciated it so he could catch the end of a game he was into.) The service was excellent. Of course, they knew my uncle was a regular so that probably factored in, but none the less, our server was lovey both times and she appeared to be just as friendly to other people eating there. The food was really good. I had the pastrami reuben the first time I  ate there, and the french dip on my second visit. Both were excellent. The pastrami didn\'t have too much tough connective tissue that some pastrami can have (like subway\'s for example...yuk). It was very meaty and flavorful. The bread was fresh and I had my sandwich with a side of fruit (it was mixed fresh cantaloupe and canned tropical fruit). The reuben was also very tasty and a good size. We split a piece of fresh carrot cake and the frosting was amazing! I make Alton Brown\'s carrot cake from scratch, which is very good, but this frosting even rivaled that recipe! I went back to buy a gift certificate for my uncle as a thank you for letting me crash at his place and the bar tender informed me that they had to call the owner? manager? to come in to get  it because the staff were "not authorized to sign for it". That was a little inconvenient, but it wasn\'t a terribly long wait and the bar tender was super friendly. She offered me a cold soda/water while I waited and checked on me a couple times. Overall, I thought the food was delicious and the people there were very nice. I recommend The Lodge if you are looking for a tasty, not too pricey bite to eat in a casual setting.'
