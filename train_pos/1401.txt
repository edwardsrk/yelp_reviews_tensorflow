b'Cafe zupas is one of my go to places for a healthy meal. There\'s so many options to choose from; I always have a hard time choosing only 2 options out of all of the salads, soups, and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a little small, so its best to get a sandwich as part of a "pick 2" meal. I love the soups. The creme brulee desserts are amazing! Sometimes I come here just for the dessert. My only complaints are that I don\'t think the chicken is very good quality, and half the time the lettuce in my salad tastes gritty like it was never washed. Ordering can be a little hectic if it\'s busy, but I generally get my food pretty quickly.'
