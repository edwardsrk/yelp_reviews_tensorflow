b"This has been on my bucket list for a while. I came here for restaurant week. My husband called for a reservation and we got sat right away. We were near a window which was nice. The server was friendly. I got the tots and my husband got the mussels. Both were delicious. After we got our appetizers, we waited a good 40 mins for our entrees. The server told us that the kitchen was backed up and apologized. No biggie. But when we got served our food, it was two completely different dishes. I got the meatball orzo and my hubs got the snapper. We were served chicken and something else. We told him it wasn't our order and the server looked confused. He took the food back and we waited again for our food. We were done eating our appetizers and saw a couple get sat. They got their appetizers and entrees all while we were waiting on our food. We finally got our food. We were both happy with our orders. The meatballs were delicious and soft. The orzo was cooked really well. My husband's snapper was very fresh and tasty. Since we were there for a long time we decided to get our desserts to go. The server said he was sorry again for the confusion and the comped our appetizers. We got the check and saw that the order was put in wrong that's why we waited so long. Overall, it was a good experience. The food made up for it. We would definitely come back to try their regular menu."
