b"I think Muddy's review hits the nail on the head. This gym is for getting in, working out, and getting out, and nothing more. It has most of the equipment that you need and it's generally in good repair (recently one piece was broken for over a week--too long in my book). There are some things I'd like to see (squat bar pads that aren't worn out, enough collars for all of the olympic bars -seriously, how much do those cost?!-, a decline bench, better selection of curl bars, etc.), but even with that, it's tough to beat the price. However, given that Golds has basically the same price with many more amenities, they should probably consider addressing some of these issues (including more sanitizer, paper towels, etc.) or they may lose customers. For now, I'll stick with F19."
