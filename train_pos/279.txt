b'Before deciding to make a long overdue trip to White Oaks, I was under the impression I was making a mercy mission to save this prohibition era speakeasy given the probable dominance by Crocker Park and sprawl to Avon Lake.  Boy was I mistaken.  The parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  In the end, probably a better choice.  The lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room\'s huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and Cahoon Creek.  The rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20\'s hideaway.  The bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, "healthy" drink pourer.  The lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor\'s order arrived.  We opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. Prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. We felt very good about our choices all around.  I was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, Cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.  It looks like White Oaks has not changed, serving excellent food and taking caring of its customers.  Definitely worth a re-review upon eating in the main dining room.'
