b"All time all star service every time (about 5) in the last two years and I gotta say their best menu item was the clams baked in beer. Wish they'd bring it back but I moved on. Their pretzels are amazing served with three different dippins and salty. The fish tacos are delightful, especially without the cheese. They have great drinks and friendly people open late at Tempe marketplace is a desirable thing when movies go late."
