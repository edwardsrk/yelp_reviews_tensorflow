b'I must have walked by this place a thousand times working on the square. Never knew what it was exactly. Came up in a search of "Asian " ? Amway, saw the reviews and walked over. The buffalo paninis with a side of black bean and corn salsa was very good. At $7 the price was fair, I think the yelp menu may be outdated. The desert case looked great and they have breakfast items also. There was a gift area too. Cool place and I\'m far from vegan.'
