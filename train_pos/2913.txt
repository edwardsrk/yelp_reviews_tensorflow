b"Hey, who ever rated these Dr. Low has some issues, step in filled out very little paper work, saw the nurse within 5 minutes back to the waiting area and was in at no more then 10 after.  Fast for how many people  were there.  Keep an opened mind everyone it's an urgent care facility not your local pub. Oh and anyone who rates something as a 1is just pissed anyways, no help to those kind of people!!!!!"
