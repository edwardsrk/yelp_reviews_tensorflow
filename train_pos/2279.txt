b"We dine out on average 4 nights a week. It can get pricey here in Sin City but when we found Habibs we found a gem.Being of Persian descent, I know what this food is supposed to taste like. Just the right spices, fresh vegetables and not too much oil. One of my all time favorites is Ghorm\xc4\x99 Sabzi. Its a Khoresht, which means a stew served over piping hot Basmati rice with a smidgen of Saffron.Habibs Ghorme Sabzi is FANTASTIC. Fresh and aromatic I was impressed.The other menu items we've tried were slightly hit and miss. Habib is a sweetheart of a man. The food here is a definite solid 4 stars."
