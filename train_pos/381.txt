b'Finally a good sushi place close to home. Ordered the double rainbow roll and it was fantastic. Well proportioned and presented. Also had the pad Thai and the coconut soup. Both well flavored but the soup could have been thicker. The staff were very friendly and the space was very clean. Will definitely visit again!'
