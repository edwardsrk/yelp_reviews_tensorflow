b"I like this place. Small restaurant with a bar (which is a plus, lol). Great lunch spot. The waitress helped and explained everything that I has question for. The food was yummy! I had the veggie pho soup my first have it. The flavor was really good. The tofu was lightly fried just wish is was a more. They had two TV's by each bar. We got our food fast"
