b"5 stars for Karissa! And also a big plus for the cute shop she's in! Cute set up and great vibes with a bunch of fun upbeat workers who (who can totally tell) love what they do!Before going to her I did a lot of research on hair stylists for the best quality and of course, price. Having such long thick hair I had to make sure I chose someone who I can trust and who does GREAT work for a reasonable price and I found Karissa!!!!! I showed her the picture of the hair I wanted and the goals to where i eventually want my hair to get. I knew she was going to get me to my goals based off the work I seen on her Instagram @karissacutshair. My hair is naturally dark so I know it's going to take sessions to get to my hair goal and for my first session she already got me super light and my hair still feels super healthy! We still have a few sessions to go to get to my goals but I am already in love with this first session so I can only imagine how the end results are gonna be!I will NEVER go to another hair stylist after this. And I will continue to refer people to her. Thanks Karissa!"
