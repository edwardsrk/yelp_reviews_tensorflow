b'First, let me say that I am a grazer.  I have big eyes, and I like the idea of being able to take little bites of a lot of different things.  So I am a fan of buffets, and I am a fan of tapas.  So I expected to be pleased with Johnny Smalls All-You-Can-Eat deal.That being said, I enjoyed this place more than I expected.  The quality of food is high, and the variety is great.  If you want to indulge in simple pleasures, they\'ve got chili cheese dogs, tater tots, and grilled PB&J.  If you want healthier cuisine, they have hummus, sashimi, and sea bass skewers.  Something for everyone!When you order the AYCE, they let you choose 2 plates at a time.  I was with my husband, so we got 4 plates at a time.  And don\'t judge... by the time dinner was over, we had sampled 10 different items.  If we had bought them all individually, our bill would have been well over $100.  But we paid $20 each... what a deal!My favorites:  Lettuce Cups - there was some kind of pomegranate molasses on it. Delicious.  Poona Tuna - it was described as "cherry limeade" flavor.  That sounded gross to me, but it was fantastic.Chicken &  Waffles - even if you\'re not a fan of the chicken, the maple-flavored waffle fries are worth it.Shorty - really tender short ribs.  Can\'t wait to go back and try some of the other items!'
