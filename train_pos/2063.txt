b"Small little caf\xc3\xa9, very simplistic and charming setup. I had the opportunity to speak to one of the co-owners and he was very polite and approachable, which is always appreciated when you visit a new place.I tried their smoked salmon sandwich, and had a simple filtered black coffee. Sandwich is exactly how you expect it to be, but the coffee was exquisite. I forget the name, but I remembered him describing it as imported from Nicaragua.There is also a small table for little children to accomodate young families when they come :)Note: you need to bring cash! They don't take credit. Can't remember if they took debit...?"
