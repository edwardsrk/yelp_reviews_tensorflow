b"Zo\xc3\xabs is my favorite place to go. The food is always tasty and healthy and there are variety of sides and dishes. Salad dressings on all tables are made in house and are great addition to the dish. Flat breads are good too but it's been a while I had it here and from what I remember they didn't blew my mind but they were good."
