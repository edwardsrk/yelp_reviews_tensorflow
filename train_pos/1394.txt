b"I like!  Here's my take:PROS:- Food is great. Is there a better traditional breakfast in Pittsburgh?  I doubt it!- The breakfast sandwich is my fave. Eggs, spicy sausage, and cheese on Mancini's bread. Just do it. - Service is very quick and efficient. Try to run out of coffee. You can't!- The menu is huge, lots of good stuff to try. CONS:- Its CASH ONLY, and it's now year 2018...  And that's all I can offer on the negative side. If you've had this on your list but still haven't tried it, DO IT NOW!  Then write a Yelp review!!!"
