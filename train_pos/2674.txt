b"I'm a big fan of self-serve yogurt places & Yogurtland is one of my favorites. The peanut butter & cookies and cream frozen yogurt are two of the ones I get pretty much every time & the guava sorbet is delicious ... hopefully a flavor that will be permanently added to the rotation! I have to give this place minus one star because although the frozen yogurt is good, I've found that some of their fruit toppings aren't fresh & there are other yogurt places that offer a larger variety. Get their mobile app to get offers such as 3oz frozen yogurt free or check in on yelp for a discount!"
