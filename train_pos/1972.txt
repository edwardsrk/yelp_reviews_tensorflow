b'I really enjoyed this place. It was cheaper than the nearby hotels, the little food spot right outside the habitat elevators was decent for breakfast sandwiches and pizza. Not to mention their rad staff there who were always pleasant! I had a stellar view of the high roller which looked beautiful at sunrise. I will definitely stay here again. Thanks, Flamingo!'
