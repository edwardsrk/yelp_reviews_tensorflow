b"Went for 'baseball' happy hour before the Indians game. Pretty solid spot for some interesting pregame eats. Beers were pretty cheap ($3). We got the Korean chicken nuggets, they were pretty tasty. We also got the charred shishito peppers which were awesome! 10/10 Highly recommend to a friend. we also got a trio of hummus. Red pepper and feta was good but the veggie was our favorite. The spicy was just alright. They also had this interesting shrimp chips to start! Would definitely come here again and would love to try sushi. Others there got it and it looked tasty!"
