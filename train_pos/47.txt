b"I found this restaurant to have a great atmosphere. Dark, perfect for a romantic date with your partner, not a first date. I see people giving it bad reviews for the fact that the sushi wasn't great, but really the place is called China Grill, what made you think that it is a good place to get sushi. That is like going to Pizza hut for a taco, doesn't make sense. Had a couple of drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees for under 80 bucks. Great deal."
