b'Very solid. More upscale than another good local eatery, Beef \'N Bottle, but the service, location, and food is great. The portions here are pretty hearty and the service we get is helpful and knowledgeable. I ordered the lamb and then requested mint jelly on the side. Hopefully, the chef didn\'t get offended, but I must have that lamb/mint combo!If you want to try on the cheap, look out for their LivingSocial deals, which I don\'t understand as it\'s already pretty popular.Their desserts are mostly the "mother\'s recipe" which makes them have a more local feel. No fancy desserts here, but the key lime pie was a refreshing finish to a recent meal. It had the perfect cheesecake consistency.'
