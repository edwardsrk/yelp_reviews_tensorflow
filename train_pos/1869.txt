b"The south point itself is a great bargain. I lost about a hundred in the casino and I wish they gave free internet but otherwise it's not a bad place. The arcade is fun though. The bowling alley and movie theater is also really nice. It has things for people of all ages. The room was also nice and we just got a basic king room but it had a flat screen in it. The BEST thing about south point though is Michael's Gourmet room. If you do anything, make a reservation and go! They were a little pricey but the lobster was the best! They also gave us a slice of strawberry shortcake for dessert because we were getting married. On top of that they gave us a huge bowl of fruit and a platter of chocolate covered fruit! I am so pleased my husband promised me we can go back for our one year anniversery."
