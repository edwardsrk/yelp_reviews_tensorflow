b"Attended the #nationaloysterday Oyster Tasting (with the drink pairing) at Walrus & the Pearl. My first time to DeSoto Central Market-- it's an awesome space with tons of potential. I wish it were busier!Our tasting was excellent. One-bite appetizer, first course, oyster course, and last course. Everything was super-fresh and absolutely delicious. The chef and shucker were really knowledgeable and fun. I would absolutely come back just for the oyster happy hour! (I also added pics, which speak for themselves.)Honestly, the only critique I would have is that the overall the service needs to work on its timing. I felt like diners at the tasting were often waiting around for the next plate to happen. Perhaps this is because it's still a relatively new space and is still working out the kinks. Thanks for a fun time :)"
