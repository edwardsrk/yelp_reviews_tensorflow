b"Wound up spending an entire afternoon here (thanks to snow), and was pretty impressed.It's a calm, mellow place, one of the few pubs in town I've actually found where I can carry on a conversation and hear myself think. An extra bonus was the fact they were playing swing and blues music - and their selection was so good that the swing DJ I was with was actually asking them for details on where they'd got the music and running songza for almost every song.The food is decent - nothing brilliant, but good and effective at filling you up (I ordered the quesedilla, and it was a bit skimpy on fillings, but ok). The staff are really relaxed and calm about you moving about the place (from table to pool  table to another seating area) and all ordering at different times. I really appreciated that the waitress wasn't fussed about us paying up immediately - she knew we were sticking around for the evening and didn't hassle us at all, but checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else.The fact that they let us host a blues dance every month here is also a huge bonus (and the reason I was there). A bar that's happy to give over a full section to a bunch of people enthusiastically flailing their arms around without charging us cover fees to do so? Major plus in my books. All in all, it's a great place to relax with friends and while away a lazy, snowy weekend day - and an amazing place to go and blues dance if you enjoy that too (second Sunday of every month)!"
