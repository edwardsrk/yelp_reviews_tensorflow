b"I have not yet reached the stage in my career where I can claim to be a flight lounge connoisseur, but I can comfortably say that AC Maple Leaf Lounge is one of the best ones I have experienced thus far. The lounge is well equipped with everything from showers, to the most recent issue of the Economist (which you can take with you)! The food options range from appetizers to hot food and to my surprise, the self serve open bar features more than a few top shelf items. Perhaps most importantly for frequent fliers, the lounge seating is definitely more comfortable than the average flight lounge, though I did not notice any beds/ recliners! Finally, I did not sense an air (!) of pretension and instead found the staff to be very courteous and accommodating.   Overall a classy and presentable flight lounge that provides a good first impression of the nation's biggest airport and city. Well done AC, at least you got this one right!"
