b"7-18-2015  I don't normally  write reviews for places that have been reviewed many times by others as I think it's redundant, but I recently ate lunch at Green Valley Ranch Buffet and was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the food was so much better than the other Station Casinos that I thought it deserved to be reviewed.  I visited on a Saturday and the Casino was very busy.  There was a line for the Buffet and it took about 20 minutes to get in.  I was seated and noticed that the chair was comfortable, something I hadn't noticed before.  I tried samples of various food.  The Chicken was cooked properly and had a good flavor.  The Mexican Rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  The BBQ sausage was good, and so were the BBQ Chicken Wings.  The BBQ Ribs were tender and tasty.  I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.  The service was good and my drink was filled as needed and dirty plates were removed in a timely manner.  The wait staff was busy but were friendly and asked me if I needed anything several times.  Sometimes it's the little things that make the difference or add to a pleasant dinning experience and I think GVR got it right this time."
