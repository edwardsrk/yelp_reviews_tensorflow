b'One of my favorite places to be in the GTA!  EC has tons of shops spread out over three floors for all tastes and styles.  A well represented food court for that quick bite to eat.  Convenient location to other major attractions in TO.  I would agree with others suggestions when taking the subway and use Queens, but hell I have made the walk from the Hockey Hall of Fame on a nice day!  Overall this center is clean and full of excitement!  If your in the GTA make it a point to stop by.'
