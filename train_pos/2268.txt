b"Ah Pinkberry, how you remind me of LA. Now if only they could bring an in and out over here I'd be set! This location is very nice for enjoying your froyo and people watching. And it's open pretty late so you could even get a snack after the movies next door!I usually just stick with original and pile the fruit on, but they have a good amount of flavors and huge variety of toppings for you to personalize your yogurt. They also change the flavors available sometimes to give you some variety since they only carry about 6-8 flavors at a time. The employees have always been really nice and helpful to me, which is appreciated since I tend to go during weird times like 9pm or during lunch."
