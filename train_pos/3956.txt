b"Stopped by Simons today based on the stellar yelp reviews. I also was thrilled to learn they had vegetarian options. My fianc\xc3\xa9 and I both had the Colombian Hot dog he had beef I had veggie. They were amazing! I got the combo with fries in a drink (you should too because the fries were fab)! I would definitely recommend - can't wait to go back and try another option!!"
