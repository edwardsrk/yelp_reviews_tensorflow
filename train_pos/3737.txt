b"NEW LOCATION. The original Miele's was in Tempe but recently moved to Mesa. (I didn't realize that when I called in my order so ended up going to the wrong location at first.) The Miele's that is still operating in the Tempe location is a totally different restaurant, not affiliated with the original. A bit confusing to customers? Indeed. And I don't think it's right for the fake Miele's to be piggybacking on the original Miele's reputation and essentially stealing its customers. But I digress. The REAL Miele's, now in Mesa, still has the same menu and lunch bargains that I have enjoyed for years, and they apologized profusely and genuinely for the location confusion. I loooove their garlic knots, lasagna, salad, and house dressing. Miele's in Mesa...I'll be back!"
