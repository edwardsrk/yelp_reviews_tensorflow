b'"This is a great place for ice cream and a general fantastic place for lunch.  They have some pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are in the mood for lunch.  But the sandwiches are kind of small.  The place also has a bunch of the "Family Circus" cartoons on the wall and write in the Sugar Bowl into the cartoons.  It\'s interesting.  They have sundaes, cones, banana splits, and their own original concoctions.  It\'s a great place for some dessert or for a whole meal.  There was a lot of pink though and I just wasn\'t feeling that."'
