b"If you are looking for something refreshing and delicious, this is your one stop shop! I've tried two drinks here and their delicious Japanese styled crepe that was filled with nutella and mouthwatering strawberries and bananas. There are other options as well. Their drinks are very customizable and if you think it's not perfect even after you get it, you can get it adjusted. The service is super friendly and the aura is welcoming. It's a clean environment where all the senses are in for a treat though the mesmerizing smell from the freshly made crepes, the refreshing sip from their drinks, to the perfect texture of their boba. I'm not from the area but anytime I'm on my way to Vegas, I'm stopping by first to get my boba fix. Try the Hawaiian Paradise. You won't regret it."
