b"Food was excellent! We ordered appetizers and I Loved the tuna tartar. It is a Hyde Park restaurant so your salads and side are separate but large enough to share. Lastly the deserts - altough I didn't think the had a wide selection the 4 of us order their banana cream pie.  It was a pie - NOT A SLICE OF PIE!  All 4 us had plenty."
