b"I came to Buca with some co-workers for a job well done celebration. I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food."
