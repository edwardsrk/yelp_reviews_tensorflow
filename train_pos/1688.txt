b"I love this place!  They always have the cutest dresses!!  They are usually pretty cheap, and are often easy to shop for as most of them are one size fits all with the stretchy waistband (and no it doesn't look as grandma-ish as that sounds! lol).  One star was taken off b/c while the employees are really friendly, sometimes they are overly friendly in trying to help you find what you need.  I don't mind suggestions, but I like to have some space while shopping so I don't feel so much pressure to say yes to things I don't want."
