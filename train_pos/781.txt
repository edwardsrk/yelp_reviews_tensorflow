b"Who knew a trip to the movies could be so high class?  I had two free passes for the Cineplex theatre so I thought I'd use them towards admission to the VIP theatre in Brossard.  The entrance is separate from the main theatre and it's 18+ since they serve alcohol here.You enter and you're in the lounge area which is complete with a bar.  They do have a small concession stand selling classic movie snacks (popcorn, candy, etc) but if you're dishing out for the VIP experience treat yourself and order from the bar.  They have a variety of appetizers and food like burgers so you could eat a full meal.  My boyfriend and I were there a little bit early so we ordered nachos and raspberry mojitos to enjoy in the lounge area.  The SCENE card gets you 10% off the food but not alcohol.  The other awesome thing about this place is the bathrooms.  They're all individual bathrooms and they're super clean. Seating inside the theatre is very comfortable and there are servers there to get orders and bring them to you up until the movie starts.  One thing I love about the VIP theatre is that they don't seem to show ads prior to the trailers and actual film.  That is always my biggest pet peeve about going to the movies.Admission is quite pricey at $18.75 a person so you can be sure I won't be coming to the VIP theatre every time I go to the movies.  I would definitely do it though on the occasional night where I feel like treating myself."
