b"If you are looking for decadence, Juliette's is your place.  Don't think about calories as you'll not be able to try any of their delectable treats.  Think about decadence and you are off and running.We had a mix of offerings and they were all fantastic.  From the made-t-order dipped homemade ice cream bar (caramel sea salt ice cream dipped in dark chocolate with orange rind chucks) or the lava cake that oozes goodness.  The lava cake has a side of ice cream with hot salted caramel sauce.  It was all soooo good!For an added bonus the cappuccino was huge, the milk light and frothy.  Soooo good."
