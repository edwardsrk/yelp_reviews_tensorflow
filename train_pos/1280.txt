b"This a nice mall in Chandler. There are quiet a few restaurants and stores around the mall which also makes it more appealing to visit this mallIt has 3 main department stores. Dillard's, Macy's, Nordstrom. Also has quiet a few Mallish  stores. The food is decent size and has quiet a variety of food options. The mall is well kept and has plenty of parking Overall a good option to do some shopping in the phoenix area. In my opinion after the  Scottsdale  fashion center, the best option Tip: Dillard's prices on its proprietary brands offer good quality items, but sometimes at regular price might be overprice, but when in sale or clearance, they are a bargain"
