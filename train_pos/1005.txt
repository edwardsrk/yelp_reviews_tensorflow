b'This is one of the nicest library in the area of Markham. When I walked in I am so glad that my tax money are putting into good use.Angus Glen Public Library is nice and roomy, with plenty of windows, skylights and high ceilings.There are plenty of seatings (sofas and seats) so you can just lounge around or you can use the private rooms if you want to have some privacy.There are good selections of current paperbacks and best sellers. Most of them are in great conditions and some of them brand news since the library is only 3 years old or so.I really enjoy spending a hour or 2 on my day off having a cup of coffee and lounging around using their wifi internet and read some magazines. Of course the best thing is the free wifi!!!'
