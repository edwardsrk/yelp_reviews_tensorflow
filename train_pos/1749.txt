b'My family and I have been here a bunch of times, it\'s always a fun time, nothing really bad to say about it...some of the entrees are a bit pricey, but I guess you\'re kind of also paying for the experience.  Lively and entertaining for both kids and adults alike, and I defy you not to start singing along with at least a few of the songs playing overhead!For being a Saturday evening, we didn\'t have to wait too too long to be seated (about 15 minutes).  Our server greeted us quickly and was sure to forewarn us that they were having issues with the computer system so things were running a little more slowly than usual.  We weren\'t in a hurry so it was okay, and we appreciated the heads-up.  He was friendly and attentive.  One of the managers also greeted us warmly as we waited for our meals.  We were pleased with the service.  This was my first time as a vegan patron and I was super happy to learn that their Veggie Burger is actually made with the vegan Boca patty...hooray!  So my dinner was a veggie burger, which wasn\'t the most delicious meal I\'ve ever had, but sure beat having to order a plain side salad or tiny dish of steamed veggies.  My husband opted for dessert only, but his brownie and ice cream dish might as well have been a meal, it was humongous.  Our daughter\'s burger was good sized and she loved it.  Everything was to our liking, no complaints.This isn\'t what I\'d call a super intimate environment, not a whole lot of privacy and the tables are pretty packed together, but it\'s a fun, energetic vibe.  Many times they have clowns, stilt-walkers, or balloon artists wandering the floor to entertain the kiddos during dinner.  It\'s also pretty decent "after hours" when the adult environment takes over...good drinks, good music, a dance floor for those who really get to feelin\' it...I\'ve had some good times here.Margaritaville is usually a pretty good bet, in my opinion.  Nothing bad to say, I like this place a lot.  I\'m a fan!'
