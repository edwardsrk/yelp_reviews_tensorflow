b"I really enjoy this market because it is just a quick 5 minute drive for some of my favorite produce that you can't find at the American Grocery stores. Well, you probably can, just not at the prices you'll find here at La Bonita During my last visit, the manager was standing at the door after he just hauled in some carts to greet his customers. My daughter was trying to show off her Spanish and the manager was very impressed. It is nice to see someone from management helping out the team & still greeting shoppers with a friendly smile. I usually check out the produce, because who doesn't love cheap, good quality fruits & veggies?! Another favorite is the meat section. I occasionally like to have a fiesta con carne asada con mis amigos! So I usually stop here for my meats, rice, beans & other yummy goodies. I love the marinated flank steak! La Bonita definitely blows any other store out the water as far as quality. The workers are definitely extremely hard working & always helpful. My Spanglish isn't all that great, but I've never had any issue with any product I needed. Plus, it's a nice way to brush up on my conversation skills. They definitely appreciate my effort! And last but not least, the fruit juice bar! You can select your own fruits for them to juice right in front of you. I opted for the watermelon & it was quite a treat for a hot day. It's conveniently located in Spring Valley on Rainbow & Flamingo across from the Sprout's Market. If you're looking for quality, authentic produce & meats, make a quick trip in!"
