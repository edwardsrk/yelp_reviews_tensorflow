b"Been coming here for years. Great, prompt and friendly service. Prices have gone up over the years, but that's expected with inflation, but the quality of food has remained the same - great.The reason for the 4 star rating is I've noticed the last few visits we've heard nothing but Adele music. Seriously, that $h!t is depressing to listen to when you're trying to enjoy all day breakfast. Cut her, and go back to the variety music you had before. This is not enjoyable and I'll have to seriously consider going somewhere else if this continues. I'd be a Shane cuz I drop at least $50 - $60 a visit.I hope the management reads this. Your choice in music is what's giving you the less than perfect rating."
