b"My family have been regulars at this place for the past five or so yrs and it never disapoints.Staple dim sum with a few unique items that are fairly priced. Steamed items always freshly made on site and not from frozen like many downtown dim sum joints.One additional bonus you don't get with many Chinese restaurants...good service. They're busy so you might not get 5 star treatment...but you won't get attitude when asking for more tea/hot sauce etc.Food portions have been shrinking a bit in the past little while. Might be their answer to inflation. Don't expect it to be quiet either....not the place to do trancendental meditation or anything. Overall a good solid TO dim sum."
