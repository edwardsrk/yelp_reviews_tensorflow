b'I once walked by this place and dismissed it because it looked boring from the outside. I wholeheartedly regret that decision after coming here during my burger binge week visit!! They were offering the Smokehouse burger for $5 for the Yelp GTA Burger Week, and at an original price of $13.50 it was such a goood deeaaaal. It had caramelized onions, peppercorn sauce and smoked cheddar. For me the peppercorn sauce was the star of the burger. So flavourful without being overpowering or salty, the sauce really brought the whole burger together for me. I also really like the fresh veggies in the burger for the simple fact that they actually tasted really fresh and made me feel less guilty about the state of my narrowing arteries. The buns were also awesome and did not dissolve into messy oblivion with the peppercorn sauce!The #bestbossever also treated me to some sweet potato fries to share and THEY WERE THE BOMB! Sooooo crispy on the outside, and the sauce that came with it also had the perfect kick of cinnamon and spice to compliment the taste of the sweet potato. I intend on coming back to try more of their burgers, sides, and oh yea they apparently do great wings too. So yea. I basically have to come back for everything!'
