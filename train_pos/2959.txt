b"Bannock, another great place owned by the O and B brand! This is a great affordable place attached to the bay with a good selection of items to choose from. The food reminds of items you can get from your moms kitchen. From macaroni and cheese, to kale Caesars to chicken pot pie. The service is on key, they are very helpful and quick with their service. I go at lunch all the time and they definitely work within my hour! The food is delicious, if you're having a bad day at work or need that pick me up of comfort food this is your go to place. Just watch out! The place is pretty small so it can get crowded. Try to make reservations if you're going at lunch, as they always get a rush. Food is great!! You can easily get a good meal for under 20.00 here."
