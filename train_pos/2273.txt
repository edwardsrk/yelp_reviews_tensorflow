b'Your experience with Top 1 is subject to how you order.  If you order la carte, it is pricey.  This rings true regardless of which entr\xc3\xa9e you order.  If you order a combo set, you are in for a reasonably priced treat.We ordered a $58 combo for dinner.  It consisted of an appetizer, a vegetable dish, a Drunken Rib, and a 2.5lb crab, stir fried "under bridge" style (\xe6\xa9\x8b\xe5\xba\x95\xe8\xbe\xa3\xe7\x82\x92\xe8\x9f\xb9).  There are many things that I\'d like to talk about, so I organize my review in point form:1) In the menu, it says this combo is for 2 people.  Pure lie.  It easily feeds 3.  2) The highlight of the combo is the crab.  The crab we had was meaty and sweet, indicating that it was fresh.  I estimated that there was over 1lb of garlic in the dish.  Yet the garlic aroma and spice was not sharp, indicating the garlic slices were dry when they cooked them.  The crab was nicely fried.  There was a delicious coat of flavours on the shell.  Lick it, eat it, whatever, just don\'t miss it.  This dish had wok air, which is what under bridge spicy crab is famous for.3) The other thing the under bridge spicy crab is famous for is the spiciness.  Top 1\'s version didn\'t taste spicy to me.  It was nowhere as spicy as the dai-pai-dong version.  You should ask for extra spicy if you prefer it hot.4) The Drunken Ribs were in essence rib bites and taro deep fried in black vinegar.  It had a harden coat on the outside.  It was another wok air dish.  It tasted average, because the meat needed more tenderizing.5) The vegetable dish in the combo was small.  It was indeed 2-person portion.  6) Services was minimum considering the price range.  I expected a change of plates, since they were full of crab shells.  Never happened or offered.  When someone did wait on us, s/he was polite, effective and efficient.7) The bill came with 10% tips added on.  The calculation was clear.  Someone wrote in Chinese that the final amount was "all in".  If you cannot read Chinese, you can clarify with a server.8) I like the interior decoration.  It is a funky mix of batman statue, fortune cat doll, bookshelves, European armour, Chinese emperor attire, owls, and stuff animals.  Consider yourselves forewarned.Top 1 serves a few unique seafood entr\xc3\xa9es.  Our family will likely revisit in a bigger group to try other seafood combos.  I won\'t recommend ordering al carte here, however.'
