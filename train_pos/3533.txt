b'English Laundry has landed! A favorite label by many stars not for the name but the style, cut, and fit. I was excited when I was walking around Town Square in Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem of a store. "Could it be? Yes, it is THE English Laundry brand! And they\'re having a sale!!! BONUS!Their cut and sew button up shirts come pre-tailored and tapered to contour your body for a very nice looking fit. Everything they have is quality.Stylish bowties will turn any nerd into desired.And if they have their men\'s fragrance in stock, you\'re in luck! Buy one or two. They usually sell out very quickly.'
