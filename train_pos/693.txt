b"Came here to try their charcoal lamb skewers; in my opinion, didn't have enough flavour, lacking cumin taste.. Which is really easy to fix.Tried a whole bunch of items on their menu, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese fried chicken, taco wasabi, calamari, chicken wings, beef skewers, Chinese sausages, rib skewers, gizzards... I felt the flavouring needed more work.. But that's just my opinion. Some of my friends said it was good and others felt the same as me.Been here a few more times (this is the only Asian style bar food on Main St). The food, in my opinion did get better. Can't wait till summer to come here with friends and just sit on the patio to drink beer and eat skewers while checking out Main Street!! Will definitely be back and recommend to others.Overall experience is good, Korean waitresses are hot!!Nice place to throw darts, watch sports on tv, and chill out on Main Street!!!Once summer comes around, I'm sure the smell and sight of the lambs skewers will just sell itself!!!Super happy they have this type of food on Main Street now!! Price is not bad considering its Main Street. Love chilling on Main Street in the summer time!!"
