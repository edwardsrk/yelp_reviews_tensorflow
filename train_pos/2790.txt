b"Stopped in jasons deli for a deli club sandwich and there was nobody to take my order, I asked if they were short staffed and was informed the workers just didn't show up to work, then was told they are closing July 31 for good, the deli club I ordered was very good with  very tender and smoky turkey and ham on toasted wheat, so I guess the metro center jasons deli is next closest if you still want jasons deli"
