b"Wonderful restaurant.  Service was the best we have had in recent memory.  Michael was exceptional, friendly, talkative.  Definitely had a passion for what the chef creates.  Just about perfect.  As for the food, pretty darn good.  I had the Scottish salmon and at first thought it looked a bit small but it was just the right amount of perfect.  Super succulent with an excellent quinoa radish and edamame mix.  I was actually sort of surprised by how good it was.  Went with the advice of the waiter and couldn't be happier.  The lady had the chicken which was probably the best preparation I have had.  Super moist, served on an awesome bacon stuffing....could have eaten a bowl of stuffing all on its own.Since it was her birthday we had the s'mores.  Which the house comped; a total surprise and it really just rounded the night out to perfection."
