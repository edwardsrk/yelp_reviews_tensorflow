b'I have no idea of the history of this place, but it has one. They also use the same sourdough starter for the pizzas for about 50 years. The waitress explained this too me, but all i know is the pizza turned out pretty good. Our version had giant pieces of pepperoni, a dabble of grilled jalapeno and purple onion. This not really NY style as I was barely able to fold the thing, but it was all about that sourdough crust. In a surprise though, the pizza did not taste good reheated. Another surprise was the "check in" on facebook and get an order of chicken tenders for $2. These were small, hot and crunchy little tenders which were quite good. They have an upstairs with games and of course all the funky stuff is fun to check out. Half the patio is covered also, so that is a good thing.'
