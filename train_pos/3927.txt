b"Incredible local bakery!  At first you may have some sticker shock but once you factor in the huge portions and that it's organic ingredients, it more than evens out!  A brownie can last you 2-3 days easily.  The lemon bars are a diabetic coma waiting to happen if you eat in one sitting.Vegans are accommodated for, however being non-vegan the items I've tried that are vegan friendly are tasty but crumbly.  Not sure if that's due to the lack of a binding agent such as eggs.  Tastes good but missing the mouthfeel that a carnivore like myself expects.  Bottom line, Miss Lauren has a great thing going with her little, diverse bakery!"
