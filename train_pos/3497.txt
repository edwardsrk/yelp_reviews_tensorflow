b"This is a gym that takes a more personal approach to fitness and nutition.  The trainers will tailor your workout to your goals, take into account your injuries and provide a lot of encouragement.  The members are very welcoming and friendly.My session today was led by the owner, James Wong.  He tailored the workout for me, since it was my first time and I had a lot of stiffness and injuries to work around.  I really appreciated that.  This is my first time of ever joining a gym like this so I really didn't know what to expect.  What I found was a lot of personal and individual attention to your specific goals and fitness level.  My package includes an initial assessment, unlimited training and yoga sessions, The Fit Labs Diet and Exercise Journal, The Fit Labs Diet guide, up to 2 sessions per month with a Fit Labs Coach and unlimited email support. Even after my workout today, James texted me to find out how I was feeling and see if I needed anything.  That's amazing personal attention!  It's going to be fun working out here and meeting new fitness friends!"
