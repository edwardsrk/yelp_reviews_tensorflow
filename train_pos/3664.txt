b"I stopped by at Prime tonight after a grueling 9 hour business meeting.  When I arrived, I was seated at a great table close to the window where I could see the Bellagio Fountain Show in the background.  After I ordered my Whiskey, I had a chance to truly appreciate the beauty of this restaurant.  The decor is very upscale, romantic and very ornate.  A great place for a power business dinner or a date.For dinner, I ordered the Butternut Squash Soup, Bone-in Rib-eye Steak, Potato Gnocchi and their Banana Tart for desert.My entire meal was amazing.  Each dish was perfectly prepared and super yummy!  If you want a great steak dinner in one of Las Vegas' most romantic places, come to the Prime!The food, fountain show and sexy decor rocks!!"
