b"Eating at the soft open right now... renovated so it's bigger. Truly the yakitori here is absolutely amazing. Has that taste that you can only get from a charcoal grill.The gindara daikon was done just right. The fish was soft, flavourful and moist; the Damon had soaked up the base and was just wonderful.Have been here before and would continue going."
