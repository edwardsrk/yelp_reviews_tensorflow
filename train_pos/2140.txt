b'Not dissimilar from Janey\'s, Firecreek Coffee Company is exactly what a coffee house should be.  With Firecreek, after speaking with the roaster, you can tell their serious about their beans.  Not only is the coffee solid, but they have a great variety of loose leaf teas; my favorite was their mint tea.The inside was clean and simple.  It\'s great to sit inside because there\'s a lot of natural light pouring in. Sitting outside is nice too.  I think this is one of the perks of going to restaurants and coffee shops in Cave Creek/Carefree; you get away from the artificial "Pleasantville" feel of most of the prettyfied places of the PHX metro area.  Places like Arcadia Farms in Scottsdale and Nobuo downtown are some exceptions.Their baked goods here are delightful and fresh.  The breakfast burrito is pretty good also.  What\'s nice is the chef really wants to make the customer happy and is willing to change things up for you.  Not that you want to be the pain who asks for a gizillion substitutions, but it\'s nice to know if you have a friend who\'s a vegetarian, the chef is flexible.The staff are down-to-earth and kind hearted people.'
