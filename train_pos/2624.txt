b'Food is good, filled up the 3 men in our party (one was a 3 year old who saw his choc. chip pancakes and couldn\'t help but ooh and ahh).  My son and husband both had some hefty omelets and very nice looking hash browns while I was more than pleased with my fit and healthy egg white omelet, fruit and toast!Staff was great-our waitress was wonderful.Plus, our grandson was very impressed with all the wooden bears-especially getting to sit behind the tree of bears and see their "tushies"!'
