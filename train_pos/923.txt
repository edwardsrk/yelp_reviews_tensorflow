b"I love trying new places and the number one thing I love about her is that she is the same. We were both 3/4 this time. I loved the intestines, the liver, and the beef but wasn't fond of the heart. She loved the calamari, the squid, and the shrimp but didn't care for the fish meatballs. Which were delicious! The heart picture is in the comments. I love us...Amber Alchemy. It was great!"
