b"The best part of the Hyatt is the staff! Wow, so impressed with the staff! In particular, Aubrey and Han. These two know how to make people feel very welcomed. There was another lady that was also SUPER! I was staying for the teacher's convention and my roommate accidentally took a bottle of water out of the mini bar. She then tried and tried and tried to replace it. When the bill came, I had several charges for this...I went and spoke to the front desk and the lady (whose name I didn't get) immediately took the charges off. She also made sure that my bags and car (which was in valet) were taken care of, as I had to stay later because I was also working  the event. The rooms were very clean and room service was sooooo yummy!My only complaint was when I went to pick up my car from valet. I gave my ticket to the tall gentleman (looks a little like Scott Disick for the Kardashians haha ;)) told me it would be 5-10 minutes. After 55 minutes, I finally went to say something. Han had just started his shift. He was extremely apologetic and pretty much snapped his fingers and my car was there. He then continued to offer me bottles of water for my ride home. He was very kind!  Overall. It was a great experience :) They also tend to have wine and watermelon infused water in the lobby...which is a nice touch!"
