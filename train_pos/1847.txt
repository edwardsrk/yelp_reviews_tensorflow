b"Pretty limited experience at this pub at the corner of King and Bathurst, but each time has been very good.I used to work just up the street from here so if we finished early enough, myself and my co-workers would swing by for a cold beer or two before last call. Beer prices were good and the taps clean, which is a plus.As for the food, I've had the burger, wings and pasta, and all were very good. I was especially impressed with the pasta (they have pasta night on Tuesdays, and I believe it's $5 a dish for either spaghetti with meatballs, lasagna or fettuccini with wine sauce). For such a good price and given that it's pub and not a pasta place, the quality is impressive.The owner and staff are all very friendly. Prices are good. I believe they also have a burger special on one of the weekdays as well. Worth the trip!"
