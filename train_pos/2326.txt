b'We lived here for 15 months.  The property manager was great to work with.  We had to submit a couple of maintenance requests, but they were all taken care of within a day or two.  We only moved out because my wife gave birth to our second daughter and we needed more room.  I would definitely recommend the Arbors for a couple or small family.'
