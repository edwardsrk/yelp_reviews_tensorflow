b"With this summer weather it's difficult to cook at home.  My husband and I are going out for lunch and dinner during the weekends and are always looking for local places to eat. Today we felt like burgers so we decided to visit Harvey's.We shared the big burger & fries and it was not bad at all. After dinner I asked him if he'd come back and he surprisingly said yes (he's a picky eater).He said he would have rated Harvey's 4.5 but that he wasn't pleased the cook was the server and the bartender."
