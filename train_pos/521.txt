b"When I want to treat a guest out to korean bbq I usually stay away from all you can eat mainly because of the quality and the service of the restaurant. My favorite was hobak before 8oz came along. It really depends on what you desire for your meal.If you want pretty good meat then I would tend to lean to hobak. However what I really like about 8ounce was for multiple reasons.1. It takes reservations 2. It's super clean and modern3. The staff are way more friendlier4. Side dishes wise, I like 8ozWe ordered the large combo because we had a party of 4 and it was plenty! One thing though... they do not allow another refill of the egg souffl\xc3\xa9 which happens to be my favorite but o well. They also have this dessert in a martini for 7$. Totally overpriced but it does taste good. We got both the chocolate and the green tea and it's like the snowflakes shaved ice."
