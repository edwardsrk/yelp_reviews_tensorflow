b'Great little spot.. I hate the location.. I feel like it is in the middle of nowhere and very much a "destination location" as nothing else is around... but I understand that is the "Maltese" part of Toronto so I get it!  I just wish they would move south to Bloor!! :)  Pastizzi is great, I have been coming here for years with my dad and grandparents so it is very much a nostalgic experience to say the least.  I also wish they would have more rice in the oven or pasta in the oven readily available.. I feel like if they moved to an area where there is a lot more foot traffic they would flourish & be able to have these types of dishes ready as they would probably be busier and no food would go to waste!  Not that it isn\'t successful.. I know it is!  I also wish they took debit... no one carries cash anymore!!   I know this may sound like a negative review its really not.. I love this place the food is great & the staff are amazing... I just am not a fan of the location & the fact they don\'t take debit!'
