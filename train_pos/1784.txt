b'The menu here is limited, they only serve beef and mainly pork for their BBQ and also have a few other dishes. The bbq came with lettuce and green onions which was a great way to make yourself a mini lettuce roll. Ordered both beef choices and the pork belly. The beef was great but the pork was something left to be desired. With your order they give complimentary side dishes, a nice bean sprout soup and a steamed egg dish. Personally I have had better steamed egg dishes, because I found this one to be very soya sauce heavy. But their other side dishes were phenomenal especially the pickled radishes. The servers are extremely nice and attentive. This place gives a more grungy kind of feel with cute cartoon pieces and vinyl record decor, and the chairs almost look like upside down garbage can barrels while their bbq rests on top of a larger barrel. Overall great experience, just wish they had more of a selection. Would definitely come back when and if in the area but not as a destination.'
