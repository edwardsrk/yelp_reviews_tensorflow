b"I like this place very much, and find it to be reasonably vegetarian-friendly. You have to know what to order, though, to get the best deal, because some things are just plain overpriced.You should definitely stop in for lunch and get the Piccola Gusto menu - it is a great deal and is plenty of food. You get to try so many awesome things, and it's possible for every component to be vegetarian! It is a way better deal than ordering any one item - they are pretty expensive.I've also been to a dinner party catered there (in the nice outdoor tent area), and they had a great antipasti platter and various pastas we could try. There were actually multiple vegetarian options, which I really appreciated.I would give this place a 5, but it would be nice if the vegetarian options experienced as much rotation/creativity as the meat ones. I love the mafaldine, but it is consistently the only veg pasta on the menu. But service, ambience, and food are all great."
