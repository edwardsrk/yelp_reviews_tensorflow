b"when I'm in the mood for fake Chinese food this is the place to go.  Unfortunately they no longer serve pork so the char siu is no longer on the menu.  So disappointed about that.  i'm not sure why they no longer sell it because the employees don't seem to know themselves.  I do love the fact they offer free samples so you can see if you will like it before you order it.  I do wish the prices was a little cheaper but you can get 2 meals out of a 2 item combo.  Other than the no park, they seem to have good customer service and are very friendly which is a plus."
