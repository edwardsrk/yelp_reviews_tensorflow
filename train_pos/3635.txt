b'This place is AMAZING!!!! Excellent service, delish food.  I ordered ramen. It was the only place open past 9 on a Monday. I am so glad we came. The Ramen was so flavorful and yummy. I ordered it with the egg. Normally when I order Ramen they give me a hard boiled egg, not here! That sucker cooked with the heat of the broth....for me it was too mushy since I like my eggs hard boiled but everything was amazing... our waitress was super nice and had amazing hair! Lol.... I will be coming back, excited to taste what else is on the menu.'
