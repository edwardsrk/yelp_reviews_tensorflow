b"Great place for groups fresh food all homemade pasta lots of variety and a good amount of seating. This place does not have waiters so it is a seat yourself and order based on what you wants type of mentality. You use cards to charge what stations you want to eat from and at the end everything is put together into one bill. The food is good and caters to pretty much everyone's wants and needs I had the surf and turf pasta with a little bit of beef and some shrimp over with a white sauce it was good however I think the traditional pasta dishes are a safe bet and have never treated me wrong. The bar is fully stocked wine is good quality inn does not cost an arm and a leg and they always have heavy pours. This is good for families or four individuals I would recommend this place to most people."
