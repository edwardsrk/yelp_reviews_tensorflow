b"Are you ready to be transported? Because that's what will happen when you order this food, transported to a euphoric state of pure deliciousness. So I ordered the dumplings and the hunan two. First things first you can order chow menu instead of rice, which was a hard decision but I went with the chow main. The staff is very friendly and there is a very cute fish tank while you wait, anyways pick up the food and get home. This stuff is amazing. The red bell peppers in here are amazing. They are fresh and lightly saut\xc3\xa9ed, as well as the broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. This is a great portion for what you are ordering and the meat is nice big slices. The sauce is this spicy brown concoction with lil Brown beans that are perfectly spicy. The chow mein is seriously amazing and also a great side size portion. These dumplings have to be some of my favorites in the valley and I have tried my fair share. This is incredibly worth it, better than most Chinese take out by far. It isn't your typical take out. Seriously give this place a try."
