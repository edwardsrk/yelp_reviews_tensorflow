b'I\'m not a rookie of Famous Dave\'s - the BBQ here is great and the variety of sauces gives you something for everyone\'s taste. We weren\'t so hungry that we felt like pigging out so we ordered the two item special, added another side dish to it, and split the entire thing. They need to put more two person specials on the menu. The 2 for 2 isn\'t they anymore but I heard another table ask and was able to order it anyway. Ask questions about the side dishes. I must have missed in on the menu but they had two types of Mac and Cheese, one with jalapeno peppers. What a terrible addition to Mac and Cheese. When we asked about it they switched it for "standard" without a problem. No complaints at all about the service - first class every step of the way and always with a smile. The total was about $30 so they\'re not inexpensive. Although it doesn\'t have the outstanding taste of an outdoor BBQ with the the family recipe, their BBQ beef is always tender and delicious. I\'ll keep looking for the genuine BBQ taste, but until I find it we\'ll keep coming back.'
