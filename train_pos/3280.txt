b"Probably the friendliest and most knowledgeable staff in town, very fair prices and a local neighbourhood gem. They even have a self wash dog station people can use for a low fee. They have tons of products ranging from dogs to birds, and even offer delivery which is great if you can't haul that giant bag of dog food home."
