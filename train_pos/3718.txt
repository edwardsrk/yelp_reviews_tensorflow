b"I have been going to the museum since I was little, and I've been completely spoiled by it! I've visited many other museums but nothing can rival it, the modern art collection is superior to the Tate Modern, the antiquities selection (especially the armory) is better than the Louvre. The CMA benefits from great editing, every room flows from one to another and every piece is beautiful and selected for a reason. You don't have to fight through the crowds in order to see pieces, and there's a relaxed feeling- you can come and go as you please and take the time necessary to truly appreciate an amazing collection."
