b'The Bronze Cafe\' is my favorite little gem in town!  From the chef,  the staff and food you will never be disappointed!  Everything is made Fresh with the highest quality products!  I have dined in,  taken out and catered and without fail each time was phenominal! You will never be disappointed!  They offer GF, Veg, Vegan, Healthy and homemade.. try a sandwich or make a sandwich into a salad.. the "bizzness" is YUMMY and the vegan "cheescakes" are to die for! Make sure you try this little cafe\' that will surely become your favorite place too!'
