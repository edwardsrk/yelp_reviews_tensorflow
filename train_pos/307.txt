b'Dim sum - Excellent choice, fresh ingredients. Be adventurous, try the rice noodle - beef, pork, or shrimp. The coconut bun is stab-your-neighbor good. Good price as well. The staff is hit or miss, friendly one visit, rude the next. I do not always care about that, though, as long as the food is good.Menu - Noodles are great. House chow fun with gravy and e-fu noodle are great. Otherwise, go wild. Pick your favorite choice and then try everything around it for fun.(5 stars on good staff days. 3 stars on really bad staff days. Average is 4 stars)'
