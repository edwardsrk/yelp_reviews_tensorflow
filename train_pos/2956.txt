b"I was walking and noticed this cafe shop in the distance.\xc2\xa0 It was cold out and a few other places hadn't opened yet so I stopped in to get a bite to eat. The place is similar to a Starbucks. The had a handwritten menu of items they sold such as meaty sandwiches, grilled cheese, muffins, coffee,\xc2\xa0 latte's etc. I ordered a latte and asked if they had caramel\xc2\xa0 (Lol) the lady said no. The sandwiches looked good and fresh but they were pretty big. I asked the lady if they serve half sizes, she said no so I ordered a grilled cheese instead. My latte was made right in front of me and served hot. The grilled cheese was ready about 3min later and was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had! As others came in I noticed several customers ordered grilled cheese sandwiches also. If you're in the area check them out."
