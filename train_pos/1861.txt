b"Took my twins here on their 4th birthday along with my 6-year-old. It is small and extremely clean. Not too busy, perfect. It was nice to be able to relax on a comfy sofa while the kids got their energy out. It's great that they allow in outside food and drink in. My only complaint is that they don't sell anything to snack on or drink. There are water fountains available for the kiddos, though. Pricing is great, too.Tip: bring socks. Everyone must wear socks, even mom and dad."
