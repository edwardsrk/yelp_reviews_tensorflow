b"Hilton is off the strip but accessible by the monorail.  Came in a few years back for a conference, and we brought family there for the Star Trek adventure.  Today, the place is quiet, no one is up yet and the casino floor is empty.  For a small price, we can ride the rail, stop and get off when you want and then get back on.  Parking is free at the Hilton, so the cost of the rail is all you'll be out.  Then you can beat the traffic jams at the major properties with limited access."
