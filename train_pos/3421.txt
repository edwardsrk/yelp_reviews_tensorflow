b"Stopped by this Dave's around 3 on a Saturday for a late lunch.  Food was awesome.  Service was great!   My husband had never been to a Dave's and said he would definitely be back.  We sat at the bar and played Keno.  My husband won $400.   Pulled Pork, Brisket, Beans are just some of our faves.  Give em a try!"
