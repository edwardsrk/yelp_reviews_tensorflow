b"I first went to Larry about 10 years ago because it was close to my office. He's worked on multiple cars and SUVs of mine. He takes care of my Lexus convertible like it's his wife's. He's done big and small jobs and is always fair with his pricing. His wife runs the office and is a complete pleasure!"
