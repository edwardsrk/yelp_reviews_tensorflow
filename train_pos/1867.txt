b'This is probably the best BBQ place in the Champaign/Urbana area. The corn bread is far from ordinary with chunks of smoked pork. The twice baked potato side was awesome. The pit beans were just okay. Now for the meat, I had turkey, pulled pork and brisket. They were all very good; the pork was my favorite. The sauces were tasty and unique. They were a little skimpy on the amount of the sauce you got. The place is a typical bar and BBQ joint, but clean enough. It was fairly chilly though. The hostess started off our visit bad enough that we almost left without ordering because she sat us ahead of another party and then later asked us to move.  She said that she called a different name, implying we somehow tried to pull something over on her.  However the waitress redeemed her and the food was worth it.'
