b"I had a two hour time break to kill in between meetings and stopped by TiCoz. I've been here many times, but I had the best customer service experience I've ever had. Not only was it Taco Tuesday, so I had my choice of delicious Tacos, but my server was attentive, but not overbearing. The perfect restaurant experience and food to die for."
