b"Sat down starving from the trip in to Vegas and was greeted by a wonderfullly friendly wait staff that knew thier menu inside and out- I love that!  The bread baskets are a meal in themselves since each type of bread is delicious you have to try them all.  Ordered the salmon which could easily be the best meal I've ever had in Vegas and maybe the U.S.  Pricing is steep but no steeper than any other dining establishment in Vegas.  If you're in town make it a point to go there."
