b"It was a beautiful 75 degree day today, made even more perfect with a wonderful lunch outside at Joe's Farm Grill.  We got there early to avoid the line (which rapidly appeared around 11:40am) so our food was ready very quickly after ordering.My chicken pesto sandwich was wonderful - the meat was juicy and the peppers and mushrooms were fresh and yummy.   Others in the group enjoyed pizza, burgers, and fantastic sweet potato fries which I couldn't help sampling.  Everything looked and smelled great.My only complaint was the condiment area which was very messy with spilled ketchup and ice everywhere.  They needed to send someone out to clean it up more promptly.   Otherwise, Joe's Farm Grill was an excellent lunch experience (as they usually are)!"
