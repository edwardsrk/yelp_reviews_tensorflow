b'Came here for a friends bachelorette.  I ordered the Salmon with a Ceasar Salad and they were both good. We shared the chocolate cake that looks like a pot of flowers. Everything was edible. It was too pretty to break it apart!There was a huge floral decor in the center to make the place feel more upscale. The staffs were attentive and friendly. Our server was very patient with handling our large party of 12 and when the food was brought to the table, they knew who ordered what.  I appreciate that the manager  came by our table make sure we were having a great experience at the restaurant.'
