b'Wow! This place has changed! I used to work at the Scottsdale Air park and would pop into H&M a few times a week at lunch. Then there were only a few stores goin on. But now! There are all kinds of placed to shop eat and be entertained. We went tot he Yelp event at SOL Cocina last night, great new place. They just opened and I cant wait to go back again! Great tacos, and lots of tequila. They even have a yummy Skinny Margarita.Brio has a great lunch!Stingray has some fabulous sushi! They has these great specialty rolls that you cant find anywhere else. I cant remember the names but there is one with pico shrimp and this yummy creme, gotta try it!True Food is awesome! Their Spaghetti Squash Casserole is out of this world. They even have these great organic liqueurs that you can put in your cocktails. They shopping is great too, Express, GAP, H&M, Nike and tons more. They even did a great job with the parking, two garages and lots of street parking.'
