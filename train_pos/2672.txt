b'Really good place! I\'m glad other people talked about the parking situation or I never would\'ve found it.They have different specials every night... I went last night so it was margarita Monday and the margs were four dollars off (so $5 instead of $9). We got the guacamole and it was very tasty. The "I\'ll have what she\'s having "tacos were very good as well.'
