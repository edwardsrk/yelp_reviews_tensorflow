b"Great food, probably twice the price of most Chinese restaurants, but worth every penny! We were four and the bill came out to $184 excluding tip. I'm generally not a fan of Chinese food, as I find it very greasy and can never eat much of it. But at Orchid\xc3\xa9e, my stomach was a bottomless pit! The food is practically grease-less! And I've never had food served directly to my plate by a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. We ordered general tao tofu, shrimp with vegetables, pan-fried noodles, duck pancakes and sauteed lamb with shallots. Every dish was a delight!The service was excellent, except  my waiter was a little too loud-talking, like a close-talking Asperger with a lisp, and accidentally spit on me at one point. Also, when we were trying to leave, my friend lost her coat-check ticket and the coat-check girl would not let her have her coat and did nothing to remedy the situation. She did not call over the manager or have my friend pay and/or sign a waiver form for losing her ticket. I got fed up and grabbed my friend's coat from the girl. Orchid\xc3\xa9e needs to put in place a lost-ticket policy for situations like these - I'm sure most people have lost a coat-check ticket at least once in their lives."
