b"We decided to try out Joey Crowfoot.  We haven't eaten here for a long time.  Service was pretty good.  We ordered the following:Mushroom Cheddar Burger with added Beach Salad - Really, juicy burger and that beach salad - so refreshing!Blackened Basa Fish Dinner - really tasty basa meal; spice was just right!Bombay Butter Chicken - great bowl of butter chicken with carrots, basmati rice on a small banana leaf, papadum.  Great blend of everything.Sicilian Shrimp Linguine - Soooooo delicious!  It's a pesto sauce of pine nuts, currants, and all kinds of good stuff,   Lots of baby shrimp but done really well.I'd come back just for the Siciilian Shrimp Linguine!!"
