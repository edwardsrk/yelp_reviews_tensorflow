b"I thought I was going to give my first 5 star review but awful service ruined the day. Food was very nice! We both had fish dishes that were perfectly prepared. The chef even came out to make sure he understood my food allergies!The service was the worst I have had in a long time. So much so that yes, I will name her. Lauren took more than 10 minutes to approach our table and only after another server prompted her. She brought my mother's beverage, but not mine. I had to ask again. My mother had to ask 3x for sugar for tea and eventually got up and got it herself. Lauren saw her and turned the other way. We waited a long time for our appetizer, eggplant pie, it was barely warm. My mother did not want to complain and ate some of it. We waited even longer for our first course from the pick 2 lunch specials. We were there close to an hour before we got our salads. Lauren was not rude, but not attentive for drink refills and requests and not timely. I don't fault a sever when the kitchen is slow but this was not about that. I would want to return but this poor service has me thinking twice."
