b"The best burger place in Pittsburgh. I went here twice during my stay. The first visit was absolutely mindblowing. I had a chicken burger, which was perfectly cooked, and the organization of the toppings was excellent. The second visit was good but not as good; the burger just seemed rushed. It still tasted pretty good but was a little dry and toppings were added unevenly.The shakes are delicious and come in large portions. I wasn't a big fan of the hard shakes, but that's probably personal preference.The wait times can be kind of long, and afaik, you can't make reservations ahead of time.. I suggest you come in between traditional lunch and dinner times for the shortest wait. I came at around 4-5 pm and was seated fairly quickly."
