b"What?!?! I know the bunt cakes here are deliciously good and they melt in your mouth, not in your spoon or fork but! the real reason I go to Nothing Bundt Cakes is for their WHITE CHOCOLATE POPCORN!!!! It's the same makers of Danielle's Snow Popcorn! I've been getting my quick fix of these scrumptious delectable little pieces of heaven at NBC since they closed the Danielle's shop here in Vegas. The popcorn may run to seven dollars at NBC compared to the seven dollars of twice the size of that bag at their headquarters in Mesquite. I guess you have to weigh your options.... Drive an hour and get the popcorn twice as big for the same price or buy it at NBC for the convenience of it being in the same city. To each it's own. So if you ever get a chance to treat yourself at NBC please try the red velvet [because it has mini chocolate chips mixed in which is just the best little surprise when you taste it] ALONG with the white popcorn. I promise you will not be disappointed unless you are on a really tight budget. In that case, just choose one. *whispers excitedly: the popcorn!*"
