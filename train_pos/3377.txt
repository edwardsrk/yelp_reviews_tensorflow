b"Chelsea's Kitchen is awesome. It's hard to find anything bad to say about it, so here are the good things: they have plenty of great beers on tap, as well as a ton of great wines. The food is amazing. I got the short-rib taco platter this time, and it is awesome. It's cool that the menu has a little airplane icon next to the dishes that are fast to make so you can make it to your flight quickly. And they have several tvs is the bar section so you can catch the end of the PGA Championship, if it happens to be that day for you (go Rory!). Overall great place. Friendly wait staff, food that arrives quickly, and great drinks. 5 stars!"
