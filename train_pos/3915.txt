b"Tempe St. Luke's doesn't look pretty on the surface but this is by far the best ER nursing staff in the phoenix area.  The nurses do joke a lot but really care about their patients.  Noise and commotion travels and is disturbing at times but,  it's the clientele not the staff.  I would say,  the appearance of the ER definitely needs improvement.  I would recommend this place if I wasn't laughed at by my friends."
