b"I was recently telling a friend of mine about Lawry's The Prime Rib and how good it was.  And he said the best he ever had was at Jerry's Nugget.  I'd never heard of the place, but I met him there for dinner one night.  When I drove into the neighborhood, I thought I'd taken the wrong direction.  It is not in a good neighborhood at all, in North Las Vegas.  Needless to say, when I pulled up in the parking lot, I was beyond skeptical.  I walked in and it was basically a dump with rather seedy looking clientele.  However, when I walked in the coffee shop, I was quite surprised.  The food looked incredible.  And it smelled great.  I ordered the Prime Rib.  They had three sizes.  I got the small one, and my friend got the medium sized one.  The small one was enough for me.  The medium sized one looked like the size of one served on The Flintstones.  It was HUGE!  I could have eaten four meals off of it.  But it was definitely top notch prime rib.  The service was ok.  They weren't overly friendly.  But I definitely love their food.  And the menu is huge.  I highly recommend it."
