b'Went here over the weekend as I was treated to a massage. The masseuse was on point and checked in throughout the massage to make sure pressure was right. The facilities are nice, though not as large as other spas. The decor and use of waterfalls makes for a great experience and vibe. Only negative would be that the jacuzzi temp. was a bit colder than ideal and the jets were not that strong. Also, they could have had more refreshments throughout the facility versus just in the lounge area.'
