b"I had the Potatoes Au Gratin here. Very good! I also got to choose off a special menu and ordered tenderloin with foie gras. I am a huge foie gras fan, but I didn't like mine too much. It was far too gooey that night.The steak was perfect but huge. I saved it and had it for lunch the next day and boy was it a treat!The service was the best. They were very attentive and nice. Surprising did not take very long to get my entree. The ambiance was very dark but cozy."
