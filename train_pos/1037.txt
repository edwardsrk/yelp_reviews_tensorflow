b"I love Red Velvet Cafe so was extremely happy to hear about this location opening up.  It offers up another lunch choice for those of us downtown.  Parking is easy and the cafe is right near the front entrance.  It's more of a take out place with some seating outside and weather permitting that's a great option.   My only complaint for this visit would be my cookies were a tad hard.  Not sure if that's because this location doesn't get as busy as the others so they keep them on hand an additional day or two or what but because I love this place and their desserts so much they get a pass this time."
