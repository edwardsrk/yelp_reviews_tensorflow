b"My wife and myself came here on a Friday night  knowing that it would be busy we were seated in less than 10 min. We ordered and were surprised that our meal was served just as we finished our appetizer. The service was excellent  and the only thing we could find fault with was that one steak was grissly. The manager wanted to make another but I didn't think it nessary.  Our overall experience was great"
