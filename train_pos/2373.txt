b'I\'ve heard that this is the place to go for shoes.  Now, I\'m not into the country scene.  At all.  So I was skeptical.  It is a country store...VERY country.  But they also have "regular" shoes, too and a really decent assortment.  They do loose a star for price, though.  I know shoes aren\'t cheap...I get that.  But when the average price that I could see on the shelf was over $100...that\'s pricey.What amazed me most, though, was the customer service.  The associate helping us gave us our space, but regularly checked in.  When we were headed to the register, she met us to take our items and escorted us to the register and acted as liaison with the cashier, and made sure we left with her card and a coupon for next time.  Definitely made the trip!'
