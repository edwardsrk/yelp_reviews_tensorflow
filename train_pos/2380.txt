b"I had my first experience with Korean BBQ here and really enjoyed myself with my family. I DO NOT suggest the ribs, as they were all fat and bone, but the beef, pork and chicken were all really great. I loved the thin slices, as it was difficult to screw up cooking anything, and the bubble tea I had, had real fruit in it floating around :) YOU NEED TO ASK FOR A GRILL CHANGE WHEN YOU NEED ONE, as I found they didn't ask, but were more than happy to do so when we did. The wait staff was fine, the guy we had was friendly and we were seated right away. It wasn't busy when we went, but seemed steady. I'd really like more veggie selections and vegetables in general though, and the tofu we had was ice cold in the middle and oozed liquid although it was cooked on the outside. Will be going again, but trying something else and not eating the tofu."
