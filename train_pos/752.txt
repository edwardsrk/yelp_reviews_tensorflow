b"great atmosphere outside.  heaters are only for night so i think it would be nice if they were available if someone asked.  FANTASTIC corned beef eggs benedict.  a bit crowded inside but this store has so many things to buy.  it'd take a day just to look at it all.  pet friendly outside :) it's self serve which is a bit unusual as you have to find your table first then order.  they bring it out to you but saving a seat can be tricky.  any alcohol has to be purchased across the way at their other restaurant."
