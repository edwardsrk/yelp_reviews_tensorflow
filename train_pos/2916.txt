b'Definitely the only table of grey haired tourists there so perhaps I offer a different perspective than other diners.But, maybe not so different.   Like most of the reviewers, a solid four stars.It looks like a "joint" from the outside, and the inside is modest. Prices are modest, too.The oysters and beers are a bargain, which even a well-healed traveler can appreciate.The Pork Belly Kim Chi was excellent.  Perhaps could have been spicier for some, but very much to my taste, and the pork belly was like butter but better.  Ceviche very generous and well prepared.  I spend a fair amount of time in Peru so have had it many ways and this preparation is very good.Asparagus tempura was crisp and not overdone.  On a par with that at Raku, a truly great, more expensive Las Vegas restaurant.  The Shrimp & Jalape\xc3\xb1o Hush Puppies were not exceptional.  Good enough, not expensive.The Rib Eyes were very good, but steak is steak.So the boil down-  the staff is wonderful.  Enthused and friendly.  Because it was late and they were out of the Foie Gras (seems not the first time) we were treated to a round of drinks.  That was above what I expected and it was appreciated.The food is sometimes a bit cutting edge and that is admirable.  It is refreshing to leave the convention halls and mega hotels and see a chef really working at his craft.  The place is not a bases loaded home run but a lot of fun, a bit audacious, a solid three bagger.  Go with an open mind and you will really enjoy it.'
