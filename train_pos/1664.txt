b"Wow. Talk about a hidden gem. Red Sea is plopped in the middle of a sketchy strip mall. From the outside, definitely no curb appeal.The food? Amazing. I had the vegetarian sampler platter and devoured the entire thing. The lentil dishes were by far my favorite, but everything was delicious. Spicy, intense flavors - definitely not recommended for a picky eater. I was with two friends who shared a lamb and chicken platter and some sambusas which they loved.We're planning on going back this week. Probably won't eat lunch that day."
