b"Not bad for airport food (Terminal C in Las Vegas' McCarran Int'l Airport) - it actually felt like a decent burrito.I got the Green Chili Pork Burrito for $7 and change + tax = $8.10It had pretty good pork and chili sauce, along with filler of rice and beans. or maybe it's healthier that way. anyway, i was filled and pleased.They also do breakfast burritos.They do sell bottled beverages (no fountain drinks), but for $3+ for a drink, i'd stick to the water fountain a little further down the terminal."
