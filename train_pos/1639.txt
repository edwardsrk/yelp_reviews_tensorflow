b"My friend raved about how wonderful this place is, so i went to check it out.  It's a little restaurant tucked away in the corner of a plaza.  Well, it really is a hole in the wall kinda restaurant.  We sat down and the waitress gave us menus that were so well used that the corners were curling up lol.I ordered the sashimi bento box.  It's called the sushi bento on the menu but the picture clearly showed salmon sashimi.   The food arrived fast.  Miso soup and congee, along with some side dishes of tofu, fried fish, and peas.  That's followed by the bento box.  The box consisted of a big maki roll, a shrimp tempura, and slices of salmon sashimi sitting on top of rice.  The salmon slices were delicious and fresh.  They melted in my mouth.  Love love love.  All that food for less than $10 in total.  More love lol."
