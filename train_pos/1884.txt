b'I went to Bestellen last night with a girlfriend for drinks and snacks. We sat at the bar.  The vibe of the place was lively and the decor gorgeous. The music was awesome (Deerhunter, Lykke Li, TV on the Radio) and piped into the bathrooms. (I really liked this at the time... I\'m not sure why) The service was attentive and the staff are all very attractive. We ordered the unexplained "devils on horseback" at the recommendation of the bartender, which are actually dates wrapped in bacon. Pretty good ($6 for four). The only downside to this place is that it is pricey- my vodka sodas were $9 a pop. I can\'t comment on the food, but I\'d like to come back and try it sometime when I am feeling carnivorous. Check it out!'
