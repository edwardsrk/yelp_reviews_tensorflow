b"I love World Market for the wines, snacks, and kitchen items.  There's something about the smell of Bali-made wood and furniture that makes me excited to be shopping there.  Most of my snacks are from this place, and I always seem to buy more than I need every time I walk through the doors of a World Market.  If you're looking for cute tea pots, nice wines, and a stick of salami, drive to a World Market."
