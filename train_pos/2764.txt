b"Great smoothies (the dragonfruit one is amazing), but the atmosphere is definitely a little weird. If you're not there for fitness (which, I didn't even realize was an option until I showed up), you'll feel kind of like an outcast. They clearly have a community following for yogis and maybe spin-class junkies, but it feels a little pretentious. I'm sure they fist-pump unironically. It looks like a fun place to work, because the people behind the counter are always joking around with each other. That being said, it also seems a little too exclusive (with the customer being the excluded party). I'll be back for the smoothie, but I probably won't stay."
