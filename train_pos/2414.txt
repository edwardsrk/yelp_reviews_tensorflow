b"Saw an advertisement for Jardin so I decided to give it a try. I'm a big fan of the Wynn/Encore casinos but I've never eaten there. I usually make reservations but I was too lazy I just walked up and was seated within 10mins. The decore is open and airy with beautiful flowers. It was a toss up between the chicken sandwich and chicken and waffles/French toast. I decided on the French Toast and a Cajun Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was very good and the food was good also. I would recommend Jardin for Breakfast/ Brunch."
