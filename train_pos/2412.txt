b'I really like this place!!!!  For a number of reasons, friendly service, excellent ambience with a trendy, comfortable feel, good food and a great bar to sit and just be friendly.  We ordered the Greek appetizer, which is very common in many places, but the presentation of this one, made it quite different from the rest.  On the bottom was hummus, topped with traditional Greek style cucumber, tomato with light olive oil dressing, and a side of Tzazitki and pita.  Unique and quite good.  More pita would have been nice.  For lunch we ordered the Porkwich, recommended by the waitress and a side of the Mac and Cheese. The sandwich was delcious, but the Mac and cheese lacked "punch" and I was not wowed by it.  I\'ll save that for the Tuck Shop next time.  We also ordered the ribs and they were tender, tasty and really had a nice unique flavor.  We had a side of the potatoes and OMG, they were delicious.  I really wanted to try the Crab Cake BLT and will definitely do that next time.  The best part...CHURN.  I love how it is connected to the restaurant and you can get an entirely different experience at the same location.  We had a pricey "create your own" sundae and enjoyed it on the beautiful patio with misters outside.  It was very nice to be able to leave the restaurant, but not and enjoy an outdoor experience with ice cream in 105 degrees and feel very comfortable.   Enjoy!'
