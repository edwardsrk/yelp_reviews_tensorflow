b'I am a fan. I stop frequently when in the neighborhood as I like their local and organic produce that they use for their food. Another thing that I like is the coffee refills and reliable wifi.Their food is creative, diverse and evolving menu, especially their seasonal specials. I love earning the every day free bagel on your birthday month, their discounts for pick 2, bagels, free cup of coffee, or breakfast pastries.I signed up for the mypanera rewards program early on and it does pay off. I love their online app and fast rapid pick up.Another nice thing is the mini-scan card on my key ring.'
