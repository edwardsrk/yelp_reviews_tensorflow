b"Judging by others' reviews, we were really lucky. Aside from a minor mistake on the hotel's part when checking in, we had a wonderful time at The Flamingo. The bathroom was bright pink and had a TV in the mirror, and we had a view of the strip! The beds were the best I've ever slept on and the staff were really helpful when asked.I loved their pool (the adult one) with the giant Flamingos spouting water out of their beaks and if you are going to the other one, make sure you get up early to snag a lounger because they are hard to get! We ended up going to the over-21's pool just because it was quieter and there were free sun loungers there.We loved the Flamingo and had a really good time there. The location was brilliant and our stay was really pleasant."
