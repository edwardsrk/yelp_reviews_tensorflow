b"If you haven't tried mackerel, this is the place to be!Very comfy, never excessively loud. Environment is pleasant for you to sit down and enjoy good food. Also note, everything has been cleaned Don't judge the book by it's cover, this restaurant appears to be small from the outside but opens up a heck more as you go further. You will find large televisions hung on the walls frequently broadcasting Korean music videos rather sports or weather forecast is nice for a change.Song's is definitely at the top of my list for Mississauga's east-end Korean food. Their pork bone soup & grilled mackerel are an absolute MUST! Service is quick and staff is very polite. 10/10 very well done guys!"
