b'Pretty good brunch place. We went on a Sunday and the wait was about 35 minutes. The salmon brunch plate was amazing- salmon omnelet, lox on a half bagel with various greens and the mocha was rich and chocolately. The Bloody Mary was not too good though, it tasted premade, but the Montreal seasoning they used to line the rim of the glass was a nice touch. Atmosphere is nice with communal seating.'
