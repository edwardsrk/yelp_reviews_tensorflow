b"I purchased my first vehicle from Pinnacle Nissan. My Nissan Juke was very good to me so I decided I want to stay with Nissan. My first experience was great with the first vehicle. I've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. The other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. I was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. I was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. I'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted. I appreciate the professionalism of the staff here."
