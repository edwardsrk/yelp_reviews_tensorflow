b"yay! another school. I love the spot in liberty village but the brunch rush always kept me away. The menu here is slightly different but of the same ambiance. It's delicious and indulgent brunch food served well. I haven't gone for dinner, only brunch. I had the pulled pork benny (meh- the pork was dry and the egg was well cooked! which they replaced with a runny one when I asked), but the french toast was killer! the candied bacon was also totally worth the visit. Would go back and try other things. Pork benny was meh but the french toast was heaven so it gets a 4."
