b'Pittsburgh has many excellent restaurants, and Sunday brunch at Casbah is well worth adding to your culinary "bucket list". Everyone in our party of four chose the prix fixe brunch at $28, which included a brunch cocktail, an appetizer and a main course. Preparation and creativity was wonderful, which meant that standard brunch choices such as a smoked salmon appetizer or a tomato and basil bisque were standouts. The same can be said of entrees, such as the Casbah Benedict, the braised lamb and eggs, or the other egg dishes tried by our group. Service was professional and the experience was special.'
