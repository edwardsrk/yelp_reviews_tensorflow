b"Stopped here for Saturday brunch, we waited about 15 minutes to sit. Everything we had was amazing including the chia bowl (fantastic) and Oeuf Coquette (so good). Only thing keeping this from a 5 star was that we ordered a scone that never came, but we weren't charged and cannot complain really given how busy they were"
