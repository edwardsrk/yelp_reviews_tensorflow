b"I go to the Fairmount fairly often, but only out of convenience.  It is within walking distance of my apartment so if my roommate and I want to grab a quick  drink this is where we tend to go.  However, I am moving to Lakewood in a few weeks and I wouldn't say it is worth the drive. They have a pretty good Martini, Wine, and Beer list, better than most places located on the east side.  However, they can be pretty expensive, so I usually limit myself to two dirty vodka martinis which is already over $20.   The food is okay,  I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner, but a light appetizer for happy hour instead.   They do have a happy hour with martinis around $6 which is definitely worth it.The patio is nice when it gets warmer out and there tends to be a lot of people out there.  However, the one night only the patio was open (they didn't have anyone working inside), so if you are not a fan of outdoor drinking/eating, you may want to reconsider going here if that is the case.  The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about every drink they have on their menu.  They make decent recommendations with the wine, sometimes I have been a little disappointed."
