b'LOVE their chicken club sandwich.  Great barbeque sauce.  We needed a place to hold an impromptu family gathering and they were very accomdating to our large crowd at the last minute.  They have "The Patriot Room" that is so cool.  Stop by and take a look and have some onion rings. They\'re the best!I heard they have stand up comedy on Wednesday nights too.  Haven\'t experienced that. We shall see...... :)'
