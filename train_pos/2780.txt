b"Good food, though a little overpriced.  I usually get the Carribean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which has a fabulous cream sauce, chicken and asparagus.  So good.  I also love the West Indies beef patties and the Ultimate Pina Colada.  I've heard other dishes are just so so.  The service  is usually outstanding."
