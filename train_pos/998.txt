b"What could be better than having brunch at Bouchon with an old friend and two new friends?  We ordered:  2 orders of sourdough waffles, one chicken and waffles, one Bouchon French toast, one pommes frites to share, and one cheese Danish to share.The food was excellent.  I really have had few sweets to compare with that cheese Danish.  Stunning!  Everyone liked what they ordered, and the pommes frites were wonderful.  The only thing that compares to these are those at an unnamed --well, OK, they have arches.  Enough said.I took one star away becasue we who got the waffles didn't get the toasted walnuts that are standard with the dish. Since we were deep in conversation, we didn't notice until it was too late.  They should know better, however.Before I left the Venetian, I checked the Bouchon Bakery near the Phantom Theatre, and they sell the cheese Danish.  Halleluia.  next time, one of you will be mine!  No photos this time.  There are hundreds already here."
