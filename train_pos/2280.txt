b"Stopped in to check out the Evoque, and Justin rocked our sales experience.  He was very knowledgable about the car, listened to what we wanted, and helped us order my new baby without ever making us feel pressured.  Can't wait for October, when my car will actually arrive.  In the meantime, if you're looking for a new ride, go see Justin.  He's a true professional."
