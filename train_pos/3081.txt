b"Fantastic service, atmosphere and food.  We ate until we couldn't anymore.My first visit here was spring break in college and my roommate who had not eaten steak in years (he went veg for a while) decided he would break down and try it since we were in such a highly regarded steakhouse.He loved it and raves about it to this day.  Good times."
