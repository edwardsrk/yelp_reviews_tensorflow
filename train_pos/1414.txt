b"i think that this place is better than the three star rating it currently has. it's got a unique twist on traditional hong kong restaurants, which is flavorful and delicious. i really really like the vermicelli that they offer, it's not the usual threadlike hard rice noodle. it's chewier in a good way. on the other hand, though, they do well at replicating the best / typical things of hong kong cheap cuisine. for example, the sandwiches come in thickly sliced bread, which i think is more fluffy and tastes better than plain old thin toast. they also managed to make the french toast taste basically the same as the ones you get in hong kong, much better than the other places in the gta that i've tried french toasts at."
