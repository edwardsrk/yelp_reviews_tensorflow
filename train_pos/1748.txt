b"Brand new eatery at Pape Ave & Aldrych. Amazing fresh food. Probably the best gyros I have ever experienced. It's namesake, tzaziki, is amazing. I highly recommend this place. Once they overcome some simple learning curves this will be a huge addition to the neighbourhood. Great food, friendly employees, very happy to see it open and so well received."
