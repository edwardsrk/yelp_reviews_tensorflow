b"I really enjoyed this place, it's so intimate and the music is always great. It's very small so you may not always find a place to sit. During the summer they have a really cute patio that makes you feel like you're just chilling in a friend's backyard. They also do poetry/spoken word nights - I haven't been to one yet but I'm planning on it soon. Warning: They never play top 40/pop music so if that's all you're into, do not come here! You won't enjoy it - made the mistake of bringing a friend that hated the music and she didn't have a good time."
