b"They did a great job! I just got my car back and I am over the moon happy with the results. I had coffee, soda, and food stains throughout the interior. Shadyside Detail got stains out from years ago that other detail shops could not. The exterior looks so sleek! Plus, the other shop charged more! Shadyside Details prices are very reasonable especially since they have top of the line equipment like carpet extractors.It's expensive equipment and It's not unheard of to be charged a hundred dollars just for carpet extraction alone on top of interior detailing!  Finally, they are friendly and organized. I would recommend them to anyone."
