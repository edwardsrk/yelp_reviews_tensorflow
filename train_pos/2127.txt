b'My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and I\'m super happy he took me here.Note: as someone who doesn\'t live in CLT, I was a bit curious about Charlotte\'s brunch scene. But I really thought this was a well thought out brunch menu, wonderful service, and ample space to  boot!It is buffet style and my assumption is that the offerings rotate, so they have the \'selections\' listed on the menu they hand you. Included in the brunch buffet is 1 specialty item. We got the french toast and the huevos rancheros as our specialty items, and then hit the buffet to our hearts desires. Can\'t speak for bae, but my french toast was great.The food is on the heavy side -- that is, carbs galore. I felt comfortable indulging, but if you\'re looking for something healthy-ish....I\'d probably go someplace else.Really casual spot to go with friends, partners, parents in from out of town. The ambiance is conducive to any number of people dynamics. They also have beer on tap (duh its a brewery) and I enjoyed their IPA selection. I had the "You Bitter Bro" IPA -- 7% y\'all -- and it did not disappoint. For those who want a breakfast drink:- Mimosas and bloody mary\'s were $5 a pop- "manmosas" (eyeroll) were $8- Specialty breakfast cocktails - $8 i think?Overall, really fun time. But I\'d prob recommend doing brunch and getting a beer on tap in lieu of a sweeter drink.Additionally, the french toast comes with caramel drizzle and waffles come w/ raspberry puree -- both, while nice additions, are too sweet for me personally. So definitely ask your server about the sauces they add onto the food before you order for awareness.'
