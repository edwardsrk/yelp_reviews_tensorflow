b"I had given this Starbucks a one-star review several months ago, saying I'd never go back after several less-than-stellar visits. I'm pleased to say I've been there since, and wow, what a difference that time has made!  While I still avoid the drive-thru because that's always super-busy, going inside has become a pleasant experience, thanks, in my opinion, to a new staff who are both friendly and efficient. I'm the only one who's noticed the change - the store is now regularly full inside. Yet despite the much busier atmosphere, drink times have gone down. Nice job, Starbucks!"
