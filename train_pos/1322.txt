b"We've stayed at South Point several times over the years and find it is just as nice as it was when it opened.  The rooms are clean and nicely decorated, as well as large.  Whether you get a king or 2 queen beds, there is tons of room to spread out.  The sheets are clean and comfortable enough, and the bath products are decent.  The casino is clean and offers a variety of slots, tables and sports book.  There are several different types of restaurants, including fast food like the deli and Seattle's Best coffee shop.  The gift shop offers decently priced beer/ wine.  There is also a bowling alley that offers $1 per person bowling after midnight ($3 for shoe rental), and a movie theater with lots of new movies that stays open late.  The Bingo hall is upstairs also and offers plenty of seating.  There is also an equestrian center that hosts rodeo and horse shows.We like to stay here when the price is right.  M's work has their conference/training once per year here."
