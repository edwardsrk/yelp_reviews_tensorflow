b"Tried the Pizza by the slice counter on our first night here at resort, best pizza I've had in a very long time and I'm from Chicago, so believe me, I know my pizza! Decided to try the actual restaurant for dinner tonight. Ordered Cesar salad for dinner, not very tastey, not enough dressing in salad, but croutons were delicious. Overall, I would recommend that everyone gives these guys a try."
