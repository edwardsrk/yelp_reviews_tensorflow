b"Came here for the first time after work this past Friday. I really hope this place sticks around..so far no business has lasted too long at this location but I think these guys can. They have lots of TV's and a decent looking bar. They had $1 Buds as part of their  grand opening specials. I tried the hot buffalo wings and they were decent. They didn't give me a lot of celery compared to boardwalk billies or bww but the price was fair.The service was a little slow with the bartenders disappearing for a few moments at a time. Overall though as long as these guys have better service than boardwalk or bww, they have a chance to be successful."
