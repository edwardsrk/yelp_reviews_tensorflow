b"It's great to have a meat-n-three place that's not your typical BBQ restaurant.  I've been here 3 times and have always liked my side dishes.  The creamed corn had strings in it, but that was my only complaint.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the pie crust - not my preferred kind.  I do, however, love the biscuits and cornbread.Portions are reasonable and so are prices."
