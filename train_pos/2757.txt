b"Being from the midwest, I'd been looking for a place that served Chicago-style deep dish pizza and Yelp helped me locate this place (which just happened to only be about 2 miles from where I live). Vito's was really good! As it was just me, I had lots of leftovers and they reheated well in the microwave and I think may have even tasted better the 2nd day. Don't let the location scare you away, give it a try."
