b"I like the way that they display their manneqins and how nice they are dressed. The interior to the store is nice too. This store might not be as big as the ones in Beachwood or the one in Westfield's South Park Mall. The store makes you want to hang out there and people watch besides do your clothes shopping..I am not joking!"
