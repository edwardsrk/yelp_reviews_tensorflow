b"My new friend,Colin Fukunaga (@fukuburgerlv) recommended Honey Pig in Las Vegas as a must go to restaurant in Vegas.  It did not disappoint.  Most people never leave strip but are missing out on the real gems of this city.  I ordered their all you can eat lunch special Korean BBQ with all the fixings.  Let's just say my friend and I had to be rolled out of there.  I wish they had great food like this back home!"
