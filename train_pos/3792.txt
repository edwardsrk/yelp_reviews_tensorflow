b"District One is a hidden gem. The chef is great.  He loves to play with his ingredients.  You can tell by his dishes.  I came here a year ago with my mother.  It was great and still is.  I came here a few weeks ago with my husband.   I was able to try a few different dishes this time around.  Oxtail Fries is a must!  Pork Belly Buns was tasty, the balance in flavors is great.  Pho was good and fresh ingredients. Can't wait to come by to try their other small dishes!"
