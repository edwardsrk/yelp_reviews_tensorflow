b"Weird I went to London before I experienced Indian Food, we know the British love their curries and take away. I went to the Tandoori Flame Restaurant a couple times in the last month, both times I went the food consistency was great. The buffet was outstanding, great flavor, good choices, if you like it hot, they offer additional sides of sauces to try around the buffet area. I think it great value for the price. Compared to the Host Indian Buffet no comparison, Host cannot even come close. It's well worth the trek to the Brampton."
