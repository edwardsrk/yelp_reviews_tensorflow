b"Stop by after church on the way home. Truthfully never noticed this place. It doesn't look inviting from the outside (don't judge a book by it's cover). The wait was really long, yes it was lunch time. I wanted breakfast and if you follow me you know I love my french toast. Yup they we're yummy! Our waitress Alexia was amazing, sweet, helpful, and patient. Why patient? I ordered, cancelled, and ordered again. Why? Had a emergency call had to leave, emergency was resolved within 10 min. Thanks Alexis for understanding. Food good, service good, decor could use a little update. Check this place out!"
