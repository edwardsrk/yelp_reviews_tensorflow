b"A while back I reviewed this restaurant, and just went there for lunch today with my friend Keith. As always, the food is so fresh and delicious. I had the Asian Pear and Goat Cheese salad, and Keith had the Poke Salad and a sushi roll (not sure what it was). All were beautifully displayed, and tasted amazing. As always, the service is impeccable and prompt. Very romantic for dinner, and a bit lighter for lunch. If you are looking for a modern style Japanese restaurant with super fresh and beautiful food, try this place, you won't be disappointed!"
