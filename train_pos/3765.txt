b"This is the coolest indoor playground I've ever seen.   A lot of things to keep the kids busy (trampolines for kids, zipline for kids, swings, slides galore) and all clean, bright and sturdy.  Plus a toddler area for the littlest ones.  It's a great place to have play dates so the kids can play while parents relax.   Socks are required for both parents and kids but if you forget you can buy some there."
