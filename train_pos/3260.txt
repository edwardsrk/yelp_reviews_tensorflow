b'Really enjoyed my stay here at La Quinta Inn. Checking in was fast and the customer service from the staff was great! Not only was she attentive but she also provided my guest and I with water. The pool was nice and clean and overall the room was well upkept. The breakfast that was provided was also delicious. I had no issues what so over here at my stay. Definitely will be returning!!! :)'
