b"Popped in on a Saturday night before a Leafs game and considered just watching it there. The BBQ is all ordered by conveniently by weight, and you can order your fixins as sides. We opted for the brisket, pulled pork, back ribs, mac n cheese and beans. Everything was fantastic, although I wasn't a huge fan of the apple cider vinegared pulled pork, but I think that might be a regional style. The mac n cheese should definitely not be missed, and the beer list really rounds out the menu. Can't wait to check out the patio this summer."
