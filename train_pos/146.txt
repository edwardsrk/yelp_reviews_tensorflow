b"Outstanding place to eat.  I ate here several times and service was always timely.  Food choices were sufficient and prices acceptable.  It can get crowded when the place is full.  Unfortunately it's a small restaurant.  I understand there is limited space at its present location but if the set up inside was roomier the setting would be better."
