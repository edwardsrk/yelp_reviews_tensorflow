b'This show is fantastic.  Frank Marino is hilarious & the impersonators are incredible.  They really do a good job. It was a group of 4 girls that went & we got pina coladas which were delicious and reasonably priced.  Make sure you find a coupon code when buying the tickets because we got ours for about $30 each.'
