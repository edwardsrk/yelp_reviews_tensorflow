b"My family and I spent two nights here(Wed. & Thurs. nights) after spending three days at the Main St. Station in downtown Las Vegas.The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite which has a king size bed and a fold-out couch which is about a queen size.The Pros:The view was awesome.  We were on the 37th floor with floor to ceiling windows.The bed was comfortable.  I was able to fall asleep easily.  It was also helpful that there was no loud noises to wake you and no smell of cigarette smoke lingering in the air.Good amenities.  If we had stayed here longer, we probably would have made more use of the kitchen facilities.  We did use the microwave to reheat some of the food we had bought downstairs.Good location.  It's located next to the Planet Hollywood Hotel and the Miracle Mile shops...so there are a lot of shopping and dining options located right downstairs.Overall, loved staying here and will do so again in the future.The Cons:Had to call to have some more toilet paper brought up.  But once we did, it was brought up quickly.Not really a con, but we did have to call to have extra bedding brought up for the fold-out bed, but once again, it was handled quickly."
