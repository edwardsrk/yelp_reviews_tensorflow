b"Got the meat lovers for 4 people which was more than enough to feed the 5 of us. Food was great. Especially the marinated meats. Service was on point as well. My only complaint is that I wish they didn't server such small portions of side dishes at a time for a table of 5, which made it annoying constantly having to ask for more."
