b'This place is so yummy, reminds me of my vacation in Kauai! Visit it before they hibernate for the winter. The tigers blood is my favorite - a combination of three flavors. The pricing is affordable, and they always hand out a 2-for-1 coupon to use on your next visit.We can usually bribe the kids to do any chore, in exchange for a trip here! :)'
