b'This place is always packed but sooo worth it.  Fish is always fresh and service is great.  I normally would choose ayce for sushi but this place is one of the few where it\'s worth paying for individual rolls.  Something new ... try "fresh wasabi" it\'s definitely way better than the normal wasabi everyone is familiar with.  Only disclaimer ... you\'ll never want to go back to the normal wasabi ... hahah.  If you love sushi ... why not try this place out.'
