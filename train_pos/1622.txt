b"I was here to support my husband while he had an MRI done.  BTW this place is open late and very nice.  There is no shady MRI's done here (trying to be funny).  Staff was really nice except for the guy doing the MRI, husband said he came off rude and like he didn't want to be there.  All in all we both pleased with the place."
