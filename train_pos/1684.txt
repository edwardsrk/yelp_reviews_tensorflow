b'Me and hubby are a great fan of nandos. We are glad that they serve Halal chicken. Though we are not a big fan of their service. They close early, their last order would be at 9:30 or so. The food is always good. We order the same quarter chicken meal and hubby loves the skewers. Overall its good for their price.'
