b"Ok...so don't go to the Filaberto's down the street on 32nd St. and Indian School drive the extra  mile and go here...This place is so so so much better.Things that are must haves...any carne asada burrito...so good and they are huge...get the #15 on the menu it is so worth it, you get 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice and a drink for like $10. Important::::And ask for the guacamole salsa, I believe it is exclusive to this location and might be the best thing ever invented. I always get extra to put in my eggs the next morning for breakfast. So good.::::The shrimp taco's here are bomb.com I mean...they are so frickin good, I could eat them everyday..And lastly the piece of resistance is the carne asada super nachos...I don't care where you go this place has the best nachos in Phoenix. They give you a Styrofoam container heaped and I mean heaped with refried beans, rice, guac, sour-cream, carne asada and chips this thing is so big it could seriously choke a pig...this thing probably weighs in close to 5 pounds...this is not an exaggeration...I seriously need to weigh one of these one day. This place is open 24 hours and I must say is my guilty pleasure, if your on a diet don't go here, but if its a cheat day and you are looking to indulge...dive in. I love this place..."
