b"I love Macy's and always have!You can beat a good Macy's clearance.......period. Move over Kohls, when Macy's is having a sale you simply can't beat the price and quality of the items that you find.The INC line is my favorite and it is VERY closely followed by the great selection of Coach products that they carry. I have never seen so much Coach on sale as I have at seen at this location.I am a new fan of the Martha Stewart home stuff that Macy's carries! Nice high quality bake ware and bedding!Staff is friendly and helpful and the store doesn't seem to ever be over crowded. I also love the Starbucks Coffee Shop that they have at this location!Only thing I could say is a con to this particular location is that their women's clothing department is lacking. Since the store is smaller than the other nearby locations they obviously can't hold as much. Even still, I still find that I frequent this location more than any other."
