b'Great Happy Hour everyday! Love this place. Probably my favorite place for sushi in Scottsdale. Def. the best happy hour. But I did take one star because they desperately need to update their menu. For months now there are incorrect items...including last night when I ordered the Tempure Ice Cream only to find out they no longer use Chocolate & Peanut Butter ice cream but they now use Chocolate & Banana. Same with the drink menu. Not a huge deal...just a little annoying.'
