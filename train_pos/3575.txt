b"I didn't know it is a Playa Cabana chain restaurant until I see the bill! It was yesterday, a day with freezing rain. When I called in and made reservation in the Morning, I didn't think it'd be a full house on a day like this( April snow). I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood. We ordered cheese Jalape\xc3\xb1o for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalape\xc3\xb1o looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter. My only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger. Advise before going: 1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early. 2, it's going to be loud, don't expect to sit in a quite corner. 3, ask the waiter for recommendation, they give great tips!"
