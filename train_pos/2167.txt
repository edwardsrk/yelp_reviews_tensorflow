b"Good thin crust pizza. We had the Dough Knots as an appetizer, the 10-inch Popeye Pie for dinner and took home a slice of the Italian Creme Cake. Can't complain -- all was tasty. Best part? The price. The cake was somewhat of a splurge ($6.50, but the slice is huge) - otherwise, it would have been a $12 dinner for two. We'll be back to try more pizzas.We were there early for dinner on a Wednesday and it was not crowded (not shocking...). Our order was taken at a table, though several people came in to order to-go and went straight to the counter."
