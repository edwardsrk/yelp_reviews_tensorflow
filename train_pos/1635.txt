b"I just recently moved out of this apartment complex and I have to say that it was one of the best places I have ever lived at. I was here for the past 5 and half years since 2010 when it was formerly managed by Equity Residential until 2013. Now currently managed by Holland Residential, leasing-property managers Audrey and Peter, in addition to the great maintenance staff have been awesome. All my service requests were rapidly responded to, pool and amenities such as the Gym and neighborhood are nice. You can't go wrong with the magic zip code area of 85254. Conveniently located near shopping centers Desert Ridge Marketplace, Kierland Commons, City North, and Scottsdale Quarter. If you are looking for an affordable place to live in North Scottsdale, Bellagio is the place to be. The only issue I had was a neighbor of mine who made all sorts of weird noises at night but every other neighbor have been friendly and kind. Overall, its been a great experience, fantastic community."
