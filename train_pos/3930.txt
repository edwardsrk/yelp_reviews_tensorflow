b"Cute small little restaurant. I would like to see this place expand. We ordered the prime rib and Kauai shrimp with Kimche fried rice. All I had to say was WOW! on point. We also ordered some blue point oysters which were on the smaller side but for $1 I guess u can't go wrong. I could eat that all day. The only con was it felt like there was no A/c. It is very hot and uncomfortable but we survived. And service was slow at first but it did pick up afterwards. I'll definitely be back to try other things on the menu!"
