b'He always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  But every single time I\'m in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!Anyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that\'s what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you\'re gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I\'ll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, "you think you know a person," when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you\'ve known me for how many years now, and you still don\'t know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a true piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!The rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn\'t pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn\'t finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.Would I return again?  Most definitely!  It\'s good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  I sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  I love me some meat!!'
