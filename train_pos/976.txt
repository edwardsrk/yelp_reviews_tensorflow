b'This days inn is very nice.  Google mislead us and it was a little farther than we thought it was from the highway, but we found it eventually.  Note that the advertised parking amenities are for you to pay $12 per night to park in a sketchy lot across the street - not cool.  But the rooms are very nice and clean, and the staff were very friendly even though we did not speak french.'
