b"My parents wrote my last yelp review about the David Duncan House. They didn't have the greatest time for their anniversary dinner, I attended the DDH tonight with my girlfriend and her family. Everyone in our party of 8 ordered the 16 Oz. Prime Rib and it was amazing. Super tender, amazing gravy, creamy mashed potatos, they did skimp on the veggies for the $37/ plate BUT I can guarantee that you will be full and satisfied with the quality of what they do not skimp on. The meat."
