b"I love the texture of the fro-yo here at Menchie's more then any other fro-yo place. Most of all I like that when you eat it the flavors don't taste like powder. It is so smooth and velvety!! They have tons and tons of different topping more then any other place I have ever been to. I knocked off a star because when I walked in the guy behind the counter just left and went to the back and wasn't around for a good 5 mins. We had to wait for him to come back to pay."
