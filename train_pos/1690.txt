b'Came here with a group and really enjoyed a meal far more than I should.  Service was prompt though the drink orders kept getting messed up and the water refills a little slow.  I had the roasted onion soup which was terrific. Days later I still think about those croutons and the deep, rich broth that accompanied it. It was a little too salty but overall so much better than those other french onion soups that masquerade as the real thing.The duck was also a big hit.  It was quite tender.  Add a little sausage and you had a nice balanced main dish.The "bananas foster" was nothing like bananas foster, but a new take on it. I\'m not even a bananas fan and I enjoyed it much.Overall, is it worth it for the price? Who knows. Someone else picked up my tab. But it is a good place to take a group when staying at the resort.'
