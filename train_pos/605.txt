b'I brought my friend here so we could lounge by the pool for a day/night. Unfortunately, a monsoon caused a big tree to end up in the pool and they had to use a loud chainsaw to get it out. We went to the front desk and they offered us a shuttle to another resorts pool for free. It was so nice. It is such a clean and friendly atmosphere and the decor is so cute. The pool is a little small but other than that we loved it.'
