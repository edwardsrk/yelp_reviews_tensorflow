b"Attention Las vegas the black bear diner this place is ridiculous with the portions and I'm talking about the light menu they are crazy. We all ordered from the light menu the meatloaf,Patty melt,tuna melt,a burger which now that I think about thats the only thing that wasn't on it and that was huge. The food was surprisingly better than I expected. I'm really glad I took some culinary advice and listened"
