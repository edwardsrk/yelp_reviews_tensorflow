b'A Chinatown gem.  This hand-drawn noodle place is legit. I wished they also serve shaved noodles like the restaurants in Philly.  The servers, can speak both English and Mandarin.  Service is good, and they are happy to oblige, as long as you don\'t mind waving or gaining attention via any means appropriate in public.Through the large glass window you can watch the chef manhandle the noodle, twisting and shaping the dough into a nicely textured noodle that is not overcooked, like pasta, the bowl of noodle soup that I had was "al dente". yumm.  I had the #1 braised beef which came in a tasty dark broth, bok choy (a type of Chinese cabbage), and the tasty noodle.  The beef was cooked well, tasty and soft.  We also had the pork ears and beef appetizers, which is cheap and decent - although it could use more sauce.  I also like the free cold tea.'
