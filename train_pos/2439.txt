b'This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay. When I first saw the menu and the prices, I thought $16.99 for a sandwich was crazy expensive Las Vegas food and it was going to be overrated, but boy was I mistaken - my pulled pork sandwich was huge (about the size of my face) and it was absolutely phenomenal. It is now #2 best BBQ on my list (with #1 being Ocean City, MD\'s "Bull on the Beach").The service was great and our waiter was courteous and was even open to questions about the HOB venue itself. He also advertised to us that a local blues band was coming back later that evening and we could come back, no purchase necessary, to listen to some great local blues music. The band was decent ("Nothing But The Blues" but spoiler alert...they play some songs that aren\'t blues) and even though we didn\'t have to buy anything, we still bought some drinks to pay for our entertainment.Great restaurant/facility, highly recommend.'
