b"Had a date night with the wife recently and decided to try Momocho from a recommendation of a friend.I saw all the reviews and decided to go with the Guacamole sampler.   We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.My wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.I ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.They tell you when you make the reservation that your experience will last about 2 hours.  That was spot on.  We didn't feel rushed.  Nor did we feel it was too slow.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will easily go back.  The best part was I didn't spend as much as I thought I would.  So its very reasonable."
