b"Definitely worth every bite... Yes I'm one of those annoying reviewers that has frequented House of Prime rib so it's hard not to compare.  I like that Lawrys actually offers other options like steaks and lobster.  The salad is great, the bread basket with whipped butter is too.  We started with a shrimp cocktail, large meaty prawns in a nice spicy cocktail sauce.  We both went with prime rib too, I really enjoyed the thin cut, juicy and flavorful.  The creamed corn was much better than the creamed spinach ( HOPR is better).  Portions are huge, we could not finish.  We also tried the sticky toffee pudding but that was lackluster, not sticky or much toffee flavor.  This restaurant has many unique qualities, the waitress outfits for one and the old school decor.  If in the mood for a yummy piece of meat give this place a whirl you won't be disappointed.  Free valet parking too."
