b"By far some of the best Thai food I've had!  We had a great meal here and will definitely be back for more.We had the appetizer platter (delicious - but would be nice if you could make it larger as we had a group of 3 and had to cut everything up so everyone could have a bite of each dish), pad thai, pork in peanut sauce (yum!), a mixed seafood dish in red curry and chicken with fried basil.  All reasonably priced with a great wine selection.  Very friendly and fast service as well.Our only tip would be to make a reservation in advance, although we did not wait long and just did a quick wander to the galleries (open late for Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town)."
