b'This was my first experience with dim sum, and I was taken aback right away by the size of the restaurant. There was a massive lineup as well, we were a group of 5 and we waited about 20 minutes before being seated. Once seated, we grabbed pretty much everything that the servers offered us. That included shrimp, chicken feet, beef, greens, crab... I enjoyed every single thing I had besides the chicken feet. My only complaint was we asked for water and soda at least 3 times before our servers finally brought some, which was right about when we were already finished our meal. Would definitely go back!'
