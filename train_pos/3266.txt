b"I met up with some friends here for some habachi and drinks. Let me start by saying that one usually doesn't associate Rock Hill will good Japanese food so I was initially skeptical but I'd figure I'd trust my friends and give it a try. Well I was happily surprised.  First of all the restaurant was very clean (which is VERY important for me) and we were greated warmly.  So we decided to have some drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I ordered a martini to start which was strong yet smooth followed by a shrimp tempura roll. The roll very pretty big and the shrimps tasted fresh. I especially like that it wasn't like most sushi rolls around here that are 90% rice and litte else. Once we were seated I ordered the steak and scallop hibachi.  This was my favorite by far! The steak was perfectly cooked and the scallops were especially tasty.  The best part was the portions were really good for the price and quality of the food. I had more than enough for lunch the next day!  It's definitely worth the drive and I'll totally keep going back."
