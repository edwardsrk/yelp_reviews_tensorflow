b"Delicious food available here, and the options are good. I had the Mac and Cheese with a tequila sauce and chili panko seasoning, and it was delicious; perfect for a cooler day. The servers are friendly, and if you order the guacamole to start, they will come by and mash it together in front of you!They have a great selection of tequila at the bar (as a Mexican restaurant should) and the margaritas look delicious. I'll be back to try for sure.The price can be a bit steep, but worth the cost to get food this good. 3 tacos are $12, Mac and Cheese was $14."
