b'My wife and I absolutely LOVE this place. I took her here for the first time last Valentines Day (2017) and it was awesome. Our server was outstanding. He was light, fun and yet very professional. The food was excellent. My wife had the butternut squash ravioli and it was amazing. I had a pasta dish with scallops and it was delicious as well. Scallops and pasta were cooked to perfection. Drink selection is phenomenal! The wine and cocktail list is out of this world. They have a wide variety of wines to choose from and a very unique cocktail menu. I had a an aviation that was very well mixed. It was floral and exotic tasting without being overpowering.My only criticism that I would have is not necessarily a reflection on the restaurant itself. When my wife and I left Casbah, the valet attendant in the parking lot was not so pleasant with me. I had tipped him $20 and gave it to what I believed to be his supervisor. As we were about to leave I had very kindly told him I did so but he proceeded to glare at me and say "I\'ll go ask him". I do understand why he would react this way but a little more professionalism goes a long way. However, other than this awkward 5 seconds my wife and I have never been disappointed with Casbah. We would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone! Please, take advantage of this gem in Pittsburgh! Just be sure to tip the actual valet and not accidentally hand it supervisor lol.'
