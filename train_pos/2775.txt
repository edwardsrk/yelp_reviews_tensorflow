b"I've been getting my eyebrows threaded for over a year now and I'll never go back to tweezing or waxing.  There are several places around town that offer eyebrow threading in there salons but this is the only location I have no complaints about. I've been to a several other places before finding Divine Threading and will never look any further. Their location is very clean which I'm a huge stickler for. The staff is very friendly and asks before they start working on whatever you. They can trim, shape, and color in your brows before you leave to give you the full effect. They always ask you questions which I like,  They also offer a few other services but I only go in for my eyebrows. If you're ever in area you should defiantly go and check it out, you won't be disappointed."
