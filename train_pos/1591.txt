b'Love how the angles of the rooms help make use of the square footage and adds a spacious feeling. The neutral wall color adds warmth and a coziness.  The large patio is nice for sitting and relaxing and talking to neighbors. The 2-bedroom master comes with two closets providing plenty of storage space. Additional ceiling fans in the bedrooms would help increase comfort during the summer months. And advanced notification of water issues would be appreciated. Plenty of pet friendly grassy areas for your pet to play in. Stricter pick up after your pet enforcement would help keep the grounds nicer to look at and walk around on. The office staff is very nice and supportive.'
