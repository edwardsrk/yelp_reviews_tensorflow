b"I went here for restaurant week only to find out that they were not participating in restaurant week. Cleveland Independents made a mistake and listed them online and posted last year's menu to boot! That aside, the experience was good. I really like how they have used the space - it was designed and decorated well. We sat upstairs with a good view of the restaurant below - or you could choose a view of E4th. I liked the salmon special sans the olives which I didn't think went well with the dish at all being so strong of a flavour. The staff was friendly and very attentive. I got here at 5 and it got busy as we were leaving - not packed however, after all it's turning colder in Cleveland and this is on a street known for patio dining."
