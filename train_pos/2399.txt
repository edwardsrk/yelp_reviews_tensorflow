b"Korean fusion resto with a contemporary decor makes Doma a stand out Resto in my books. We didn't opt for the tasting menu as we all had a late lunch.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered 4 dishes to share. We had the tofu steak, kalbi, fish and shrimp with dumplings and grilled squid.  My favourite was the fish/shrimp with dumplings for flavour followed by the kalbi for creativity.  The kalbi came with thinly slices of pickled radish for wrapping. It was delish! I enjoyed the meal and atmosphere but I didn't enjoy the bill.  The four dishes cost $100 before gratuity.  A bit expensive for tapas size dishes."
