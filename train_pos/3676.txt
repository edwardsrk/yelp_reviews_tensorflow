b"Wow this place was super nice and fancy. A lot of people stay here for their work. Everything feels very new, modern, clean, and has elegant interior design. The workers here are very friendly and always tend to your needs. All of the furniture and decorations have a very minimalist feel to them. Which is probably why I'm so drawn to this hotel. I've only had the breakfast here and it's pretty good. I only wished we got bigger cups and plates. Not a deal breaker though. The room I stayed at was very spacious, and big. We had 2 full size beds, a couch, a desk, and a big bathroom. The rooms also had a minimalist fee to them. The beds were so comfy. Once you lay down, you sink in. I slept so well there. The desk was kind of small however, and it only came with 1 chair. This kind of sucked because there were 3 people in my room and we each had to do some work in our room. The bathroom was amazing. It had a glass shower, and 2 sinks that were aesthetic af. We had a huge window that spanned the whole height and width of the room. It was a nice view and we could see the beautiful Skyline. I would definitely stay here next time I'm in town."
