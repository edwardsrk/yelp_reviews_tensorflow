b"I really dig this new Harkins.  I was pretty bummed when I heard they were closing down the Camelview location because I loved its artsy & Indie flicks and the retro vibe.  (I also dug the cheap prices!)  But this Harkins has kept up with their end of the bargain showing movies that bigger theaters don't.  Its also pretty darn nice to buy a ticket and a seat ahead of time and not fight the lines (Tempe Marektplace!) during opening wknds of the big realease movies.  Yes, its more expensive, but sometimes that is worth it for me.  You can also grab a cocktail if you're hanging around the mall and early for your movie ... A cocktail during or beforehand makes everything funnier, right?  Just don't have too many or you won't remember the flick.  ;-)"
