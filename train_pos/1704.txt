b"Pretty good. This place opened up on the 18th I believe. We got the chance to try it today and it filled up pretty quickly. The decor is similiar to Kinton next door with the same black tiles, large open windows and the wooden benches and tables.We were quickly seated but that's most likely because we were some of the first people to check out this new restaurant. It has a pretty good selection ranging from $11-22 on the main dishes I believe.We ordered the kimchii omlette rice and the cream chicken katsu. And was immediately served a side dish of pickled vegetables and two varieties of soup, one for each dish. Miso for the omlette rice and cream of mushroom for the cream katsu. Both were pretty standard. Once our dishes came we were astounded by the sizes! These dishes were very big, larger than an adult man's head! The Kimchii Omlette Rice was delicious, a little spicy and tart; served with a Demi glac\xc3\xa9 sauce, potatoe salad and Cole slaw. I wish that the Cole slaw and potatoe salad weren't so sour as it doesn't complement the dish very well. I believe a side garden salad and some wedges would have been a better option.The Cream Chicken Katsu was by far superior. Four small katsu pieces came pre sliced and covered in a creamy Alfredo sauce that tasted creamy, salty, and cheesy. This dish came with a small salad, rice and the same potatoe salad and Cole slaw of the previous dish. The tartness worked better with this dish than the omlette rice. Our bill came up to $32 including tip, $28 without. I would say the place is very much worth the price, I look forward to trying it again!"
