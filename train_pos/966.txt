b'The rating is actually 3.5 starsI went on a Thursday evening, as part of a group of 42 people.  We had about 1/3 of the restaurant reserved and I would recommend this place for large groups.  The all-you-can-eat sushi option was perfect for our group.Sushi is good and there are a few items worth mentioning:Appetizer: Enoki Beef MakiSushi: Snow RollDessert: crispy rice dumpling with red bean paste and the crispy rice pumpkin cakeService was very attentive and fast.  We stayed a little past closing and never felt we were being pushed out the door.Plenty of parking either on the street in front of the restaurant or in the parking lot behind.The only minor gripe we had is that it got a bit warm towards the end of the evening.'
