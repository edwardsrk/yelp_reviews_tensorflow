b'Excellent food, wonderful atmosphere, and exceptional service!  The waiter was sooo friendly, and the owner really did a fantastic job of going around and making sure everybody was happy.  Admittedly, we had a reservation and had to wait a bit before it was actually ready, but the owner made sure to personally apologize and explain the delay to us.  Later, he came over and talked to us about travel... Long story short, you don\'t find this kind of service often!As for the food itself, I think they serve the BEST baklava I\'ve ever had ("better than any of the baklava in Greece or Turkey or anywhere else in the Mediterranean that we tried", according to one of the other members of my group), and the rest of the food is AMAZING as well. UPDATE: I\'ve now come here several times (basically every time I come to Pittsburgh) and I\'ve gotten used to just ordering a whole bunch of appetizers for my meal so that I can try a little bit of everything since everything is delicious.  Highly recommend!  This is definitely my favorite Mediterranean restaurant!'
