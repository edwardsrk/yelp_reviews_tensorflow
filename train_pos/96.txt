b'I just came here with my friend who had to get his car checked for something really quick.Pros:+Attendant was quick, responsive and nice. +Wait was short (it was an easy task).+Waiting room is nice - complementary water, coffee/teas. Magazines and television for entertainment. +There is free wifi.Cons:- Waiting room is a little small (probably sits around 6-10).- I would like it more spacious and open.'
