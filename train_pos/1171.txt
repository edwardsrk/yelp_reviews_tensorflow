b"Good place! The Rangoon, soup and dumplings were all good appetizers. Sushi I would say is above average considering It's all you could eat, would actually say just as good as Mizu (dare I?) Shrimp Fried rice was tasty and the ice cream was great! I didn't get Hibachi because I feared an all you can eat it wouldn't be good but now I feel like I should have! Would recommend."
