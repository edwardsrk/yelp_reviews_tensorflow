b'I first tried Everyday Noodles when they first opened and felt they were just blandly "Every day", but having gone back recently, they have mastered their craft!  Expertly prepared noodles, and the best soup dumplings I\'ve had since Hong Kong.  Expect friendly service, an attractively remodeled modern asian atmosphere, and light, home made, flavorful, authentic, freshly prepared food.  Given all that, why isn\'t it a 5 that I want to go to "Every day"?  It has fairly limited menu options, and a few of the dishes are a bit timid.  Still all in all, a worthy contender against Squirrel Hill\'s many excellent asian eateries.  I can\'t get enough of their soups, noodles, and soup dumplings and I look forward to returning back again in the near future!'
