b"After my scathing review of the Perez Museum in Miami, I thought I better balance things out by telling you about the AGO, which (I feel) is an example of how to do things right. Had lunch at Frank (on site restaurant), which was quite chic and the food was delightful, but a wee bit spendy.The gallery itself is beautiful and interesting. I've been twice in the past 6 months (to see the Turner exhibit and the Lawren Harris exhibit), and have been impressed by both the special exhibits and the regular collections. The special collections are an additional fee, but in both cases, well worth it. The gallery is spacious and well lit, with an interesting mix of trad and modern art. I still need to go back again, as I didn't get to spend as much time as I would like, and am pretty sure I didn't see everything.It's a great way to spend an afternoon. The staff is polite and well informed, gift store is eclectic and fun."
