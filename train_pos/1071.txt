b'All hail the Pink Taco!This is a great place to go with the girls.  That said, there were also a few bachelor parties here.  Everything is hot pink, even the menus!  The food is yummy- my roomates and I ordered appetizers and drinks here.  Everything we had was amazing.  Service was also really good. Definitely worth the cab fare off the strip to eat here.'
