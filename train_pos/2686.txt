b"Great for Happy Hour, love the deals on half off wine and fries. Summer deal includes certain burgers as well but the portions are still great.Our favorites are the green chilie fries and blue boy burgers....favorite shake is the salt and caramel. Good crew and accommodating staff. Just a little annoying that the bathroom is outside and there is a wait if you don't get there early enough."
