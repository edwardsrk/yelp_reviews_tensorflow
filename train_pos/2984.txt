b"It is a very difficult thing, to stand on this part of the Queensway, where two well-known local chains almost but not quite face each other, and not immediately start to make comparisons between the two. Many of the other reviews do exactly that, and it may be a useful exercise for those who may have eaten one or the other before.But I think that they are more or less two sides of the same coin -- neither of them is going to ever fully compare to the sweet memories of local burrito shops in my home area, San Francisco, the birthplace of these style of burritos. So, I'd like to judge this place on its own merits, and pretend that it is alone on the street.Firstly, parking is a nightmare here. It shares a miniscule parking lot with a number of other busy businesses, and we opted to not bother, since I was in my behemothmobile. There's a shopping center parking lot a short walk away, and that made things a lot easier.This is another style of burrito place where you pick your meats and fillings in advance, and then they toast the thing up on a hot grill before handing it out to you. This can create a little bit of a bottleneck as people wait in the ordering area for their orders. I grabbed a table while Lee waited for our food.I like that they have a nice combo deal, where for slightly more than a price of a drink you get some chips and salsa thrown in. The dining area is pretty spacious for a place like this, and I really appreciated that. It's decorated with the numerous awards that the chain has won since opening. As for the burrito? It was great. I got a shrimp burrito with no rice and a lot of the extra spicy additions. It was mouth searingly delicious.I'd definitely head back for a return visit!"
