b"We had been to a similar place in California that we absolutely love and we're excited to hear about Crave. It definitely met our expectations. Great food, the smores waffle is my favorite! Only downside is it does take a while for them to bring out the food, but that just means it's fresh right? Will definitely be returning over and over again."
