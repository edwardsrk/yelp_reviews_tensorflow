b'Not sure why the rating is so low on this place. I stopped in for lunch the other day and it was delicious. Definitely not your typical American-Chinese restaurant. I shared three dishes with a colleague - Hot & Sour Soup, Handmade Shaanxi Noodles, and Shaanxi Noodles with Pork and Vegetables. The soup was very good. I expected it to be spicier, but it was definitely a mild soup. Not the typical dark brownish Hot & Sour. The Handmade Noodles were excellent! Thick and tasty. Lots of spice in this dish. Overall, I had a very enjoyable meal. Service was good, prices were reasonable, and food was tasty. Yea, the parking is less than optimal. N*joy...'
