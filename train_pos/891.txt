b"Kick off your high heels and peel off that tight dress!  This is the place to unwind.  We arrived 20 minutes before our services began.  I learned next time to go even earlier than that to make use of the great amenities.  After filling out a little paperwork we waited were escorted to our separate wings.  The girl gave me slippers, robe, and a locker.  I only had time to change into my robe (they have private changing rooms) and gulp down a cup of ice water.  I had one of the SIGNATURE RITUALS package.  My body melted!  Afterward, I used the steam and dry sauna.  Make sure to grab a cucumber iced towel (and a few cucumbers for your eyes) before you head into the sauna.  They have an endless supply of towels ready for you inside the spa.  Once you are exhausted from sweating out alcohol through your pores, get something to drink/eat in their dimly lit room.  There are magazines and a TV.  When you're ready for your shower they have razors, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash for you.  ENJOY!"
