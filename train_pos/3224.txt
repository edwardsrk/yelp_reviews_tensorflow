b"How have I never reviewed Caramba's?!?!? I've been eating at this place for at least the past 13 years. It's a family favorite and you might say it's been a little bit more than a staple of my diet for nearly as long.My two most favorite meals from Caramba's are the bean and cheese burrito (fresh tortillas and the perfect mix of cheese to beans) and the chicken quesadilla. Oh, how I miss my chicken quesadillas since I went vegetarian. Delicious grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, sour cream, and then add some of their amazing mild salsa, and you'll seriously be in heaven.  My dad is a huge fan of their machaca burrito, and he's pretty picky when it comes to machaca. So I'd have to trust him and believe that it's pretty darn good.They also have a decent beer selection (Mexican beer of course), with margaritas available too. Free bowl of warm chips and freshly made salsa with every meal, lunch or dinner for under $10 and at least two locations (Bell Rd. and Glendale Rd.)."
