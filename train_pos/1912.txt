b"Green Valley Ranch is a great place to stay and is a very nice upscale resort away from the strip! It is very different staying there than any other Casino or resort on the strip. It is quiet and they have a beautiful pool! There is a real sand beach that leads into the swimming pool that kids just love. The pool is also very warm and nice. I have stayed at Green Valley Ranch several times and the other thing I love is the Spa. The use of the Spa is typically included with your room. They have a nice Sauna, and Steam Room, and Hot Tubs. But the other nice thing the Spa has is a Spa pool separate from the main pool. There is also a great Arcade and a Movie Theater as well, which makes staying at Green Valley great for families. I'm not a huge fan of their Buffet. But Pizza Rock makes the best Pizza in the world, i'm not kidding!!! I was also not overly impressed with Hanks. Hanks is a very high end Steakhouse. But for the price it wasn't that great compared to other places you can go to in Las Vegas. My Steak was pretty tough and chewy and overcooked. For a $250 meal you would expect better.  There are also a lot of nice restaurant options at the shopping district right next door. The rooms are nice, especially the bathroom with a nice Tub and separate shower. Overall it is a great, classy place to stay away from the busy strip. Sometimes we like to stay on the strip and have fun for three days, and then go stay a couple nights at Green Valley to relax!!"
