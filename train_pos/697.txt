b"This is one of our go-to places for lunch at the office! Zuppa's is the cure for the all of those boring chain soup/sandwich places. Their sandwich menu is creative and everything is delicious. My two favorites are the Meatloaf Sandwich  and the Little Italy. The meatloaf sandwich is a meal in itself piled with meatloaf, bacon, bbq sauce and mashed potatoes - it makes me hungry just thinking about it! The Little Italy is Italian bread, prosciutto, fig spread, fresh buffalo mozzarella, and field greens. They have a several homemade soups on the menu (tomato bisque, shrimp and corn chowder, minnestrone) but also have two daily soups that range from anything from cream of mushroom to Guinness stew.Don't forget the homemade cannoli! The flavors change daily too. So far I've had vanilla, pistachio, pumpkin, and peanut butter."
