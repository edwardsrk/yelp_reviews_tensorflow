b'This was our choice, by default, for New Year\'s Eve dinner this year. See, we chose not to make reservations, but instead just wing it and see where we could get in. They had some early dining availability, so we jumped on it. Their special New Year\'s "Paint the Town Gold" menu did not disappoint.Located in the beautiful Mandalay Bay restaurant row, Kumi is a gorgeous display of style and food artistry. Every course was surprisingly delicious, and plated interestingly.Service was very good, seriously on point. Right up until the dessert course...after 30 minutes of waiting for it, we finally requested the check as we had an event to get to. One of our attendants felt bad and offered to quickly grab it for us but we were in danger of being late so we opted not to take him up on it. It\'s a beautiful, albeit very pricey experience for dinner. We would return for special occasions only.'
