b"I got me some Paper denim jeans on sale here for $45, an English Laundry tee and some Donald J Pliner shoes for half off - and ever since I was hooked. Roka is a small mens/womens boutique in the Arrowhead AJ's shopping center - heavy on the denim with shirts, sweaters, belts and shoes.  The owners are friendly and offer guests water and candy when you're shopping (or maybe it's just me).   Every so often they'll have a steal of sale - including their denim sales in February.Who says you have to hoof it to Scottsdale for fancy duds?"
