b'My second visit here was much better because I ordered the right dishes this time I think. The carbonara pasta was pretty decent and the caprese salad was delicious once again. The naked mozarella was awesome and very unique. This place is a solid 4/5 as long as you avoid the spaghetti and meatballs (overly salty) and garlic fries (overly sour). The service was great and the atmosphere is pretty nice too.'
