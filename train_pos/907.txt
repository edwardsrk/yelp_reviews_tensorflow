b"First thought was this market is becoming saturated with AYCE sushi shops. This place was above the rest the presentation was pleasant and the manager or owner came around and was very nice he asked how we came across his restaurant and was very welcoming. Which was on par with the rest of the service staff. The food was plates nicely and was in good portions. I have found that some other AYCE places make their maki rolls smaller than regular, that's not the case here. I didn't feel they were trying to cheap out on their AYCE orders. Although we weren't given an option for a regular menu I would imagine you don't have to do AYCE if you don't want too. But at $19 it's a good value since other in the area go up to $22. Well worth the money, the portions were good, the food was fresh, the atmosphere was casual but somewhat eloquent, and the service was very friendly and pretty quick.The only thing was I would have at least seen a regular menu."
