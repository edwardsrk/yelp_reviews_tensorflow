b"I came here 1 week after it opened.  The beers were good, adventurous, over all well done.  I'm an IPA fan and they did those well.  I loved the half pours because they gave me the option to try a large amount of the beer list without having too much.  They do 1/2 pours instead of flights.  So don't be disappointed if there are no flights, because the 1/2 pours are perfect....you can try so much more!  It wasn't overly crowded and the service was on point.  The cheese and meat board was a nice size and you can choose your own.  The wings were also pretty good.  The place is the start to something wonderful.  There is street parking only, so take it when you can get it!  Also, although the street sign says East Railroad Street, those of us from the South Hills know this road as Washington Pike coming from Bridgeville and Washington Ave coming from Carnegie.  I'm not really sure why the township renamed this road East Railroad Street because it parallels West Railroad Street.  As a person in the map making field....this is really odd.  You don't usually have east & west road names parallel to each other.   So just be aware, this is on the main drag."
