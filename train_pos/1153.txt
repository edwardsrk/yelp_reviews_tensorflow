b"We have ordered and enjoyed: buffalo chicken salad, steak salad, Caesar salad, tossed salad with cheese, spinach rolls, eggplant parmesan hoagie, the Napoleon pizza, and pizza with and without toppings. As others have mentioned, the cheesey breadsticks are great. I'm vegetarian and I love their eggplant parm, especially on the Napoleon pizza. We get delivery in Fineview in 45 minutes or less. I've ordered online, through Eat24 and GrubHub. I prefer Eat24 and their weekly $2 coupon, as well as their Pizza & Sticks deal for $16.99 (large cheese pizza, breadsticks & mozzarella sticks [toppings extra].)I believe the horrible driver people have mentioned no longer works there. We've been ordering delivery on monthly basis from Riviera Pizza for over two years and have had a problem only once."
