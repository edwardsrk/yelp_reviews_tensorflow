b"Great restaurant for a date night or to get a different ambiance than the usual PSH here in Ayrsley. Service here has always been fantastic. They always recommend great apps to start and they always have daily drink specials! This is actually a bit more upscale than you think. I would put this more on the higher end of the double dollar sign. $$. I think it's worth it if you are craving a good steak. I haven't been able to pull away from any other appetizer other than the hummus & pimento cheese dip dip. The hummus is really good! Another great go-to if you are here to drink and munch are the flatbreads. They are actually more like little pizzas, not flat at all and very good! Very filling because they are doughy. Finally, when I am craving a great burger, this is my go-to. Trust me on this one."
