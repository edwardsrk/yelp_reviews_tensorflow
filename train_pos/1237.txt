b"Looking for inexpensive children's games for my WII to keep the grandkids occupied this summer, I stopped by to browse the used WII games. The games were priced $4-$32, with most around $9. This is less expensive than Gamestop and I picked out a couple of the $4 games.As I was checking out I noticed that the shelf above the games held all kinds of old game consoles (it almost was like a museum honoring past gaming machines). Parking is easy and close to the door."
