b"I can not say enough about what a positive experience I had with these guys today! I called day of- from Los Angeles asking for a delivery to my friend and her new baby. Even though their schedule was packed, they accommodated and delivered 18 beautiful (and from what my friend says, DELICIOUS!) mini cupcakes with a bow and personal message on the box! They were beyond friendly and helpful. Don't send flowers, send cupcakes!!!"
