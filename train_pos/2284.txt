b"It may be little....but this market has punch!A cupcake truck (salted caramel cupcake, mmm), pizza oven truck, crepe truck....spices, fresh fruits and veggies, the world's most fragrant popcorn, cheese, plenty of meat options (bison bratwurst?!)....I have to say my expectations have been exceeded. Add in the fact that a number of great restaurants/ bars/ coffee shops are within walking distance, and just found yourself a lovely Tuesday afternoon."
