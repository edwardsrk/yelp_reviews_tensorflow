b'I have now eaten here 3 times.  It is such a great place. The general manager Allen jumps right in and serves if he is needed too. The waitstaff could not be nicer.  The seafood is so incredible fresh.  We get the ny strip with hollandaise.  The sauce is not overwhelming or salty. It is delicious. The only issue is with the waffle fries. Not meaty enough. They need to cut them a bit bigger because they come off as potato crisps and kind of weird texture.  The crab totstada could be eaten every single day. Put a little acid in it and it willCome alive. What a great and fun place.  Looking forward to going back again. Btw the sushi is sooooo fresh it tastes like it was just swimming. Try the scallop.'
