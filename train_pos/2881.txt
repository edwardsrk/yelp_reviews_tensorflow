b"4 stars for food, 5 stars for service.Ordered a grilled cheese with chorizo, I ended up getting some additional toppings that I didn't ask for (refried beans and hot sauce). I spoke to the staff and he apologized and was happy  to make me a new sandwich. To make up for the inconvenience, he brought me a cup of watermelon juice for free. The sandwich itself was good. Also ordered the steak eggs on fries. Eggs on anything is good but I thought it was a bit bland tasting. Everything was made to order so it took a little longer than your typical fast food joint. Overall, it was a decent meal, would come back again if I was in the area."
