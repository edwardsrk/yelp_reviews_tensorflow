Shark attack - which unfortunately didn't have the gummy shark in it but they gave my friend a punch card with 10 stamps, but that's only because they forgot about his drink in the first place. That's okay, he said it was still delicious without it.Guava have it - you can taste the Dew and guava more than any other flavors.Life's a peach - I can taste the flavors all around, if you like peach then it's a must have!"
