b'I was invited back to the restaurant by the owner to give it another try. Alexandria our server was awesome. She gets 5 stars just for being so lovely.I tried the A2, Frying Tuna, and Screaming O... They were good, all offering something a little different.The BEST was the Tempura Oreos. Sounds bonkers, right? No! Eat them.. Be willing to get too full off of them... They are heaven.'
