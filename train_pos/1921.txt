b"Well, I'm writing this review while waiting to even place my order. Been here for about 20 minutes now, and doesn't look like anyone's coming yet.  Just sitting at the table drinking my water. Although they are pretty busy and there's only two people out assisting customers so I don't know.... Management needs to learn how to properly staff their store properly. How long willI be waiting tonight? HahEdit, right after I posted this review someone came and took my order so things are looking up, I added one star for that.Edit2, a lady came and apologized for our wait so it's good that they're acknowledging they were having problems at the time. Seeing as I'm an Assistant Manager at another restaurant I know how important it is to make sure that's one of the first things you do during hard times, also I can hear someone in the back now yelling, and directing people so I can tell someone's trying back there to get everything back in order so I'm changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars for the comeback they made."
