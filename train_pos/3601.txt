b"It looks like it is almost finished.  The greenway now extends from behind Park Rd shopping Center (breaks a little near Freedom Park) and then continues on up to CPCC.  The new section is a gem along the creek with various plazas and artwork and the animal life returning.  I walk this greenway often and often see various animals from purple martins, robins, ducks, geese, fish, turtles and even snakes.  This is a wonderful addition to the area's urban trails.  I expect to see a lot of festivals popping up in using the new section of the greenway.  There's already the Kings Drive Arts festival which will be huge in a few years."
