b'Blah, blah, Balzac\'s coffee is divine, it\'s life-changing, it\'s the ejaculate of the Gods, I\'ve heard it all. This place could serve liquid hate in a cup, and frankly, I\'d still pay good money just to sit here. As caf\xc3\xa9s go, this space is stunning and Torontonians should be proud to have access to so charming and unique a spot Balzac\'s. This Distillery coffeeshop is some 50 feet high with gargantuan windows and a large green door that\'s BFG friendly. Walking in will draw your eyes up; it\'s an overwhelming space.Their mezzanine is fabulous and I would probably push someone over a ledge for a seat. Their delightful whitewashed walls often feature charming local art. There is a patio out front (which unfortunately faces an abominable sculpture), which is pretty busy in the summer. There\'s no wifi, so it\'s not a place to work, but an enjoyable place to chill.And having said all that, I\'ll add: their coffee really is pretty good.Obligatory Title Pun: (Too easy.)Menu Readability: I definitely do not like the typeface on the board here.Need to mention: Upstairs there is a mysterious and out-of-place glass door labelled "bureau." What this place teaches me about myself: I have restraint: a Balzac\'s pun could have been one of the crown jewels of my pun career.'
