b"Fact: high quality fish, screamingly fresh and exquisitely prepared is inherently expensive stuff, traditionally served in small portions. My sashimi dinner here was a steal at $20-some, albeit a very light supper. But a less experienced dining companion had real trouble negotiating the menu and left unsatisfied. If your concept of sushi is California rolls and the like you may want to put off a visit to Hiro. If you're looking for an undiluted Japanese sushi experience look no further."
