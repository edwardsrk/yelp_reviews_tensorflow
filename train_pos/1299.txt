b'While I am not in love with Wildflower, I do have to mention the great service we had recently. We have food allergies, so we are "those people" when we place an order. CarolAnne was very patient and friendly with us AND she got our order entered correctly on the first try! It sounds funny but that doesn\'t happen very often. We told the manager how sweet she was and she was happy to hear that as this is CarolAnn\'s first job. Keep up the friendly service CarolAnne! I also noticed new management at this location, which was much needed.'
