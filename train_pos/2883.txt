b"I like their variety appetizers plate and the sweet and sour pork specially for the amount of food you get for the prize, but like any other Chinese place you can taste the grease that's been used over and over again. I loved their crab Ragoon which they didn't over fry as most places do. The service was OK and it wasn't crowded I did see that a lot of the orders are for pick up so maybe that's why you don't see a lot of people inside the restaurant."
