b"Let's be honest, I would never have discovered this place if I didn't live on top of it. Now I live about a block away from it, and don't want to move much further from it!It is perfect, gourmet take out for a young professionals face paced lifestyle. Superbly decorated (love the concrete floor) with a rich atmosphere and amazing food to choose from (herb crusted mac and cheese :) Staff is happy to greet you with a smile and help you out with all your questions. Sit in, or take out you... won't be disappointed. One more reason I love my little Bridgleand."
