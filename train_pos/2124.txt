b"The menu prices have changed, but the food was good, the service was great, and they even have almond milk for your coffee/tea. The only thing we didn't like was that there isn't a kitchen fan, and my jacket smelled like breakfast meats for hours after we left. But we would definitely go back for the good food and friendly faces."
