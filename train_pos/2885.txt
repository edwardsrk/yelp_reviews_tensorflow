b'This is our first stay at South Point.  We usually stay at another casino while in Vegas away from the Strip. However, this year we were unable to book room at the other casino and decided on South Point mainly for cost and availability.  First, the room at South Point was bigger than expected.  However, the furniture and room decorations are less modern.  The same with the pool area.  On the better side, we loved the coupons for free drinks and discounts that were provided by the hotel.  We enjoyed the Steak and  Shake, the late-late night Steak and Eggs, and the gaming.  Overall, South Point served us well and exceeded our expectations.'
