b'Came here with a group of friends for a night out.Had a good experience from beginning to end.We were boring with our choices of food and choose to get lamb, and chicken souvlakis. We were impressed with our choices. We each ordered an alcoholic drink. All of them were made well. Although it was a busy night, the service was still great. Attentive but they did not overdo it. The food was delicious, great portions and good quality. Solid authentic Greek place to add to the list of food restaurants in port credit! Check this one out :)'
