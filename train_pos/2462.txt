b"It was large portions and great food. I got sashimi, which was delicious, but the salmon was not very good. It was fresh, but not the best quality... Didn't taste much like salmon. I am from DC where you pay higher prices for less food, so this is a great place in my opinion. Our waitress was very nice and gave me a free bowl of miso soup. Definitely try it!"
