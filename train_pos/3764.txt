b"I love Angie as a person and as a small business aficionado.She's super accommodating for the last minute custom tan. I truly love the tan she provided me. This was my first custom tan & I'm not sure I could ever go back to just standard spray tan.  There were no lines, no drips, nothing negative about the spray at all. Plus Angie's attention to detail is what keeps spots from being darker or lighter than they should be. Just follow her instructions & you will be able to sustain the airbrush for up to 10 days. MOISTURIZE!!! & it will be so awesome. I got the booster to upgrade my base i had been working on. I got tons of compliments. I have another appointment scheduled for my post wedding party in Minnesota. Can't wait."
