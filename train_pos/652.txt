b"I've been coming to this place since the very beginning. The first time I was here years ago not long after their opening, Russell offered us soup without charge, and was so friendly and welcoming. I've come here for lunches, dinners, and pick-ups. I've had their Korean, Chinese and Hawaiian dishes and none has disappointed. One of my favorites is definitely the jajangmyun (wheat noodles in black bean sauce). The portion is huge and I usually eat about half and take the rest to go. I especially like to order pick-up from here because the food has always been quick and ready for me when I arrive. The service could be a bit slow and at times it's hard to get the servers' attention, but the place is usually pretty busy. This is definitely one of my go-to places for Korean/Hawaiian food, and one of the best in town."
