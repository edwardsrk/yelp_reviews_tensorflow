b'Took the wife out for a special event/dinner.  We arrived early and were well attended.  We got a shooting lounge, ordered drinks and some appetizers.    Buffalo Chicken egg rolls, mushroom fries, fish tacos, all very good.  Note - since it was just the two of us, shooting for one hour straight was quite a bit.  It would have been better as a double date, sharing costs and splitting the time.'
