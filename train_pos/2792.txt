b"Just moved to the neighborhood - walked here after unpacking for several hours. Famished, and ready to eat some good food! It was late, but I was confident that I could put away some food in a short period of time.The woman in the front explained that they closed at 10, which was fine - she was polite about it. The waitress was great, very attentive and sweet (even though we were officially THOSE people who showed up 40 minutes before closing time)Food was brought out almost immediately, great flavor & quality. Sushi was MOSTLY fish, not MOSTLY rice - it's rare that you find this. My large miso soup was LARGE - enough for two days. All portions were a very nice size.Upon checking out, the woman in the front was pretty much telling off our waitress because she forgot to add my wine to the check - ridiculous if you ask me. They made us swipe our credit card again to pay for the wine - while the woman was still yelling at our server. Honestly, that was the only thing that I could say that was an issue this evening. The waitress handled it great though - she was awesome & I would ask for her again when we come back."
