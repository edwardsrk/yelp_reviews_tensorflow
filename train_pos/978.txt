b'I was never much of a burrito person until this Fat Bastard entered my life one fateful late evening last summer."A lil tequila lime chicken please," I said. Their idea of "lil" is not the same as mine, but do not mistake this as a complaint. Generous portions of all your typical fixings (lettuce, pico, guac, cheese, peppers) plus unique ones such as noodles (A MUST!) and "crunchies" (AKA those hot-as-death chips) are piled sky-high to the point one must wonder, how will these wonderfully nice people close this burrito?It\'s a true art what they do here, managing to fit all those toppings into one tortilla is a skill most enviable. The tequila lime is my favourite, but my partner in crime swears by the baja chicken. I\'ve also tried the baked yam (though don\'t be fooled: to heat it up they do toss it in the deep fryer for a minute) and it was awesome, again huge portions. The pulled pork is my friend\'s fave, but it wasn\'t for me. They have a large selection of flavours, as well as quesadillas that are built much the same. Be warned: the hot sauce here is super hot! The last time I got a burrito here I passed on all things spicy.Sizes come in lil, large and huge, the latter of which truly does live up to it\'s name. I\'ve personally never ordered anything bigger than a "lil" and with toppings so generous, finishing even that can be a challenge!'
