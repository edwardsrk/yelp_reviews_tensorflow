b"BEAUTIFUL restaurant with awesome service and good, but expensive for the portion sizes food.The decor reminds me of a cozier Cento. Love the booths (they remind me of little cabanas). I love that you can see them cooking, too!Fun, friendly and helpful servers.So the menu reminds me of the menu at A Pig in a Fur Coat in that it's mostly smaller plates designed for sharing. However, in practice, most of the dishes at Graft are not actually shareable. I think the main difference in the actual food between Graft and PIAFC is that the Graft food is not quite as decadent so you actually want more than a bite. However, my group of 4 shared a lot of dishes and we really only got a tiny bite of each. We left hungry and still paid a lot. Each dish was like $5 per bite.We loved most of the food, though! I think I would just go back with one other person and be prepared to spend a lot. Favorites include the beef tartare, flank steak and ravioli. The macaroni and cheese was the only thing I didn't like. Too smoky, but people apparently love it. The fried ch\xc3\xa8vre was good but not all that interesting and the scallops were yummy with that hint of grapefruit but really not feasible for sharing. Great cocktails and wine, too. This is definitely a place for a special occasion. An anniversary date, not a group dinner with friends!"
