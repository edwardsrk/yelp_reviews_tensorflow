b"Great Italian food tucked away at the top of Eau Claire mall.There is nothing bad that I could say about this restaurant except that it is quite expensive (although worth it). I received great service throughout the meal and received my food very quickly. The food was exceptional and I couldn't get enough of it. I almost wished that I had ordered two dishes, so I could take one home for later.If you like Italian food and are in the neighbourhood, check this place out."
