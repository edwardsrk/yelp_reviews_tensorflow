b'This is my first time going to Yeh, as my daughters took me there.The good: Very good ice cream. Various different flavours. Lots of choices of toppings. Nice seatings and enough for everyone (we were there during the day). Nice staff, they were available to answer our questions.The bad: Ice cream machines could be a little cleaner in the "drop zone". Cups section could have been filled and looks less like half-empty. Can end up being expensive (sold by weight).This is a very nice place to have a good ice cream, if you can pay for it.'
