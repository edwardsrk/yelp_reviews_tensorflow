b"I found this place when I was located in Madison several years ago, but unfortunately have moved away about two years ago. Ever since I've moved away, I look forward to the summers when I'm willing enough to return to Madison and always book a massage here when I do.From my first massage to my most recent one last week, Seth has done an amazing job at being friendly, helping me relax, using the right pressure, and never cutting edges with time or services. I've had a regular massage, hot stone massage, body wrap, and body scrub. Whatever you're looking for, call up Seth for a friendly and convenient booking at good prices, an excellent 5-star massage that I haven't found elsewhere, and a relaxing time that you won't regret."
