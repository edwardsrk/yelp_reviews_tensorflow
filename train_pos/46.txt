b'The server had an extensive knowledge of wines & their various menu selections and it was clear that we were her top priority. The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a "wine bar" feel. Otherwise everything was amazing!'
