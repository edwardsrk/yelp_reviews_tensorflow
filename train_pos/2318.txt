b"I grew up near here and now live in another province. Each time I come to Toronto I eat there with my son or my friend. The food is amazing but each time we order two laffas, always the laffa, don't bother with the pita, we regret it because it is so much food, one is enough for two normal people. To address the service, it is fine. I like the people behind the counter they have a good sense of humour and deliver on time."
