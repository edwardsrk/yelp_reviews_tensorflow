b"This was my first time here. Very cool and interesting concept. You pick a poke bowl or a poke roll from the menu or create your own. I picked the Ahi Lover roll. It's like a giant sushi roll, more like a wrap in seaweed paper or soy paper. Yummmm. Besides the fact that the young man helping me didn't know what was supposed to go in the roll, was clearly nervous and shaking, and I had to stop him from putting in crab and put in the tuna instead (you think Ahi Lover would give him a hint), overall it was very good. I will be giving this another shot to try something else."
