b'Great ambiance. If you can\'t decide between dinner and a lounge this is a good compromise. You get to eat and you still feel like you spent your night somewhere lounge-y and vegas-y.I agree it\'s loud (and dark) but it didn\'t bother me much. It took a while to be seated and get our food. I expected this a bit because it is Vegas after all and this is a "cool" place but it took a bit longer than what I\'d consider to be normal "hollywood buffer" standards (wow I sound kind of douchey) We had an additional minor issue w/ the food served but long story long... I was happy w/ management\'s response when we brought it to their attention. They had a great attitude about trying to make it right vs. arguing with us. Yes, that sounds crazy vague and bizarre but i wanted to give them points for it without going into the gritty details of our situation.Overall there\'s a lot to love about this place from ambiance, to drinks, to flavors of the food (all exceptional). the slowness of the kitchen, etc was very much overshadowed by the really good customer service we received. so Yay i\'m a fan. and yes i\'d be back.'
