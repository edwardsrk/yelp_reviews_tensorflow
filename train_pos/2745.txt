b"An excellent little restaurant.I had the salmon tartare, the calamari and a soup. For dessert, I had a strawberry pouding chomeur.Everything was delicious. The service was impeccable. The only thing is that they have some things on menu that I don't eat, so I am limited in my choices (ex: blood sausage, game...) But their salmon tartare is so so so amazing that it will have me coming back as a regular for sure."
