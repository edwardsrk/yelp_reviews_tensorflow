b'GREAT enchiladas!!! I really liked the taco also, much better shell then the normal corn ones. I also liked the bean dip and salsa with the chips. It is a nice touch we do not get back east. The margarita cupcake was also really nice!!!It took 15 minutes before anyone showed up to seat us... (not nice)'
