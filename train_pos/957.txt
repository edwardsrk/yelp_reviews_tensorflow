b"Both times I've been here the bartenders have been friendly, the beer (of which there is a great selection) has been cold and the food has been delicious. They've only been open a few weeks, but so far it looks like they've got a good thing going. It will be interesting to see if they're able to keep it up as they get busier, but I'm very much looking forward to this becoming a frequent stop on Mill."
