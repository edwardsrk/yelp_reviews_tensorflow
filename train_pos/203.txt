b"Came here with husband and bonus daughter while on vacation. Love the texting when your table is ready concept. The shakes are very yummy and incredibly filling. I got the expresso one. my husband the caramel bourbon and the 8 year old got the Smores. The Smores one comes with a roasted marshmallow on top! You get your glass of shake with tons of think, almost Fluff-like whipped cream on top plus the metal container that the shake was made in with all the extra that wouldn't fit in the glass.My husband got the Farmer Browns' burger and enjoyed it.I got the Hot Chick sandwich and it was incredible! The perfect combination of flavors and amounts of sauce, cheese, etc. Chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. The Bonus Daughter got the grilled cheese and for an extra $1 (only homemade chips come with the sandwiches) got the fries. She did not care for the fries. The fries were a bit overly salted and also had pepper and I want to say rosemary on them. I loved them but did try to scrape off some salt.The waitstaff was very friendly and we got to eat in the outdoor covered area. Great spot. Wish we had something like it close to home."
