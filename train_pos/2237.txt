b'The 10" Margherta pizza smelled fresh and yummy and the 4pc Chicken mix was also very tasty, but the chicken was a pinch salty but still juicy. The garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. Some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. The wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. Was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. Overall I give it a 8 1/2 out of 10.'
