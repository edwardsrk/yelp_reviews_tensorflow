b"Love this store! This is a massive store with a good layout and a nice women's and shel department. I usually come here to buy my shoes, since they have such a good selection. If I order anything online and have to return it, it's always a seamless process bringing it here for my refund. I always receive great customer service, although at times it takes a while to get someone to help me in the shoe department. It's usually cause they are busy there, but aside from that I enjoy my shopping experience here! Plus if you have the Nordstrom card you can accumulate Nordstrom notes for future purchases, which is fantastic."
