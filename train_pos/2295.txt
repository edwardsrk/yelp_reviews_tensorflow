b"I had previously dined at Mesa grill years ago and remember enjoying it so decided to return for lunch. Had smoked salmon club and spiced pork sandwich. Also had a cactus pear margarita. Everything that I had was very good with lots of flavor. Both sandwiches were excellent with good amount of meat to each sandwich. Perfect toast to the bread and sandwiches were both dressed well.  Probably prefer the smoked salmon club, but just a matter of personal preference as each sandwich was done well. I do think the fries that came with the sandwiches were weak component of meal as they were not crisp.  May have been a matter of them sitting on warming tray or perhaps is consequence of the basket that was used as serving dish that did not allow them to breathe.  They were however, well-seasoned w/ some sort of Southwestern spice mix.  The margarita was refreshing but not exactly a bargain at 15 bucks.  I guess thats what happens in Vegas.  All in all, it was a great lunch and I will go back again next time I'm in Vegas.  If they can fix the fries then it would be 5 stars."
