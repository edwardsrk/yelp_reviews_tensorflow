b'I finally move away from the West Valley and the coolest sushi joint opens up!I come out every now and then for the reverse happy hour because its is cheap! Everything is less than $5 and the sake bomber is $6.50. Not bad. What did I eat tonight?- Blue Flame roll- Baked mussels- Japanese Dynamite salad- Spicy tuna roll- Spicy Salmon roll- Salmon Skin rollI really like the friendly staff, I wish there were more to move the service along but that is really my only complaint. The food was amazing and done right. The fish was fresh and the rolls and I love the pickled ginger. Not that fake pink stuff.. the real deal. So fresh.'
