b'I was staying at the Hilton next door and got access to the YMCA.  Nice!  One of the days, I woke up with a sore throat.  Headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as I checked in.  Had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.  The lady at the front desk was so nice!  She brought me a cup of water because she noticed that I was coughing so much earlier.  Amazing service!  Now I wish I belonged to a YMCA back home.  Going to have to look into it for sure.'
