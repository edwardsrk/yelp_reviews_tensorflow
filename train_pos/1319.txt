b"This is the best burrito in Charlotte in my opinion.  I have been to Phat Burrito too and was unimpressed.  They have more meat selections than your typical Moe's, Chipotle, Qdoba, etc.  They load the burrito up with toppings and they don't charge extra for guac (YES!!).  The hot sauces they have are HOT and I love it!  It sucks this place is uptown or else I would be a regular."
