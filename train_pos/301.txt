b"I haven't tried anything but the El Jefe burrito which is often except for this last time they forgot the chorizo and the salsa but I called back and Travis was nice enough to give us another burrito he explained they we're very busy that morning with a huge order and could have gotten mixed up. I still love this place and just because Travis was so nice I will keep coming back."
