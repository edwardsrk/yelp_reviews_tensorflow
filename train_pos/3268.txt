b"Holy smokes!  I can see driving to Gilbert, AZ from Ventura County just to re-experience this delightful dining experience.  Flavor, flavor, flavor!  On our way back from our New Orleans road trip we detoured and took a chance on Joe's and it was well worth it.    We are bringing the kids next time so watch out!  By the way the G.I Joe's showcased were a nice touch."
