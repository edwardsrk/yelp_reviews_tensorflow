b"This is my last stop on the reign of terror of vegan hotspots in downtown Las Vegas.  It's a pizza shop in the plaza hotel with a vegan slice called the soho.  It's pretty majestic, including spinach, artichoke, and the Daiya cheese we all love.  The crust is chewy and delicious.  At other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla.  In my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me. Thumbs up!"
