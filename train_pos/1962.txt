b'My wife and I along with another two couples at here for dinner one night.  It was very fancy, classy and elegant.  The server was fantastic, very polite, knowledgeable about the food and items on the menu.  Showed genuine concern that we were having a good time and our food was cooked as requested.  Everything was great.  It is expensive but the food was worth it.  Steaks were perfect.  We enjoyed it, and spent a lot of money in the process.  Must make reservations.'
