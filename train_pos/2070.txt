b"Not much of a salad guy, but this place is a salad lover's Mecca. Anything you want. Huge bowl. Lots of stuff. They do an amazing job with their grilled tofu and shrimp, too. Love the flavor. Not too keen on their beverages or their bread/side options. The tomato basil soup is a little on the bland side.Make sure you're there when the cook who owns the salt shaker shows up. Love sitting outside though. Great place to eat at sunset. If you're the evening workout type, this is a an awesome place to grab something light before you head back home. I recommend the Chinese Shrimp Salad. Great combo of smokey, grilled shrimp and mandarin oranges.Overall and Elizabeth staple for a quick and healthy lunch."
