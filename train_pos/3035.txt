b'Some cretin at a store swiped my credit card information while ringing me up and then charged 3,000 bucks worth of stuff on my Keybank debit card.  I was in Florida at the time on a long term assignment, hundreds of miles from a Keybank.  I discovered the fraudulent charges when I checked my balance just before leaving on a road trip.  I called the customer service number and within a few hours all my money was back in my account.  They canceled my number and sent me an all new card by FedEx which arrived the next day at my destination. They made the whole recovery process so easy.  Miss this bank, big time.'
