b"i use to think this was one of the most boring places to drink ever.after saturday night, my opinion was changed. but only a little tiny tiny bit.random crowd. good drinks (drinks are strong, and the bartenders pour that long)..  and well, if you're so inclined, drugs could very easily be copped here. #dontdoit #drugsnevertheless, if you stay here long... you'll feel like hell the next day for sure."
