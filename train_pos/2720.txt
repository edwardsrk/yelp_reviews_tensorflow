b'First time ordering from here. Good food even if the sweet and sour pork was a bit over done. Portions for dinner combos look more like lunch portions compared to other chinese take outs. Food was warm, not hot. Egg rolls, fried wonton and crab ragoon were really good. Will order from here again.'
