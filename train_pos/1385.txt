b'Came here since we live in the neighborhood to try out some tacos. Being the seafood lover I also ordered the Agua Chile and I had to send it back :( it was wayyy too sweet and not the agua chile I know. The tacos are 6.50 a piece but are big. The waitress took back the agua Chile and brought me something new which is great customer service in my books. My daughter even said how sweet she was. I personally would only come back to try the posole. The tacos were delish I had the salmon and Baja and also tried the californian which was pretty good too.'
