b"This is a really nice, classy joint. Don't bring your punk friends here or try to act cute, got it? Good.Now for those who enjoy a good lunch: the portions are generous, the daily specials always are and they put ice in the mens room. This place also happens to be hidden in the coolest strip mall in all of Arizona. If you can't find it, you don't belong there."
