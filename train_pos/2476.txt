b'They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi, chinese, malaysian, thai, japanese) Cuisine Malaya does really well (as in, authentic) with some stuff, pretty well with the rest. Decent prices + me being able to sit down and have decently executed cuisine from 4 different asiatic countries for dinner = awesome.The lunch menu is limited but still very veg friendly. Dinner is where its at. I love malaysian curry (well, curry of any kind, really) and the Curry Vegetable Chef\'s special hits the spot. Okra and eggplant, tomato, tofu, green beans, yes yes. Oily, smokey curry and delicious coconut milk, yumm. Unless you\'re ravenous, the 11$ will be well spent, as you\'ll have lunch for the next day. And we all know curries improve overnight ;) They have both Thom Kha and Hot n Sour veg options, both soups I adore. Tofu can be added/subbed to almost anything here.All the sushi I\'ve had has been perfectly prepared, with good ingredients. The rolls aren\'t 80% rice, 20% stuff. They\'re also flexible about ingredients, something a lot of places are not (have them make you a vegetable tempura roll - delicious).I wish they had coconut rice, and gado gado. I don\'t get the "shrimp sauce" served with the hibachi items (a mixture of what tasted like mayo and ketchup, yikes). For my malaysian curry fix, however... I\'m stoked they\'re here.'
