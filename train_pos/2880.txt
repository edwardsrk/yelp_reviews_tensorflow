b"What a little gem this place turned out to be! From the outside it doesn't look like much but when you enter it is has an intimate feel about it. Almost like a Jazz house. The place is a little small but don't let it fool you, by 9 p.m. that place gets packed! I look forward to returning in the future for their local jazz/blues nights."
