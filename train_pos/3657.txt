b"This is my favorite McDonalds store in the local area.  It's clean, the staff is particularly nice and friendly, and the wifi is very fast.  There are electrical outlets in several locations if you want to work on your laptop.You can purchase food at the counter, drive through, delivery (uber eats). So convenient!If you want to save even more money, check out the McDonalds app. There are a half dozen coupons to get a free drink, fries or cone when you make any purchase and often have buy one get one free offers. Check out the overhead board for additional regular promotions as well.I help restaurants with their social media and online reputation and think the 2-stars they currently have is totally undeserved."
