b'I went to Aroma after reading the great reviews and looking up their awesome prices. Not only did I go on a Tuesday for the 15% off it was my first Brazilian. I went with Margo because she had a lot of great mentions. She was awesome, super personable and very quick. I will go back again for sure! The staff were friendly and the place looks quite clean.'
