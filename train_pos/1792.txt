b'this was actually really good....some of the best food I had in Vegas this entire trip. It was a tad pricey for alcohol, $11 for sangria (although, it was a pint)....and $15 for a salad with no meat (I assumed they would knock a couple bucks off for not wanting the meat). So the entire thing with tax and tip was $34. So i was a tad shocked.But...the service was fantastic. Super nice and helpful. And the salad was amazing. Tortialla shells on the bottom, with guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, avocado and beans.  Delish. Definitely could have used more beans, however. Overall it was a good experience, but like everything in Vegas...a tad pricey.'
