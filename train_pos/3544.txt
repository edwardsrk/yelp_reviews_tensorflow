b"I love this place. My friend introduced me to this place about 5 years ago and I eat there when ever I can. The food is great and the same people have worked there for years. If you're looking for a fancy restaurant this is not the place, if your looking for good food look no further. I like the Chicken Sharma and the Hummus is the best I have ever eaten. The portions are big and the prices are really good. It's hard to find a cheap, fast good quality restaurant but Haji Baba has it all."
