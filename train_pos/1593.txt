b"They do an amazing grooming job on my bichon/poodle mix dog, and in a timely manner. They don't accept credit cards and only accept cash, which is understandable for being a small business. They aren't as friendly as I would like and customer service isn't out of this world (it's not bad, just not great), but I think it's just because they may be understaffed and overworked. The grooming they do on my Zoe makes up for it!"
