b"Lots of really cute and unique baby items! I love the designer security blankets and burp cloths... Chic idea! They have really cute toys too. Love the little girl's pedicure kit! Staff is really friendly too. Never had a problem. A little pricy, but its a cute store. I'd gladly pay a little extra for unique items!"
