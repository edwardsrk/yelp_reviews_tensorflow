b"This was recommended to me by a co-worker, based on my love of wine.  We brought out the readers, inspected the novel size wine list and placed our order.  Our waiter, Ray (who was awesome by the way!) told us that they *might not have that bottle, and that if they didn't, he would find something similar.  That made me nervous, but sure enough he found a really good bottle of wine and charged us what the other bottle would have been!  I had the filet, ordered medium and most of it was excellent, but there was a slight section in the very middle that was very rare.  The piece of meat was so big, that by the time I got to the middle, I was full.  The sauce on it was ok.  The Asiago bread was amazing!  There were 3 of us and we decided to split a dessert.  We asked Ray what his fav was, and we ordered the Cereal Killer.  OMG!!!  Don't leave without ordering that!"
