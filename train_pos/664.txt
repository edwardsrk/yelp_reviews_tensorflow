b"Went here for brunch with friends! Had an extremely positive experience. Servers seemed tired, but continually refilled cups of water and chips and salsa.The breakfast tacos were large. 3 were enough to fill you up. I got the crab cake, chorizo hash, and chimi churri. The crab cake and slaw were my favorite of the 3, but all were good.Got a blood orange mimosa, but wouldn't recommend it. It's mixed with cider, not champagne, and the drink felt heavy for brunch."
