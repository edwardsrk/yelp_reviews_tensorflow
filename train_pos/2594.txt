b'Excellent food! Watan Kabob is amazing in taste and speed. Had a Tandoori Chicken dish and I loved the taste. The Vege salad portion was quite small yet the positive is that it had more vegetables than leaves. Went with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed the food.Staff are very friendly and is happy to make suggestions.The only reason I gave a 4 star is because of the restaurant outlook. Pretty ordinary. However, there is a lot of natural light coming in.'
