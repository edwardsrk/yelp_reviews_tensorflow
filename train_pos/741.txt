b"There are two towers here at the Palms. The one over the casino offers rooms to the public. They have a food court, buffet and a few nicer restaurants. The other tower is where we stayed.  You can book through vrbo or airbnb etc. Most of the units are owned and rented out by the owners. The front desk handles the check in and house keeping. We came in for some r and r as well as a concert. The rooms have full kitchens with plates,  pots and silverware etc. Stove, refrigerator and dishwasher. The bathrooms are awesome, nicely tiled. Very  large bath tubs. Separate large shower with an overhead fixture as well as the regular sprayer.Bed was super comfy and was set up with four pillows. Nice balcony  (27th floor) and view.No casino in this tower, but there is a second floor connector tunnel that will take you to the casino. There's also one restaurant.We paid $330 total for two nights, not bad."
