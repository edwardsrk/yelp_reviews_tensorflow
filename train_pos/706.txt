b'Great food.  Tacos are wonderful.  Service is prompt and friendly.  I had some issues with the air quality inside; because of my asthma I was pretty done after an hour sitting inside.  However on the plus side, they have a nice seating space outside for a few tables.  I would sit outside next time.  And there will be a next time for sure!'
