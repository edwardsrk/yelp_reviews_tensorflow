b'Traveled to NC to visit a friend and she took me to this place. She explained that the biscuits and grits (which I had never had) were amazing. She was 100 percent right! The place is very quaint and unique, which I loved. They seemed to be very busy, which was a great sign for the business. We waited for around 20 minutes and it was definitely worth the short wait time. The apple butter that goes on the biscuits could be addictive, if I lived closer. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area or visiting.'
