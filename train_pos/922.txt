b"I eat here a lot and it's usually pretty consistent. They have MANY yummy options. Sometimes their fried stuff (tots, waffle dogs, etc.) are overdone and taste greasy, their Jalape\xc3\xb1o biscuits and gravy are super tasty but they have overcooked them a time or two. That being said, if I ever have an issue, they always graciously apologize and take care of it which rights any wrong in my eyes. It's not wether you make mistakes but how you fix them that matters. Thanks Over Easy for making my family happy time and time again! Oh, one thing that would make my family even happier would be a kid's plate (like some cereal and sliced bananas) since the waits can be very long and little ones tend to get cranky."
