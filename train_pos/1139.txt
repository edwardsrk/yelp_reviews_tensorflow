b'Had to check off another place from my list before we headed home. SERVICE - Our waiter was really nice! He made our dinner very enjoyable. FOODPretzels & Cheese - They are very generous with their pretzels and cheese portions. In San Diego, we usually only get maybe four pieces out of what they gave us here. And we are used  to getting cheese in a tiny little bowl. Here, you actually get enough cheese to finish your pretzels! Fish Tacos - This was okay. Always on a fish taco hunt but these are standard. Nothing spectacular. AB Cheeseburger - There was a different flavor to the sauce that they used but I can put my finger on it. It was an overall solid burger. I can see this spot being a great one when there is a game! Very convenient.'
