b"After 2 years of trying to go at it (unsuccessfully) alone on a short sale, I was referred to Xenophone by my real estate agent. I am so grateful I found them! I first met with Xenophone and he spent about an hour answering every question that we had during our first meeting. When we arrived, Xenophone had already reviewed our file and had a recommended course of action. We learned a lot about the process and had a sense of comfort about his knowledge and track records with success on our type of short-sale. We were able to work out a convenient payment plan and retained Panda & Associates services when we left.It took four months and countless hours by Xenophone's staff to get this short sale approved. We are in the final stages now so its not completed but looking encouraging.The staff here is extremely responsive, very good about communicating and always prompt with updates. We had a few close calls with the sales date looming and the staff put in overtime with late/early calls to work on our account.Ill update when everything is finalized, but at this point, I have been happy to refer my family and friends to this firm and have only positive feedback."
