b"A nice stop for my mid day lunch out of the 108 degree heat. The chicken was very good and I tried a beer (or two) that I hadn't had before, so it was a good experience. SRSLY, I was in and out in about 45 minutes, which was perfect for my lunch hour. Would def come back again with more time. Waitress was friendly, service was prompt and restroom was clean. All good here."
