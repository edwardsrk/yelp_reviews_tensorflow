b'So...I have never made it in here for their famous brunch, because it always looks so darn crowded, with a super long wait!  Regardless, I have had their food at any number of events, and it never ceases to amaze!  In addition to eating in at their charming location, talk to them about catering if you want your event to be really remembered.  A high number of vegan and vegetarian options, in addition to those with meat.  These gals are truly accommodating.'
