b'My husband and I ordered the special dinner for two which included soup, appetizers, two entrees and rice.  The egg drop soup was good, the appetizer platter was so much food but by the time we finished it, we were too full to eat our dinners other than just taste them. We got teriyaki chicken and kung pao chicken and both were very good, although we wished the teriyaki glaze would have been thicker. The ingredients in the entrees were very fresh and nice. Service was courteous and prompt, as was the food. We got to go boxes and have enough food left over for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely go back there again the next time we are in the mood for Asian food.'
