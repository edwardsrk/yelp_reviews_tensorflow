b"This is my one-stop neighborhood shop for supplements and natural products.Every time I drop by Noah's I end up leaving with items I didn't know I wanted!  And it's okay because you feel like you are doing your body a favour!If there's a disaster and you can't take refuge in a Wal-mart you could totally live out of a Noah's.* You have hemp soap and natural shampoos* Overpriced-but-clean-burning incense (not useful in disaster situations but smells nice)* All the vitamins and supplements you need* Food section with sugar-free coconut water, gluten free cupcakes and cookies, and quinoa-almond crisps, etc.I love shopping here.However, do your own research.Unfortunately, some of the staff spend too much time in drum circles instead of learning about their own products.  I didn't agree with their recommendations on a few occasions.  But, it never hurts to ask because it really depends on who serves you.I overheard a staff member telling a customer that Asian people have young looking skin because of all the chicken feet we eat.  (raise eyebrow)Regardless, I still (organic) heart Noah's! =)"
