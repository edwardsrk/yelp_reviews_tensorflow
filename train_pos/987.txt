b'Every aspect of Best Ellen last night was Eggcellent !Service was great- I had a million and one questions for the server and he patiently/happily answered all of them. When we stayed longer than 2 hours and the next party came to claim our table, our server moved us to another table but have us 3 desserts on the house for the inconvenience of moving.  They were Divine!!  The oysters, steak tartar, rabbit pasta and flank steak were all incredibly delicious. The drinks were eclectic and scrumptious as well. I am definitely going back to try the burger.'
