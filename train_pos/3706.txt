b"I don't think words can describe how much I love Brew Tea Bar! What makes it even better is that it's only a couple minutes away from my house! I literally go here every day, it's pretty embarrassing..On my first visit, I ordered the Honey Milk Tea with honey boba and pudding, which was alright. I also tried their caramel slushy (I don't' know exactly what it's called) but it was waaaay too sweet for me. My boyfriend then introduced me to my favorite drink, Hokkaido Milk Tea with honey boba (also good with grass jelly) !!! I'm so in love with this drink, you have no idea! It's all I ever get and I refuse to drink anything else, because it's THAT good. If you like milky drinks like I do, then I highly recommend getting the Hokkaido Milk Tea! I recommend trying their crepes as well!Not only is their boba perfect, but they also have excellent customer service! I love how they are willing to adjust your drink to your liking. I also love how the employees remember me and my boyfriend! We come here so often that sometimes they give us a large instead of a regular drink, which is AWESOME!This place just has really chill vibes and a friendly environment. I don't think I'll ever go to another boba place, because this is honestly the best one we have in Vegas."
