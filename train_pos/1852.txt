b"Ah, Mr. Cooks... your food is delicious,Your menu is a tasty item menagerie.Your dining area cleanliness is suspicious,Always opt for pick-up or delivery.I have never been disappointed with my meal,Egg rolls, sweet and sour pork all tasty.But the people on the phones, what's the deal?At least the food is always done hastily."
