b'What a cool little bookstore.I really like how the place is set up.  It just looks "right" in ways that I can\'t describe.  It looks almost mysterious, which for a bookstore, I like that feeling.Great selection of books.  I like places like this because browsing pays off.  You never know what you are going to find on any given visit or day.  It really is a journey into the unknown.If you like old books, or not knowing what to expect with the experience of discovering something new, this is a great place to visit.But yes, the potential damage it could do to your bank account in terms of buying stuff could be a little frightening.'
