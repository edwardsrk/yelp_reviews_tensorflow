b"A Yelp Talk query called my attention to the fact that I'd never posted a review, even though I've enjoyed this spot at Tivoli several times over the years. Yes, it is a Cigar Lounge, housing a large humidor with excellent stogies, but it is more, and worth exploring, even if you don't smoke cigars. Of course they have a wide selection of single malts, cognac and typical spirits which accompany puffing away; they also have a full bar. The decor is dark and rich, and seating is comfortable; very men's clubby feeling to me, in a good way. Staff has always been knowledgeable and welcoming, friends who dig cigars like the variety, and the live music we have caught at times added an extra cool vibe. A nice place to have a nightcap in Tivoli. * cigars to suit any taste or budget * ** nice selection of single malts, whiskey, cognac, and full bar ***** knowledgeable, friendly staff ******* live music some evenings ****"
