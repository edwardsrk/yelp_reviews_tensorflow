b"I always like to find a juice place as soon as I get somewhere new.There isn't a huge selection of juices here but the thing that really sold me on these guys is how good their acai bowls are. Everything is just SUPER fresh and tasty, it actually feels good going down and you can change up the toppings too! I haven't tried the cold pressed juices here yet but the fresh juices are great too!"
