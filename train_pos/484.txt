b"I love this place! I have been four times now and it is fresh, consistent and reasonable. I usually get the Spicy maki-combo and a wakame salad.  Plus, the owners are so very cheerful! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I would like to sit in and eat, and save on so much packaging."
