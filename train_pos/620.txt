b"Definitely will go back...best wonton soup I've ever had. I got the Pai Thai which my waitress said was the same as Pad Thai however I was not a fan....it was very soupy and tasted a little like barbecue sauce honestly. I would not get that again but I tried my friends food and everything else was delicious! Seemed very authentic."
