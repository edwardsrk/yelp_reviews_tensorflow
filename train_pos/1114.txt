b'My review is not going to help you solve the great bagel debates of 1) St. Viteur v. Fairmount, or 2) Montreal bagels v. NYC style. What I can offer is a whole-hearted endorsement of all things made of carbohydrates. Montreal bagels are delicious. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron, or a liar. They are sweeter than the NYC style, and a lot less doughy. I find that less dough- equals a better carb to cream cheese ratio. Fairmount bagels are wonderful. You will have to wait in line for them- but they are worth it. I ordered a to-go bag of 12. There are a lot of flavors to choose from including: All-dressed, Garlic, sesame, chocolate, cinnamon-raisin, "a sweet bagel" (whatever that is), poppy seed, plain, etc. My favorite was the garlic bagel, second places goes to all-dressed. Fairmount does not have a toaster- so you\'ll have to eat your bagels "raw" or bring them home and prepare them. Fairmount sells cream cheese - in a few different varieties, and can direct you to a good lox shop down the street. They also sell day-old bagels at a discount, already helpfully arranged in bags, to the side of the counter.Bagel-sellers speak English. They are excellent at handling complex orders and are efficient at gathering all of your beloved demands. Open 24 hours a day. It\'s a good place to shop for vacation "presents" for your jealous friends and family. Last word of advice: Fairmount bagels keep well in the freezer. If you freeze you bagels- you just need to zap them for approximately 30 seconds- and as if they are fresh again.'
