b"Delicious sandwiches- and it's in my neighborhood.A new addition to the Ohio City growing restaurant scene, I was pretty happy to see a sandwich place open up. Sometimes I just really want a hot solid fresh sandwich- and lo and behold, Herb n Twine appeared!It's a cute space- maybe 4-5 tables, and it was completely full when we went for a late lunch around 2pm on Saturday. I ordered the Korean fried chicken sandwich, he got the meatball sandwich, and we got a cup of tomato bisque to top it off (hey, why not).First of all- the BREAD. They use delicious, thick, crunchy bread- none of that soft, soggy, falling apart bread- the bread they use is good quality. It almost reminded me of banh mi bread- but slightly different. Nonetheless, the bread was delicious.Second- the ingredients are fresh. Delicious and fresh!!We were actually surprised how big our sandwiches were too. They were both very flavorful- I had kind of wanted my Korean fried chicken to be spicy (bc, well, most Korean anything is), which it was not, but it was still good. His meatball sandwich was really good meat as well.The tomato bisque was delcious too- not too salty (which, being more of a broth soup kind of person, I personally dislikes super salty soups, so theirs was GREAT), which even came with almost garlic like type of bread croutons. I'm not sure what they were, but they sure were delicious in our soup!Overall, I really liked this place for a solid sandwich- if you're looking for a quick and solid sandwich shop- deflinitely stop by Herb n Twine."
