b"I've liked Blue Martini ever since it opened, but the visits have been few and far between, because it's pretty far away from where I live.  But we were invited to a private party, so who can resist unlimited free booze and food??  Servers were very efficient, and we never had to wait very long to give a drink order or get the drink.  Lots of different appetizers were served, finger foods that were mostly fried.  Pigs in blankets, mini crab cakes, and a host of others that were tasty.  Though I usually don't order them, I couldn't resist, since this was dinner for us. There were plenty of tables for seating.An excellent cover band was playing, but unfortunately I never did get their name.  Good music, and the girl singer had a great voice.Great evening at Blue Martini, and hope not to stay away as long!"
