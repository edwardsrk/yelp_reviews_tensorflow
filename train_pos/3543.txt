b"Back in August, I was wanting to get a massage so I asked my girlfriend Jenny if she had any good but affordable recs. She suggested Suzanne & I called right away to try & make an appt for that wknd. Unfortunately, she was already booked but had an opening the following Sunday, so I immediately took the spot for a 90 min classic massage. I had a lil trouble finding the location but I called Suzanne & she was able to guide me, even with my horrible direction skills-I am by a, uh building with balconies. Lol bless her heart! Suzanne is very personable & makes you feel at ease. We spoke some during my massage but not too much where I couldn't enjoy it. She applied the right amount of pressure for my preference & I was in heaven the entire time. My 2nd experience with Suzanne was late September, my mom got me a massage as a gift. This time I chose the lava shell massage. If you have ever experienced a hot stone massage, this is similar. But in my opinion so much better! I am going to try & see Suzanne once a month or at least every other month. I used to think massages were not necessary & just too expensive, but that was before I experienced Time For You with the amazing Suzanne! :) *Also, she has a website with a ton of info on it: www.timeforu.net"
