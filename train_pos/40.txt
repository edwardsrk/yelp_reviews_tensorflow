b"Lakes Lounge is a great place to have a meal. My husband and I read a review about our neighborhood eatery 4 years ago and have been fans ever since. We work hard and like to treat ourselves to a great meal and this place competes easily with your top establishments.  The food is exceptional along with the great customer service. We love all the people who work there but watch out for Brandon...he does not make you feel welcome or gives the excellent customer service as the other employees. You will absolutely agree when I say that Lakes Lounge is a fabulous place to dine, but just avoid Brandon. He doesn't do this place justice by being an employee there and probably should re-evaluated.  Maybe the owners should have a secret shopper eat there to understand what I'm talking about. If it were not for the other staff there I would take our business elsewhere. Don't let one BAD APPLE...well you know the rest"
