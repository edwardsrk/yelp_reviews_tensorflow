b"Great sushi joint at Hilldale. You cannot beat their lunch specials. My personal fave is the chef's choice of 3 rolls for $10. Yes, TEN dollars. It includes one veggie, one seafood and then one random. It's the best lunch deal around. The seaweed salad is hit and miss and can quickly double your lunch bill at an additional $7.The restaurant is small and fills up quickly, but if there's room, sit at the sushi bar! The guys are super nice and always willing to answer any questions!"
