b'This restaurant an amazing place to stop while traveling especially for gluten free food. The town is cute and the food was great. The cedar plank salmon was a one sitting proportion. It tasted great. The gluten free options were limited but were different from what is typical when eating out.  The squash and cashew meal was delicious. I highly recommend it.'
