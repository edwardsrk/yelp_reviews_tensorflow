b"FOOD: 5 stars. My food was amazing. I ordered a meal that essentially boils down to pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, and potatoes. But Eggspectation does it a bit differently in that all the items were STACKED. A bottom pancake with bacon on top, flanked by a middle pancake with sausage, and finally another pancake topped with an egg. It was delicious. Not an especially novel concept but combined with the absurdly delectable 100% pure Canadian syrup, this was a winner.VALUE: 4 stars. The price wasn't too bad, but this was close to the most expensive breakfast I had on my trip to Montreal. To be honest, any restaurant can make the brunch Eggspectation does, but I won't knock off too many points, considering the mood and ambiance of their outdoor seating is pretty top-notch.SERVICE: 3 stars. Our waiter wasn't the friendliest. I legitimately don't think he smiled a single time. When I asked for a straw, he seemed mildly annoyed and brought me one without the wrapper. That was kind of strange.TL;DR VERDICT: 4 stars. The food is great and the atmosphere is so Montreal, and despite a higher-than-average price and a blistering waiter who shall remain nameless, I'll be back if I ever visit the Royal Mountain."
