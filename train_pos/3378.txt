b'I had a 2pm appointment, arrived 15 minutes early. At exactly 2pm, "Chad" came and escorted me to CPAP room. Although I have been on a CPAP machine for at least 10 years and I knew the drill, Chad was very professional and explained the machine, functions, equipment, etc. He also recommended a different mask and headgear than what I had previously requested and it was much more comfortable than the one I wanted. I was very satisfied with the treatment I received from Chad. He is an asset to Bennett. I will point out that I left another local CPAP supply company last week after getting the run around from them. My pulmonary Doctor ordered a new CPAP after I had another sleep study done. I had to contact Preferred CPAP Supplies and ask the status of my new machine. I was rudely told that I wasn\'t the only customer and the insurance paperwork took awhile. I reported that company to my doctor\'s office and was referred to Bennett Medical by them, and immediately cancelled my appointment and scheduled with Bennett. Bennett had my insurance approval and paperwork done in two days where the other local company wasted 3 weeks of my time and gave excuses. I had been with this other company for 4 years. I called Bennett on a Friday, had my appointment and machine, etc, the following week. Thank you Chad for your expertise.'
