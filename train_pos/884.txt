b"OK, I am a sucker for Queso Fundido, so my dining experience was off to an incredible start. The fundido was hot, but not scathing and had a great consistency. Then the blue corn tortilla with duck. The duck just melted.  I ordered dinner, not thinking about how full I would be from the appetizers, but I powered through.I ordered the 16 spice chicken. Just the right blend of spices (no I don't know what they were), the right amount of spicy, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.So I was to full to have dessert.My only complaint is that the staff stood around a lot, in full view. Which is really frustrating if you are waiting on something. As an added bonus we could hear them complain about other waitstaff, what they were doing after work... Really do that in the kitchen on on your own time. This knocks it down a star."
