b"I live in what might possibly be one of the finest cities for sushi in the US....yep, Los Angeles (Feel free to argue or debate this point with me and then tell me where to go, cuz I am a sushi ho!). Specifically, I live in Studio City; the home of sushi row, the land of sashimi wonderment and the prime pallate real estate that holds faves like Asanebo, Nozawa and Iroha. So imagine the pressure my co-worker, Gabi K, was under to find a sushi place worthy of my snobby and know-it-all sushi taste buds.She chose Yasu and dammit, she chose well! I thoroughly enjoyed the tasty treats we had here last night and I would definitely come back if I lived here. I really liked the hamachi with jalapeno. It was a little light on the ginger sauce, but still very good. We also tried the tuna carpaccio that mixed walnuts with it. Very different and very good. We also tried one of the featured scallop specials that was good, but a little too heavy on the scallions for my taste. I wanna taste the scallops and they got a little lost in the onion madness. We also tried the shishito peppers, good, but a really small portion and the eggplant. Oh and I can't forget to mention the miso-marinated black cod. Very deelish.Definitely check it out. The atmosphere is nice and charming, the service is attentive and helpful and they serve a nice Pinot Grigio to boot. Good times :)"
