b"I was debating between doing this one and Battlefield Vegas. I am definitely glad that I decided to go with the Best Bang for Your Buck Groupon experience for two at Gun Garage. Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. Once we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. In all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like. All in all though this is definitely the perfect venue for people who have never held a gun in their hands before."
