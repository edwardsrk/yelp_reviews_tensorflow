b"This was a great art museum. With three buildings to go around to, you're sure to find some piece that will be your favorite amongst them. There's a parking lot associated with the museum but it's very small. However, there's plenty of FREE street parking all around so that's probably your best bet. Ticket costs $20, $15 with a student discount, and $10 with a military discount. The cafe and shop were a little on the smaller side which is weird because there's a giant open space right next to both so they have room to expand. Despite this, it's worthwhile to take a couple hours and visit this awesome museum with unique exhibits and art pieces!"
