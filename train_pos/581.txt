b"Can't say it's the best sushi I've ever had but definitely found it good. I would go back. All the roles were tasty. I didn't particularly like the special queen, that's because I'm not a big fan of cooked salmon. It was too fishy for my liking. The rest were quite good. I particularly liked the chef sushi and Mexican role. One small disappointment was the staff didn't remind me that if I ordered 25$ or more u get a. Futumakis free. Ive been to other shops and alway was told when my order was clearly over. Once I paid I let them know it was cool that it wasn't mentioned. So look at the first page when U order and remind them to include the bonus role :)"
