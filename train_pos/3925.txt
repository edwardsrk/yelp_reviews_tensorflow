b'The food here was amazing. We ordered the Las Vegas platter for 4 and there was a ton of food. For 4 adults it is a really good amount. Make sure you come hungry. I also recommend the bulgogi bibimbap. It was so tasty. Really, there was nothing we did not enjoy. The sides were good and plentiful and the meats were seasoned very well. The only thing we regret is not being able to finish it all because we got so full.'
