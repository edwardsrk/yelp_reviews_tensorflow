b'Appears they fixed the service problem. We saw 2 servers this night and both were on the ball and very knowledgable. Phew!The food was delish! best Butter Chicken I have ever had and was just the right heat. My husband got a lamb Masala extra hot and he built up quite a sweat. My sons tandoori chicken came out of the kitchen literally steaming hot. It was a little spicier than most tandoori chicken we have had but it was moist and flavorful. LOTS of vegetarian choices on the menu and the server suggested coming for the lunch buffet because there are lots of optionsThe atmosphere is very nice and Bollywood videos are always fun to watch.'
