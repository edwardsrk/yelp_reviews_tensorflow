b'Went for breakfast on an early Wednesday morning.  I was the first one there a few minutes after 7 am.  Super friendly and prompt service.  Comfortable and funky decor that I really liked.  Excellent coffee, and they brewed fresh decaf for me on request after 2 cups of regular.  I had the avocado omelet, which was pretty good, but I think they forgot the jalepeno cheese in it.  $10.50 tab, before tip.  I would probably go back again -- but would check out some other places in the neighborhood first.  Seems like a friendly and funky place.'
