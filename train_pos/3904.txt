b"Wow, just got take out for the first time last night. Seaweed Salad, California Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. The salad was fresh and delicious with a slight hint of heat. Very, very good. The rolls were both delicious as well. Very fresh and the rice was light and fluffy. The kind of sushi I like to close my eyes and enjoy while eating it. When I went to pick it up, I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was inside. It's just a tiny storefront next to an auto parts store. My wife and I will be going in soon to try more food."
