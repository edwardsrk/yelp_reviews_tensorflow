b"After waiting years for this to finally open (and moving 2 years ago) I finally tried it out on my way back to St. Louis from the Chicago area.  It was after 2 pm, so no idea how things are during peak times.  I liked the atmosphere, although the AC was at arctic levels.  I enjoyed my food and drink, but since I was traveling, I just got a sampler of the Altercation (a good compromise between light and dark), and the spinach salad (enjoyed the maple bacon dressing) and the Cuban Pork.  Recommended stop in downtown Champaign - in the large condo tower on Neil in downtown.  There's a gigantic parking deck behind it, or metered parking in the city lot across the street, where there are 2 Zipcars stationed.  Good move, Champaign."
