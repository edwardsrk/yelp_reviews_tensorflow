b'This place was able to get me in very quickly as a walk in. They have great pricing and a comfortable atmosphere. They are only four stars, however, because my manicurist could have been gentler. My cuticles were a little sore afterwards! Services were overall great though. I got a full set coffin style for $30 and a honey sugar scrub pedicure for $27.'
