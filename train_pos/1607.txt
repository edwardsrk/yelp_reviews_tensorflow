b'Totally an unsuspecting place.  You see a place next to a gas station and you don\'t assume good food but Sam\'s is actually pretty damn good.  Decent price for a gyro combo that includes pretty good fries and a soda.  Can\'t hate that.  The gyros are huge and full of all sorts of goodness.  Still not the best gyro ever...but pretty good for "gas station food."'
