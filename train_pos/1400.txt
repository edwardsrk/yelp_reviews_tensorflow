b"I've been taking my puppy to see Dr. Claus at South Shores Animal Hospital for about  4 months now. The service here is spectacular and Dr. Claus is an excellent vet. Anytime we've come in with an issue, he's been able to successfully diagnose and cure my puppy.My puppy had dental surgery here as well and everything went smoothly and perfectly. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because of their grooming. The groomer isn't very kind and doesn't seem to know much about customer service. That's ok though, I'll just get grooming done elsewhere. I highly recommend this vet!"
