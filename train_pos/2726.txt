b"Love the Korean BBq with Yellow Rice (but I think it's a Java Rice) it is perfect. They don't have a lot of selection on their Menu but every day they have some specials you just have to ask.  The good thing about it all their food are not frozen, they cooked it the same day you order and it's a family-owned business so Food tastes like Home-cooked. Lutong Bahay-sabi nila paglutong bahay  kumple- tos rekados."
