b"So far, so good. Ever since Mike, formerly of Leslie's was asked to leave there, I've been coming here. The prices are pretty good, and I've even found a new Mike to answer my pool questions. One of my new discoveries is the gallon jugs of chlorine. It does the trick, just as well as 2 bags of Shock for the same price. The major plus is a cleaner back-wash and a lack of powder residue. I'm a happy customer and I approve this Review. LOL"
