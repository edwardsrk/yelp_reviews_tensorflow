b"Love boba tea house cause they will redo your drink if you don't like it! Sometimes the service is really good and sometimes they look like they hate u. Overall their drinks are yummy I like their flavored teas. But their boba is flavorless so I usually get the jellies. I wish the place was bigger so there's more seating cuz it's usually busy. Also the snacks are good and the owner is super friendly!"
