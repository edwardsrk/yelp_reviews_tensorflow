b"Are you craving pierogis? All Pierogi Kitchen is the place to go to fulfill that craving! The pierogis were authentic, made fresh in house, and filling. Every bite was deliciousness. All of the pierogis tasted good and we even recommend trying out the dessert pierogis. On the outside, the building looked sketchy but we were glad we weren't deterred away. The restaurant inside was clean and had a homey vibe. The service was attentive and friendly and we recommend checking out the market attached to the restaurant."
