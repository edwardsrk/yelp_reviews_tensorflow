b"First of all, this is a budget hotel currently under renovation.  Therefore all the mediocre reviews below should take into account that this property is in transition.  I first stayed here back in the 80's and gradually watched it deteriorate.  So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. * Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.  Paying $10 a day for wireless is a bit too much.I would stay here again.  Another plus, the Airport Express bus stops right at the door taking you to Pearson aiport for $20 (or $18 online)."
