b"If you covet Onitsuka Tigers the way I covet Onitsuka Tigers, you'll fall in love with Groovy.They have the best OT selection in the city - like, an entire floor-to-ceiling wall covered with Tigers in every colour imaginable. I bought my beloved Mexico 66s as well as another hot pink pair with lime green detailing. If you walk past the massive Asics and Adidas displays you'll see tons of Doc Martens, Rocket Dog, PF Flyers and Converse shoes in the back, along with other Onitsuka Tigers/Asics models that are either older models or available in limited sizes. As far as I remember they don't sell Nikes here (exception is Converse). The staff is a bit overwhelmed most times so service can be slow. Group your shoe size requests to minimize trips and expedite the process.And don't forget - no refunds under any circumstances, and they are REAL sticklers about it. I bought a pair of shoes here once and ended up finding them cheaper three days later, so I wanted to return the unworn/still tagged first Groovy pair, but no. I ended up selling them a year later on Craigslist for double the price, so I guess I won in the end."
