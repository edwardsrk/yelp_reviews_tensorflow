b"PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!Burger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. Service was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. Kinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all, and there is some interesting religious art work on the walls."
