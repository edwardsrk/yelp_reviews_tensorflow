b'Recommended by a local and co-worker. "Don\'t let the wait scare you" she said. Apprehensive by her comment, I rolled in solo at noon on a Wednesday. I was seated immediately. The wait staff speaks in French and English. They were overly  nice and accommodating. I ordered the Soupe de jour -yummy culinary concoction with sausage AND "the Cubain". A hot toasted flat bread with sliced seasoned pork, perfectly selected melted cheese and pickled mayonnaise. Delicious beyond delicious. Bon appetit!'
