b"I have been so happy to see Heist turn things around from when they were not producing good beer years ago. Our recent visit during Queens Feast Restaurant Week was not quite five-stars, as we were seated at a two-top that had lots of server/waiter traffic rushing by, but it didn't get in the way of us wanting to come back.Interestingly enough, it was the focaccia and desserts that stole the show; our main courses were good, just not as memorable. I love their wings and really enjoy their beer, so overall the food gets high marks in my book. As is expected in NoDa, parking was limited on a busy Friday night. I was particualry impressed with the ka kau and brunch junkie beers and the blackberry pickin sour had real bright color and full flavor. Keep it going Heist! I look forward to seeing how popular the new event space is that just opened."
