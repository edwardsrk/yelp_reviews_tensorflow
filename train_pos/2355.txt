b'I have been to Pink Taco twice and have enjoyed both times. The first time I got the chile rellano which is stuffed with refried beans which is odd but tasty. The second time I got a vegetable burrito which was also good. The portions are huge I always need a box the end. Another great thing is the chips and the three different kinds of salsas which I could eat by itself. Only thing that sucked was the kids cup sized margarita for $10.00. I was like "come on"-- "Seriously." If you get a choice sit outside it was nice. P.s. Guacamole is not chunky but had alot of onion in it which I think is good.'
