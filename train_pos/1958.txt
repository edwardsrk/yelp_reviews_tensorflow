b"'Large beef, extra meat please!' is what I always say when I come in. Hidden on International 17th Ave, this place is one of the gems Calgary has to offer.For me, I always ask for little sauce cause I think they generally load up on that. Every time I eat here (which is very late), I always taste that little crisp in the beef, which I like. I don't recall any other shawarma places in this city that have that kind of texture. One of my two favorite shawarma places to go in this city. My only knock on them is that I wish they would put more spice in the beef."
