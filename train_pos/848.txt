b'This is the place you come to when you are on a budget and need a sushi fix. It\'s honestly a bang for your buck! We ordered the red dragon, rainbow, black dragon, spicy salmon, salmon ginger wasabi roll and one assorted tempura. (We also got complimentary enoki beef rolls because they messed up an order!) Oh, and I can\'t forget the complimentary miso soup and ice cream. All of this came up to a sweet $58 and some. Obviously the quality can\'t be compared to Guu down the street.. But still quality sushi regardless. The rolls could be a little more creative, but it\'s not a big deal. The ingredients still mingled. Presentation wise.. Well honestly when you pay for fast service and cheap quality food.. Who cares!  Avocado was bang on (total pet peeve when they\'re not fresh or browning), portions were reasonable and sashimi was fresh. Service is always fast at this place. The only thing I dislike about Sushi on Bloor is the "waiting area" in the front. It often gets busy and results in a 10-15min wait for a table. People often line up in this tiny corridor between the inside/outside doors.. It gets way too congested and makes me feel super impatient with all the people brushing past me. Stop shoving me!! I\'m hungry and cranky too! Well despite the cranky and hungry sushi lovers...My sushi craving has been satisfied tonight!'
