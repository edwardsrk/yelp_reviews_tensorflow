b"I've driven by this place countless times on my way to work but finally got the chance to stop by early this afternoon. There was another couple sitting outside (they only had 2 tables with 2 little chairs outside, so not much of a patio incase anyone was curious). Anywho, me and my boyfriend took a couple of minutes to decide what to try because there were at least 30 flavors to choose from. The small and medium give you 2 flavors to try from, the large gives you 3. He chose the small with coconut and mango gelato and I had the small Oreo and dolce de leche. The coconut tasted AMAZING. But the mango was the show stopper, it was amazing. To anyone who loves the fruit, this is just as good if not better (yes, I went there!)The Oreo tasted like plain vanilla. I barely tasted any cookie pieces. So avoid it unless you want a plain vanilla taste. The dolce de leche was really good, a little on the sweet side but still enjoyable. All in all, we paid about $11 for both small gelatos. It was worth the price and if ever I'm on the danforth and craving something cold & sweet, this is where I'll go!"
