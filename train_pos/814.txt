b"I have been eating at Cabo for years now...before NoDa became the conglomerate that it is now.  The food is consistently good.  The flour tortillas that they use for their tacos are delicious all in their own.  I love the queso dip (the best I've had) and I've eaten at plenty mexican restaurants.  The Wraps are great and filling as are the entrees.  I will say that yes, at times, the chips are stale and the salsa isn't anything to write home about but who cares...it's an appetizer and it's free! I've never been impressed with their Margaritas so I usually stick w/Modelo or a Sweet Tea.  It is also a good place to take out-of-towners or maybe a first date.  It is usually VERY noisy so don't expect to have a super romantic time here unless you are a very laid back type of couple."
