b"Just had AccuTemp move and then reinstall our two a/c units. We needed the units moved to make room for dig equipment to have a backyard pool built.  Several months passed between the first time I called and when we finally had the work done. Rates had gone up due to it now being peak summer season, but AccuTemp met us in the middle of the off-peak/peak rates, which was professional of them and really appreciated by us!  They carefully moved the a/c's out of the way, then a few days later moved them back into place. After the bobcat came through the yard was really torn up; but the AccuTemp guys just borrowed our shovel and re-leveled the ground where the units needed to go. They didn't even complain about it, even though I'm guessing that's not usually part of a/c installation. The process was a pain in the behind, but AccuTemp made their part of it easy. Highly recommend this company and will use them for our future a/c needs."
