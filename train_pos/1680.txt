b"I really enjoyed the Pho filet mignon!! The broth had a great flavor and I was very happy with the speediness of food coming to the table after the order. The only reason I did not give 5 star is because service was not the greatest when it was time to to pay. I guess you are to walk to the front cash register when you are ready to pay? I wanted to order another soda but no one comes to check on you once they bring you your food. Other than that, the filet mignon Pho was so good that I will for sure be back regardless of the weird service when it was time to pay . My daughter had the chicken pho and that was ok but compared to the flavor of the beef, it wasn't all that."
