b"The service here is great. I ordered takeout and showed up a half hour early, fully expecting to wait 30 minutes before I got my food. Instead, they had it out for me in less than 10 minutes. The woman behind the counter was very accommodating, polite, and nice. The food itself was decent. It's pretty much your standard Chinese-American takeout place so you know what you're gonna get, though the crab puffs I thought were particularly delicious. The portions are fairly sized and not too expensive. Overall, good food and great service. I'll definitely come back before long."
