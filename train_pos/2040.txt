b"Been to Nimman many times and is one of the go-to Thai restaurants in the Mimico (South Etobicoke) area. Lunch specials are a great deal at just under $10 (depending on options) and served every day, including weekends. It includes a spring roll, salad and soup. The serving for the main dish itself is also a good portion, so you can't go hungry after a lunch special.Haven't tried the delivery service, but only because home is a convoluted mess to find and get to for delivery. I've had my birthday the past couple of years catered from Nimman and it's a hit with the guests. If your group is 15 or less, just order a bunch of individual dishes for everyone to try out. For larger groups, they can do the trays of each dish instead.Haven't had any issues with the service, and staff have always been courteous and meals are usually quickly prepared. Although last weekend the lunch did take much longer than usual for a party of four. Takeout meals are also usually prepared within 20 minutes of calling in.The dine-in ambiance is casual and doesn't get too noisy (depending on groups of diners that are present). Views are either of the parking lot of the strip mall or the park/playground and swimming pool on the lake side. Parking can be limited, depending on the time of day or day of the week. The strip mall has a pet grooming store, laundromat and a couple of other restaurants, not to mention the residential apartments on the second floor. Although no actual bike racks in the plaza, there are some areas bikes can be chained to (railings or in the nearby park). Streetcar stop is right at the front of the strip mall (Lake Shore and Mimico intersection).Dishes I've enjoyed here are: garlic chicken or pork, panang (peanut sauce) curry with chicken, and cashew nut chicken. Beer and wine are also served here.Overall, Nimman is a consistently good Thai restaurant for dine-in or takeout."
