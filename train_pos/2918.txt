b'As far as spring training goes, this stadium was very much like the rest of the city of Surprise: new, clean and welcoming. I checked out the game yesterday between the "hometown" Texas Rangers and the Chicago White Sox, and it seemed like half of the town of Surprise was there. The grass area was well kept (some of the greenest grass I\'ve seen in the Valley) and the facilities were in tip-top shape. The only complaint is the usual stadium bummers: high prices, big crowds and lack of efficient parking (although it was free, so that\'s a serious plus). A really nice place to check out a game.'
