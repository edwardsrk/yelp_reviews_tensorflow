b"I've been to this location a few times since moving closer to inner city. After having not-so-good service at the 16th Ave location in North Hill Shopping Centre I've decided to make the drive to this Sunridge one instead. I've not come across any terrible service, but mind you I come mid week during lunch hours when it isn't too busy. I've been having a French toast craving and I like the strawberries and whipped cream topping add on. Their kids menu has a great selection and comes with a free kids drink. Food is good enough for me to keep coming back."
