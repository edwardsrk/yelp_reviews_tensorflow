b'I am a real Chinese, so this flavor is all I\'m being looking for in Glendale...we ordered several "signature" dishes for schzuan style on the menu, and there are definitely ups and downs here:The cold dishes taste really good. We ordered beef tripes, and they\'re delicious.We also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!The water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup. In general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food.'
