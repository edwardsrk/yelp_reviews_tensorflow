b"We were seated on the roof top patio, very nice! Got to see a lot of the downtown happenings. The pasta here was delicious! Andrew was our server and let me tell you he is the best, funny, attentive and gave his recommendations which by the way were great! The atmosphere here was lovely, it's nice for a date night or to take the whole family out! Coming back for sure!"
