b"This place is so good.  My wife and I have been here a lot since our first visit, just a couple weeks ago.  Can't stop thinking about that carne asada burrito!  Get the pork belly taco(s)!  All tacos are very tasty, but the pb stand out.  Just had the Inca salad with grilled shrimp... Delicious!  Outro does it right.  Oh... The chilequiles are just like the ones I've had in Guanajuato.  Real deal folks.  Great staff, tunes, vibe."
