b"Discovered this newly opened restaurant and I was very glad that I did! They advertise that they offer Mongolian food, but they also have some northern Chinese items as well. My experience was already off to a good start when they gave me complimentary corn and egg white soup along with bread sticks (fried with a sweet taste), and both of which were pretty enjoyable, especially since they were free ;) We ordered a beef pancake which I really enjoyed b/c it was overflowing with juices. We also got the stewed beef ribs and bread. The bread tasted awesome with the sauce, and for some reason the beef had a taste of lamb with it. Not sure if this was intentional, or simply b/c they cook both meets in the same wok. Regardless I personally enjoyed the dish BUT for those who don't like lamb I may have to caution you against it.  Service was also very polite, which is not common among chinese establishments, but I'm happy that it exists here. They also have special menu combos for large groups which I intend on trying out with the family soon!! I am also happy to see a Mongolian restaurant that does not involve a grill/bbq. Very welcome addition to the Chinese food scene in the GTA and adds some much needed variation!Minor point of irritation: Very cumbersome seats. Very hard to pull out the heavy seats from the table, especially on the carpet that they have."
