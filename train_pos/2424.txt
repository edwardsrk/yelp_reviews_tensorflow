b"There's one by our house so we always come to this location. Service is fast and food is consistently good. Their corn bread is to die for and I'm trying not to eat more than one cause I would not enjoy my delicious BBQ. Love the shredded pork and the burnt ends. This is where we go to when we crave for BBQ"
