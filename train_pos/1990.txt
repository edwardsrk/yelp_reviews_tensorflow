b"This place is buzzing with excitement... from live dancers at 11pm every Saturday, to an abundance of meat and salads.. You really can't go wrong!  The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of a 5 is that the meat could be, at times, too salty for my liking.  The salad bar is also smaller compared to their downtown location.  Nonetheless, this place excites... If you're looking for great value ($40 all you can eat meat), then look no further."
