b'I\'ve been coming to this Sauce for quite a while and its consistently good. I don\'t think I\'ve ever had a bad experience because I always know what to expect.The pizza is good, salads are solid, and the mac n\' cheese...well, lets just say I\'m a sucker it. Every time we come to eat here the service is friendly and helpful, probably the best I\'ve had from a "fast casual" type of restaurant.I definitely recommend sauce if you\'re looking for something fairly quick but delivers on quality.'
