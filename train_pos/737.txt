b"I'd almost give this one half star more.  It is really good food.  Cool atmosphere.  but the food was not the best I ever had, so it gets 4 starts.  Had the love me tenderloin sandwich.  very good.  the curry sauce for the sweet potato fries was a nice change.  They have complimentary valet here.  not sure they need valet or not, but it is an added expense.  The meal wasn't too overpriced."
