b'First time at this restaurant and I have wanted to try it based on recommendations from friends. Luckily, we got there just before they got real busy because they were extremely understaffed. People were getting angry with the long wait for their food which was not the fault of the waiters. Every single one of them were working their butts off!!! Even the guy seating people and running the register was cleaning tables in between customers with a smile on his face. I was very impressed with everyone of the staff. Mia was our waitress and she was outstanding! She always had a smile on her face even when people were getting upset with how long it was taking to get their food. She kept our drinks full and was right there when we needed something. Food was very good and I will definitely be back to try breakfast. Mia was excellent and hope I get her again!'
