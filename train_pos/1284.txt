b"A pretty diverse drink menu, filled with many craft brews & ciders. The smoked pulled pork & beef brisket were delicious & generous in portion size. This place is always busy around typical meal times, but usually quiet in between. (We go around 3 or 4pm & sit right down.) Try the burnt ends if they aren't sold out for the day!"
