b'A little bird with pink hair told me and showed me Tony\'s in Gastonia and I am a fan.We came here for dessert... hey sometimes desserts involve hot dogs, depending on who you ask.  But one side is burgers, fries, and dogs... the other is the ice cream side.We got a scoop of their grape ice cream, which sounds gnarly when you think about it, but when you taste it, it\'s pretty amazing.  They captured the best part about grape soda and turned it into ice cream.  I\'m a convert.  We also had a banana shake and a chocolate shake.  These shakes are pretty robust, so bring your stretchy pants.Lots of parking on the outside of the store... I felt transported when you walk in.  you can tell they\'ve been there a while.  The sparkly red vinyl booths and menu signs where you put up the individual letters... this place definitely hits "vintage" right on the head.  But don\'t let the old decor fool you, they obviously have been around because they have a winning formula for their ice cream and various sandwich-fare.'
