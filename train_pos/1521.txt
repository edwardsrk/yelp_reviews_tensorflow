b'We had an extra large group come here for a special department lunch. While I was not impressed to find out they really wanted us to book it for 11 AM (who eats at 11?) in the end, it made up for the fact that we were treated so well when we got there. Spectacular seating area that worked for our group, with a quaint fireplace. Service was fantastic, servers were super attentive. The prime rib was excellent. I meant to take half home but ended up devouring it all. I definitely will return, with both large groups and a more casual outing.'
