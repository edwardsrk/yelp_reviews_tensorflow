b'Best coffee I had in Phoenix (despite having to drive 35 minutes from my hotel to get there).  Would have gone every morning had it been closer.  Good service.  Cool decor.  Went in asking for a dark roast, not pour over.  And their drip was everything I could have asked for.  Tons of flavor without that burnt Starbucks taste. It was what I needed at 7 am.'
