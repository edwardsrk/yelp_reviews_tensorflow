b"Tried this place out for the first time last Knight. Think I found my new favorite sushi spot! Pretty vibey atmosphere and really nice inside/out. Fresh fish and good selection. I got AYCE focused more on the menu items. They have a buffet line with a few choices such as fried rice and egg rolls. Sushi is what a came for . You can only get 1 order of oysters w/ayce (2pcs) dinner menu only. I would pop these like crazy! But you can buy them by the half or full dozen. Presentation overall is A+. A couple behind me got a sashimi platter that had some dried ice effect to it pretty cool! All in all I'll definitely be back again. Go Knights Go"
