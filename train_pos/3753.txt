b"Really yummy sushi. We've been twice now and only orders off the regular menu.  The sushi is really good and their special roll deal makes it super reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is nice and relaxing and overall enjoyable.  We have liked everything we've ordered and this will probably be our sushi spot from now on."
