b"Great paninis!  We had a group lunch and the paninis were brought in.  I had the Italian and the Pacific.  The Italian, for me, lacked some spice.  I would prefer if there was roasted red peppers as well as tomato slices.  I really like the Pacific 'cos of the mixture of flavours of the smoked salmon, artichokes, capers, red onion and spinach.  It combined really well and was fantastic!  I would like to try their breakfast items one day."
