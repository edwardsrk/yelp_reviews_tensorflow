b"Sara has been my family portrait photographer for the past 4 years and I cannot rave enough about her skill and the amazing finished product that I receive each time.  After their first session with my 2 month old I was so impressed that I vowed if I ever got married that they were going to be the ones to photograph the special day.  Fast forward to today, my daughter is almost 5 and the wedding is only 7 months away.  They were the easiest decision I made, no need to shop around.  I know for a fact that they are going to capture the day perfectly.  You can't go wrong with Love My Life, they are an easy decision."
