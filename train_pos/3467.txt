b'Amazingly Awesome!! The food is amazing and so tastey. My taste buds had a party in my mouth its so good. You can see the rotisserie so you know everything is fresh. The staff are super friendly, inviting, and laid back. We came in 20 mins to close and we were going to take our food to go so not to hold them up from closing and they invited us to stay and told us to take our time and enjoy. We also got samples of their bac lava and it was so good (not too sweet or sticky).  We will be regulars here and bring friends with us as we just moved into the area. Well done.  Love the food and customer service.'
