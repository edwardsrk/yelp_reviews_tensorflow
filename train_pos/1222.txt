b"16th Street Sports Bar is a funny place. It's kind of like high school all over again in the sense that I went to Washington, had a lot of friends at Sunnyslope, and a lot of them come here. With do reason too, as it is more of an entertainment spot than a sports bar. The TVs are somewhat limited in comparison to other places nearby, but they have shuffleboard, darts, pool, video games, etc.The servers are all friendly, they have a great burger and beer of the month special that changes each month, and the food is better than average. Their prices are very fair as well."
