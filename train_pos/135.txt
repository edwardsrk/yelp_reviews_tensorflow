b'For $35 per person you can come and recharge or have some drinks while waiting for your flight out of Las Vegas.They do not have an American Airlines Admirals Club in Las Vegas so we needed to find an alternate location to relax and have a few refreshments. We walked in and were greeted with friendly smiles. Gave them our boarding passes and $70.No hot food or snacks are offered here except for Cup of Noodles (beef or chicken). Plenty of quickie snacks: multiple flavored popcorn, fruits, pretzels, potato chips, cookies and trail mix.But the unlimited drinks were really why we were here. The bartender kept the Hennessy and Coke coming. They had wine too but nothing that caught our attention. This place was a Godsend when after walking down the ramp to board we were told we were too early and that our flight was delayed. We headed back to The Club to continue keeping our drinks on.'
