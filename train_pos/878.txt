b'I like the Main Dish. I really do. Especially the part where they make me home cooked meals that I don\'t actually have to prep but I can still look like a rockstar for having on hand (when people ask if I make it, I just reply "Of course it\'s homemade!") Bests: meatloaf and lasagna. The rest is yummy too, but these two dishes in particular just taste better when they\'re coming out of somebody else\'s kitchen.Besides the takeaway options, TMD also has a pretty fantastic lunch counter. Go to the sandwich counter. It\'s the provolone to my prosciutto. And I hear pretty delicious reports on brunch, though I haven\'t managed to try that myself yet.In other news, TMD also serves beer and wine at their little bar. Oh, and coffee. Seriously, what DOESN\'T TMD do?If you haven\'t been yet, and you\'re reading this, you are out of excuses. Go. Go directly to The Main Dish. Do not pass another eatery. Do not collect other nibbles to fill yourself up on.'
