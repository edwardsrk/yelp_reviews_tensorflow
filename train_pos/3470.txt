b"At this point we have 98 check in's.  Good thing they are a good ways from us.  If not, we'd probably be broke,  and wouldn't be able to fit through normal doors.Food and service is wonderful.   Although yelp classifies this is a bar, this is not typical bar food.  In fact, almost everything is made from scratch - including great desserts. If you have never been here, you are definitely missing out."
