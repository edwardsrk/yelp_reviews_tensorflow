b"We ordered the spicy and house ramen and the grilled calamari when went there for dinner. I thought the spicy ramen was very good. I got the level 1 spicy. I thought the broth was nice and balanced. The pork was tender and the egg was perfectly cooked. I know it's a sin to say that but I wasn't the biggest fan of the dried baby shrimp on top. I could do without them in general. They remind me of fish food. My wife got the house ramen and  really liked it. The noodles were tender and the broth was hearty, and right amount of salt.Didn't enjoy the calamari. Mainly maybe because it was served a while after we got our ramen and we were almost full by then. Service was very good and friendly."
