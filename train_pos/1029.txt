b"I wanted a perfect diva on a budget place to stay for my birthday weekend and once I saw a picture of Flamingo's new black & pink rooms, I knew this was it.This was one of the cheapest places we could find and the location is PERFECT center strip.The outdoor pool area isn't super fancy but it's nice and wasn't insanely crowded.The rooms are average size but very classy with pink & black decor and black hardwood floors. It was a really fun place to hang out.I would definitely stay here again!"
