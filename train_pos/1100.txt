b"Yes, finally a Sushi Restaurant north of 64th Avenue north.  They are located across from Rona in Creekside this brand new location is just what the surrounding communities needed in the Sushi department.  We have been driving all the way down to Kensington in the past three years to get our Sushi fix so this addition to our local dining is very welcome.  My wife and I dined there with our two year old and it was a very pleasant experience.  The ambience is nice and includes a few classic Japanese style booths along with your regular booths and tables.  We ordered the Bento Box's and they were tasty and fresh.  The salad included the traditional ginger dressing, the miso had substance, the saki sushi (salmon) was fresh.  The ginger pork could have used some crispness and the gyoza was more pastry-like than is commonly served, but overall the food quality and flavour was excellent.  The service was also attentive and friendly including being very accomodating to our two year old with additional avacodo slices.  He enjoyed sitting in the Japanese booth and bopping to the background music.  We went around 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and replaced another family and saw one other take out order, so please add to their clientelle and visit Taiyo to keep good Sushi alive in north Calgary."
