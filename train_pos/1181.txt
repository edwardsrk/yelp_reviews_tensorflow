b"Food was so good I didn't realize I had eaten my entire burger until I looked down and saw and empty plate. I stopped in for dinner with my boss and coworkers. We had no problem getting a table for 5 around 630pm on a Thursday night but that doesn't mean the place was not busy and hoping. The waitress we had was also our bartender so that meant we were able to get our drinks a little faster than other tables, which was great. We had the salsa and chips, word of caution the salsa was on the spicy side. We also had the artichoke dip which was awesome. I opted for the triple bacon burger and onion rings and it was fabulous. The atmosphere was good and lively and there was no pressure to hurry up and leave which was good because we were there for several hours. All in all I would definitely come back."
