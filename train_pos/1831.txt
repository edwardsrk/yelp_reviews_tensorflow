b'New owners and did a little reno to make it more of a clean brighter look.The sign noted it was a Japanese, Korean and China restaurant.When we were seated... we were handed the Japanese/ China menu.We came for Korean... the previously great portion and great tasking black bean noodles.When we were abbout to leave and stated we were specifically here for korean... there was another menu which wss not presented... as the waiter thought we wouldnt understand it.Nonetheless, we were happy to see our dish was available.The portion was larger than previous owners and it tasted great!Price was bang on too!Very happy with the dish!Their tempura app was a bit pricey bit the veggie pieces were big so we couldnt complain.It was ok tasting.Small dining area... but we had no issues getting seated.Their main menu was very hard to read... with pages like light pink background off white fonts... they need to make their menu more legible.  Prices for sushi items very a bit on the higher side too.Owners of this place are Chinese.'
