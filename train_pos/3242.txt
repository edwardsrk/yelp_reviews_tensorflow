b"THE UP-SIDE: Mojo's is wonderful, a call back to the days when coffee shops served great coffee and food, and didn't make you feel like a number. This place feels like home. You can hang out and work at the many tables. Never that difficult to find a spot, although they are always busy - and for good reason. The coffee drinks are perfectly created and there is a great selection of breakfast and lunch choices, along with fresh bakery. The service is warm and pleasant from all of the staff. They always greet you with a smile and make you feel good about coming back. Kayla has been especially helpful for any little issues I had like getting a new extension cord with multiple outlets for folks in one small area. Much appreciated!THE DOWN-SIDE: No down side. THE SUM-IT-UP: I love it here. You will too."
