b'We had a great day at the park today with another family.  Kids loved the slides and zip lining.  Make sure when they offer a Groupon you jump on it.  It really makes it worth driving all the way out from the west valley for some water fun.  The park does need maintenance and painting thru out the complex.  This park is not state of the art but a good time was had by everyone.'
