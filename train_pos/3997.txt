b"Today was the first time visiting munch and it will definitely not be my last. I had the Marv's club and it was soooo good and fresh. The bacon was so crispy, thick and delicious. I added sprouts to mine to give it a extra yum factor. I haven't made up my my mind on what to get next. Everything looks so good but I think I have to give Marv's club one more try. Lol"
