b"perk is great!  the food is really good and comes out fast.  the staff is the friendliest around.  there is an einstein bagel's a few doors down - why go there? honestly - i wish more people in the community supported locally owned places like this instead of chains. the money stays right here in the community instead of being shipped out of state - and god knows this state needs jobs and money!  i'd highly recommend this restaurant."
