b'This place was packed with corporate power lunch peeps! Right when we sat down, they brought us salad - I love instant munchables. We had the Tom Ka Gong (shrimp?) soup with a level four spiciness. Now, I have a really really high spice tolerance, and a level four knocked my socks off! I was weeping with hot chili joy (eek - bad description, but you get the point!). The soup had a small amount of coconut in it, but was not heavy and rich where you cannot eat anything else. I chose the red curry chicken from the lunch menu at a level 3 spiciness - that was a perfect amount of heat for me! Even though the place was packed, our food came quickly and was piping hot. Great experience! We will be back!'
