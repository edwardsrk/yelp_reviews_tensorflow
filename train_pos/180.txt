b'A good option for a quick and inexpensive meal. I had the chicken teriyaki and spicy chicken plate. It was a lot of food and came with veggies and brown rice. I signed up for their special offers club, so hoping to see some deals soon that will get me back here! I would highly recommend checking it out for a simple and cheap meal.'
