b"So spicy and flavorful! Shrimp Pakoras really good and not too oily. Chicken tangra really tasty too (if you like chicken tikka masala you'll love this!). Appreciated the fact that the manchurian seafood rice actually tasted like seafood (instead of a oil-flavorless-spicy taste) and did not have too much food coloring."
