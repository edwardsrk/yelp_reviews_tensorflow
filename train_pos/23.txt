b"Great food & very friendly staff.\xc2\xa0 We got the Shrimp Creole & the Cajun Trio, both tasty with the equivalent of home cooking.\xc2\xa0 The peach cobbler was delicious & passed my friend's test, who is from the South & has some experience with this dessert.\xc2\xa0 The owner chatted with my friend & I and told us how the restaurant got started.\xc2\xa0 Definitely worth trying."
