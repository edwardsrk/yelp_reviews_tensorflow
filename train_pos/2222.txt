b"Very happy with my micro-blading results. Didn't hurt at all. I was able to sleep through it. However I was a little disappointed that when I went in for my second treatment they couldn't find my account, so that was a little frustrating and was quickly resolved. Other than that my overall experience and results were very much satisfying!"
