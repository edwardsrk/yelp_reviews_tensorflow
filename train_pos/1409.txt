b'I like this place a lot.  It is relatively cheap and even cheaper with the student discount.  The mango shrimp quesadilla is really good, and I would definitely recommend it.  The restaurant is clean, which is a plus.  The server is nice, which is another plus.  So, overall, i would recommend this place definitely.'
