b"I've gotta say, I enjoy my Thai Tai subs. My favourite sub is the Teriyaki Chicken with some cucumber, carrots and cilantro. The bun has a nice crunch to the crust. It's just the right thickness to go with the sub filling as well.I quite enjoy the lychee smoothie as well. It's the same thing as the bubble tea, just without the bubbles. You heard it here, you can definitely ask for your bubble tea without the bubbles. Little jelly things in my drink just freaks me out a little.Note: I'm not sure about the other locations, but the 17th Ave spot is more of a walk-in/take-out kind of a place. There's one bench to sit down and wait on, but no tables. It works if you got the sub, but if you ordered any of the other meals, expect to be finding somewhere else to eat it."
