b'Liked how they were open late and also had happy hour specials after 10 pm. We really liked the bulgogi and Korean prime kalbi. They were marinated very flavorfully. The mushroom medley and sweet corn were also very good. Would definitely keep this place on my list of late night eats or when IIA just craving korean barbecue.'
