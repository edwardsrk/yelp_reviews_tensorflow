b"This place is great! I bought a bag of these little walnut cakes filled with custard and they are delicious. At $5 a bag, they're a great, inexpensive dessert or snack. I've also tried their regular custard buns and they were really good, similar to Hong Kong style buns but the bread wasn't as sweet. This is a cute little shop, seems to be family owned, I see the same couple running the place whenever I stop in. They're very courteous and proud of their shop, it's a pleasure supporting businesses like this.The shop isn't much to look at but it's clean and welcoming. Not much place to sit, it's definitely a takeout place. Prices are good for what you get, which is delicious homemade baked goods. The only issue I have is their hours, no signage on the door or hours posted anywhere. I've tried to stop by a few times when they were closed, I have no idea what their hours are like so maybe calling ahead is the right thing to do. I've read that they only make limited batches of the custard walnut cakes. I was lucky enough for some to have been already made when I walked in on a Friday early afternoon, if that's helpful to anyone!"
