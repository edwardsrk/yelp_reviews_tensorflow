b'We went for breakfast today.  I had the western omlet and my husband had the SOS "chip beef on toast". My omlet was light and tasted fresh.  My husband said the SOS was as good as his old navy days. He enjoyed it. The coffee was hot, fresh but a bit weak.  But nothing on the breakfast menu was over 6.95. Pretty impressive!  Its good wholesome food at a great price. The bill for 2 of us was $14.00 before tip. I definitely will be back. The waitress was ok. Not too friendly but pleasant. That and the coffee is why I gave them a 4.'
