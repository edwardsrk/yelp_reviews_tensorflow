b'While planning my Vegas trip I subscribed to the Groupon e-mails to see what kind of deals I could find.  I was hoping for more food deals than I found, but was lucky enough to come across the deal for Mystery Adventures!  My husband and I joined a group at the "inn" the evening that we arrived in Vegas.  There were three other parties participating, giving us a total of 12 for the evening.  To start, we signed a few things and were told the rules and then the story began.  A mystery was presented to us then we traveled to the next location to search for clues.  It took us to a third location which was done up fantastically!  They really worked the locations into a good mystery.  Our group worked well together and with a little assistance from our driver (Joe, I think his name was) we solved the mystery!  There were drinks and snacks available to us on the bus and we got a certificate and prize at the end.  This was something fun and off the beaten path to do in Vegas and I would definitely recommend it and maybe even try it again on my next visit, and with a new mystery to solve!'
