b'When the weather is nice, the Bridle Path is a wonderful place to walk with friends or go on a run!  In fall the trees are beautiful, and in Spring there are fun farmers markets to check out!  Venture off the path a little and take in some of the beautiful Central Phoenix homes and neighborhoods.  I love to start at Northern and go down to about Glendale,'
