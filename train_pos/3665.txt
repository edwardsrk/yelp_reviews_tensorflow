b"This place has ruined  my view of all other Brazilian restaurants that I thought where amazing. Where do I begin the all you can eat food, I'm about to burst as I write this. All I can say for the food is I made one trip to the galleria, after that I was at the table. Why? The frequency of the carvers bringing meat to my table was ridiculously fast,How fast? as I was finishing my meat and trying to eat my side dish  I was being offered more meat. I literally never had an empty plate from the time I sat down until I finally tapped out to sit and enjoy my drink and the entertainment. The entertainment is one of the things about this restaurant that will make others seem bland. From the guitarist, to the capoeira fighters this place is an over all experience, and one I won't soon forget."
