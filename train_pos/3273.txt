b"Dave Bonanno and the VW North Scottsdale staff was fantastic to work with.  Everyone was fast and courteous.  All prices were fair with full disclosure given.  The experience was more Lexus/BMW/Mercedes than anything else.  I will be a repeat customer again!  They took the time and didn't rush to get a quick sale (and I was in on a Saturday).  Thank you VW North Scottsdale!  I love my GTI!!!"
