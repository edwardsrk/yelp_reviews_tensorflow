b'Ok, this is currently (4/13) my vote for the best burger in Phoenix. And it gets better... 1/2 price burgers all day Saturday.  Hand made patties, nice fresh buns, cooked just right.The place itself is fine, dark bar with off track betting.  Not my thing, but nothing against it... But there occasionally is a lot of yelling at the TVs.  Salads need some work, and the wings are good, ESP for 6.99 on Wednesdays.  But get the burger and skip the menu.'
