b"Excellent sandwiches and friendly service in a historic place! Wife had the curry chicken sandwich and and I had the ham and brie sandwich, both of which were very good, well crafted. The mocha drinks we had were ok, served too hot which tends to kill the flavor (or just burn your tongue).Overall I found the bungalow to be a cool, quaint, little gem which is unique for AZ. A great place to relax and have a conversation, play a game, or read a book.*Worth noting: the gentleman working the day I was in with my wife and children was very friendly and took the time to make fresh curry chicken for my wife's sandwich as well as a off-the-menu sandwich for my 6yr old (not that it's complicated, but worth noting)."
