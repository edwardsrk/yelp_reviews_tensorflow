b"C & Dubbs has been a go to place for many many years starting off in a small barn looking building which was very small with few seats and not much time to move around.  Then moving into a plaza with a larger dining area.  For those of you that are not aware this is the home of the infamous Sumo Burger and Super Sumo Burger.   The names of the burger should speak for them selves but in case they don't let me sum it up for you....INSANE.  The Sumo Burger is 1 lbs of meat and the Super Sumo is 1.5 lbs of meat.  Not only are these burger massive but they taste amazing also.  Its massive and super messy and super hard to eat.  A good burger is a messy burger.  Well that's what I say at least.  I have visited C & Dubbs many times but my last visit i realized I had never reviewed it.  On my last visit of course I had the Sumo Burger but I shared the fries as the burger and a whole plate of fries would have been way to much for me.  Burger was super juicy and tasty.  Dripping with goodness.  Fries were super crispy and tasty.  Seeing as I always order the Sumo Burger when I visit C & Dubbs i think next time i'm going to step out of the box and order something else that is on their great menu.  ALERT !!!!! Mississauga and Etobicoke and all surrounding areas C & Dubbs = Great charbroiled burgers.  Make sure to visit you wont be disappointed."
