b'We dined here for our 30 year anniversary, and everyone from the hostess to the busboy wished us happy anniversary. There were rose petals on the table. Server was very accommodating, as you would expect a restaurant with $35 entrees. everything was quite excellent, from the perfectly seared scallops to the steak and shrimp with au gratin potatoes.  they brought us a lovely anniversary creme brulee dessert. I would highly recommend Ocean Prime as a special occasion restaurant.'
