b'I enjoy coming here several times a week to eat, drink, party and sing karaoke. The managers John and Jose are great and the staff are attentive and fast. Food is good but to some it might seem a  "little" pricey but pricing is standard and to be expected of any place on the Las Vegas strip so hotel guests need to take advantage of any deals/specials.  The sound system is awesome. The amount of Vince Neil memorabilia is amazing and he is at the restaurant on occasion like his birthday this past February.'
