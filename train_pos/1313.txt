b"After being disappointed by the lackluster turnout for Go Topless day, we headed to Fugu for a late lunch.  We opted for some small dishes to fill the gaping void in me left from last night's festivities.I ordered the Sichuan Pork Wontons in chili oil and Hot & Sour soup. The wontons arrived fully submerged in a sea of slightly spicy oil. While it seemed a little excessive, the wontons were delicious. The combination of both was just what I needed to fill me up.Pro tip: skip out on the General Tso's and order from the Sichuan menu section. Chicken with Spicy and Sour Garlic Sauce is always on point."
