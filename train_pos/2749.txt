b'First visit with car.  Had oil change done.  They did the normal checking of all fluids with suggestion of additional service.  I declined and no additional push to get the extra work done.  I like that.  Not too long of wait to complete oil change.  Price was OK.  I am willing to pay as long as the work is done well.  I am going to use them again.  I hope this is a repair place that I can return to and trust.'
