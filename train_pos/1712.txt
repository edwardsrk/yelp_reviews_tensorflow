b"This review is ONLY for the hotel room.  (The casino's ventilation sucks and your hair will stink when you leave.)I have stayed there twice.  Once in a normal king room and last night in a jacuzzi king room.  The jacuzzi is not quite big enough for two people, but it is really nice and relaxing.  This room was a corner, so the huge windows on two sides of the room.  Excellent view of the whole city.  The shower is not for the modest; completely see through glass.  Comfortable bed.  The comforter was covered with a duvet.  There is just a cleanliness about the room.  This is really a nice place to stay.  The rooms are great.  I highly recommend."
