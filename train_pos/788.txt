b"Sadie's is probably one of the top soul food spots in Charlotte, not the best but in the top. The original Coffee Cup off of Clarkson, although closed, will forever be the number one soul food spot in Charlotte(just had to throw that in there). The menu at Sadie's has changed over the years but I think some of the best dishes that were offered were taken off the menu. I'm not a restaurant owner so who am I to complain:-) The beef tips, baked chicken and pineapple lemonade had to be some of the best items on the menu, but I digress. The sweet potato waffle and fried chicken is pretty good, the waffle looks a little weird but the taste compensates for that. The mac n cheese can be suspect, but lately it has been on point. The fried whiting is very good but the pieces of fish are just way too big/thick or something, maybe it was just that day. The fried corn on the cob is very good and highly recommended. I haven't had the baked chicken in a while but it used to be pretty good. She usually has mini cheesecake desserts by Honey Butter Bakery which are quite delish."
