b"This location has a ton of restaurants and bars surrounding it, so it's super convenient to do dinner and a movie or drinks. I like that there aren't a ton of kids so the arcade area isn't loud. The parking is quite far though as you have to park and walk through the restaurants to get to the theatres. Not too ideal in the winter."
