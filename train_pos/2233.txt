b"If you have a huge group of people, want to treat them properly yet don't want to put a dent in your wallet then take them all out for dim sum lunch at the Regency Palace.  I went with a group of 5 people recently and we were all completely satisfied for under $30.  Now how can you beat that?  This is the largest Chinese restaurant in Calgary.  The Regency has tons of ample underground parking and has the option of seating you, you and your friend or you and up to 50 of your friends in any of their private rooms.  The decor is stupendous, like walking into a mini dynasty, complete with welcoming lions, and good fortune fish.The bar is fully stocked; imagine paying under $6 for your choice of scotch, rum, gin or vodka.  Or buy yourself and your mate a beer or share a bottle of assorted reds and whites.And finally drumroll please the dim sum menu! Over 40 items varying at 1 to 4 dollars each:Shrimp, seafood, scallop, house pork, shark fin, chiu chow, deep fried taro and stuffed dumplings.  Beef tripe leaf, Octopus with curry sauce, chicken buns, pork BBQ buns, and duck feet.Mango pudding, chestnut cake etc... The list goes on and on.I can't believe you are still reading this? Don't be the last emperor get yourself down to the Regency Palace for dim sum lunch today."
