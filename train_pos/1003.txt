b"We met up with some friends here last Friday for lunch and this new spot lives up to its name:  Thailicious!  The lunch specials are fabulous!  I had the $6.99 Chicken Pad Thai because I always have to try Pad Thai when I go to a new Thai spot.  The portion was very generous for a lunch special and I had leftovers to take home.  The restaurant is nice and bright and the service was fantastic.  I'd definitely come back for more and extra points for being close to my workplace."
