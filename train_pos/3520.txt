b"Lydiah's Coffee House is a prime example of what makes small business so great, particularly those in the food service industry! The owner (Lydiah) is incredibly kind and friendly, and the food she makes is very delicious. Every different menu item I've had thus far is of the curried variety, which is expertly done. Not too much, not too little, just the right amount of delicious curry flavor. The small lunch special is economical, but also jam packed with a great amount of food.The Kenyan chai tea is also quite a treat which I will be enjoying the next time I stop in for lunch."
