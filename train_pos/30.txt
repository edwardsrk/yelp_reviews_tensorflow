b'I came for a quick bite and just ordered from the appetizer menu. Things I had:Sweet Potato Pancakes: these were very interesting and not what I expected. They appear to be deep fried pouches of a sweet potato pur\xc3\xa9e-like filling. The balance between crunchy outside and gooey inside is a nice balance. These are only slightly sweet and I wish weren\'t so oily.Beef in Lettuce Cup: the plating was nice but not sure how they got "cups". I expected lettuce  wraps but received beef with lettuce pieces. I could not scoop then into lettuce cups as the lettuce was chopped too much. Flavor wise this was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this if you want a lighter low carb dinner, and it\'s much cheaper than the entrees and the portion isn\'t too much! Ambiance: a little dark for my liking and I went during lunch time. I sat by the window which made it bearable, otherwise it was way too dark.'
