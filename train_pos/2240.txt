b"Four stars is for the brownie only. We went in because we wanted to try a brownie, had the traditional one. We wanted to sit down and eat it but since we only wanted one brownie they didn't want us to even though the place was empty. The guy heated it up for us which was nice, brownie was amazing, especially warm, but service wasn't the best."
