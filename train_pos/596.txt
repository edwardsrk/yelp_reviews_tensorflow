b"My family went here on new years eve for my dad's birthday so dinner prices were super expensive because of the holidays. It was $27.99 per person...better make sure you eat $27.99 worth of food! I definitely did not eat $28 worth of food that's for sure.The restaurant is huge...it used to be a home outfitters so imagine how big the restaurant is. The food selection is pretty typical to other Canadian-Chinese buffets. The only difference is that they have live cooking stations for noodles and grilling meats. They also had freshly grilled half lobsters and you could ask for more than one. Drinks are self served so there's a drink station filled with a pop station and a fridge with bottled juice and water. My favourite stations were the chocolate fondue and waffle station.I prefer this buffet over Mandarin...if the prices were lower."
