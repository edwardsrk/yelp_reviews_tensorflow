b'This place never gets old, came here probably around 10 times in the past several years. This place has always been one of the best original spots for KFC (Korean Fried Chicken). HOHT never disappoints. My usual top picks when ordering are:  -blazing fire chicken- sweet and sour wings- boneless fried chicken with green onionAll dishes are really tasty. Tastes even better when you get flavored soju as well. Most of the time this place is pretty consistent with their breading and taste, maybe I have encountered one or two times that there was too much breading but overall it was ok. One of my go to places whenever craving for some KFC'
