b"To be honest this review may be a little impartial only because Santa Fe Station is my favorite Station casino to visit. It's not the closest one to where I live or even one I frequent that often but this theater certainly makes it so. First the up-charge for 3-D is only three bucks instead of the usual five I've been paying elsewhere. Second the snack area is just awesome, no other theater I've been to has a Starbucks coffee, hand scooped ice cream, and a cafeteria style check out. I went here today on a semi-date with my husband. (While we were here together and at the same time, we were in different theaters, watching different movies.) Buying tickets I saw the best thing ever. A movie style poster stating that kids under six will not be permitted to go into rated R movies after 6PM. OMG jerks who bring their kids to inappropriate movies and let them ruin it by yelling and not removing them when they get loud is one of my biggest pet peeves. Knowing that I can go here and not have to put up with that crap will keep bringing me back. LOVE IT!!!"
