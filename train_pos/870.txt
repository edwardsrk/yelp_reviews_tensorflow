b"Loved our services and the techs my husband and I had were outstanding. My husband received the best hand and leg massage from Shalonda (he thinks that's her name lol) He was so relaxed when we left and she sent us to a great local place for wings and another place for Gelato. We'll be back on our next visit from Chicago."
