b"I finally tried Pig and Duke. It's a 3 minute walk from by bf's house, but we've never thought to visit until last night. It was crazy busy and loud since the hockey game was on. TV's are all over the place, I mean, every angle your eyes turn, you'll catch a glimpse of some sport or other. Anywho, despite the huge crowds of people all over the place, it didn't take long to have our server offer us menus and something to drink. The menu is mostly standard pub fare, heavy on the pork products, but does have a few vegetarian options as well as gluten free buns. I ordered a cider and the veggie burger /salad.My bf had a couple ales and the beef burger/mash potato. Our food was good, on par with The Ship's food but at a higher price point, and throughout our server kept checking in. All in all a pretty decent first experience. They have specials on every day as well as pool tables and support Arsenal for those who watch soccer when World Cup isn't on."
