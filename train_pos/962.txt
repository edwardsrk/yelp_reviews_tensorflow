b"Great lamb burger! Enjoyed the diner ambiance and yummy lamb burger Po'Greek boy plate with fries. We had local beers OMB and Legion and loved the fried pickles. I liked the old timey decorations and great service. When you're looking for diner food with history in Charlotte it's nice to know that this little gem is in the neighborhood."
