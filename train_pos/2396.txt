b'So I\'ve checked out this place a few times and I am hooked on their fries and grilled cheese sticks! Fries have great flavor, texture, and cooked to perfection. The grilled cheese sticks, if you\'re a cheese lover its so gooey and cheesy that you have to try! Now for dessert, if you have a chocolate craving/sweet tooth (especially if you\'re a woman and your "Friend" is in town lol) you have to try their oreo sundae! #OreoLover haha Anyways I\'ve tried most of their menu items and I think there burgers and chicken sandwiches are average - considering it is a fast food joint and not a gourmet restaurant. The best part is they\'re cheaper price wise compared to everything else that\'s out there. My only complaint is that if you\'re in drive thru and have to wait for them to finish cooking your food, they want you to park in front of the red no parking zone as they dont have a designated place to park and wait for them to finish and bring out your food.'
