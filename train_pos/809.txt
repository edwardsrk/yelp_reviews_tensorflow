b"Not really much to say that everybody already said about raising canes the chicken is delicious love the fries and the texas toast that they give you with sauce is okay at best wish they had ranch but it is what it is love the service as well and it is one of my favorite places chicken that is to eat at I still love the Charleston location but this comes second out of the raising canes location so if you haven't tried this place out I recommend you to give it a shot."
