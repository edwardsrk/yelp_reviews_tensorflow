b"Maybe I got lucky but my experience at the Plaza Hotel and Casino was pleasantly enjoyable. The parking garage isn't the greatest but it's free for hotel guests (unlike a lot of hotels now). The room rate was cheap so I was expecting the worst but my room was clean, spacious and had a king bed in it. There is also a free shuttle to McCarran Airport, which saves about a $22 Uber ride one way.My expectations were quite low due to the price and reviews but I would stay there again if I'm on a budget.FYI: $20.00 resort fee (less than many hotels as well)."
