b"The smell of sizzling barbecue still lingers in my ....clothes :) but that is part of the fun!  I came as part of the UYE hosted by Jen S. and dined with Steve W., Anthony M., Misti Y., Bobby Y. and my other half Eric R.  We shared two yagyu specials for the table (skirt steak, ribeye, and short rib) plus an order of tongue.  Eric R. also got shrimp and a salmon avocado roll, Steve got kimchi, and we all split a wakame soup from the suggestions of Misti and Bobby.The soup was pretty amazing, so I would go back for that in a minute!  The broth was flavorful, and it had long strands of egg (my kind of egg drop yo!), wakame and green onions.  They gave us 5 small bowls and we were all able to share it (and one order is only $4.50).  Surprisingly, the ribeye was least fatty of the meats but my favorite nonetheless.  The only dipping sauce I really liked of the 4 was the sesame oil that was seasoned with some salt.  Eric R. and I also got our own bowls of rice which was a great addition to our meal.  The meats overall tasted great, and I especially liked the marbled tongue.  It was a real treat that I am glad we tried!Jen S. and I also grilled up the kabocha garnishes from the meat plate and that was actually a really great idea!  I did not get a chance to try the kimchi but Steve and Anthony seemed to like it.  I had one shrimp (hard to mess that up!) and one taste of Eric's sushi - this isn't the place for sushi but it was perfectly fine.When I return, it is wakame soup, tongue and ribeye for me plus the ice cold beer.  The guys ordered pork cheek with miso at the end but I do not partake in the pig :)  It was a fun interactive meal and I am glad I met Steve, another educator.  I also owe many thanks to the generous Jen S. for hosting and sharing his groupon."
