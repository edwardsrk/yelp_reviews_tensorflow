b'NOTE: This is not a review for the restaurant, since I have not actually eaten food here.I have been to this place several times but not for dinner or food but for events downstairs. When you first come into Calisto, you see the dining room area but you would be surprised to know that in the basement they have a full dance bar. The bar is long ending at a small sized dance floor with a DJ booth in one conrner. If you are looking for a small place to host a party or just go out with some friends, Calisto is the place for you. The drinks are normal Toronto prices. The music is a good mix of stuff. Sometimes people throw special events in there and you may stumble upon something really interesting. The staff is friendly and there is usually no cover (I have never heard of anyone paying cover). I do like this place and feel pretty comfortable there, so will you!'
