b"My first ramen stop in Richmond Hill since I moved here and I am a fan! I got the Yokohama Ramen with extra egg (bamboo, mushroom, green onion, fish cake, pork, seaweed) and my husband got the miso ramen with pork, both with pork bone broth. I've definitely had more flavorful broth before, but it was still very tasty, not too salty, with a nice garlic flavor.The noodles had a good chew to them (though I wish there was just a LITTLE more noodles). I am a stickler for the egg, and they have it down perfectly. The pork was tender and smoky. We both cleaned our bowls and I was perfectly satisfied.Good prices as well, and I even got a domestic beer for $1.99 with my ramen (sweet special!)Would certainly visit again for my ramen fix."
