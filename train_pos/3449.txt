b"Brought my car in to the dealership (Toyota Autonation) to get my brake pads changed and rotors resurfaced and they charged me a little over $400 on top of trying to hit me with more things I should have done to my car under their care, I also had it appointment with them and it still took them 5+ hours.I decided to not get ripped for my wife's car (same brake change) so I took it to H-Tech Auto and was charged under a fraction of the what the dealership charged me for the same service AND it took only and hour to do not what seemed like half the day at Toyota Autonation.This is the best place to take your car for servicing, but where ever you decide to take your car, just don't bring it to any dealerships ESPECIALLY Toyota Autonation, unless of course you like getting ripped off."
