b"As someone who hesitates stepping foot into a dentist's office, I can begin to say this office is fantastic. From the assistants, to the hygienists, to Dr. Davis, they all are beyond exceptional. Dr. Davis is a very talented and efficient dentist, and at the end of the day, is the most honest dentist you'll have. He shows you all your options and will be genuine about what needs to be done and when. He is very compassionate about his work, which reflects upon the impeccable quality of dentistry he provides. I'd recommend this place for your dental needs."
