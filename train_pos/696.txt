b'Great to find a 24/7 place in Toronto. It has a hip ambience to its environment with artistically decaled walls and seats; half diner half low key speakeasy. I decided to try the general chicken and waffles but other popular dishes include their Blueberry Hill and their French toast. Service is pleasant and welcoming.'
