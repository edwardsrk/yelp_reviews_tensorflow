b'Sweetie and I went to Global this past Thursday night for a nice dinner with friends.  Reservations for 5 were accommodated and off we go.  Nice location in downtown Pineville since it was on the main street it was easy to find and plenty of close parking.We stepped in and the place was pretty full.  Nice bar and seating area, but they also had a setup upstairs where we went.  I felt bad for the waitresses walking up and down but once I tasted the delicious offerings my lack of empathy kicked in.  On to the food!Sweetie and I split a She Crab Soup and once it came we were immediately sorry we didn\'t get our own bowls.  It was delightful and rivaled any She Crab that I\'ve had in the "big" seafood areas like Charleston.  It was creamy, well seasoned, and quite honestly soul saving.  You can tell the person that made it knew what they were doing.I ordered the Diver Scallops and Sweetie had the Sea Bass.  Scallops were big and Gordon Ramsey would have been proud at the preparation.  Bouncy, yet firm and covered with a pickled something or other and a house made sriracha rounded it out.  OMG, the sriracha was perfect and added a nice kick to the dish.  Sweetie is a virtual Sea Bass Connoisseur and said it was the best she\'s ever had.....a statement not to be taken lightly!  We shared a chocolate torte for dessert and called it a night.Global is priced well, had many good menu offerings and we will definitely be back.  Well done!!!'
