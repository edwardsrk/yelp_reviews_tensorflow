b"The hubby and I were in Cleveland to visit the Rock and roll hall of fame and thought we'd stop by here on our way home. Fun little thing to check out. It's $10 a person. The day we went it was self guided only, which I was bummed about, I'd liked to of learned a bit more history. Also free parking is hard to come by. We ended up paying $10 to park next to the house. I actually didn't mind. It was cold and I didn't have to walk far!"
