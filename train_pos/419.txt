b'It\'s a small little place, right there on Willy St.  It\'s fairly cozy inside, with low lighting, but well chosen decor.  It\'s definitely not the best location for a large group, but if there\'s just a few of you, it\'s worth a stop.As with other thai restaurants, they\'ve got a spice scale (1 star = mild, 4 stars = Thai spicy), so you can customize the entree to your liking.Not being overly into Thai/Laotian, I went with a "safe" selection, a stir fry in a sweet and sour based sauce.  I went with moderate spice. It was definitely a unique taste, one I would highly recommend!  I wouldn\'t consider it traditional fare, there were more than plenty of options, if that\'s your thing.I was convinced to go in halvsies on a dessert of mainly coconut milk, rice, and cinnamon, topped with a slice of mango.  Good thing it was in season! It\'s one of those unique dishes that, I have to admit, doesn\'t sound like the most appetizing thing until you try it.  However, if you get the chance, go for it - it\'s a unique dish you won\'t want to pass up.I\'d recommend Lao Laan Xang for anyone else looking for a unique, tasty, meal.'
