b"Cute coffee shop located in Chagrin Falls.On a recent trip, we needed the baby to take a nice long car nap, so we hopped in the car and drove the 45 minutes to Chagrin Falls to get him to sleep (haha).It's a cute coffee shop located in a plaza on Washington- they have drinks and also a small breakfast menu consisting of various pastries, breakfast sandwiches, and health bowls.We got a simple pour over and an Inca tea- they informed us, for our tea, that the tea bag can be used twice (why don't all places tell you that!) and that they'll refill your cup a second time. I thought that was a nice gesture!We ordered their avocado toast drizzled with honey, and it was delicious. Their breakfast tacos were also on point too. The coffee was good, I just prefer other roasters in the city more (duck rabbit, six shooter), but it is a nice option on the east side.So, after seeing the waterfall in Chagrin Falls and you need a cup of coffee, definitely drop by Tame Rabbit!"
