b"Anyone who is complaining about the Plaza Hotel has to be a hard-nosed, difficult curmudgeon...cause we got WAY more than we paid for! An excuisite room with a spectacular view of the Strip for just $30! Woulda' been 5 star...except I had booked a room with a Deluxe King Bed, and all they had was 2 Queens. I will come back!"
