b"We had an amazing brunch at Bouchon! This will be on my must-eat list every time I go to Vegas.Arriving a few minutes early for our table, we found ourselves waiting at their full bar, which is where our wonderful experience began. A melange of mimosas, French 75s and Bloody Mary's rolled out (hey, we were on vacation!), and the brunch festivities began. The bartenders know their stuff, are friendly, and prepared our drinks lickity-split. Each cocktail was carefully made, and tasted delicious. Drinks in hand, we were soon escorted to our table.They were debuting a new menu on the day we went. I can't comment on the changes since I haven't seen the old one, but the menu had something for everyone. Our server did a fantastic job of explaining the menu to us and making recommendations based on our preferences. The service was singularly outstanding! Thanks to Alonso!At our table we got the chicken & waffles, croque madame, salmon version of croque madame, steak & potatoes, and a variety of sides and pastries. Every item was delicious and well prepared. The Lyonnaise potatoes are an excellent side. Chicken and waffles are the bomb. And the pastries - oh my gosh, the pastries! It wouldn't be wrong if you ate an entire meal consisting of their pastries. I wouldn't judge you.Overall, a vastly superior dining experience, and a brunch to remember!"
