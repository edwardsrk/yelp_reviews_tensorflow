b"The whole experience is awesome. They start you off with silly anouncements from the gate. In other words, the staff is friendly, spontaneous, and well, AWESOME. It's a small plane, though, so whether you're travelling a short (ie from San Francisco to Vegas) or longer distance (SF to New York), then Virgin America is the way to go.  I guess the airline is famous for its mood lighting which is relaxing. They have a really cool in-flight entertainment system - touch-screen, on-demand movies, live satellite TV, radio, etc. So if you're flying, better bring your own headset coz they sell theirs for $2. To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane."
