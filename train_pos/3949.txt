b"I don't work around anywhere that I know of that has a good veal sandwich, so I came to Yelpland to figure out how to satisfy my veal craving...and I was not let down! Small place with some outdoor seating which I took advantage of on an unusually warm October day. I got the veal sandwich (of course) and it was FABULOUS. Made fresh to order, instead of scooping a soggy veal out of a tub that's been sitting for hours...the veal itself was a huge portion with no stringy or tough parts, the edges were beautifully crispy..geez just writing this review is getting my mouth watering with the memory of this awesome sandwich. The bun was soft and fresh as well, and to top it off, they had Cherry Dr. Pepper! I never see that. Anyway. I will definitely be back, this is now my new 'fave' veal place. YUMMO!"
