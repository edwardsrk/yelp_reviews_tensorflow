b"Probably one of the most overrated Restaurants, but probably because they do so many group sales and business dinners. This is the only place that gets away charging Prime grade meat prices for choice cuts.Still, for a Prix fix dinner, it's some of the best service. Our server was super professional and was a sterling representation of well trained staff...  he even made sure my glass never got empty. The food was good as always, but I wouldn't say its the best Prime rib in town. You come here for the experience, and Yorkshire pudding."
