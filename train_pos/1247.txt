b'Fantastic lesson on Moroccan cooking and how to adapt to your kitchen. We made lamb tangine and couscous. Chef Alyssa taught us in easy to understand steps and the helpers brought around the ingredients. I loved the goat cheese honey lavender cigar desserts. We went as a date night Valentines present and it was awesome.  You can reserve the date night table for a little more and cook together for more romance!'
