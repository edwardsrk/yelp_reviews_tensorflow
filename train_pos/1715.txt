b"I come here pretty often because the location is so convenient and I work just right around the corner as well. Like anyone who likes thai food and is rather basic lol, I always get the pad thai with steamed tofu. Prices are super reasonable (entrees ranging from $6.95-8.95) and portion sizes are big as well. Their serving sizes can feed about two people but I definitely recommend doing family style and just ordering a lot of entrees and sharing. There's so much to order so you can't go wrong there. Other than pad thai, I usually get their green and yellow curry with either chicken or pork and brown rice. Most of their dishes give you the option of your choice of protein which can range from shrimp, chicken, pork, steamed/fried tofu, beef. I like their pad see ew but it can be a little too salty but it's been different everytime I've ordered it. If you're sick, I definitely recommend their Tom Kha or their silver noodle soup which is a bit simpler but still good. Their thai tea isn't overbearing (too sweet) compared to boba shops. Only huge downside to this place is that the workers here can be pretty rude or come off really cold and mean. It's honestly just a hit or miss though. A couple ladies that work there have been sweet and provide really good service but most of the time, they are pretty rude and give you attitude. I wasn't sure if I was the only one who noticed it but a couple of my friends who ordered pick up and dined in found the workers to be rude too. That's the only downside I can think of. It's not something they can exactly control but it sort of just kills the mood when you're trying to enjoy the food and ruins the atmosphere a little. Food is on point and the interior is pretty small and cozy but there's nothing wrong with that. Overall, a great place for authentic thai food for affordable prices!"
