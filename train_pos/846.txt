b"Cozy place, friendly staff. We stayed here three nights while attending a wedding weekend. The rooms are on the small side but we fit four adults, one child and two infants into two rooms connected by a bath. The rooms were clean and well equipped. Breakfast was generously portioned and delicious. Our rehearsal dinner was good too, save room for the bread pudding, even if you have to share. The rooms are quiet during the well but they do have music downstairs on the weekend. The volume wasn't more than a radio playing in our room and it ends at 11 pm. We would definitely stay again."
