b'This business is amazing. I was almost finished painting my bedroom when I spilled the remaining pint on my carpet. We called and Sandy answered- immediately told us what to do with the situation and said found us a technician to come out within an hour and a half. She was so sweet and helpful especially when we were freaking out a little bit. The technician gave me tips on keeping the carpet cleaned and got all of the paint out. He was prompt, professional and I wish I had cash so that I could have tipped him! Highly recommend this business, and will be using them from here on out for their services.'
