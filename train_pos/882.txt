b"You know this place is going to be good when you walk in and everyone there is Greek. It feels so warm and friendly as the staff there is super attentive and it almost feels like you're in Greece (or what I imagine Greece would be like). The food here is absolutely delicious. I got the special which was fish. It was a bit on the pricier side ($20 for salad, fish and fries) but SO worth it. The fish was nice and crispy however it was literally as though they took the fish without cleaning it and just fried it. There were so many bones that is was a bit painful to eat. The fries were perfectly crispy. My friends got the pork souvlaki  and the ground beef dish which they all really enjoyed. The meals are big and I would say they're large enough to feed two people at a satisfied state (provided they're not heavy eaters). Will definitely stop by again!"
