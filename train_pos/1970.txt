b'This wasn\'t the very best gelato I\'ve had, but the sheer volume of flavors make this place a fun experience.  Without actually counting them, it looked like they had forty-odd flavors of gelato available that day.  (If it\'s 64 and hence the name... well, then, I\'m an idiot as usual.)I was there about 9pm on a Friday night, and the staff could not have been nicer.  Before deciding, I tasted several flavors and they heaped several more upon me.  "If you like that, then you\'ll like this..."  I must have collected almost ten of those multi-color mini gelato putty knives that they use as tasting utensils.  I finally chose two flavors:  the peanut butter oreo and the mud pie.  The peanut butter oreo had a rich peanut buttery taste and a smooth, creamy texture.  It was outstanding.  The mud pie was a combination of a few different flavors.  It was a little firmer and left the after taste of bad coffee.  The staff noticed I was sharing my gelato with my wife and gave me two of their sugar cone wedges that they jam into every cup.I\'m looking forward to going back and ordering two more flavors from their giant selection.'
