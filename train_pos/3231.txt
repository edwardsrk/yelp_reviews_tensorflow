b"My favorite new pho! In town. My family eats like crazy and I went to them to this place 30 minutes before it closed:/ I hate doing that but that's how my mom rolls. Anyways everything was so fresh. Pho 1 and Kim long have more reviews but this was better and a lot more fresh. Service was great! They packed all our food and were very kind. Oxtail soup and peanut sauce soup were my favorite! It's a plus it's close to my house and the pho is the best!!"
