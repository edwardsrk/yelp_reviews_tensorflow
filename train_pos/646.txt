b"The pepperoni pizza I had was well done and my husband had a cheese pizza he very much enjoyed. I disappointed not to see some yummy chicken tenders. Preferably in a hot style. Besides pizza there was nothing really else on the menu that I desired to try. Definitely come back for the pizza specially for the price it's a good deal."
