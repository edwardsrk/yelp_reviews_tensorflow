b'I was very hesitant to try it because im not a fan of the cold. My husband and i both went and really enjoyed it! Staff were very helpful and kind. My mood almost immediately improved and i felt more relaxed. My husband says his back feels much better- only negative thing i will say is that i had the localized cryo on my neck. Its been several days and ive been in incredible amounts of neck pain. It almost feels like a stiff neck. I wouldnt do the localized treatment again.'
