b"Very good quality steak! Really enjoyed the meal and loved the rapid and courteous service. The atmosphere was nice and was the type of place that would be great for a special occasion or fancy date. The only downside was that for four people to eat, three people had tea and the other water (no alcohol), and two total desserts... with tip the total was $320! Phew ... that hurt. Also traffic and parking in uptown Charlotte is sometimes problematic. And don't forget that going outside for a smoke will make you a target for the beggars. Overall I'd go back if my bank account allowed it and I was craving great steaks without the standard side dishes (no baked potatoes there)."
