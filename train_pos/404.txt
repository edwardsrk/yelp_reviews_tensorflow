b"I love fast food....I really do.  And this is my favorite chicken finger place...hands down.  They do it right.This Raising Canes restaurant is clean and the staff is nice.  They are helpful and efficient.  If you are unsure what to get, they are quick to answer questions too.So....not a ton of variety at this place.....just get what everyone else is getting...chicken fingers with cole slaw and texas toast.  The chicken fingers are amazing! Crunchy on the outside and tender-soft on the inside.  I can eat many of these....many.  The texas toast and the cole slaw are very good as well.  I always order an arnold palmer because they have good sweet tea and lemonade....it's such a good combination.Next time your in Vegas try it, you won't regret it!"
