b"Great gas prices and surprisingly a great convenience store as well. I do feel their coke product prices are high unless coke has just gone up but I've gotten Powerade as 2 for $1.50? before at Terrible's or Rebel and it was more expensive here but with it being across the street from my work can't complain too much. I also grabbed a salad from their to-go section and wow! Worth every penny and it comes with 2 salad dressings!"
