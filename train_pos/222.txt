b"We went there fairly late in the evening, and the staff was fine with two of our party trickling in late.  The atmosphere is awesome, I'm not sure if they actually revamped an old theater or just faked it very well, but it's quite beautiful. Totally 'date worthy' surroundings.The 1st course salad bar had everything from heart of palm to pickled vegetables and cheeses, hot garlic mashed potatoes, wasabi potato salad, as well as the normal greens and veg. We were really happy with the meat course - 8 different offerings. The only one i was iffy on was the lamb, which in itself tasted good, but seemed more like it should be it's own dinner thing with some milder food to complement the heavy spicing. It didn't really go well with the other offerings. I love lamb, and wish they could have had something a little less wacky. The Parmesan pork was ok, not great - a little bland. The various beef cuts were amazing though, and I loved the garlic chicken. Our whole party pretty much burst into laughter at the waiter 's suggestion of dessert. Their poor pastry chef doesn't get much call for work, as I think most people do NOT save room for dessert. The on tap list was very nice, was pleased to see Crispen cider there (as I am not much of a beer drinker), and the wine list was quite large. Going to have to attempt a brunch sometime."
