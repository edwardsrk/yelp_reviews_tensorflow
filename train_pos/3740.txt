b"My dad and I went to deluca's for breakfast while we were in Pittsburgh. We had heard that deluca's was very good, we also heard that it was always hard to get a seat. When we got there the line was just coming outside the door a little so we didn't expect much of a wait, but when we got there their was no wait. We were seated almost immediately at the front counter. I got the banana split hot cakes while my dad had the Pittsburg slam. My food was delicious, my dad also enjoyed his meal. The only thing that I could see as a problem is that a party of 3 or more would have to wait a while for seating."
