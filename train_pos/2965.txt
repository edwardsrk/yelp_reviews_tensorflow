b"My source for great Polish chocolateI've been here twice so far.   This grocery store features imported European specialties, especially in the sweets department.  I was delighted to find chocolate from Poland here.  I fell in love with Polish chocolates at a food trade show a couple of years ago, so I was thrilled to find a handsome selection of international bars and bulk sweets.  Goplana is my current fave.It's a bit out of the way for me, but I will definitely be back to try some other goodies."
