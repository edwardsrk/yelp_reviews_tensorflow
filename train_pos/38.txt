b"Wow, this baby's got no love on Yelp since 2010! What's up with that?Well, you guys are missing out because YUM. I recently tried the shrimp burger at this cozy little hole in the wall, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. I mean, it consisted of  burger buns, lettuce, swiss cheese, onion, tomato, and about 6 sizzling, crunchy shrimp which to my knowledge didn't have too much garnish. Still, the combination was oddly very satisfying. I like my food to have a lot of flavour through sauces, herbs and spices, but the dressing wasn't at all necessary. Great little place."
