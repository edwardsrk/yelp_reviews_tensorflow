b"The sushi rolls are really good. My favorites are the volcano, fire roll, and crab pop. They always have special rolls as well and those are pretty tasty. The hibachi is a good price for the portion, enough to eat twice. They recently starting serving pho! I'm so excited because there's not a vietnamese restaurant up this way and now this place has pho. It's authentic pho and you can tell the chef cooks the broth for more than 8 hours. It's some of the best especially during the cold days. The portion size is really big and pricing is reasonable due to the amount of meat you're given. The restaurant is family owned and very friendly. Would recommend to everyone."
