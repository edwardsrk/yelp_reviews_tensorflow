b"I've been a member since it opened and I've built  more muscle mass while losing body fat during this time. The trainers are motivating, friendly, & knowledgeable in the fitness & nutritional area. Jamison, Stephanie, & Nathalie are helpful during each class making sure everyone has the correct form & lifts correctly so they don't hurt themselves.  I love that that each class is 45 min of intense cardio or weight training except for Saturday which is an hour class. Saturday's class is my favorite with a live DJ. We live DJ Lee too. It's a great workout with a group of people, but everyone works at their own level. It's a family atmosphere were everyone gets to know each other."
