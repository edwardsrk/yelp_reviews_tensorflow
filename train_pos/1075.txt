b'I was delightfully surprised with how good Burgatory was. I went there with a fear that I was in for a Red Robin\'esq experience, over priced mediocre burgers, cheesy restaurant design, and tons of gimmicks. Fortunately Burgatory was as far from this as possible. The burgers were fantastic and I loved the build your own burger check list concept. I can\'t wait to come back and try another creation. Just to give an idea of what you can expect to spend, a "build your own burger" and a Yuengling was about $13. Also if you are getting there during the dinner rush expect a 30-45 minute wait, fortunately there are plenty of things to keep you occupied near by. We went to Uncle Sam\'s Subs and had a beer while we waited.'
