b"Riddle Room is easily my favourite board game cafe in Toronto. They have a wall full of board games and the staff there are really engaging and teach you through them. It's relatively cheap as they only require you to purchase a drink and you can stay however long you like. They also have video console games!I've tried one of their escape rooms before, and the experience was definitely worth the price I paid.  I believe there are 5 in total and I will have to come back and try them all."
