b"I eat here entirely too often, but I can't help myself. I live in the neighbourhood and have brought many friends for dinner (easy converts). There are a handful of vegetarian options but the more popular dishes are mostly meaty. I'm a vegetarian and generally stick with the cheese (panela) or vegan (avocado) burrito. The staff are all super friendly and are quick to offer recommendations to those who just can't decide. It get's busy on weekends to make a reservation in advance or go during the week (they have drink specials on some weekdays)Be smart, order the guacamole. You won't regret it. Oh, and if you have room for dessert try the chocolate molten lava cake thing (don't recall the specific name) it's ridiculous."
