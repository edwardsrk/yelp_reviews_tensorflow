b"The pizza here is pretty standard, nothing special but decent. I am a huge fan of the hot cookies though. That is what this review is for. I don't usually come to Oregano's unless I know I am getting a hot cookie for dessert. My favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Best to share with a friend is it is rather large."
