b"Despite it being a vegetarian, vegan, and healthy place to dine, their pastrami sandwich with thousand island dressing on rye bread is delicious! In my opinion, the prices are a bit steep for the type of food. There aren't a lot of meat options available, but if you are craving something hearty, order the Roo's Romanian Pastrami!"
