b"I decided to stop in a couple days ago to get my banh mi on. After watching the defeat of the NOMNOM truck on Great Truck Race on Food Network, my tummy was curious and I've heard from Cali friends that this was the go to spot. FYI I'm pesco-vegetarian and because my boyfriend will do whatever I tell him to, he also does not eat meat, so my selection was between the avocado, sardine and vegetarian. After standing in front of the menu for what seemed to be the greater part of my day I decided on the latter two. I honestly did not expect to get how much I did for only $6. I've never been a sandwich person but this beats Subway any day. I love Vietnamese food and flavors and here they were in a convenient little bread pocket, which they make fresh on the daily. I will definitely be coming back, maybe to try some of the other offerings."
