b'Read about this in "Phoenix" magazine under their "50 Best Bars" article.  Then checked it out on Yelp and it had good reviews.  Booked the reservation for last night on OpenTable and we had a blast.  The DJ was spinning old school hip hop - really loud - and it was a fun way to enjoy great sushi.  It isn\'t really a restaurant - it\'s more of a lounge / club vibe.  It would be a great place to start your evening on the town.'
