b'Went here on New Years Eve 2015. Surprisingly (for a place located within short walking distance from Fremont Street Experience) it was very quiet, not overpriced, and had plenty of tables available for walk-in guests like us! Very pleasant place, good service and AWESOME food! Very creative, familiar foods tasted unusual and unusually good! I had Tuna Tartar, Angel Hair, and Ricotta Cup with Pears as a dessert. Everything was just fantastic!'
