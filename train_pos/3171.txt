b'I was lucky enough to find this place. The manager Jack was absolutely unbelievably helpful and kind. And he likes dogs! He was efficient and help me in anyway he possibly could I was in a dire need of a new mattress and box springs and he helped me. I was in and out of there within a half hour of choosing what I wanted. I am not sure that I will ever shop anywhere else for a mattress. They will have my business forever and I will also let everyone know about them. Fast easy and efficient. Thank you again for all your help and consideration and time.'
