b"I love the Lazy Loaf and Kettle. I used to live in the area, so I'd try to go in as much as possible, but sometimes it is hard to get a seat because it is always full of people (at least when I go).I love that I get to pick my toppings on a grocery list of ingredients to make my perfect sandwich. The bread is soft and tasty, which is definitely a selling point for me. They don't give you too much though, perfect bread to topping ratio.Now on to my favorite part - the coffee. I have no words to describe their coffee other than delicious. Or maybe perfect. Or smooth. I change my mind, there are lots of words to describe it. I currently live quite a ways away from the Lazy Loaf now, but I would drive there just for some of their coffee, that's how much I like it."
