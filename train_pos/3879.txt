b'I have been going to this place since I was 10-11. A decade later I still go every few months and the food is still a good. Some of the cashiers have watched my sister grow from an infant to a preteen to put it into perspective. The food is incredibly cheap and very quickly made. The chicken corn soup and spring roll has tasted the same for over a decade. The Szchewan chicken over fried rice, the beef ho fun, Singapore noodles, Malay noodles, house delight, deep fried tentacles, deep fried squid, the deep fried pork chops over fried rice and the Shanghai noodles are a must try. I can usually get an entree with soup or a spring roll for about $10-$15 depending on how hungry I am. You can usually feed a family of 4 on about $20-$30 here which is great!'
