b"I've read through the reviews and listened to what friends had to say about it so I mixed feelings! I had to try it myself and first the decor is amazing. You can tell time and effort went into this place. I went on a Sunday evening so it wasn't busy at all, perfect time to go. Our server was super sweet just really slow and didn't check on us much. The food: 8/10. The cornbread isn't anything special and was dry, hard, and burnt. Other than that, the chicken was fried to perfection. The mac & cheese, greens, and yams was also a plus! The grilled catfish comes with grilled onions and peppers and seasoned just right.I also wasn't a fan of the turkey burger sliders, the bun was hard, poorly put together, no flavor; pretty much waste of money. Overall, good food! I'd return for sure."
