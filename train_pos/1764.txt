b'Located inside Planet Hollywood, around the corner from the Starbucks. This fancy "diner" matches the rest of the Urban Hip decor of this Casino Hotel.The food is pretty good here. Service was not too bad. The Waiter was friendly & attentive, but slow....like was the kitchen located at the other end of the Vegas Strip? The food is pricey, but Hubby used his Reward Card points to pay for the meal...which was almost as much as eating at a BUFFET!!!'
