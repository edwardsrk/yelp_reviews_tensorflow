b"This bike shop was awesome!! Reasonable prices, GREAT customer service, not condescending at all, (like you sometimes get at bike shops)! Super helpful tips on trails nearby, helped us get the bikes into our car, trail maps, reverse osmosis water to fill your camelback, etc! Literally couldn't ask for more!"
