b'If you like the Tempe brewpub, this NoSco "grill and tap" is very similar. To start, all the yummy Four Peaks brews are the same (can\'t you just picture the Four Peaks mobile trekking keg after keg up the 101?), and the excellent pub grub on the menu is identical to the Tempe location. Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side\'s more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They\'ve clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe\'s, but oh well). I like that there\'s a loft-like second story to the Scottsdale location, but it\'s not nearly as bustling upstairs for some reason. If you\'re in Scottsdale, stop in, order a Kiltlifter and get the reuben sandwich or one of the big juicy burgers.'
