b'A solid 4.5...just shy of a 5.My stars:  (5=epic "best of") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)Go or No?  Go!Tease:   Iron Chef Bobby Flay\'s Southwestern restaurant in Caesar\'s Palace (right by their sports book)Why I went:  Because I am a fan of Flays!When:  11/18/12Food:  I had the Mesa Burger...I was craving a high quality burger for lunch as we were there early in the afternoon.  We had a total group of 4 dining.  Other entrees included the grouper, pulled pork sandwich, and bacon quesadilla.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  A number of us also enjoyed their amazing and spicy Bloody Mary\'s!  I\'ve eaten here a number of times.  Every time, I really have enjoyed my meals!  The flavors are so vibrant and interesting.  Things can be spicy, so if you like that...you\'ll love Mesa Grill!    Basically the food & drinks are delicious!Service:   Mike P was our server, and he did a fine job.  Hints/Final thoughts:   The food here is really super tasty!  However, the only real complaint is that a lot of the dishes are not changeable.  Given many marinades, sauces, and preparation...apparently, they can\'t make many substitutions.  For my wife, who can\'t eat cilantro, this made ordering a little difficult.  They will try, but sometimes there can\'t be much done.'
