b'Cuisine is outstanding - unique Southwestern creations with excellent flavor.APPSHighly recommend the tiger shrimp & roasted garlic corn tamale - shrimp was juicy and the corn was a surprisingly perfect complement. Pass on the blue corn bbq duck pancake, taste was fairly salty/heavy and one-dimensional. MAINSChile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. Rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey. There are only 3 steaks on feature - black Angus NY strip, coffee-rubbed filet mignon and bone-in chipotle-glazed ribeye. Coworker enjoyed the coffee-rubbed filet.SIDESCauliflower gratin with roasted poblano was delicious and creamy. Double-baked potato with horseradish, scallion had a subtle horseradish note, which was a good complement to the meal. Service was attentive and helpful with recommendations. Ambiance is fairly average.'
