b"Awesome gym to go to. I've been coming here for some time. Eos fitness overall is a great gym to come to and the staff is great as well, but mainly I want to give a special shoutout to Casey, this man was so generous and down to earth, he went above and beyond to help me find my phone when I had lost it here. He actually let me borrow his phone to track down my iPhone and thanks to him I found it. He's the real MVP :)"
