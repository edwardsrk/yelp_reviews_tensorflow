b'Very nice dining experience. Fresh ingredients, well prepared. Atmosphere and service was casual and friendly. Nice mood lighting, linen napkins and table cloths. The scallops with truffle butter and herb, asparagus risotto was outstanding. Wine list was small but thoughtful; like the food the focus is on quality rather then quantity.'
