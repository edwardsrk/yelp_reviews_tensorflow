b'I would love to give this place 5 stars if I was rating on the food and customer service only!  However, as a business sometimes what patrons you brings you down as well. Let\'s start with the chicken; it is really, really good.  What is better than the chicken; the bread!  Anyone who has eaten here knows the bread is killer.  The sauce, yep, don\'t forget about the sauce it to is killer, and will draw you back for more. The customer service is outstanding. The young kid with the "poofy" ( I mean that in a nice way) who brings out the food is a sweetie.  The counter girls are also very efficient, even though it is so busy in there. Now, the chaos!  The patrons!  This place is super busy during mid day and there were a group of rude, loud, obnoxious girls in BIKINIS eating while all the mothers inside were trying to distract their kids from noticing.  One of these scantly clad divas came up to my table while my son was alone, and just grabbed a chair.  No asking, no excuse me, no nothing.  Fortunately, for me and her I only needed 3 and not 4 chairs. I didn\'t want to have to embarrass my kids with a scene. I have since gone to the Henderson location and it is just as lovely minus the Divas!Love Raising Cane\'s.....'
