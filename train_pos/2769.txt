b"4.5 stars. Food and baked goods on point.Made our way here on Canada day. Got there around 11, was told it would be a 45 minute wait. Perused and walked to the basilica (and even went in) and made it back and waited about another 10-15 additional minutes  past the original 45 min. No biggy, though. Place is small and loud and bustling.Food: Poached egg on your face panini. Perfectly cooked eggs, with a little bit of a kick to it. The boyfriend got the pizza pocket and that was deliciously warm and kind of sweet. Both sandwiches were reasonably priced.What takes the cake here are the desserts. Although I was bummed because they didn't have the banana chocolate brioche, we tried the raspberry white chocolate brioche. That pastry was all around soft, sweet and tart and just very, very delicious. Also took a chocolate cooke and lemon poppy seed cookie home and those were moist, tangy, and rich. I love their pastries.Service: Awesome. Friendly. They take american credit cards too.I would definitely come again the next time I visit Montreal."
