b'Went last night with a party of 16. Staff was extremely accommodating and friendly.The restaurant was tastefully done. You order and they bring the food to you.The turn around time was efficient especially since we were a large group. The food was delicious and there is something tasty for the biggest carnivore to a vegan. Chips are complimentary and there is a salsa and fixings bar. Portions are generous. They also serve wine and beer. This one will certainly be a good back again and I am pretty certain the whole group felt the same way.Very positive experience.'
