b"What an adorable spot!  The pink and white color scheme and cozy booths made me feel so 1950s, I wanted to throw on a poodle skirt!  We stopped in on a Sunday evening around 8pm and the place was packed.  Luckily we didn't have to wait but five minutes for a table.  We split a burger and each ordered a dessert.  The burger came with chips and coleslaw, all of which were subpar.  Our ice cream desserts however, made up for the burger and sides.  Skip the dinner options and splurge on the ice cream options instead!"
