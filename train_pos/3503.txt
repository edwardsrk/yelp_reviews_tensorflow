b"I ordered the yellow curry veggie style because it's my favorite and because all the positive reviews on yelp about the yellow curry. IT WAS SO YUMMY!! the veggies included, onions, carrots, potatoes, broccoli, and cabbage. I ordered a 3 because reviews had said they run hot and they were right I love spicy food and a 3 was the prefect amount of heat. My total with tax was 8.61$ I am super satisfied and am wanting to try the lunch special next time I have a layover!"
