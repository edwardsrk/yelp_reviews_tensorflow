b'I try my best to be honest and detailed so that other tourists can make an informed decision regarding visiting an establishment. My wife and I were in Vegas looking for good Italian food. We searched Yelp and other resources and decided we wanted to try this restaurant. Our journey: this is not the restaurants fault, but worth noting. Not knowing how to get to this establishment we relied on the directory. BIG MISTAKE. no joke it took us 20 min to find this place. After asking, and looking at several directories ( that show "you are here" backwards from where you really are). At one point my wife and I were tempted to just eat any place, but it became a game to find this restaurant. Once here it was smaller than expected and kind of exposed to the mall. But we were happy to find it! The service was superb! Wish I remembered our waiters name. A younger Italian gentleman. Super nice, checked on us at all the right times. Overall very good service. Food: we both had Caesar salads that were very good. I had chicken parmesan which was great and my wife had chicken Marsala. It was honestly very good food. Our bill came and it was "cheap" for Vegas, around $80 or so. Considering we had great service and good food I put $120 bucks in the binder and we finished our drinks. Our waitress took the bill, asked if we needed change and I said no you\'re all set. 2 min later he walked pasted us and thanked us which was nice. As we left he made it a point to thank us again saying he really appreciated it. I wasn\'t looking for that, but it was very nice of him. I recommend this place. No frills, small, but great food with good service.'
