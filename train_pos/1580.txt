b'Things started out a little slow. Fajitas came out with no tortilla shells. I had to track down the manager to have them brought to the table. Service was ok. I think our server was newly returned to the job and might have had a few too many tables to work. When it was all set and done, food was tasty and the manager did come over to apologize for the service. I would go back and give them another chance.'
