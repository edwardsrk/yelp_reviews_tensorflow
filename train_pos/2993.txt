b'My favorite item from Panera is their Mac n Cheese! Today I decided to try their newer menu items because they\'ve added quite a few! I had a "You Choose Two" - you select two of either soup, sandwich, pasta, or salad. I got Chicken Sorrentina Pasta & Baked Potato Soup* equal amounts of pasta, chicken and spinach ; sauce is good ; pasta may have been a little overcooked today though* great baked potato soup!Coworker also had a "You Choose Two" - Tortellini Alfredo & Broccoli Cheddar SoupOverall good place to have a quick lunch!'
