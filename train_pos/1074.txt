b'First time here and not disappointed at all. Decor is rustic and well put together. Eager and friendly staff. Prices are so reasonable. Pours from 6 ounces and up. Dark Star Rises is a porter with roasted coffee from Allegheny Tea and Coffee Exchange. So good! They also carry the Pina Colada mead from Apis; sweet and refreshing. Brain Bucket and Gunga Galunga are also delish. No food this visit but definitely next time around.'
