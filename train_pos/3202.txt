b"Placed my very 1st order today. I am very pleased with my order. Very friendly and the BEST customer service I've dealt with since moving to the valley. Thank you for being awesome! I order a Green Chili with Shredded beef burrito, cheese quesadilla, side of beans, chips and salsa, and a side of sour cream. It was worth the wait and can't wait to order again!"
