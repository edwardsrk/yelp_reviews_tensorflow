b'First time here with two little boys my 5 yo boy and his 9yo friend. We just came from Flipnout extreme and this was the closest dine in pizza place we could find. Very happy we came here. The I think manager or owner was very polite and friendly with us making us feel welcome. The pizza we ordered, a small half cheese and pepperoni and garlic bread, was very good!  Overall, we would come again. :)'
