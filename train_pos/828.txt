b"I am so happy to finally have a decent Chinese delivery around us!  We got a flyer on our door so decided to try it last night.  The food is AMAZING!  We ordered (2) sesame chicken, pork fried rice and moo shu pork.  The portions are huge and the food is fantastic.  Delivery was super fast.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because I specifically asked for hot mustard and sweet and sour.  They sent 3 packs of hot sauce.  Well done, Tsing Tao, well done!"
