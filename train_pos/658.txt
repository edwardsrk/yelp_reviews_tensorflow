b'My go to place for my texmex cravings. For under $11 I got a huge large naked shrimp bowl. I usually ask for tons of veggies toppings to make it healthier and to get a bang for my buck! Guac is 80c extra which is a bit annoying thought. Good basic Mexican flavours and efficient service. Usually so pick up but they also have some spots for dine in as well.'
