b'We have been eating here for 5 years and though it is a little bit pricey for some things on the menu, you get what you pay for and what you pay for is the best Sushi and service in Nevada! The staff is amazing and friendly- they know us by name and give my 5 year old hugs and high fives when we come in! I love the entire menu but if I had to eat one only one thing every day for the rest of my life it would be Salmon Lover no Rice! Best thing I have every eaten! (Close runner up is the scallop hand roll and salmon skin hand roll) We look forward to our weekly visits and when we have actually ventured out to try other Sushi places we are always disappointed as nothing ever has come close in quality, service and atmosphere as I Love Sushi!'
