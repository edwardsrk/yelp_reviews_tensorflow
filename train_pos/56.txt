b'South Point is a very nice hotel and everything is nice since it is only 6 years old.  The room is very clean, big and comfortable with a big flat screen TV.  Everything is modern and new.  Inside the hotel, there is a movie theater and bowling center.   The buffet is very cheap and they gave out a lot of coupons like a free cocktail, a free sovenior at gift shop, 50% coupon for Garden buffet.  It is a very nice hotel.'
