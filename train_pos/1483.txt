b'The sweet potato latte which Misti wrote about was what got me interested in coming here. However, it was a warm day and our bellies were full of hotpot. I wanted something cooling, so I got the patbingsu (regular size).The server who made the patbingsu really stuffed it to the brim! He even apologized for the fact that it would be messy to eat, as there was so much stuff in it. There was a nice amount of shaved ice, kiwi, banana, strawberry, boba, mango, watermelon, and the mochi bits. I loved the mochi bits, they were the perfect size!As were waiting for the patbingsu (and my friend\'s iced coffee), the smell of the taiyaki fish cakes wafted into the air. We decided to get one and split it. Well, "one" was actually "one order" - it came with 5 of the fishies. When we sat outside to eat everything, my friend noticed on a window poster that the fishies can come in different flavors (chocolate, red bean, and one other which I can\'t remember). The server didn\'t ask us what flavor we wanted, so it was just the standard red bean. While I love red bean fishies, I think my friend would have preferred chocolate as he said the red bean fishies were "meh".This is a cute space, with interesting treats. Definitely sit outside and enjoy the sun with your treats if you can.'
