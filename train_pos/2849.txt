b'Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with friends. A bit tricky to get a reso at the time we wanted, which was weird because when we showed up there were a ton of empty tables. We had a great spot by the big fireplace so it was nice and cozy. The service was fairly quick, although when our server did disappear, she took a while to return. I like that their menu has a little "gf" beside all of the gluten free items. I still specified that it was not a preference but a necessity, but that\'s my own paranoia about being glutened coming through. I ordered the chicken tacos on corn tortillas with a salad. The salad was pretty typical of any restaurant chain. The tacos were great but need to be eaten quickly as corn tortillas do not hold up as well as flour ones and the insides started busting through the bottoms soon after I started eating (I made the mistake of having the salad first). The tacos were very flavourful and spicy - great combination of tastes. I really enjoyed them. They were absolutely loaded with purple cabbage (my fave!) so be aware of that if you\'re not down with cabbage. I\'ll be back to try more of their gfree offerings!'
