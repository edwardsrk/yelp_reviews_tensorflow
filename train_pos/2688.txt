b'Looking from the outside the sign just says "Cleaners" in a little shopping center at the corner of Providence Road West and Lancaster Highway. I was in search of a nearby dry cleaners with good service and prices because I was feeling especially "adult" that afternoon and decided to have creases in my work pants and pressed dress shirts. The dress can be a little pricey when compared to everything else. Around $9 to dry clean a dress, but around $4 for shirts, and less than $2 to press a shirt with starch. The service is very nice, and they have a pretty quick turnaround. I dropped off 7 shirts and a dress on a Friday and received them back on Tuesday. They were also able to get out some stains on things I were afraid were unsalvageable.'
