b'Food was nothing special...definitely have had better Thai. I did appreciate the gluten free menu. The super great service we got is the reason for the 4 star rating! I was really impressed by that.  Also, the cute outdoor patio was nice as well.  The food alone would have been a three star... I tried the pad thai and panang curry.  Maybe other dishes are better?'
