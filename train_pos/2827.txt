b'Great great show! Get there early! Get up front at the waiting line by the bar. Line up starts at 8pm right by the 2nd floor entrance. you don\'t wanna be at the back of the theater. its a flat level theater so general admission means 1st come 1st serve if you don\'t upgrade you will be sitting at the rear half. Show is great with a GREAT live band and the best version of Bjork\'s "Oh so quiet.....sh sh" (other than Bjork\'s, of course) Singing, dancing, contortionists, acrobatics and even burlesque....... all awesome.'
