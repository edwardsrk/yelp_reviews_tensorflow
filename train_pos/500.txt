b"My son has just chided me for never writing a good review. So that I become more credible, let me state that the dinner I had last night at the Ocean Club was fantastic.My waiter, Michael was very entertaining and attentive. The tuna tartare appetizer was very large and it was very high quality.The Boston chowder was good, i take off a point for too much bacon and not enough clams.The Mediterranean Bronzino was perfectly prepared and totally delicious.I tried some of their famous butter cake, it was as a good of a desert that I have ever tried, just too full to eat much of it.If you are in Scottsdale, don't miss this place."
