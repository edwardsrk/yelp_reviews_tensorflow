b'The idea behind this place is great. It screams nostalgia for any gamer while providing really good pizza. The pepperoni pizza was delicious. The crust was cooked to perfection and the cheese was gooey and melted. They carry a variety of canned sodas, my personal favorites including Grape soda and Vanilla Dr. Pepper! Being able to play video games while you wait for your order is what makes this place so unique. Each table against the wall has at least one system hooked up varying from NES to the Wii U and PS3! Overall great place. 4 stars instead of 5 because of location size. It could be so much more if moved to a larger location. But, start small and grow Super Pizza Bros.'
