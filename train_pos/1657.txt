b"Some friends recommended Mesa Grill and it did not disappoint! I had the filet and it was the best steak I have ever had! It was so tender it was like butter. My wife had chicken and it was also amazing! The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the dessert. I had the the banana cream pie and it was okay, not great. Wife had the coconut cake and she said the same thing about hers. They also had tables really close to each other which didn't feel very private. I felt like the people on each side of us were listening to our conversation."
