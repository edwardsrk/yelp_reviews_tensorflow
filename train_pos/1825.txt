b"Upscale southwest themed restaurant. Service was excellent and included great little touches for a memorable experience. The food is southwestern with a touch of French influence. You won't find tacos and enchiladas, instead think American fine dining flavored with chili's. And tamales or corn on the side. Dessert was delicious! I also recommend the peach margarita. Tip: some of the tables face the hotel sports bar and the tv's take away from the restaurant atmosphere."
