b"The Peoria Red Robin is super convenient for the avid movie goer since it's located right across the street from the best movie theater. The service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is casual and modern. We have been coming to Red Robin for years and I will say I miss their old decor of old movie posters and random nostalgic trinkets from years past. The seats are comfy and the booths are roomy (fluffy friendly). And each table is equipped with a tablet that lets you order drinks, appetizers, desserts, and your meal (or you could just wait for your server but it is a time saving tool for sure)- and pay. The food is hot and fresh! You can customize your burger order with a variety of buns which is a plus and they offer bottomless fries AND broccoli. Kinda nice that they offer healthier options but I'll stick with the steak fries. Be sure to sprinkle the table-side seasoning on your fries too for the extra kick in flavor. And did I mention there is a full bar here too? Let's also not forget about bottomless root beer floats! Yes, you read that right - bottomless. Root. Beer. Floats."
