b"This is a review of the restaurant experience.The environment and service are both good, so I'll get right to the food. I had the $6 green pork chili hand pie/chocolate creme brulee combo. The prices are low on the absolute scale, but the portion size reflects this. It will satisfy the average hunger and is about the same size as some fast food places, but there are other restaurants at similar price points that offer quite a bit more food. You do get a side salad with the hand pie, so that helps some. Next time, I would order it with no dressing because the salad dressing tasted a bit weird.The hand pie and creme brulee were both tasty and made with care. The creme brulee topping was on the thicker side, but the flavor was there.I liked my meal and dining experience, and I would like to return."
