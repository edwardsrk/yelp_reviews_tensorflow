b"I went for my appointment and was acknowledged right away.  My stylist is the owner (I'm sorry - I forget your name - Naia?) and she was nice, fun, very personable and just the right amount of chatty.   She gave me a lovely new style which everyone likes and I love.  I would definitely recommend this very clean, very professional, and very upbeat salon."
