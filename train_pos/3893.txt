b"Did some damage here while in Vegas.  Was in town for the Backstreet Boys concert and happened upon this place while meeting up a friend off the strip.  It's in a little strip mall next to the K-BBQ place - you can't miss it- the sign is very visible from the street.They have a bunch of Korean beauty products as well as clothes and fashion accessories.  I mainly went crazy with the beauty products since there were a couple items I had been looking for and couldn't find online or at a K-beauty store in LA.  They also have a vast face mask selection with different brands which I loved!The store is very bright and cute and very well curated.  The girl who was working there was very friendly and knowledgeable about all of the products which made picking stuff easier.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!  Or open a store in LA!  That would make the drive much easier for me."
