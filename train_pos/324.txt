b'There was three of us who came and tried this restaurant, we all love korean food so our expectation is pretty high, especially after reading yelp reviews...this place did not disappoint...the location is not the most attractive place in vegas and most visitors will never try coming to this local gem, but if you are like me who is looking at las vegas as a vacation resort instead of just gambling and party destination, then you will love mingling with the locals here...the ambience is great, service is good amd most of the guest are very relax...the decor is nothing to be proud of and the location is caterred to locals, but you will not leave disappointed...start with their combo...share your orders so you can try more of their menu...if you are with group, try not to order the same item and just share...'
