b"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. I got the veggies with homemade ranch (I love ranch). And the boytoy got a double bacon cheeseburger. He said it was absolutely amazing! And he adores cheeseburgers. So I believe him. My veggies and ranch were exactly what I wanted. Don't worry, I had French fries too. And they were so good! I like to pretend I'm healthy while I drink excessively... haha... so the beer was cold, the food we had was great, and the service and atmosphere were great! We will be back for sure. Ps. They brought our beers in about 15 seconds? It was amazing!"
