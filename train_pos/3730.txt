b'Taco Tuesday!? Los Taquitos is my favorite Ahwatukee Taco Tuesday joint.  Whether taking out or dining in, you head to the register to order and pay. The line can get long sometimes, but it is worth the wait. However, I typically call my order in a head of time to try saving some time.Depending on my mood, I enjoy their burritos and tacos.  Their fish tacos and pollo tacos are my favorite! At the counter, they have a few different salsas to add some additional flavor to your meal.I guess Guy Fieri had an episode of DDD here!'
