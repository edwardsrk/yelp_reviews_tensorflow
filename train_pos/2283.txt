b"More like 4.5 stars, but I didn't have that option.  Greenhouse Tavern was another of our must hit places in Cleveland during our short weekend trip.  This place was laid back, casual, and very homey.  Service was pretty slow, but our waiter had 2 other huge parties, so we understood.  We enjoyed the experience nonetheless.We started with couple of small plates - Devils on Horseback (bacon wrapped dates) and Foie Gras Steamed Clams - both were delicious!  We soaked up the warm bread they served us with the juice from the clams...can you say foodgasm?  We then had the Chicken Wing Confit....great twist on the buffalo wings.  The meat was falling off the bones and it had a great kick with a hint of what tasted like lemon grass.I ordered the Garlic Chive Risotto, which was great, but a little cheesy for my taste, and my BF ordered the granddaddy of them all....The Roasted Pig Head.  OMG this plate was so huge and he had a half of a pig head on his plate, teeth and all.  The meat was so tender and the fat just melted in your mouth.  I think he did a hell of a job finishing that all by himself.Like we did at Lola, we shared 3 desserts between us - Buttered Popcorn Pot de Creme, Vegan Chocolate Custard, and the Johnnycake.  Very small portions, but very tasty.  The chocolate custard was my favorite out of the three.It's definitely a place I would go back to if we're ever back in Cleveland."
