b"My husband and I started out with the beer cheese dip appetizer.  It was delicious.  It was 4 generous pieces of amazing pretzel bread accompanied by slices of bell peppers and carrot sticks.  The beer cheese dip was great...I maybe could have used just a little bit more though...we ate every last bit of the dip.  For dinner, my husband order the corned beef and cabbage entree.  After insisting to him that I do not like corned beef, he finally got me to try it.  I bet he wishes he wouldn't have...because after that I was sneaking bits of meat off his plate for the rest of the meal.  It had so much flavor and it almost melted in my mouth because it was so tender.   I would highly recommend trying it!   I ordered the shepherd's pie which was also delicious.  It's the perfect comfort food...meat and veggies topped with delicious mashed potatoes.  It's a very hearty meal, and I thoroughly enjoyed my leftovers the next day.They also had live music which was very nice."
