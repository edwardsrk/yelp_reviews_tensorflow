b"It was a lovely place to stay at.  Our place overlooked the pool and had enough room to house our 7 people comfortably for the weekend. Good selection of channels available on the TV, and the kitchen had a stove, oven, microwave, and stuff to cook with, which was lovely.There is good security at the door - the guard asks where you're heading to or who you're visiting at the gate which keeps out random wanderers. Nice bar across the street too if you want some quick and affordable food.You're basically in the middle of nowhere, but though I have not personally tried it, I hear there's a shuttle that takes you from the resort to the Strip.HOWEVER, the BIGGEST downside (in my opinion anyway) is no free wi-fi - you have to pay quite a bit extra for it. When you consider how even really crappy hotels have free wi-fi, it was ridiculous and annoying that a nice place like this didn't offer it. Luckily we were only staying 2 nights. Lovely though the place might be, I would've gone insane without internet for too long, and I wasn't about to give in and pay for their super overpriced wi-fi that should've been part of the package."
