b'Okay 4 stars for the bar and atmosphere, 3.75 stars for the food (the food is good bar food not "great" bar food, how do you rate that?;)First you need to understand that this bar is tucked neatly on the edge of Dilworth, and is very walkable from many of the surrounding homes, thus making it an easy choice for anyone who needs late night grub and or comradery (read people mingle here).  They are open late which is a plus, they have pool tables also a plus, if you like to pick your own music they have a touch tunes device there.  Decent beer selection on tap, if you\'re a beer snob go somewhere else.  If you like your beer served in buckets maybe this is 4.5 stars for you.  All in all Ed\'s is fun and the location is great, I expect their new patio will be very popular in the warmer months.'
