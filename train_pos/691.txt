b"Love UO but still very expensive, got a good selection of Levi's 511 and 510 for about $80, I can get the same pair of jeans for half that in the States!! Graphic tees are nice recently bought the Kelly Kapowski tee $25, its good quality and has a nice fit, there's some graphics that were decent but not for $25, good selection but overall very expensive"
