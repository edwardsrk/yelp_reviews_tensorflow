b'What\'s up with restaurants in the Queen and Ossington strip closing at 3pm and opening at 6pm?! I mean seriously people, it\'s 3:30pm on a Friday and I am hungry! Their loss is my win I guess because as a result of this most distasteful realization I stumbled upon Caf\xc3\xa9 Bernate.The place looks small at first glance, but don\'t worry, there is a huge back room area with plenty of seating and even a little fenced in garage door area. The decor is simple. small circular tables in the font with a large concrete "mosaic" slab counter which features keys, buttons and other odd found objects. The back has more of a backyard jungle meets 70\'s cafeteria, with larger pastel blue tables and bright orange waffle plastic chairs.Trying to select which sandwich to order proved to be challenging with so many yummy options. I ended up ordering #20, the Chicken, artichokes, spinach, and brie melt on an Italian baguette with a Red & White side salad. The salad was good, but not worth the extra $4. My sandwich was perfection, with melted brie oozing from every corner,  I had to take  moment of silence to honour the divine piece of cheese that was about to sacrifice itself for my appetite.I ended my meal with a cookie and latte, which were both perfection. I will definitely be back to try more.'
