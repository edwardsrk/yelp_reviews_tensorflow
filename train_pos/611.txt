b"I went here for the Japanese cheesecake based on previous reviews.  I was not disappointed!  The cheesecake was moist and delicious.  I paid $7.50 for the cheesecake so the price has gone up a bit since the previous reviews. They had many other desserts as well including coconut and egg tarts and a variety of buns.  I haven't tried the other desserts yet but I will be sure to do so the next time I'm here.  A gem of a find!"
