b"Fun, fun, fun. Here to celebrate the birthday of one of my son's friends. Be warned...Saturday afternoons can be PACKED! We arrived early enough to beat the crowd. I was pleasantly surprised by the food...and drinks. Pretty tasty and the menu was extensive. We had wings and sliders. Wings have a kick so they aren't for amateurs. And the sliders inspired me to go buy Hawaiian rolls and make some myself! They were really tasty. Bring your wallets. The kids will want to pack their cards to pack in the games!"
