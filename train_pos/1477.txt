b"If you're looking for some bomb coffee and delicious pastries, this is the place to come. My friends and I frequent this cafe weekly just before our Makeden sewing class next door. And it's become a favorite part of our routine. Their coffees are strong and pastries are decadent. We try something new and every time we visit. Their service does tend to be slow as there's always only one person working the till and making the coffees. Plus, no debit-just cash and credit which can be super annoying."
