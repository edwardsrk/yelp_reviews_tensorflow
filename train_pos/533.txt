b"They have vallet service right in front of the door.  There is an oyster bar that's pretty small and a bar with music.  Nice menu with your standard seafood steakhouse type dishes.  The portions are nice sized and the crab fried rice as a side but it's a must try.  The fish is fresh, the steak nicely cooked and the desserts are great.  The bananas foster butter cake is my fave."
