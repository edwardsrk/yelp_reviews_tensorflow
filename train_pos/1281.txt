b"We went for a Monday night happy hour just to check the place out without hoards of people around.  It's a beautiful set-up - classy, comfortable furniture, pool with cabanas for rent as well as plenty of free seating with lounge chairs and pool tables inside.  We had 3 appetizers and loved them all (shrimp ceviche, carnitas tacos and chicken quesadilla) - quality and quantity were great for happy hour food.  Drinks were just ok - they were 2 for 1 and filled up to the rim with ice.  It's built as a party place for sure, but early in the week could be a nice atmosphere to relax poolside during Happy Hour!"
