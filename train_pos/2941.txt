b"My mother and stepdad are full time homeowners at Cotton Lane Resort and asked that I post this review as they don't belong to Yelp. We have lived at Cotton Lane RV Park for 13 years. We all have gone thru many changes in the park. One of the best changes is the new Office Manager, Sheila Ellis Leonard. She is a delight, and she is bright, pleasant and loves her job, and it shows. She always greets everyone with a smile and she does her job efficiently. She makes sure she fulfills all of our needs and requests, and makes sure to follow-through and keep us updated. Who could ask for more? Also, the new owners have improved our park in so many ways, we are very thankful. They also are a blessing, and our park is now a standout because of them, and it is exciting to know that there is more to come!"
