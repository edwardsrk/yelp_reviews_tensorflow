b'One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte!  The live music is entertaining and the older crowd seems to enjoy dancing and drinking on Friday and Saturday Nights.  I was introduced to Mickey & Mooch during restaurant week a few years back.  I am heavily addicted to the wedge salad, filet mignon fondue and the crab cakes.'
