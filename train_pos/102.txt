b"Place was recommended to as an alternative to the super busy other seafood place and tried it out for dinner with my family over the weekend. Fancy interior decor that was expected from this sort of restaurant. Had reservations so didn't have to wait long. Set dinner was competitively priced, and had decent portions for a 5 person meal."
