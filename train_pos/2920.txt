b'We frequent the (AZ) Ave location and decided to try this one a try. The layout is weird. Kind of like a maze how it has two separate dining areas. I don\'t know why but the area where the drink machine was seemed super hot. I think the kitchen was right off that area. But not sure. Wings were hot, crispy, and tasty. Everything was good. It threw me off when I asked the girl if we got a free soda since we ordered the ATL fries with our 18 wings, and she said "not today"? But other than that, the girls were nice. Food came out fast and it was clean.'
