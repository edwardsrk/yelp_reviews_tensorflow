b"The time has finally come, THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER is here! The burger is plant based but is said to bleed, smell and taste like meat. My husband and I got it and now we feel like we want to order different burgers but substitute for the impossible patty every time!!! It was delicious! It's a different texture but there is so much flavor and you don't feel so heavy after eating it. When feeling a little guilty but still craving starch, I will order sweet potato fries but unfortunately never fully be satisfied. Not this time! The sweet potato fries were crispy, lite made perfectly! On top of our delicious meal I love the different ketchups. Seems simple but it's the simple things in life that we appreciate most! Also the staff was awesome! Very friendly and attentive."
