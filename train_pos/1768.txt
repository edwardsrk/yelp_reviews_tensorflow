b"If you want a Philly cheesesteak - this is the place to go. No where in the surrounding area will you get closer to the real thing. Only reason for four stars instead of five is the roll is not 100% what you would get in the Philadelphia area. The service was fast and friendly and the cheesesteak was delicious. They put onions and peppers on their steak- which I did not have as the onion/pepper is not on a typical philly steak in philly ... so can't comment on those but they have the steak and cheese down pat! Great place to go for a cheesesteak"
