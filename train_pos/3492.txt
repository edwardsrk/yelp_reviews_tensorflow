b'Positive: The food! We had soup, chow fun, and the Peking duck. The chow fun was exactly like at home. The Peking duck  was served exactly how my sister liked (lean, less fat). Also, great service. My sister and I felt incredibly homesick after eating here. Negative: I wish the Peking duck was served on a bao instead of in the wrappers; however, my sister informs me that the wrappers are more traditional.'
