b"We always go to Mesa for special occasion. Absolutely love the dinner. We've been wanting to go for brunch and finally did. Here's my comparison of the two:Brunch bread basket was better... which says a lot cuz I'm a sucker for the jalape\xc3\xb1o cheese bread at dinner. But there's like some coffee cakes and oatmeal things and mini jalape\xc3\xb1o muffins that were all delicious. If you go for dinner you HAVE to get the cactus pear margarita on the rocks. By far the best margaritas we've tried to this day. Also their side of corn is amazing but seasonal. The tiger shrimp appetizer and rough cut tuna nachos are go tos for us as well. As far as breakfast goes, we got both quesadillas (one with egg and one with salmons- i forget what they were called) and they were delicious. The sweet potato clam soup is also great, we've had it twice. It was better the first time but still very good. My waffles... AMAZING. I could have eaten a whole stack! My husbands potato hash Benedict wasn't as spectacular. The flavor was fine but it was all one note texture wise. Very mushy. The mango glazed bacon was good- take it or leave it. Overall we are fans on Mesa and always come back. Usually we get a couple things we know we love and always try something new as well! Our service has always been excellent."
