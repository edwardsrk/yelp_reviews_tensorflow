b"Shinbay was everything I expected it to be and more (which is pretty impressive as we had built it up in our minds for months before we went). We went there for my fiance's birthday and ordered the 5 course tasting menu. Each course was more phenomenal than the next. Keep it up! Phoenix is lucky to have such a phenomenal restaurant."
