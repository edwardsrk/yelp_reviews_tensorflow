b"Just came across this place since its close by to work. Had the Pho Beef Banh Mi and a side of Karooge. The sandwich was so good, could have used some more beef (which you can get for an additional charge) but the flavors were amazing. The Karooge is pretty much fried chicken pieces and they were so delicious! If you get them as a side, they don't give many pieces, you could eat these as a meal if you order maybe 3-4 side orders but again they tasted so good and comes with a side of spicy mayo, I'll most likely get 2 orders of these next time. Apparently they're ricotta donuts are supposed to be amazing! I will def have these next. I also liked the fact that the employee came out of the back to hand deliver me my food. It was a nice touch to customer service. Can't wait to be back!"
