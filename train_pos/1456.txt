b"Just to preface, this is only a review of the bar/entertainment- not food. I honestly was skeptical at first to go to Level 20, but some friends suggested we go there for karaoke, and it was a blast!!!! The host was really nice and we all had such a good time. There was a good atmosphere. The drinks are reasonably priced too, I was expecting them to be more expensive from what I'd heard. Since then, we've been back for music trivia. It was fun, but I'm told that there was a substitute host that night, and tbh she was a little rude. Again, she's not the normal person so she could have just been stressed out or having a bad day. We still had fun though! Overall- We'll definitely be back! Probably not going to try the food though based on other people's experience."
