b"Flower Child reminded me a fancier version of Lemonade or Tender Greens. It's a fast-casual place where you order first then grab a table. I went at 2pm, and there was still a steady stream of people. Food was delicious - I loved everything I got: sweet corn and quinoa, eggplant, cauliflower, and chicken. My friend got the lemonade, which is self-serve. I got the kombucha on tap, which was good but not as carbonated as I like it. I thought the portions could be a little bigger for the price, but I'll still be back. The decor was very french cafe, and their food was great quality."
