b"We have been going to this particular Home Depot since 1989. The customer service in every single department is top notch. Specifically, we had an issue yesterday where we needed help immediately with our vehicle. We had run over what we thought was paint on the freeway. Several employees grabbed different products off the shelves, along with some rags and headed for the parking lot. They worked on trying different solvents to find one that worked. While working on it, they realized it wasn't paint, but instead, roofing epoxy. So, once they discovered what worked to remove it, they donated all of the supplies to us so we could go home and finish the job! We are so grateful to Albert and his team for all of their help yesterday. We knew we loved out local Home Depot!"
