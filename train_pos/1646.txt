b"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while. We stopped in the other night for some guacamole. The atmosphere was awesome, fun music and enthusiastic staff!! Instead of chips the guac comes with fried plantains. I loved the plantains and would rather eat them plain! After leaving we knew we had to come back to try actual meals. Fast forward to the next day (seriously, we were that excited to go back). The same awesome employees greeted us. We tried the split chicken meal with rice and beans ( it reminded me of the Latin food I used to live off of in NYC) and the grilled chicken salad wrap. The wrap envied the size of a chipotle burrito! We also tried a beef empanada and it was a standout. All that for under $20 with servings that are guaranteed to turn into leftovers. Eat in their bright dining area or take your food to the nearby park. This is the kind of local joint I have no problem giving my $$ to!"
