b"Great food at this location. The restaurant was clean, and we were greeted right away. I got the classic chicken sandwich, grilled and with the spicy chipotle mayo in place of the regular mayo. This is so good!  The fries and chicken were hot, and the veggies were cold. Perfect. I love how thin the chicken is. It's not small either, it is a good sized sandwich. My husband said that his burger was perfectly done and juicy. The food at this location is great, and we will travel a ways to return here."
