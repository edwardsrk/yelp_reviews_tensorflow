b"You have to try this place out if you love Mediterranean food and if you are REALLY hungry. Yes come here really hungry because the portions are huge! There is a small market that is attached to the small dining area. It's not too pretty but don't let that stop you from trying out their food! We stopped by for dinner and it was starting to get busy when we arrived. There aren't too many tables but they were definitely doing their best to clean them as soon as people were done. We were helped right away and menus were given to us. They have sandwiches and a ton of entrees to pick from. We decided to order one shish kabob, one gyro plate, and a chicken schwarma plate. My chicken schwarma was delicious! It came with a ton of chicken, hummus, delicious basmati rice, and a piece of pita. My husband had the shish kabob plate and the also came with rice, grilled vegetables, and a side salad. He also had a small guava drink for $3.50 (no refill) but it was well worth it.Each plate was priced about $10 each. We spent about $45 and were there about an hour. Portions are really big and so we still had food leftover. I would definitely be back to try the chicken schwarma in the sandwich style."
