b"I love this place! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison and my hands down 1st choice for quality sushi in Madison. First of all this place is located in the Hilldale mall near a lot of great shops. Yes there isnt much parking near the restaurant but there is always parking in the Hilldale parking lot. The place has a great vibe to it, very modern. I've eaten here a number of times and all of their rolls are superb. Maybe once out of the 20+ times I've eaten here the unagi wasnt that great but it was only once.  Yes its kind of pricey but they do have discounted sushi specials for chefs choice during lunch and dinner. They have great options for small appetizer dishes that are super yummy and a lychee martini that is killer. The sake selection is kind of pricy but all really great quality. Anywhere else I would give this place a solid 3 stars but since Madison has so many limited options for great sushi I'll add another star. I'm so glad this place exists in Madison!"
