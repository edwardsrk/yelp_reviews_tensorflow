b'Stopped in here to do a pick up and was surrounded by nothing but teenagers, so maybe my lack of a fifth star is ...misplaced? The young guy who was cashier turned around toward another female staff member and said " What the hell is that? You call those bread sticks!" while I was leaving. I\'m not sure if he was joking or not but I certainly hope he was.   Otherwise, the food, as always, was awesome!'
