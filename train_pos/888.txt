b"First timer here, we've been wanting to come here for a little while. From the reviews it seemed like we needed to get here early. Luckily for us we're old ppl trapped in young bodies so we tend to go out very early so we didn't have any issue with seating, of course this was at 16:00. The staff gets a 5 star for being awesome. The burgers were good, but for $11-15 by themselves I'm not too sure. Maybe I'll try the kobe beef next time. The shakes are pretty good too. Out of the whole thing I'd say the fries and shake were our favorite. We will definitely swing in for the shakes and the loaded fries (we didn't get the loaded this time)."
