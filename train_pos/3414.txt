b"My girlfriend and I came here to get a quiet coffee and snack, somewhere away from the business of the strip, and could not have been happier! The food is delicious and prepared fresh in front of you in an open kitchen area, the owner is incredibly sweet and friendly and takes a lot of pride in what he serves up and the huge selection of pastries looked phenomenal (I was too full from my food to have one unfortunately, but next time for sure!).I would absolutely recommend this to anyone stopping by for a quick coffee or brunch/lunch and will be sure to come back anytime I'm in Vegas!5/5!!!"
