b'In from out of town and had a tire with a slow leak. Had to do a roadside spare tire change and limp my way over to this Discount Tire. I saw how good the reviews were here so I drove past several other tire shops on the way. Amazing service from Jonny; quick, professional and courteous. Found that it was only a leaking valve stem so no repair needed. In an out of there within 20 minutes. Definitely highly recommend!'
