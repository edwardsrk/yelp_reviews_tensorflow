b'Started with drinks, White Russians my favorite.    Had the lobster bisque Yummy with lots of lobster.   Finished with grilled pub sprouts.   They were very filling.   Tasty with bacon like meat.   Very nice.   Had 8 in our group, waited 5 or 10 minutes, quick service, sat us right away, waiter was great.    Would highly recommend and will definitely be back.'
