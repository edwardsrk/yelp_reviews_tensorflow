b'This is the perfect place for a "staycation." Ugh, I hate that I just used that term, but it is the correct one to use.  Firesky is a beautiful resort, nice pool, service, rooms, and all.  Very nice firepits and free wine, beer and other drinks during happy hour.  I live in Phoenix, so it was a nice weekend away while still being near home. If I\'m coming from out of town though I may want to stay somewhere a little more modern and swanky.It\'s less than a $5 cab ride from Old Town Scottsdale, so in other words it\'s free.
