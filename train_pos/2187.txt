b'Sooo...Corinne and I after a satisfying lunch at Bangkok Balcony ended up making our way over to Waffalonia. Best decision of the day. The girl at the counter was super nice and let us try that delicious concotion in a bottle "Spacculos" which she described as tasting like a graham cracker it was guuud. Test tasting is always fun. After we had our fill of samplings we order two waffles and sat down and split a hot cocoa. Luuuuveed it.'
