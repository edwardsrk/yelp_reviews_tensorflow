b"I called HoneyComb for an appointment for full highlights, cut, and blow-out. I couldn't come in during work hours but I was able to get in with Tia Hunter within two weeks (which is pretty good for a 2 hour appointment after 5:30 pm)! The salon itself is neat, clean, simple and whimsically decorated. Tia took time to listen to me describe what I wanted to do with my hair and she offered advice and recommendations. She took the time to explain what she was doing and gave me some tips for maintaining the style. Tia updated the color and cut with some very subtle changes but it definitely freshened up my style! I am still super happy with her work two weeks out. Thanks Tia!"
