b"I went with my friends on a Tuesday night and I have to say, their service was pretty awesome. Our server was attentive, promptly refilled our empty water containers, and served us food all in a timely manner. For a table of 8, we didnt wait very long for all of our food to arrive; which was amazing since we didnt have to wait until our food is cold to begin eating. Four of us decided to share, so we ended up getting quite a few selections from their menu. Their calamari and polentas were extremely well done, I loved the chili oil dipping sauce the calamari came with. The bruschetta was good, and the buratta was a very interesting app (it was the first time ive tried this). I probably would order the spicier version of it to try next time I come back. The pastas we ordered were all very delicious. I highly recommend the shrimp spaghetti, the sauce was beautifully done with plenty of tender shrimp on the side. The poor man's parmesan was crunchy on top, making every bite an experience. The only thing I did not enjoy was the diavolo pizza. The balsamic vinegar was wayy too strong, it was all i could taste when I bit into it. I could barely finish 1 slice. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, I would definitely come back to dine again. On a side note our server was awesome as she split the bills perfectly for us without mistakes. Bonus!! :)"
