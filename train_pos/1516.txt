b"This is a place that you must bring an out of town guest to, and if you really want to be creative with how to propose marriage this would be a good place to, heck it's good for any occasions other than break-ups and affair confessions. It's a throwback to the 50s soda parlor, it's so old school, and quite cute! Everything's pink, that it almost feels like Barbie is the owner of the store and she just wanted everyone to know pink is the color of the ultimate diva! Their's a soda bar and booths, and tables and chairs, and it's a great family friendly atmosphere. During the days it attracts families and in the evening, couples, teens, and kids at heart! I like their changing flavors of the month board where you can take out either a pint of quart of their hand packed ice cream!They offer shakes, floats, splits, and cones/bowls of ice cream! love it! And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches. One thing you'll notice when seated are the many frames of Family Circle comics. Bil Keane the comic strip writer is a big fan of Sugar Bowl and alot of his comics mention the place, so it's pretty cool a comic strip celebrates the awesomeness of this old town landmark. These are my favorites, the top hat sundae, the buster brownie, the Desireme (D-Sire-Me) Banana Split and the 23 skiddoo!! Love them all and if I have no plans to go out, I'm willing to trek out from my place in Chandler to Old Town to pick up some ice cream and some quarts to go! It's laid back and chill... hence I've come back ever since I first went here back in 2005. Oh and the proposal thing happened to a friend of mine, her husband proposed to her at one of the booths... I think it was the 23 skiddoo!!"
