b"I had a craving for poke bowls so I decided to come here since it had relatively good reviews and was close to me. Decor: 3.5/5 very average and not too bad. I liked the big menus and the window lighting made the place super bright. There were only a few tables and some window seats. Very typical fast food joint set up. Food: 4/5 loved my bowl. I got the one with crab meat salad in it (too lazy to look up the name lol) and I you could customize the sauce and the toppings. There was a nice selection of toppings and sauces and the lady suggested I try the spicy mayo sauce since I didn't know what to pick. It was great!! The sashimi was good and seemed fresh too. The reason why I docked 1 point was because the avocado wasn't diced or fully sliced into pieces. The avocado was sliced but it wasn't all the way, so it seemed like they just put half an avocado in there. You pretty much had to slice it up yourself. In addition, i felt like some of the fish chunks could be smaller. I had a piece of tuna that was so big! Service: 5/5 they were super friendly and nice!! Always willing to answer any questions you have :)Can't wait to try the other signature bowls!"
