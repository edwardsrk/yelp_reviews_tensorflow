b"I was in the area with family, headed to a concert at Celebrity Theater. We stopped in here to have dinner and it was pretty good. It's far from me and I wouldn't make the trip just to eat here, but if I was in the area, I'd definitely come back.It's a bit pricey. Two two-meat platters (comes with two sides), one pulled pork meal (one side), 3 drinks and tip was $56~Ribs and brisket were decent, not the best, but better than most. I make ribs at home, so I'm super picky about these.My wife and my dad both said the pulled pork was excellent. I thought their BBQ sauce was original and very tasty. I assume they're making it in house and that it's not a commercial restaurant product.Mac and cheese was ok, with a good flavor but the texture was off. It was quite mushy. My wife loves green beans and she said they were really good. I had collard greens and these were cooked perfectly. I'm used to them being cooked with smoked meat for flavor. These were not, but were still tender and nicely seasoned.Portions are the right size.I think we stopped in like 30 minutes to closing, so that could explain the Mac and Cheese.Really nice people running the place, were welcoming and courteous."
