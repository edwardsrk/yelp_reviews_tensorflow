b"3.5 stars rounded up to 4... We came here for Sunday Brunch... it was a MUST on our to do list because Stella could not stop talking about the bread basket... lol... she even mentioned it to our server a few times just to make the point across that we MUST have this bread basket. lol.  When we did get the bread basket, it wasn't as great as she remembered it to be... she said they changed it up... I wasn't too impressed with it either... I just took a bite out of every type in the basket to see what the hype was about.  For appetizer we shared the Salmon and Tuna Tartares, which we were told was new to the menu... it was served with deep fried plantains and on the menu it said blue corn flatbread, but we had one small piece of blue corn chip... which I guess was the flatbread... I don't know.  We all ended up getting the Mesa Burger which was really juicy but it was too much burger for me... I ate half of it and I couldn't even pick at the other half... I tried just eating the meat but I gave up."
