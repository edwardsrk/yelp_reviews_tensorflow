b'We walked in the door and were immediately greeted and seated by the hostess. The restaurant has a warm and inviting atmosphere. While we waited for our entrees, we snacked on a couple of crunchy egg rolls for a appetizer and my husband had a cup of egg drop soup that came with his meal. All was delicious, nothing unique about the appetizer, but as expected. I ordered the daily ramen and my husband ordered the teriyaki chicken. I like that they offer white or brown rice as a option. The ramen was very good- brothy and full of fresh veggies and chicken.  My husband really liked his chicken teriyaki as well. The whole meal was about $30 before tax and tip. Great experience overall! We will definitely come back and bring our three teenagers. There was something there for every body.'
