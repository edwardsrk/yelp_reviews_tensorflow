b"It seems that the farther you go from the Strip, the better the breakfast options. My theory is still that people don't wake up early enough around there for a lot of breakfast-dedicated establishments to be profitable...but that's probably BS. Whatever, it doesn't matter.I decided on this cafe because they have lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote. I don't know why more places don't offer this type of pancake, but because so few of them do, I love getting them whenever I can. As stated in my other reviews, I hold breakfasts to a higher standard than other meals. It's the most important. It's my favorite. Ya better not screw it up.Well, MTO definitely didn't screw it up. These poppyseed cakes are DIVINE! Typically I'm not a fan of lemon, but when it's paired with the cakey pancake, the nutty poppy seeds, and the sweet blueberries, it's irresistible. My friend ordered the scrambled eggs and bacon, because he's a simple kind-a guy. I dig it though - they're the cornerstone of a well-balanced breakfast. He likes bacon that isn't too crispy or too chewy, so the bacon was perfectly cooked for him. He wasn't as much of a fan for the eggs, but they got the job done.This orange cafe is a refreshing and safe change from the series of perhaps-questionable stops on your Vegas Strip visit."
