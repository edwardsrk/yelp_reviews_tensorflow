b"Biscuits is a great breakfast/lunch place. Be prepared to wait on Sat/Sun mornings but it' always been worth it. Friendly but busy staff, free coffee while you wait and they always say they are sorry for making you wait.  The decor is back home country. Reminds me of my grandma's kitchen. The food is good, and a huge plus for having chicken fried chicken for breakfast, that means no more having to go to nasty cracker barrel for it!  I love the country gravy, love the chicken fried chicken. The grits seem pre-sweetened and I can see how people might not like that, myself I am all good with that. Now the one downer is the Biscuits, I am not a huge fan, they are huge and heavy. I myself like the lighter ones. I've had breakfast and lunch items both there and all have been lovely. My best friend swears by the corned beef hash, he orders it as an add on to everything and anything he gets there. You can eat and get beyond full for two for about 20 bucks and that is a huge plus for me. The only bad thing we ever got there was a cinnamon roll for my son. He said it was nasty and couldn't get past one bite, he said it tasted like a hard roll with some funky icing.  I have never myself tried it but it didn't look that good honestly. But hey, if that is the only minus for them I am ok with that!I would totally suggest getting over here and give them a try, they are also open late on Friday and Sat's for fish frys!"
