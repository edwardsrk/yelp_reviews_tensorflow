b'Food good. Setup odd. People nice. Money gone.Walk in, find table. (You will not be seated, no one will come to get you. If you wait, you will look new, not just to the restaurant, but to earth)Claim table with jacket, backpack or park your fave, but rotund Uncle who prefers to sit.Walk over to wall with menu items, there are no food menus. Pick food items. NOTE: Each meat is too much for 1 person. Order 2 or 3 meats & 1 or 2 sides. for 3 adults. Approach Cash register, say items. You will know you have succeeded if they give you a tall metal thing with a number on it. Take back to Rotund Uncle. He will pick it up, and look at all sides of it. Notes: - the sausage is truly delicious. Delicious like a cupcake, only this cupcake is very much like  sausage with a casing and hipster coddled pork or beef. - The potato side was good. Very homemade taste. Homemade if you have a McDonalds style deep fryer in your home.- The brisket. More tender than my inner thighs after a brisk August stroll. FOODIES: It has a decent smoke ring. With all of lives challenges and temptations, all I am thinking about is that sausage. This is not code for anything.'
