b"We ate there Friday night and it was an absolute delight.Scott the owner, the staff and the d\xc3\xa9cor was very inviting.The pizza was very good. The combination of the tasty crust, the right amount of sauce and a fresh mozzarella along with quality toppings makes it the best pizza I've had in Arcadia area. It was even tasty the next day.What I liked about it the most is that they're not trying to be a fancy place or going all snobby on the food as the Arcadia area restaurants do way too much.  They obviously just want to be a pizza parlor offering a good pizza, at a fair price and they seem to be doing a good job of it.They also have BYOB, you can bring in your own bottle of wine or beer and drink it with your food. I don't why but I find this kind of coolWe will definitely be back."
