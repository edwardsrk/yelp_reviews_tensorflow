b"Note: CASH ONLY!I have yet to conquer their titular menu item, but I can say with absolute confidence and honesty that The Original Gyro of Castle Shannon (formerly a pizza joint) has already vanquished every other Baklava and order of Stuffed Grape Leaves I've ever had the fortune of eating. The grape leaves are pouches of gastronomic pleasure that nearly burst with rice and a most delicate ground lamb.  The lavish, honey-kissed, nut-embedded Baklava will simultaneously exercise your jaw muscles and seduce your sweet tooth, suggesting flavors and preparation far beyond their $2 price tag.P.S. Dig those late hours!"
