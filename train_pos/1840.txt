b"Yummm love their sandwiches especially number 11! It's cheap And sooo good and fills u up. The sandwiches may be odd to some ppl but u have to try it! It's a burst of flavor. A con about this place is that sometimes the cashier man looks like he's annoyed or depressed. Cashiers should be positive! Or they get no tip! And it's cash only which is also a pain in the butt. It's 2011 and we all use a card nowadays doh"
