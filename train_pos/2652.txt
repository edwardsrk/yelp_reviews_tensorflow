b'I was waiting at the door recently to be the first one to get a newly released cell phone and tablet. Once they opened, the service rep was ready to assist and get my order processed. Jorge talked me through the different options but was respectful of my time. He was impressed that I had waited outside before the store had opened, so he knew I was a dedicated customer. I was able to acquire both electronics and get them operational before leaving the store. I would give this review five stars but there was one thing out of his control and I had to call T-Mobile on the phone to get fixed. I have done many cell phone activations since 2002 with T-Mobile and this was one of the smoothest.'
