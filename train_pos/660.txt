b'Great deal on appetizers during Happy Hour.  We tried the pineapple habanero wings, the ribs , sliders and deep fried pickles #fatkid . We both loved the batter for the pickle spears although we were surprised to see spears vs. Chips.. no biggie. Hubby enjoyed the whiskey flight. The Coldcock whiskey was hands down my favorite, an herbal flavored whiskey. The ambiance was ok, seems to be one of those spots that the service is better when you become a "regular".  WE will defiinitely be back and perhaps we will become regulars.'
