b"Glad I stopped in for lunch!I recommend the Wisconsin cheddar cauliflower soup. I had the crab avocado panini - did not care for the bread but everything in it was very good . The restaurant can get very messy because customers do not take the time to put away their trashes and garbage correctly . The clean up staff worked really hard keeping everything nice and clean . The front staff was very friendly and fast . Clean up  staff were very helpful and sweet .I'll be back for more !"
