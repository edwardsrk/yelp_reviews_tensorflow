b"Pop Up Pizza was conveniently located next to the elevator going to my room, so of course I had to try it. If you're staying at Plaza, look out for their coupon too! My welcome booklet came with a deal on two slices of cheese and a drink, but I just asked if I could pay a little extra for toppings.The storefront is cool looking and they were playing a lot of dubstep...probably because it was EDC week. The workers there were friendly, and even though there is no soda fountain outside, you can still get free refills of your drink by asking.I got a slice of their White Chapel pizza (ricotta and spinach) as well as a generic meat lovers. The White Chapel is sooo goooood! The other one was tasty too, but I preferred the White Chapel despite the lack of meat. The slices are pretty big, and I really liked the crisp yet chewy crust. Dare I say I liked it better than Secret Pizza, a Vegas joint on the strip that also has NY style pizza? What they have on this place is location, but Pop Up Pizza is cheaper, faster, and equally (if not more) delicious. Food: 4, Service: 4, Environment: 4, Price: 3"
