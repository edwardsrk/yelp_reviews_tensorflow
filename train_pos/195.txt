b'Wow. Using the overused term "hidden gem" really doesn\'t do Alexander Michael\'s proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn\'t notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There\'s no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. HINT: If you\'ve never been here, I\'d recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can\'t turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won\'t be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. Sat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It\'s kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn\'t indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I\'m glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can\'t go wrong. Service is so friendly here. You really get the feeling that these people have been at it for a long time and keep it old school. If you haven\'t been or are on the fence, I highly recommend. Definitely one of the Uptown staples.'
