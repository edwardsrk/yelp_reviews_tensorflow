b"The rib eye beef noodle was good and bad.  The beef was awesome, thin and well cooked.  Meat balls were also great!  But the problem comes in the noodles.  They were too soggy and they fell apart into short piece so I had to eat it with a spoon!!!  Broth was great, even better than some from San Jose!!!  If they improve on the noodle then it's perfect!Customer service was great, waiters were very aware of what we need and when we need their attention, but I didn't appreciate the female manager having a training session while the restaurant was opened for business!  That seemed a bit unprofessional tho the rest of the staff were very polite.  The lady in charge was just loud and sounded obnoxious.  Kind of annoying while trying to enjoy a great bowl of beef noodles.  Pork belly bun is a must have, with steam buns!!!"
