b"The food is really good-Globe Az style Mexican food. But the service was kinda slow. It looked like there were only 2 waitresses serving the entire restaurant, so I felt bad for them, but it took a while to get our food. We also got take out once too and it took over 30 minutes to make. Yummy food but definitely slow. If you are in a hurry, don't go here."
