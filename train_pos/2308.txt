b"Love this place for ordering takeout. Soup and sandwich options are delicious. Love the option to order from the salad bar online. The potatoes are a great different option too. Fruit is always fresh. I would give five stars, but this one server keeps trying to force Diet Coke on us when we order Coke online. I have an aspartame allergy, so that isn't cool."
