b'Five friends and I went for a bachelorette party and had a lot of fun!  We each had our own pole (it was a weekend afternoon) and the instructor was very good.  I highly recommend the class.I cannot leave five stars because I had booked a package deal when I originally made my reservation.  The package included a drink at the class and tickets to Chippendales.  To get the tickets we were told to obtain vouchers at the Stripper 101 class and take the vouchers to Rio to get the actual tickets to Chippendales.  I was assured that there would be no problem getting tickets to any show that weekend and that we would have front, or close to front, row seats.  We finished the class and headed straight to Rio.  I called along the way wondering if I could book on the phone and save the cab money.  The woman on the phone said there were no 6 seats together for any show and that I needed to come to the Rio to see what seats we could still get.  The Rio box office attendant was able to get us six tickets together (luckily) but they were not at the front at all and they were on a different night and at a different time than we had been planning.  It\'s unfortunate the way this "deal" was organized.  I called months ahead for this reservation and ended up with not very good seats and had to rearrange our plans last minute (not to mention needing to take a taxi to and from Rio just to pick up the tickets).'
