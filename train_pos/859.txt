b"So I come here for 3 things: the splash pad, Menchie's, and H&M. Oh, and I have been to the Apple Store also, so I guess 4 things. The splash pad is awesome for the kiddos because it is nice and shaded by huge palm trees. There is a nice blend of retail clothing shops, jewelry stores, restaurants, and specialty stores to keep most people happy. A few other fun places are Make Meaning and iPic if you really want something special. Nice misters make the hot summer days a bit cooler. It is like a street taken out of Beverly Hills and transplanted into the middle of Scottsdale."
