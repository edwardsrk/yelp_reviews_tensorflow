b'My husband and I have brought our son to see both a Pediatric Urologist and a Pediatric Neurologist at Phoenix Children\'s Hospital, as well as having had services like MRI\'s conducted at the hospital.   Each experience has been positive - as far as any medical visit could be.   The waits haven\'t been long.  The staff has been courteous.  The followup has been great.   The facilities are gorgeous.   I would add a couple of opportunities for improvement (which is why there is one star missing from this review).  First, I think that they should add the ability to send email confirmations for appointments.   (In the one instance, the hospital called to schedule an MRI while we were on vacation and I had no way to write down the appointment time.  When I asked if they could send me an email confirmation, they said they weren\'t set up to do that).   The second opportunity is with the main parking garage.  The security guards were "quizzing" us as to the purpose of our visit.   My husband and I were both perplexed as to the line of questioning.  I think they should coach the security staff to phrase the question better -- especially if it\'s meant to be helpful.Other than that, I recommend this hospital, services, and staff to any parent who needs pediatric services.  This is a top notch hospital!!!'
