b"Located in Wilmerding, PA, Bucky's Automotive is the former Palumbo's Automotive.  We've been coming here for years and never feel 'jabbed'.  Jose, the owner, has also worked here for years and he is fair, honest and accommodating in his scheduling.  If something comes up that is not his shop's specialty, Jose will recommend another local shop.  Did you ever walk away from the car dealer's service department feeling like a 3-month financial recovery is needed?  Ya, me too...  Never happens here.  Great communication regarding work that is needed, cost involved and time required.Through the high school years, our family had (5) cars requiring attention and service and we cannot imagine anywhere that could take the challenge and keep everyone on wheels.What can I say?  We {heart} Bucky's Automotive!  Tried and true It's a great east suburban car care option and well run business."
