b'Pretty cool boutique with lots of fun items! Was here during their grand opening in Old Town as they just relocated from downtown PHX. I think a bit more inventory will definitely do them good in the long run. They have a beauty bar now where you can get the complete vintage pin up girl look from head to toe! So fun!!'
