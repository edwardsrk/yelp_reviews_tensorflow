b"I'm totally confused as to what previous poor reviews were about - my coworkers and I thoroughly enjoy this place! We've been here a few times since I started months ago - but a few of them have been coming since before then. The decor is nothing to speak of - just a plain, down home small counter-service restaurant with some sights & sounds of Chicago. The guys who have worked the counter were nothing but sweet. I've only had the Italian beef and cheese fries. The Italian beef tastes about as Chicago-authentic as authentic gets - so much au jus too! The cheese fries were decent - maybe a little too salty for my taste, but in general good. I think my combo + a drink have been about $8 - great value! A few of my coworkers have gotten their Chicago hotdogs and love them too! A little bit of the Midwest in the heart of the West warms this native Midwesterner's heart."
