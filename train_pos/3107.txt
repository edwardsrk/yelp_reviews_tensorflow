b"So i came here for dinner. The service was outstanding and top notch. The food portions are very small but it is a high end type of restaurant. We started with a arugula salad: very fresh and delicious. Next i had some kind of bread with pork belly avocado and a few other things on top. It was awesome i never had something like that before. We drank moscow miles with everything! Easily one of the best mules i've ever had but it wasn't too strong. Next we had salmon which was hot and crispy omg he outside. The dip it came with was good too. Last we have a small piece of steak: very well cooked and crispy on the outside. i love when the food comes burning hot it's really so important! Last i had the banana bread pudding and signature pot dessert. Both were UHHHAMAAZZZINNG! Check out my awesome pics!"
