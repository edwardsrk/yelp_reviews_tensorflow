b'They seemed to be understaffed which is a shame because it was the start of spring break season when we were here. Had to wait a while for any service. Once we got a waiter, he was fantastic and made sure we were happy with everything. But the only time we saw him were for drink orders, food orders, the "check in" after food arrived, and for the check.The food itself was good. Ma\'s Mac & Cheese is amazing! Highly recommend if you like creamy Mac and cheese. The BBQ bacon burger was good but needed more BBQ sauce.'
