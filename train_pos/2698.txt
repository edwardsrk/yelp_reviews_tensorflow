b"Spent the weekend here and we heard that it was a great new boutique hotel but to be aware that it could get really loud because of all the college kids who frequent it.  It was a very nice place and a great location.  We asked for a quiet room and were put on the top floor.  We had no noise issues.  It wouldn't be my first choice but I would stay there again."
