b'We spent a whole day at the arcade during our stay in Vegas! The games were all in working order, and there were plenty games to choose from. Listened to the advice of others and did not eat at the arcade. There was a great selection of games, but when they got busy, many were being played and there was much more down time. Totally worth the price with the Groupon!'
