b"A little pricey for breakfast if you're looking for a weekly routine, but this place has one of the most fun brunches I've had in a long time. My brunch companion is very much NOT a vegan, but loved everything we got on the menu (including the blueberry maple glazed vegan donut)! Good addition to the choices on 7th St. in downtown Phoenix!"
