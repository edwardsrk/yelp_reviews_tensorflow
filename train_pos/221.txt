b'Just voted best community pool in Pittsburgh! You\'ll find the regular pool amenities: shallow and deep ends, lap lane, diving board and snack bar. They also have a slide, mushroom fountain, slide and ample "lawn" to sunbathe and relax.  The community "pooled" (ha ha!) together to raise money to repair and save.  The staff is friendly, helpful and keeps the pool in tip-top shape.'
