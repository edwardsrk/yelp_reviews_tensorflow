b"Went for my moms 60th birthday and had a blast. The wait was a little longer than I would have liked but well worth the wait. The hibachi chef put on a great show and made my mom feel extra special. The soup was tasty and the tempura shrimp appetizer was fantastic but expensive for only getting two pieces.  Our group ordered, lobster, filet mignon, shrimp and the kids steak hibachi. The filet mignon melted in your mouth, and the shrimp was delicious. The lobster was a little salty but still really good. Dishes were also served with fried rice and vegetables which were also really good. If it's your birthday the staff gives you ice cream as well as sings you a fun birthday song! Highly recommend coming with a group of friends or family. Tables seat 10.One downfall is they do not take reservations on the weekends."
