b"Two simple things equalling one great little hole in the wall on State - amazing sandwiches, and amazing beer selection.This was the only place nearby with relatively affordable food where I could get my favorite craft beer this winter, and in the process, I ended up trying their breakfast sandwiches. It is, hands down, the best I've ever had. Golden, liquidy, white hot egg yolk, local sausage, and a buttery, crisp bun that had obviously been toasted on the griddle. Amazing. Only downsides are, as it's a state street place, it can be loud and obnoxious if you go in during games on the weekend. Not a place to eat and study, to be sure, but a great place to grab a lunchtime bite. I have yet to come by in the late evening, but I imagine it's perfect for those who like better than average food with their brew, something sadly lacking on most of State."
