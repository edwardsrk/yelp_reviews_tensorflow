b'We went during restaurant week and boy did we make the right decision or what! This place has some amazing food you can get in charlotte. Right from the drinks till desert, every item hit home run for us. The mussels in white wine and scottish salmon dish was absolutely delicious. Our server was not that friendly but who cares about the server when you are in food heaven.'
