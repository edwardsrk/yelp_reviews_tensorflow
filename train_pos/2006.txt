b"I really enjoyed everything about this establishment minus the windy rainy walk there...and the fact that we were starving when we parked and famished when we got there.First of all, the tiny dining area is wonderful. It feels like you're eating in Harry Potter's room beneath the stairs, but in a good way. The only problem was the kitchen door--it leads right into the dining room, which was ok, but the squeak in the hinges made my skin crawl and my teeth tingle every time someone opened it. The choices here were overwhelming mostly because they all sound delicious! I went with one of their soups--the corn chowder--and the Mediterranean hummus wrap. Both were fantastic and I couldn't get enough of the soup!! Also, bonus: pickles that were super tasty! We finished with pumpkin cupcakes, which were probably overboard for my stuffed stomach, but oh so delicious! I love a good pumpkin product and these cupcakes WIN. I'd go back sooner and more often if downtown weren't a nightmare for parking and I had the time."
