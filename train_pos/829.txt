b"It's interesting how a neighborhood family own restaurant can succeed, specially being in the top of the hoods. I guess good food, nice decor and great service builds regulars. I had the uncle Louie salad which was good, nice serving and with a lot of flavor. The penne wild mushroom was super good.A nice touch is that the owners (I assume they were the owners) talked to us a couple of times. Not the typical annoying manager/owner who engages into an endless conversation but a gentle genuine courtesy chat.All in all a very nice place."
