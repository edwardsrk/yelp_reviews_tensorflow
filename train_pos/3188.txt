b"When a friend told me there was a Pierogi place near my house I was excited.I went and had dinner two nights later and saying I was happy doesn't do it justice.I had the Kielbasa with Cabbage and Mushroom Pierogis. I also got to try the Meatballs with Tomato Sauce and the Farmers Cheese and Chive Pierogis. The Kielbasa was lean and tasty. Both Pierogis were great but the Meatballs were fantastic.On a whim I took the Beef Stuffed Cabbage with Mushroom Gravy for lunch. It was very good but didn't compare to the Meatballs. Probably because the Tomato Sauce was much richer in flavor.Don't forget to visit the market next door. It has so many goodies including Cracovia Plum Butter. Simply Fantastic."
