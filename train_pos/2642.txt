b'Have been here before, but did not write a review.  The decor is beautiful, it makes you feel as if you were under the water.  The wait/host staff are a little austere but efficient.  The food is the star.  The DanDan Mien is flavorful with just the right amount of spice, the BBQ platter was cooked perfectly - pork, duck and chicken all juicy and delicious.  We also ordered the eggplant and string beans which were tender and succulent (not soggy in the sauce at all)!  An incredible meal and great cocktails!'
