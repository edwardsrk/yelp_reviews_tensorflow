b"Good off the strip spot for brunch without the wait.  Well, still a wait, but pretty short and our group went down for a cocktail at Oak and Ivy they gave us a discount for.  My Beef hash was the best dish, chicken and Waffles had good chicken, but the waffle was a little soft and there was nothing to go with it like a veggie or fruit to be seen.  But $15 bottomless mimosas/bloody mary's is the proper way to start a vegas saturday."
