b"As a vegetarian, this restaurant is all wrong for me. However I came here for dinner w/ 4 others and didn't pay a dime of the bill so I was fine with it. The others (rest were non-vegetarians) seemed to enjoy their food and our waiter was excellent. The place was quite nice and we had a great view of the famous Bellagio watershow so I was entertained as well as enjoying the several side dishes/appetizers that I ordered (obviously couldn't order the steak) and washed it all down with decent wine."
