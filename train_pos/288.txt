b"As others have indicated, perhaps this store could have done a better job coming up with their name, as they are much more than a wine store.  I didn't know that for a long time and I'm disappointed that I spent so much money buying my liquor at supermarkets.  Now that I've discovered Total Wine it is pretty much my sole stop for not only wine but beer (I am incredibly non-loyal to beer brands, I like to try new beers from all of the world).  I also stock up on my hard alcohol at Total Wine and have recently discovered they have a decent selection of cigars.The store is pleasant, with kind of a woodsy warehouse feeling to it.  Most of the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant.  The prices across the board are reasonable.  They have long hours and tons of parking.  Maybe the only slight downside is they chose to locate in Desert Ridge, which is not a mall that is easy to just pop in to.  I think Desert Ridge is more suited to stores like Target, to the movie theaters, and to the food court than to a food/liquor store that I might want to go to for one or two items every few days."
