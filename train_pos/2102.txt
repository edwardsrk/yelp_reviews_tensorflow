b"My first time here, it was pretty good! Servers were attentive fast, and the prices were not too bad as well! They have good prices for desserts that are good to share for 2. They also give you a free macaron ice cream per Yelp review (I think that's amazing since macaron ice creams are 4 bucks each in kbbq's that I've been to!):)"
