b'Libertine Social is a fancy gastropub that is a great place to catch up with friends. Though it is a little pricey for a gastropub, the food is pretty tasty. The House Baked Pretzel was baked perfectly, allowing the dough to be light and soft. The cheddar fondue was the right amount of gooey-ness and was a delicious dip to the pretzel. The Wood Grilled Sausages were a good sampler of different types of sausages, which were all grilled to perfection, giving the sausages a smokey kick.The Black Truffle Pizza had a good ratio of fontina and Parmesan, giving it a nice cheesy and stringy consistency, which is always nice to have with your pizza. The pizza was topped with slivers of truffles, which accentuated the delicious flavors of the cheese. But my personal favorite was the Fennel and Sausage flatbread. The flatbread was thing and crispy, while the sausage was very flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness that was noticeable with the notes of honey that was on the flatbread. If you have friends coming into town, Libertine Social is a great place to have some food and drinks while catching up.'
