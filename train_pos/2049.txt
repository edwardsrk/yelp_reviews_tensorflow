b"To be honest I am not a big fan of Bobby Flay. Being the son of a famous LA restauranteur I find the whole celebrity chef craze silly. I do have my favorites in that world but for mostly different reasins than their cuisine. So we had tickets to Absinthe and decided to eat at Ceasar's Palace before the show. The menu at Mesa Grill intrigued me so we gave it a go. We started with the tiger shrimp tamale. The flavor was good and the shrimp delicious but the crumbled tamale left me a bit confused.For dinner I enjoyed the veal chop. Honestly this is the first time I had a veal chop but it wont be the last. I am a fan!!! The chop was expertly prepared, cooked, and presented. More importantly with the accompanying sauce it was also absolutely delicious.For dessert we shared an apple cheesecake. To me it seemed more carmel apple than cheeecake but it was very tasty.I have gained an appreciation of what Bobby Flay has done here. Southwestern and Mexican dishes transformwd into a rare experience. His experience, it was a pleasure."
