b"At any burger place, IMO, after all the gimmicks and flourishes, it really just comes down to the burger. Capitano is no exception. After going through the menu I settled on the Blue Lagoon -- a very enticingly described burger with a juice beef patty, blue cheese, fried egg, saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, capitano sauce. Needless to say it was VERY flavourful and the fried egg added a lovely dimension to the whole thing. And the blue cheese. Oh the blue cheese. The best part? It's under $10 with tax. I think that given the ingredients that's a pretty good deal. As for the Gelato part of their business, I was satisfied too. Personally the gelato burger did not appeal to me, but I loved their selection of house-made gelati and it really rounded out the meal very well.All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try something new in the Yonge & Bloor area and not spend a ton in the process."
