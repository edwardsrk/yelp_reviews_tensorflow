b'I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant/brew pub.  The beer selection is pretty good here if you want to try different beers, and their food is pretty good.  I came here for brunch which was average, but I really enjoyed the pizza I ordered on a different occasion.  I would recommend this place as a nice spot to go for dinner.'
