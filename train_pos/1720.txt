b"Everyone knows they hate going to the post office especially when it is the holidays but I have to say this was an unusual experience. Im the kinda of person who at the post office wants to limit all personal contact with any human being besides dropping off the package I'm trying to ship out or buying forever stamps (which you can now buy at other places beside the post office so i don't even come here for that anymore). But like I said Unusual Good experience here. Aftering seeing the 30+ person deep line on the day before X-Mas, I went to the self help weighing machine to pay for the flat rate boxes. After I thought I did everything right, I didn't know where to drop the box off. So I jumped to the front of the line and asked one of them employees Matt,and he said I paid for the wrong box amount.Thanks to him, instead of asking me to wait in the inexcusable line that is the post office, he came out from behind the counter and walked me through the steps and in actuality I OVERPAID for the box. Unfortunately, he couldn't give me a refund nor use the credit to buy anything but whatever, I avoided what could have been easily a 30min-1hour visit to the post office and my friend got her Bday package on time.Thanks to Matt, I spent a total of 7min in the post office on the day before Xmas.THANK YOU MATT!!1) Tip- Pick up prepaid flat rate boxes and envelopes before and PAY FOR THEM AT HOME and then just drop them off at the post office2) Use the self help machine to pay for letters and packages so you can avoid the bad customer service at the post office that we all usually experience (just like at the DMV)3) Avoid standing in the line as little as possible because we all know how slow that line moves"
