b'Second night of having Italian so my review may be a bit biased. I had the lasagna which was pretty good but I cannot say it stood out to me as spectacular. My family seemed to enjoy their meals. I thought it was nice of the restaurant to give a fam member a piece of cake for free (his birthday).'
