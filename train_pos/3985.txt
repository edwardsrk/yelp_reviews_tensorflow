b'The only downside was that they ran out of Green Tea creme brulee even though we ordered it pretty early on. Other than that, absolutely loved this place! I came here with my brother and his friend while I was visiting from out of town. Joanne was our waitress and she was very nice and attentive! The torched sushi is amazing, I would recommend the Ebi and Salmon!'
