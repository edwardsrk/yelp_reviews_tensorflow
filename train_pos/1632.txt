b'Love love love the ambiance of this place. My date and I were seated in the "outdoor" terrace area which is really a faux outdoor next to faux greenery but it was beautiful and much more private. When we first arrived in our cozy area there was only one other couple on the terrance. Our area was so quiet, it really made you put your phone away and just be "in the moment" with someone. I think the tables and lighting are placed appropriately where you feel like you\'re in our own little bubble away from everyone else.I don\'t remember any exact plates that I liked. We had the 16 course meal and the food became a blur of goodness. Everything was executed well. Service was superb, everyone was extremely friendly and each plate came out not too long after we finished the previous plate. I do remember the amazing giant blob of butter in a giant bell jar! Imported from Great Britain the server said. I wanted the bread cart to come around just so I could see the butter being shaved. When the dessert cart came around I had to try one of each! Overall, it was a very fun and romantic experience. I\'ll probably skip the 16 course next time and order a la carte though.'
