b"I'll begin by stating my reason for not giving them the full 5 star review. The floors were dangerously slippery. Ok now that we've covered the only negative from our experience I'd like to describe how amazingly delicious our food was. The customer service is outstanding and they greet you as soon as you set foot in the restaurant. The aromas will smack you in the face the moment you walk in and you'll notice the hard working chef juggling phone calls and tasting his food assuring it's just right!  I ordered the small Curry Chicken and it was PERFECT! Not overpowering and tender and flavorful! The potatoes and carrots were so good that I wish I had ordered the large portion. The Ox Tail has nothing to be envious of as it was EXCELLENT! The presentation is beautiful and the quality of food is evident after your very first bite. The Chef will check on you to make sure you're enjoying the meal which is an indication of how focused they are with satisfying their customers. Without a doubt I will return and recommend to anyone craving some authentic, delicious, affordable Jamaican food."
