b"Stopped here on a LONG layover before a flight to LA.  I was traveling with another employee and had a great time in the little couch / booth area.  It was so different from other airport restaurants.  It felt like we had a little peace and quiet area to ourselves.  The food was okay overall.  I got the kale salad (not a big fan) and the tortilla soup (okay).  The best thing we got were the prickly pear margaritas.  Mmmmmm.  The server was a little uneven -- our waiter got busy at the bar and disappeared for a long time.  We got apology cookies (tiny!) but we didn't mind much as we had the time to kill.  Big thumbs up for those margaritas."
