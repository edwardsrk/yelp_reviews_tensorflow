b"I come here often for Walnut cakes! 6 little delicious balls for $2! My fave are the potato and walnut, and potato and almond cakes. Walnut cakes with roasted green tea Korean style - you can't go wrong! Total: less than $4! Great snack and totally different from timbits. Run by a sweet Korean family!"
