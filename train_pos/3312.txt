b'I heard really good things about this place, but I wasn\'t sure what to expect. It was very different than I expected. Alexander Michael\'s is in a cute, old house in the 4th ward and has a COMPLETELY different feel than anywhere else in Charlotte. It is a dark, pub feel. I assume they would have mixed drinks, but it\'s definitely more of a beer place. They have a large selection of local beers, which I love. The night I went it was 100 degrees outside, so I wasn\'t much in the mood for food. I didn\'t see a lot of lighter options on the menu that I would eat (I\'m picky), but I did try the "What It Is" pasta. So glad I did because it was delicious! If you\'re looking for a unique, small place in Charlotte, go visit!'
