b"This place is good. I haven't actually been to the restaurant, but had the food delivered to our hotel. Me and my friends had just got done clubbing at XS and it was around 1am (my friend was really drunk lol) so I told them about Krung Siam because I had them deliver food before and it was good. We ordered food and by the time we got back to our hotel, we only had to wait a few mins and the guy was there with the food. The food is good and they deliver so yeah i was happy lol."
