b'Took my love here for an early birthday celebration. Our waiter, Johnny, was the best, so funny and attentive. We started out with the lobster bisque and it was heaven! I had the petit filet with scallops, my bf had the Kobe steak with saut\xc3\xa9ed shrimps, we had the lobster mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts for sides. The filet, steak and shrimps was delicious! My scallops was a little salty and slightly overlooked but still yum! The brussel sprouts was also salty and could use some shaved almonds and cranberries but overall good. Would definitely come back despite the whole meal cost me an arm, a leg and probably my first born.'
