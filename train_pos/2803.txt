b'This place had the cheapest rate so I decided to go with them and booked online.  They were very friendly and the return was smooth.  One minus star for the fact the guy who helped me initially did not say OPTIONAL insurance.  He said "Do you want just the basic or premium insurance?"  instead of "Would you like to add our optional insurance to your rental?"  I travel enough to know that those insurance are only optional but it would mislead some people.'
