b"This place is amazing. I am feeling the best I have felt in the last decade thanks to this place. The trainers are amazing and every class they make sure you know exactly what you are doing and how to do it. I am also amazed at how nice everyone is all of the time it's crazy but great. I recommend this place for anyone considering working out they scale down any exercise if you can't  do the one they are doing. For example I am a long way off from doing pull-ups but they will get me stronger doing other exercises to eventually build up to doing the pull-ups."
