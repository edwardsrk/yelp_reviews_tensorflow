b"It's been a looooonngg time since I've been here that it was practically my first time. Came here with a few friends for sushi, and sushi was all we had... although I did start with a bowl of their shiitake mushroom soup. Yummy! We ordered a boat and a couple of extra hand rolls - one was a jumbo spider roll, and jumbo it was. Overall, the sushi was good and fresh - well prepared and well presented. Servers were friendly and attentive. My only tiff is the space seemed really cramped. Tables were too close to each other. Makes it very hard to have intimate conversations.I was, however, pleasantly surprised that they serve Malaysian cuisine. Only came for sushi on this visit, so I'll definitely be back to try their Malaysian menu for another review."
