b"I loved this place! I am surprised it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be but I had an early dinner on Friday. There was a special where for every cocktail you buy, you get a main dish for half off!We had the meat and cheese board! It was perfect! I enjoyed every bite. As for the food, we got Pork ribs and Mac and Cheese. OMG. You have to get this. If you don't, you are missing out! The Pork Rib was crispy on the outside and juicy. I wished it was a bit more tender than it was. The juices from the pork ribs made a killer combination with the Mac and Cheese! I loved this dish! I thoroughly enjoyed this place but I am a charcuterie type of girl! I would definitely come again!"
