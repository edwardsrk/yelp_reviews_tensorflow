b"Location: Let me think.... oh yes - on Fairmount! Street parking is present but rarely available, and most streets in the area are residential. Use transit or walk, or show up very early on a Sunday morning - you'll be able to park on St. Laurent for free until 1 p.m. The place: The only reason you come here is to buy bagels - that's it, that's all. It's very small and there's no lingering - know what you want before you walk in, buy it, and get the hell out. K? K.The goods: The battle for best Montreal bagel is between hear guys and St. Viateur. I used to be a hardcore St. V girl but at some point in the last couple of years, they changed their recipe and their bagels have more of a bread texture. SO.... I converted to Fairmount. You can't go wrong here - their bagels are bloody good. Can't make it here on the regular? Buy a dozen and stick half in the freezer.Service: All I do is pick up bagels so..... nothing bad to say!Price point: A little spendy at around $9 for a dozen but well worth it when you're walking out of there with 12 hot bagels."
