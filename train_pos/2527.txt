b"The place has good food, friendly stuff and fairly nice, casual atmosphere. Drinks are overpriced (as is common along Vegas Strip), but the food we got was plentiful and tasty. The servers were friendly and helpful. The wait time was so-so, but it was a busy Friday evening so that's acceptable in my book. I will come back for lunch or dinner on a future visit to Vegas (esp. if I get a groupon or similar deal :-) )."
