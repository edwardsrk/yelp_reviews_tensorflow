b'*edit*I\'ve been meaning to update this but I totally forgot.  I got the entire situation fixed with the help of Dana George.  I ended up having a pretty good time here.This hotel is so unreasonable. On which planet does a hotel reward customers for booking late rather than early? It makes no sense whatsoever. Granted, I did book the non-refundable room thinking that I was getting the best possible price but for them to lower the price on the same room by 20% is absolutely ridiculous. I suggest everyone to read the fine print on their so-called "best price guarantee" because its so misleading. For this reason I will never stay at this hotel again and will make sure none of my friends or family do either. I hope they enjoyed making that extra $150 off of me because it\'s the last they will see of my money.'
