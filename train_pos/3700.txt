b"I have no complaints about my experience with my laser hair removal package. It was sold to me without it feeling pushy and the consultant was as knowledgeable as she was beautiful, which led to choose with confidence. I never have to wait, am always in and out. The women at the desk are always pleasant. I love the convenience of texting confirmations. Sneha is saving lives one zap at a time! They were recommended from a friend, and I've certainly told many more."
