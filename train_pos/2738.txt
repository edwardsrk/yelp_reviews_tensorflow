b"We came here for a late lunch on Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised by how quick and efficient the service was. The marinated kalbi was perfect and the portions were decently generous. The only issue was the side dishes, which I didn't think were great. Most of the pickled items seemed a little dry, and the overall selection/variety of the banchan was mediocre. I guess I'm used to Korea, where the side dishes are as important as part of the meal. I was also not impressed with the chicken karaage which they used chicken breast for (made it dry)."
