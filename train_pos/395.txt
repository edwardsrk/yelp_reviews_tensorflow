b"Lunched it here today.  Burgers are are good... eh... better than good.  The meat is certainly a couple notches up from say, In & Out.  Which I like.  The bun is high quality as well.  I ordered the Green Chile Burger.  I was very happy with it.  My family both go Cheese burgers and they loved them.  I was surprised by the Fries... they are not up to the standards of the other food.  Bland.  The service was good and the staff was friendly.  Not sure how long it's been here, but Yelp brought me today.  Constructive criticism?  Slightly up the scheme, change the colors and bring in some more images etc... for the walls.  Up the menu look and feel and brand it!  Parting shot?  You already have the hard part down... good food!"
