b"This is a dive bar, it's not a college bar, but they can make some serious drinks. I love this place for karaoke and am embarrassed to confess to getting hammered accidentally (one drink at Cappy's is like 2.5 drinks at most other bars) and then trying to sing on multiple occasions.I never was too impressed with the food, but I never came here for the food. In fact, if you want good food within walking distance, go to some place like Harris Grill. But if you want good drinks and a good time in an environment that you can be laid back in, this is it."
