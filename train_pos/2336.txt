b"Great food and amount for price fix family style. I'd come back for this amazing meal. Highlight was the fish and pasta. Service was attentive. The only thing was that our server should have shown us the wine menu and prices. Seemed as though our second bottle was a lot pricier than expected when the bill came around."
