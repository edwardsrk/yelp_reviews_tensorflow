b"In December, my boyfriend had begun to look for some advice and appraisals on a diamond that was his grandmother's and happened to be in a pretty ugly setting. He just wanted to know what he had overall, so we spent some time wandering around to antique shops that could look at not only the diamond, but the funky setting as well. This was one of my favorite places that we went to because it was pretty crazy in here. It's an extension of the other antique shop in the same strip (Uptown Archaeology), and it's obvious why the man that owns the place has two shops. There's SO MUCH going on here, that you can't imagine even glancing at half of it. SO. MUCH. And that's not a bad thing! That's definitely a good thing when you come to places like this. And don't be afraid to ask about particular items and backstories, because you'll get good answers and probably learn something while you're here, too!"
