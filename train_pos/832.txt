b"I heart a good salad, so was excited to try Chopt out!  A little hectic during the dinner crowd, but there was a floor Chopt dude helping guide those of us who were lost and to hand out menus.  The line moved quickly and the staff there is really friendly with a positive vibe!Pretty straight forward once you figure out what you want.  I ordered the Braised Greek and grabbed some organic sweet tea. The final results were delish!  My chopper initially forgot to add the quinoa mix or chicken, but when I caught it she was very sweet and apologetic, and promptly fixed it.  It would have been such a sad meal without it. Yummy place, and I will definitely be back!  I'll just be checking my salads with a critical eye while they work the kinks out :)"
