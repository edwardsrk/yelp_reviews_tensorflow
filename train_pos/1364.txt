b"I have been a frequent customer here for several months now.  At first, I was on the fence because I was not very happy with an alteration I had done.  I think it's unfair to judge a dry cleaner by that standard, since the seamstress is separate and apart.  In terms of the dry cleaning, they do a great job, particularly for the price.  Once you sign up for the text club, prices are very competitive.  They are also on it in terms of the turn around.  I regularly bring a truckload of dry cleaning here and they manage to take care of it in a matter of days.  The only drawback for me is that the location is not convenient to my current house, but  I just bought a new place right around the corner from Eldorado and have no doubt I will be a dedicated customer for many years to come."
