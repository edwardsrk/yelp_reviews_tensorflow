b'Great stop for a late night desert!  After a delicious dinner at Laurier Gordon Ramsey next door we stopped at Juliette et Chocolate for desert.  The wait was long but worth it.  During our last visit to Montreal we went to the sister location on St. Laurent.  The Laurier location is the same in terms of food quality just a bit "fancier" spot with newer decor.  I would strongly recommend the molten chocolate cake with carmel topping.  For chocolate fans that have been to Angelina in Paris, this feels like a scaled down version of that over the top choclate stop and well worth the visit.'
