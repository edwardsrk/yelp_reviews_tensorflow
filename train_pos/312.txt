b"Who doesn't like good BBQ?  I ask you?  Good, though...like so many things in Champaign, I found the ooohing and ahhing pretty over-rated.  It's good food, no doubts, and their burnt ends?  You'd travel the globe for these suckers!  But.. their brisket is often dry(ier than I'd like), and I am SOOOOO not a fan of pulled pork that sometimes has globs of fat in it (it might be that _all_ pulled pork is susceptible, I am just not a fan! =P).  Regardless, you have so much to choose from (http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/menu/), and don't be stingy with the sauce!  I'm a true Carolina girl at heart, and Black Dog does this Carolina Red that's vinegary and tomato-y, and has a bite to it that'll just.. well, it'll make your mouth water.  Other's really like the Hot Georgia Peach, like the most exquisite combination of both heat and sweet!All in all, you're going to get a fabulous meal here, and for Champaign-Urbana IL, it's some pretty legit BBQ!  Pair it with one of their amazing beers (and the choices are endless! http://www.blackdogsmoke.com/beer/) and you'll leave stuffed and satisfied!"
