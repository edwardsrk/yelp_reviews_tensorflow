b"The hotel is brand new and is nice and clean.  I have stayed here for a total of about 3 weeks off and on for work.  I have had a couple issues but they were corrected and made everything 100%.  I'd give them 5 stars but the elevator has had lots of mechanical issues however that's probably outside of the staffs expertise."
