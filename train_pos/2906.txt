b"Dive bar/jazz jam? I'm there!There's a lot of solid bar food here, and some nice outdoor seating, but the real kicker is the open jam session. It's a nice change to have a session at a place where the venue isn't some dumpy dungeon-like space. Not to say that tiny cramped jazz spots aren't hip or anything, but it's good to see that this college town can maintain an event like this.OK and an extra star because I met some life-long friends at the session too... really chill people come here. Gotta love the vibe."
