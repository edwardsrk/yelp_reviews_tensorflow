b'(3.5) Nuit Social is a very laid back place and great spot to come and hang out with friends in an intimate setting. They specialize in tapas style dishes where everything is meant to be shared. They have sections dedicated to meats and cheeses so you can customize your own charcuterie board for a reasonable price. All in all the food is pretty good, service was great and a nice environment. Would come again, but not for dinner.'
