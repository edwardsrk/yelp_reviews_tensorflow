b"One of the better ramen places that isn't downtown Toronto. The place isn't very big but it's quiet and the service is good. The ramen is rather good, and pretty much one of the few places that has a curry ramen. Some of the appetizer/snacks are a little overpriced for the amount you get  but the ramen is on the more inexpensive spectrum for ramen which is good. This is the second time I've been here and would probably go again."
