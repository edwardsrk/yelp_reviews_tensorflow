b"Location: it is located right next to the farm with home grown lemons, oranges and many diff types of veggies etc. The restaurant doesn't have a lot of seating in the inside. However, there are quite a few tables on the outside. Parking is a bit tight but still have plenty of parking. Be prepared to park on the dirt. Food: This is my first time coming here to try their coffee and breakfast. I ordered a Latte and waffle with berries. Coffee is so smooth and the waffle is by far the best waffles I've ever had. Rating: I will definitely come back here for their breakfast and coffee again."
