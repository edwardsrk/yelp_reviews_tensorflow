b"2015 St. Patrick's Day Festival highlights: Saturday morning parking was available for free at 1) Parking Garage near City Hall, located at Basic Road and Lead Street. Accessed from Basic Road and 2) Parking Garage near Justice Facility, located at Water Street, near Basic Road. Accessed from either Water Street or Texas Avenue.A must see is the  Carrolier Academy of Irish Dance! The children participated in the parade and scheduled events throughout the weekend. Led by Debbie Carroll and Shelley Locklier, the two dancers have Irish dance teaching credentials; both teachers travelled the world with Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.Fun for the children included the ferris wheel and carousel.  Since the Las Vegas Valley does not have a permanent ferris wheel and carousel to ride, we enjoyed taking a twirl on both.  Ferris wheel tickets were 4 tickets per person. Carousel tickets were 3 per person, but an adult is free if standing next to small children who are on the ride.  Each ticket = $1.25.I would like to see a greater use of food trucks.  We saw pizza, Mexican, Filipino, hot dogs, cupcakes, and snowcones. Come on Las Vegas Valley food culture, come out and show us what you offer."
