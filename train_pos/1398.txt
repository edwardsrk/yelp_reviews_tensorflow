b"By The Slice is one of the best pizza places I been to.  It is a small place nicely tucked away in the plaza.  I order here at least once a month for lunch with my co-workers.  They always have killer deals such as 2 medium speciality pizza for $16.99 - Their specialy pizzas are amazing as they have around 5-6 toppings on it. Southwest chicken and Meat combo are my fave.  If you just want to pick your own toppings there is a 2 Medium pizza 6 toppings combined from $14.99.  Ex-Large Margherita or 4 cheese pizza for $9.99.  They surpising also have amazing fried chicken almost like KFC.  I actually like it more than KFC and it is cheaper as well.  10 huge Chicken pieces and medium wedges for only $12.99.  Only thing bad is the plaza parking is horrible as it shared with Wendy's, starbucks,Kelsey and Mr. Greek.  Can't wait to order from them this Friday."
