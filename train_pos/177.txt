b"I have stopped in at La Plaza twice now in the last two weeks.  Once on a whim (based on a glowing yelp review) and once more on a mission.  Both times I left happy and excited to return. La Plaza stocks most of the general staples you'd need from most groceries, though obviously there is a strong lean toward mexican, Central, and South American goods. Especially delightful to me is the meat counter with not only fresh chorizo, but also fresh chincharrones (PORK RINDS!) by the pound.The fresh guacamole, salsa, and pico de gallo (also available  at the meat counter) are all superb, however there is only one heat rating for both the salsa and pico.  You get what you get, and you'll like it, gringo/a.The produce section has lots of items that would be hard to track down elsewhere, as well as reasonable to great prices on other more common items. On both visits the staff has been very friendly and helpful, and strongly urge others to visit and support them.  As an added bonus they do have a taco cart, but it wasn't open one either of my visits.  I guess I'll just have to go back..."
