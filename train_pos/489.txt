b"Bobby flays place is exactly what'd you'd expect from the southwest flavor king. I ordered the corn tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious!  For the main I got the spiced pork tenderloin sandwich. Definitely a must try. You have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it. I came on a Tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. I recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner."
