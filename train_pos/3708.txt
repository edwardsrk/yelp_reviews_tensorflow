b"This is my favorite happy hour place in all of Madison! It can be a little pricey for dinner, but their happy hour is perfect! They have an amazing list of their cocktails, beer, wine and their incredible seafood for insanely cheap. It is comparable with Sardine's happy hour for their oysters, but Tempest has much more to offer than just oysters. I would recommend trying all of their food offers. They are each delightful in their own way. The atmosphere is lovely- simple, elegant, transports you to a warmer climate with their ocean-esque decor. This is truly a hidden gem in Madison."
