b"Please note that I only came here for dim sum and have never ate from the menu.The entrance to this restaurant is met with 2 flights of stairs, and as far as I know there's no access for disability.I liked the atmosphere, calm, relaxing background music, and clean.We ordered hagao, siu mai, and lo mai gai. All of them were tasty and filled my stomach real fast.A great stop for a quick dim sum eat and it didn't cost a lot. I would highly recommend to come in early especially on weekends."
