b"I'm surprised that the Kensington area doesn't have more Third Wave Coffee shops like The House but it's certainly a great start. I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area so I'm spoiled by having incredible coffee like Blue Bottle, Ritual, Barefoot etc so when I visit the in-laws here in Calgary I'm always on the hunt for good coffee. While The House doesn't quite stack up to my personal Calgary favorite -- Phil & Sebastian it's definitely in the Third Wave Coffee ilk. Let's do the technical details run down:- Locally roasted coffee beans: Check. They source from Fratello Coffee Roasters in Calgary- Baristas with proper training on pulling espressoCheck- Microfoam quality and Latte Art:The barista who made our drinks poured a decent rosette. See picture of the cappuccino I uploaded.Next time I'm in the Kensington area I would definitely go back to The House."
