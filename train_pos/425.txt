b'After walking past the sign nearly every weekend this summer, I finally popped in to Prohibition for "the best brunch in town" when I realized I was much too lazy to attempt cooking for myself.Admittedly, I have a tough time getting up and getting dressed on the weekends, so I\'m not much of a brunch connoisseur.  That being said, their "best brunch in town" claims may not be that far from the truth.I ordered the stuffed French toast, which featured two LARGE slices of sourdough bread, stuffed with mascarpone cheese, and topped with enough maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream to put me into a sugar coma for the rest of the day.  Coming with a side of bacon, I couldn\'t ask for anything more.Their brunch menu isn\'t extensive, but what they lack in options they make up for with pure quality, both in the ingredients they use and portion sizes they present.  My stuffed French toast left me entirely stuffed and very, very happy.It\'s definitely on the pricier side ($13 for my meal, $15 for the plate my boyfriend ordered), but when I\'m raving about the food to my coworkers on Monday morning, you know it\'s totally worth it.I\'m not as smitten with the service (we were starving and it was a little on the slow side), but everyone was friendly enough, and I will most definitely be back in the very near future.'
