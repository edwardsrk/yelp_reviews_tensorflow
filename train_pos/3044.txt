b'This is a review of Pliner\'s approach and style (truly original, but certainly "not for everyone,) this location, and especially their sales person - Milijana, or Mia as she introduced herself.  Making my purchase on 12/18 during their holiday sale I literally tried on 25 pairs of shoes before making my final selection - a half-lacquered pair of black suede shoes unlike anything I\'ve previously seen.While the store did not have my size in stock, Mia brought me shoes made from the same mold and informed me that not only could the size I need (11) be mailed to my home, but it could be accomplished with no tax and free shipping since I lived in Ohio.In retrospect I wish I\'d have bought more pairs of shoes while I was there, but as it stands they\'ve guaranteed I\'ll return on my next Vegas visit.'
