b"Coming from California, a land of a huge variety of authentic Asian cuisine, I wasn't expecting much of a Thai restaurant in this area. But I was proven wrong.They make some awesome curry! The menu looks great; real good variety of dishes.Overall, very impressed. And since I am now living in the area will definitely keep them in mind when I feel like eating some Thai food."
