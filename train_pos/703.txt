b'This is a nice place to come and hang with friends and have a few drinks. The whole place is centered around beer. The moment you wake in there is a wall of beer to the right. At the bar there are two additional cooler also filled with beer, both import and domestic. Need less to say the also have a good number of beer on draft.Bottom line if your that into beer there is not a huge reason for you to come here. Not to discourage their food.'
