b"I used a living social voucher for my appointment at TrendSetter Eyewear. The cleanliness and ambiance of the lobby and facilities was amazing, I felt like I was at the spa, not getting my eyes checked. I only had to wait a couple minutes, and while I was waiting, was shown what frames I could shop from that the voucher included. I went in knowing I just wanted a basic pair, so I was happy with the selection. (I noticed a lot of incredibly stylish higher-end selections, that if I had the extra money at the time, I probably would've been very tempted to buy!) I received a lot of personal attention, and my glasses were mailed to me for a very affordable rate. (I was about to move out of state within days, and they squeezed me in last minute!) Dr. Payne was so pleasant, as was everyone there, and I even got my prescription emailed to me per my request, many weeks after my appointment and receiving my pair of glasses from them. Would recommend this business to anyone."
