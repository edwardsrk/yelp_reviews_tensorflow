b'I have passed this location at least 100 times in the past 4 years, always have seen the neon beer signs in the window and thought to myself......"odd place for a bar."I finally stopped this weekend.   If you like DIVE BARS this is your place.....Sunday fun day is in full effect now! Beer selection could be better but the greasy burgers coming off the grill where perfect!!!!Juke Box, pool tables, darts and a whole bar full of old men that look like they\'ve been coming there for 50 years.The one waitress they had day was nothing short of Super Woman......all by herself and carried a great attitude the whole time.....SHE"S A KEEPER!!!!AND SUPER CHEAP!!   PUB N GRUB-------I AM A FAN!!!!!'
