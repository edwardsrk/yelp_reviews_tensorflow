b"Hand made noddles, and you can watch them make them!This place seemed pretty authentic and the wait was not even 20 minutes for 4 people. You order by circling what you want on the menu. I got the braised beef noodle soup. Big portion, noddles were great, but beef seemed fatty, and I wish there were more vegetables. You can order a side though and they seemed huge. I've never had soup dumplings and they had it here so we placed an order but we got something that I wasn't expecting, but it was so good! We ordered wrong and got the pork and vegetable potstickers. All the dumplings were together in 1 which was kind of a pain. Food came out really fast. They had a few vegetarian/ vegan options but our vegan friend was not impressed. Friendly service."
