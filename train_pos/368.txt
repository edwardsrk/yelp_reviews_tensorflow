b"Went here before a concert. Literally just steps from the t mobile arena. You walk and your assaulted (in a good way) by loud music and flashing lights. They have a crazy host running around with a mic singing and getting patrons to do sake bombs. When you go to some place like this you think the food is going to be sub par - it wasn't. The toro sushi was so good and fresh as was the yellow tail and salmon. The spicy tuna roll wasn't nearly as good as the sushi but still decent. You can imagine that the service was spotty with our waitress breaking to jump into a song and dance - but the management felt so bad that we had to wait so long that they took care of a large part of our drinks. Wouldn't definitely recommend - but it is a party atmosphere so be prepared."
