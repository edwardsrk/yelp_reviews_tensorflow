b"I had to find an anniversary dinner which had amazing food with equally amazing views.  I was a little skeptical of Prime because I've been to the other restaurants on the Bellagio waters, and they were nothing to write home about.  We were seated outside, overlooking the fountains.  The dry-aged ribeye was a party.  My wife and I were trying to figure out what made each bite so good, but at the end, we came to the conclusion that it was just damn good.  I've had Mortons, Flemings, etc. and this steak ranks higher than those places.  The wife ordered the Chilean seabass, and it was just alright.   The fish was flakey, but there was not much taste.  I'm comfortable giving this place a 5, even with the mediocre fish, because our dining experience was everything we hoped for."
