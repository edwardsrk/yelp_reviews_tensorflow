b"**Review for Taco Tuesdays**When people ask me where to go for Taco Tuesday, I always recommend Kennedy's. They are usually skeptical but don't take my word for it- go! The tacos are delicious and they have drink specials as well. Tacos are $1 (or were the last time I went last fall). I've taken my massive dog here to sit out on the patio and the service for both human and pup has been phenomenal. Now, I've also known others who have gone and had slow service but that personally hasn't happened to me. Perhaps I eat earlier than normal? I usually go before 6:30 p.m. I love the outdoor area when the weather is nice. In fact, I've seen the inside but don't think I've ever eaten inside. That's how much I love hanging outside Kennedy's! I highly recommend this spot for an out of the box location for Taco Tuesday."
