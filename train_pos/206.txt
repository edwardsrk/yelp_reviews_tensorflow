b"Took us a minute to find it, but after some searching, we found it (located on the 10th floor of Venetian). Mrs. Ninja's favorite meal is breakfast so we had to try Bouchon. First, they served bread with butter and jam. Something about the butter was so good, like they were slaving away in the kitchen,churning butter. For our meal, she ordered the chicken and waffles, not as good as Roscoes, but still got the yes nod from her. I ordered the mussel in wine sauce w/ pomme frites (fries) and it was also very good. Mamosa (champagne w/ OJ) was good but I finished it in two large sips. Definitely worth checking out if you dont want to stuff yourself with the buffet or if you need something to deaden a small vegas hangover. 4 Hip to the Hops!"
