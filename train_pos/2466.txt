b'This restaurant is great if you want a quick lunch. The food is great, filling and nutritious.At this restaurant you order at the front, wait for your number to be called and then pick up your entree. If you work in the area I highly recommend it. The portions are also huge. You might have enough left over for dinner or the following days lunch. You should definitely check burnout if you are looking for a balanced and healthy meal.'
