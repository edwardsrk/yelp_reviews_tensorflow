b"I joined in February and have been going 3-4 times a week. I absolutely love the boot camp style classes as well as the boxing and TRX classes. You know which ones are the most popular from how fast they fill up during sign-up time. The location is very convenient and the staff is mostly friendly. The other gym-goers mostly keep to themselves but are nice enough. I can't comment on the equipment since I only do the classes.It is pricey but worth it for a good workout, and I am seeing results! I'll definitely keep going, even in the summer time, because there's no way I can motivate myself to do weight training the way these guys can."
