b"We were thrilled to get a last minute reservation on Valentines Day. Our experience started off with our incredible server-wish I could remember his name! He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside. We finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well."
