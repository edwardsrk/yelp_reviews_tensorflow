b"Visited this place for the first time today on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We were the only customers there, and had the pleasure of spending time chatting with Mandy. We were greeted by what must be the most cosy and homely cafe in Pittsburgh. It felt like I was walking into someone's home. The room was filled with local handmade items, freshly baked goods, and of course, an extensive tea room with every kind of tea you could want! All teas are blended in house, and they are working on using herbs grown in a community garden in Millvale in some blends! You can even sniff the tea that you want in little jars that are laid out. We spent more than an hour there relaxing, browsing through the many gifts, books, and other goodies, and enjoying our tea and cookies. They are a vegan cafe and usually have a creative food menu on weekdays. What an amazing spot in Millvale! Please visit and support this local business!"
