b"I cant hate and I was gonna hate Chinese buffets usually not that great, BUT this place is hands down bomb.com especially for the price, only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the crab meat had very little crab meat in it, was a pain to eat but delicious it was and all you can eat so yea can't complain. Almost everything was the bomb though nothing cold, and the fried bread with sugar on it ummmm lets just say you need a plate by itself for that one."
