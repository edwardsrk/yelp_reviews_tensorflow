b"Unusual, I'll give it that. this is not what one is used to when it comes to traditional Mexican (street)food...however....its not bad at all and then some!They had all kind of fanangled stuff I'm not used to so I stuck to the basics: Carne asada burrito, oh...I ordered a large, what a mistake, that is not a large, its HUGE, no human can possibly finish that monstrosity, its over a foot long and over 3 inches in diameter. pure evil.Bottom line, I'll love to come back and try some of the other offerings. good stuff here."
