b"Almost exactly the same as Canter's in New York.  A bit pricey, but also huge and very tasty sandwiches.  I always have a hard time choosing between the Pastrami and the Reuben.  We got a Reuben here and a potato knish (Karen had never had a knish, and their is delicious).  My brother-in-law got the pastrami, and he liked it so much he did not want to trade a quarter sandwich to try the Reuben!!!  Hahahahaha!I told him both were good, but this was only the second day since we met (the first day he eloped with my sister in Vegas, hahahaha) so maybe he did not trust me yet.  Oh well.They have beer here as well, and slot machines out front.  They have cool modern diner tables and I need to post my picture of us there cuz it was cool.  Some may complain about $15 for a sandwich and a beer, but on the strip, it is a pretty good price for a dent meal, and especially a sandwich big enough for two.  I would go back in a heartbeat, just like I would  go back to the original in LA."
