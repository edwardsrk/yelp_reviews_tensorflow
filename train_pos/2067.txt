b"Look mom, I'm a player. Ok, not that type of player...geez guys! Get your head in the game....not that time of game! Sports people, I'm talking sports!When you get a free ticket to go to an exhibit, why not go to it...Right?!?! Anyway, it's pretty cool to see what these professional athletes go through it's like being picked first in gym class. Pick me! Pick me! The exhibit is pretty cool because it goes through the history of sports and famous athletes. I really enjoyed the basketball and baseball sections. It is an interactive exhibit, meaning you interact with the signing, photo shoot (yeah, couldn't stop laughing here cause ya pose like an athlete!), and all the tests that athletes go through. You can even measure your feet to see how tiny you are. Let me tell you, I have never felt so short and tiny in my life. Wow. Towards the end of the exhibit, you see the contract you sign and your jersey, oh and the millions of moneys you'll be making!"
