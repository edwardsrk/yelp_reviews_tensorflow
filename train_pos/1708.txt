b"The happy hour gang I hang out with frequents this place often.  It's hard to find a decent martini in Cleveland, but I have to say they know how to shake an excellent one here.I've been here a few times and the food has been consistently delicious every time.  The pizzas really stand out.  They're half price during happy hour.  Oh and they're also a little smaller than the full priced fare, but they are still delicious.The rest of the menu looks really delicious, but I don't know how many people know they have a full menu.  People may think this is a bar only, yet there appear to be some really nice entrees as well.  I'll need to come back and try those.During warmer weather, this is one of the best patios around.  I really want this place to succeed.  This location has been cursed by so many failed restaurants.  In my opinion, this place should be around for a long time.  It's nice to have a classier, unpretentious wine and martini bar on the west side of town."
