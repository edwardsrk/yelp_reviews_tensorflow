b"Tried their basic miso ramen and tasted pretty good.  The soup base was flavourful, noodle tasted good and toppings was decent.  My dish came with roasted pork which tasted good but I personally prefer pork belly with my ramen.  Their dumpling was very delicious. It tasted very well with the sauce (I think it's vinegar). My food experience here was good.  It is a good ramen place but not my favorite."
