b'We found this place on yelp. We were a little confused when we walked into a clothing store looking for restaurant. The restaurant is in the back. It is a really nice atmosphere with really fabulous wait staff. We enjoyed all he appetizers and the recommendations for our lunch entr\xc3\xa9es were spot on. They help you make the best choice by asking good questions and even brought us a free appetizer to sample. It is a lovely place and I wish we had one in my hometown because when I return to Las Vegas I will be looking forward to going back to this one.'
