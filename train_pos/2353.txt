b"I had dinner at Humble Pie in Scottsdale last night, the bar tender Marcus was very polite, had great recommendations which were awesome and has a great personality! The bar has a great set up, had it been a little warmer I would've sat at the outside bar.. They did have heaters but inside was just as nice. I had the huge wedge salad, the lettuce was crispy, all veggies were fresh but the only ingredient missing was BACON! Shame on you, Humble Pie! I also had the margherita pizza only because I had to try a pie! This is a must try and enough for two, maybe 3 if you have starters.. No need to over stuff yourself! If I have another chance to come back while in Scottsdale, I definitely will!"
