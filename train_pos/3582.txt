b"I've been here 3 times now and every time was fantastic: very reasonable prices, great food and awesome friendly service from this fully family-run resto.Our favourites are the deep-fried cauliflower and the royal jade house special soup. On the latest visit, we asked for the ginger crispy beef made instead with chicken since we had one person that couldn't eat red meat.  The chef kindly obliged and it was AWESOME!  Definitely should be added to the menu. :)"
