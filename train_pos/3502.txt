b"First time at this Discount Tire (just moved to AZ from Spokane, WA and was very happy with the Discount Tire there) to have the front tire of our truck checked as it was losing pressure overnight.  Was helped by Benjamin (name on the work order) who was great.  Told us they would check the tire and rotate them for free.  Went outside to look at the tire and measure the remaining thread on each tire (still OK).  They did find a nail and fixed it.  I will return here when I need a new set of tires.  Discount Tire must train their employees well as I've always received excellent service."
