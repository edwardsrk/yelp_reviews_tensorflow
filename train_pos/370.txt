b'Found good reviews on Yelp and decided to stop in prior to a concert at Blossom.  What a great choice we made.  Sat at the bar up front and enjoyed the interaction with both the bartenders and cooks who prepare the food right in front of you.  Had the grilled oysters as appitizer (awesome must have) along with the halibut special which was off the charts. We will be back again for sure.'
