b"I live in Vegas but needed some time away from home.  So glad I did! The rooms are beautiful.  The beds were very comfortable but the pillows left much to be desired. I would suggest to bring your own pillows. The room was so spacious. And the bathroom was just simply beautiful. I don't gamble much so I can't say much about that part of the casino.  But it was pretty much a casino but not as big as most of course. The restaurants that I visited were okay, nothing to write home about and the prices were you know, casino prices. The area is not the best in town. But watching the locals could be very entertaining.  Oh and did I mention, there are no resort fees and free Wi-Fi. WINNING!!  I would definitely do a staycation there again.. And have family or friends stay there when in town."
