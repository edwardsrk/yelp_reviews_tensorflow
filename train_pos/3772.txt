b"I had the best experience here. I went here a couple weeks ago on a Sunday. They were the earliest place that opened, so I came in with my two young daughters. I had Cindy and my daughter had Kelly. They did such an amazing job! They were very nice and Cindy gave me a suggestion on a design. My nails are natural and I like the gel manicures for protection. She did a beautiful purple tip with an ombr\xc3\xa9 and glitter. They were amazing. Unfortunately I totally forgot to take pictures. Friday, I went back to my old nail place because I had a gift certificate that I wanted to use up. They completely butchered my nails. I literally was in tears, because of the pain from the harder than normal grinding. Also the 20 times of being put under the light after every screw up. I knew there was no amount of fixing that would make it right, it really just kept getting worse. (And yes, I was the dummy that didn't get up and walk out. I was trying so hard to maintain composure and just hope that it turned out ok).So... Sunday I went straight back here. I explained what happened and they were so very nice. Cindy was busy, so I went with Julia (I believe that was her name). She was very attentive and careful. She did a beautiful job. Bottom line, I vowed never to go anywhere else again."
