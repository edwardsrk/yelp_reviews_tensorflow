b'When ever a deli is around, I have to take advantage of the situation and have a bite. Came here for lunch during the 4th of July weekend. I had a BLT and the boyfriend had a pastrami (I think) and watched the Spain v. Paraguay World Cup game. Yummy food. I had to save the second half of my sandwich for later (I was full after the first half!) Great place... Kinda deep inside the casino but worth it!'
