b"This is a great place for a healthy meal.  I usually get the Mother Earth bowl with either chicken or salmon.  The Mother Earth comes with ancient grains, sweet potato, avocado and a few other ingredients.  It really is delicious and the serving is large so recently I've been taking some of it home for another meal.I also really like their juices and teas. I usually mix a green tea with the lemonade.The cashier and servers are always super nice."
