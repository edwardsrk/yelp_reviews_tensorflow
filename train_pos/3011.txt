b'AMAZING. Simply amazing. Believe all of the hype and go out of your way to try this place. My partner and I lucked out and ended up staying just a stones throw away. So, our first morning in Mile End, we popped in to give it a shot. We ended up going every morning (and once in the afternoon) after that because it was just that damn good. It\'s cheap (like 85\xc2\xa2 and up), the staff speaks good English and those guys churn out wood fired bagel perfection 24 hours a day. I highly recommend the "all dressed" but just go and try everything. You won\'t be disappointed.'
