b'A very good experience.  They did everything well.Jessica provided great service.  The wine list is large enough, good variety and fair prices.  Food was very good also; good presentation; delivered hot, big portions, and at reasonable prices.If you stay at the Monte Carlo, there is no reason to leave the property for a steak dinner.'
