b"The milk tea drinks at this place are excellent! The flavors are well balanced and you can really taste the tea without being overwhelmed by added sugar. I've been here a few times in the past couple of months and here are the food items I've tried:- Crispy and salty popcorn chicken: Delicious, hot and definitely salty. Very crispy coating and the dark meat is juicy.- Tempura fish cakes: Really good flavor and the texture of the fish cake is soft. I just wish they'd had more - Fried chicken cutlet over rice: The taste of the chicken is very similar to the popcorn chicken, so no complaints there! The veggies that they add are pretty lackluster. The broccoli/tiny portions of shredded carrot I had was overcooked (probably steamed) and soggy.- Black pepper beef over rice: Meat was excellent and savory but, again, the rest of the fixings (miscellaneous veggies) kind of ruined the meal. Overall the menu is tasty but I'd say skip the big eats since the markup isn't worth what you get. The decor is simple if not a bit tacky, but there's lots of seating options and the place is open and clean"
