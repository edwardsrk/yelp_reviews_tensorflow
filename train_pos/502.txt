b"My fiance and I are both restaurant workers and yelp is the bane of our existence but after our experience today, I downloaded the app just to tell my story. We were attending a concert and really wanted to try barrio for the first time. There was a tribe game and we waited 35 minutes for a table. I had been told that the portions were small so we ordered 6 tacos a person for 3 people. FYI unless you are a glutton the portions are lovely. We definitely over ordered. The guacamole was fresh and bright and delicious. I could definitely taste (and feel) the liquor in the drinks. The server was on point and had plenty of help. The food took close to an hour. We had to leave. I should've allowed more time for dinner. When we informed a manager of our dilemma, he had our tacos boxed and comped therm. All 16. You can imagine it was substantial. I was blown away. In this business, sh!t happens and it's all about the recovery. Nice recovery guys. The tacos were SUPERB and we really appreciate the gesture. We'll be back soon and with ample time for the experience. Thank you again"
