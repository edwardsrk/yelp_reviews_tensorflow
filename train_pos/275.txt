b"Very tasty panini and crisp salads with fresh ingredients in a lovely though crowded and noisy setting. We split the Pomme - bacon, cheddar, apple slices with vinaigrette. It was delightful!! Wait staff was helpful and pleasant - until the end. We were unaware that we were not supposed to leave the table to go to the bakery shelf and order some take out. We were scolded a bit - which was fine but rather silly. I mean it's more money in the bank and there was no signage or warning we'd be breaking an unspoken law! Any way - the almond croissant and banana chocolate brioche was little better than average and tasted a day or so old. So, maybe skip that part!"
