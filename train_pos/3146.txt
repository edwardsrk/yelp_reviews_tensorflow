b"Amazing food! You wouldn't think it was the nice just by looking at the outside but the inside decor is wonderful. The Venison was perfectly cooked and the sauces were incredible it comes with the House rice which was also great. The Veal Marsala was a little too saucey for my taste but still really good. The dessert options are also great. Overall amazing place !"
