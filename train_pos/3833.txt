b"Loved this place! I came for crab legs and was not disappointed! Loved that the seasoning wasn't full of butter, the level one spice was perfect, steamed veggies were crisp with a flavor season that wasn't too salty. Tried the allegator and frog legs for the first time- good, but not for me. I'm not that into fried, salty foods though. Our service was excellent --thanks, Tim! Fun and laid back atmosphere, friendly service! Oh, and we got to tag the walls which was fun!! I'll be back! *wish they stayed open a little later..."
