b"What a great alternative to a supermarket cake. I've never been disappointed by the cakes I've tried several. My favourite is the Red Velvet. I ordered online and picked it up at the store location a seamless and beautiful experience. You can see them preparing the lovely desserts and they always have a window case full of beautiful  dessert treasures."
