b'Went in for the first time to have my eyebrows waxed and was impressed. The building was very nice, and I was worked with in a private room. Paula who did my eyebrows was pleasant and courteous. She seemed very experienced and did a good job. Before tip and tax it cost $12 which is quite reasonable. I would recommend.'
