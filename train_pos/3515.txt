b'Skip the game and just hang out here. So close to the stadium, all the pre game is here. Cheap beer, great waitstaff. Huge crowd hangs out and goes late to the game. By the time they clear out, the early leavers from the game are coming back. They have the game on TV. I came back for the fireworks. Great view from the bar.'
