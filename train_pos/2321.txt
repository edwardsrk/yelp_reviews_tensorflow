b"I took my wife out for a night of seafood, some place different, so I thought of trying out Diana's for a change! While waiting for our seats we tried out a mix of oysters and a drink at the bar right as you enter the restaurant, nice! When seated we started with the seafood appetizer plate for two(grilled octopus, shrimp, lobster, calamari , cheese and veggies) very good! My wife had for dinner, the pasta w. shrimp and lobster in a Brandy sauce, very rich but oh so good. I had the surf/turf which came with veal scallopinni, scallops, lobster, potatoes and greens. DELICIOUS! Dessert was a special coffee for us both, simply because we couldn't fit anything else in our stomachs. Phew! It was a little pricey so be prepared and don't be shocked, but overall a very nice night! We'll be back!"
