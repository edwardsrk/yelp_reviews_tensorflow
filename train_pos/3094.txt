b'"River, we see that you haven\'t Yelped in a while, what the one place that you want everyone to know about?" This. Is. It. Everyone has that one vegetarian friend, right? They\'re always there on your tail making it so you and your friends can\'t get your McRib on at the local McD\'s and you have to make sure to reiterate her order with "NO BEEEEEF, SUB BEANNNNNS" at TB. Geez.. But there\'s no need to fear, Veggie House is here! I\'ve tried a variety of dishes here and I\'ve yet to be disappointed; Pan-Fried Noodles, Mongolian Beef, Wonton Soup, Beef Ramen, Sweet and Soup Chicken, Jasmine tea, BUN ROLL!! You need to order a fried bun roll.. Thank me later.This place is vegan/vegetarian and they serve no meat.. What? Yes. I tell my bestie every single time that they should put quotes around all their meat products so people don\'t get so darn confused. Their meat, it\'s not real- but trust me, it\'s a good thing. Especially when it just hits the table, it\'ll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the "meat" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can\'t do textures, you\'re probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.All the food I\'ve had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don\'t let that deter you. Get the bun roll.I\'m serious.'
