b"The original name used to be Muntean's. The new owners kept the original buffalo wings recipe. I think they're the best around. The blue cheese dip is  also from the original owner, and is soooo addictive! It's made from scratch. Their prices can be a little high tho. Best bet is to get their wings on Wednesday, when they're on special. Yummy!!!"
