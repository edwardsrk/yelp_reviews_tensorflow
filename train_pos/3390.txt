b"My husband and I are not quite the handy people we wished we are. Now that's where Daniel is a heaven sent!We just moved in to a new house and have tons of paintings to put up along with some curtain rods and bidets for our bathroom. Daniel quoted us a price that was over our budget but he was willing to negotiate. And that was the best money spent! No headaches, no worries. Daniel took care of everything. Daniel and his coworker were meticulous and got the job done perfectly!I foresee us calling Daniel again sometime soon for any little jobs around the house!"
