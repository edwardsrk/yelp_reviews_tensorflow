b"Strangely enough, when family comes from Mexico, they want to come to pawn shops for electronics and jewelry. So we take them here because they're prices are reasonably fair.My sister got her itouch generation 4 here and it works great! We went to 5 different pawn shops for the best price and this place had the lowest price and it looked in better condition!They have jewelry-necklaces, charms, pendants, watches. They have DVDs, video games and video game systems, TVs, DVD players, phones, mp3 players, stereo systems and other electronics.If you need money quickly, you can pawn your valuables, and as long as you pay your interests on time, you can get it back. Granted they are good condition! Of all the pawn shops I've been to, this one is one of the good ones!"
