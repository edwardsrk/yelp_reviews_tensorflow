b"I will never get waxed by someone else! I absolutely love Courtney! The studio is very clean and comfortable and she always makes the experience great! She treats you like a friend, not just a client. I live in Flagstaff so I try to make an appointment every 4 weeks but even when I can't and I don't see her for a while, she still remembers so much about me and my life! Also, she charges far less than most places (half the amount that Flagstaff places charge). PLUS she gives a little discount for college students which helps out a ton! I usually get a brazilian which she charges $50 for, but as a college student she only charges $40! That $10 really makes a difference for a broke college student. My wax always comes out flawless and I stay silky smooth for 2 weeks at least. She uses hard wax but if I have stubborn hairs, she doesn't hesitate to go in with soft wax and even tweezers to make sure I get the best result! I love Courtney and I will never go to anyone else again!"
