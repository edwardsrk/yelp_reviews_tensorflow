b"This was a fun place! The buffet had a lot to offer. They don't have very good sushi and I couldn't wrap my head around all of it sitting out for a long period of them, but everything else was great! There was just about any item you could find at a Chinese restaurant on buffet and there was also a hibachi which was cool. You are only asked to take what you'll eat and you'll be charged extra for tossing food which is an amazing idea! We are all too wasteful in general. The pricing was a little deceptive. They asked what we would like to drink assuming it was included in the buffet, but it was not. So expect another $3/drink."
