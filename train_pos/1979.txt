b'I somehow found my self here two times in one week and both experiences were great. The hostesses were polite and efficient and the bartender was very well knowledge on any questions we had on the beer. I really appreciate the managers letting us have our little event there, as I know we were extremely rowdy. Even with us being loud and obnoxious it did not stop the customers one bit, which tells you how awesome Madison can be. The food was great and the beer was awesome.'
