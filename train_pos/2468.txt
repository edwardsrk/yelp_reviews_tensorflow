b"Video games and attractive bartenders, it's almost the equation for a perfect wet dream. They don't just have the run of the mill games either. The fact that MarioKart is up in there is worth 4 stars alone. Oh and if you get a shot of Patron here, which you better because this is Vegas, expect a gigantic shot because these ladies aren't selfish with their liquor. The only down side is that there are a couple kids in there and my adult ass would like to be in the company of other adults even though I'm socially awkward and won't talk to them anyway. Definitely a good spot to go to with the girlfriend or boyfriend (No judgements) just don't be in there drunk playing video games solo...it's slightly depressing lol! But hey...at least you're out of the house."
