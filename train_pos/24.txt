b"What a great restaurant in the South Side! We went for restaurant week but the entrees are on their normal menu. Everything had such a pop of flavor and was perfectly cooked. The only part of our meal that my boyfriend didn't enjoy was the dessert. The shrimp appetizer is loaded with garlic! Definitely enough for two people. The stuffed oysters were very filling but I liked the shrimp more.For entrees I had the chicken in cream sauce which was amazing. My boyfriend had a perfectly cooked fillet. My lemon cake was awesome but his creme brulee was watery. They substituted it for him.Awesome service, great wine, and great food! We will be back!"
