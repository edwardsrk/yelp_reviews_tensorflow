b"We joke that the best food in Madison is Japanese, and Muramoto is consistently our favorite go-to restaurant in Madison, especially for the lunch specials. We tend to stick to the special rolls, so can't comment on entrees. Ambiance is nice but not stuffy, and service has been consistently good. Waitstaff have always been friendly and accommodating, though we tend to go at non-peak times. A note to first-timers who rarely frequent Hilldale -- trust your GPS, the place is actually there! It's just that the exterior is so minimalistic that you will probably miss it unless you walk past it at least once."
