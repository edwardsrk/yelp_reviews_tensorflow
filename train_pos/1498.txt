b"This place was awesome. Definitely one of my fav hakka restaurants. Strong flavours all around and their hot sour soup was on point. Definitely recommend the Bombay chicken and the green curry. The green curry was so flavourful. It was, dare I say it, even comparable to high end Thai restaurants like Pai but for fraction of the cost! The owner served us and he was super nice and accommodating. If you're not from around here, lock your cars cause the plaza ain't no gated community."
