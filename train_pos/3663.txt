b"Just ate at Moreno's for the first time. First they brought out fresh chips that are thin and warm and they come with bean dip, red and green salsa that are all good. I had a chicken tostada and a fish taco. The fish taco was served on two fresh corn tortillas and the sauce was full of flavor! Loved them both. Also at our table we had a Moreno's chicken burrito with green salsa and it was very good but the green salsa was a little spicey. We will make this a regular spot for good food at a reasonable price."
