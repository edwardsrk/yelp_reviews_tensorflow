b"Went here last weekend and had a great meal. It was pretty busy when we arrived, which is always a good sign. We wanted to sit on the patio since the evenings have been so nice lately and the host said it might be a little while. Not a problem, we just went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. He came by once or twice after to ensure us that we would be seated soon, which was nice. I had heard good things about the cocktails and ended up ordering the No. 17. It was awesome and I would definitely order it again. My sister got the No. 6 and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well. We decided to split the fondue and crab cake BLT. The fondue was great and the pretzels and sausage were perfect dippers. The crab cake BLT was good, but nothing really memorable. I don't think its anything against the sandwich itself, but just that I realized I prefer crab to crab cakes. Church potatoes were an awesome side! Service was attentive and the food was well spaced out. We weren't rushed and enjoyed spending the evening enjoying the nice patio dining. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."
