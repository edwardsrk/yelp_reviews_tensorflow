b"In Charlotte for one night and we needed a place to grab breakfast before we got back on the road. This place was by the hotel and we saw it the night before so we decided to try it. In glad we did. The ordering can get a bit confusing, they weren't overly friendly, but not bad, and they didn't have crepes, even though it was on the menu board. Those are my reasons for not giving 5 stars. The pros: the blueberry cream cheese muffin was probably the best one I've ever had! It was perfectly moist and flavorful. I ate more of it than my son did because I couldn't help myself!I had the quiche which was perfectly flakey and deliciousMy husband got a sandwich of some sort, o don't remember what it was but he loved it. I also got a chocolate croissant, mmmmm I could use another one right now."
