b"The food is excellent and the bread is the best in Urbana. Dinner is delightful with excellent gourmet pizzas, fondu, tapas, etc. On Sunday, they have an excellent and low priced brunch. The dinner prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Their sangria is also the best I've ever tasted. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the service which at times is very slow."
