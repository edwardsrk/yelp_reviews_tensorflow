b"Had lunch here after a hike.  The menu looked great.  Very limited (maybe 20 items) but all sounded and looked amazing.  Tried the sausage wrapped pancakes, I think that's what it was called.  AWESOME!  Had the breakfast burrito , you build your self, really good also.  Perfect for after a morning hike!"
