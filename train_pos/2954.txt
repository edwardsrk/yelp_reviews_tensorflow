b'Prime rib California cut, which is a smaller cut, was very good and I actually ate it all! Starter salad was just okay with a standard dressing for everyone of a thousand islands flavor. Got mine with a baked potato instead of mashed potatoes. However, minus one star for such a slooooooow service on a Saturday evening! They should be used to large groups and the busy weekend crowd!'
