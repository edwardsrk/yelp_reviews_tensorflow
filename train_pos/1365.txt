b'..two of us had a great meal and service on a monday night...it was quiet so that we could speak in regular voices(a treat these days)..the food was excellent and presented with old school style(remember Napoleons)...if you like seafood, this is the place to go...my only neutral comment would be that it was somewhat pricey...but for a special occasion, it would be a treat worth having..'
