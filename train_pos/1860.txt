b'This place has a peak location at Paris across from the Bellagio Fountains. Good viewing place! 2 very large bars upstairs with cute picnic tables. Drinks are served in heavy duty Red Solo Cups.They have a very large draft beer selection and also serve bar and grill food.Our bartender was friendly. We shared a beer flight. You get 4, 7oz glasses of your choice for around $15. We shared a full 16oz beer as we played old school games, such as Connect 4.We loved the vive up here and will definitely come back!'
