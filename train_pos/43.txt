b"Surprised they didn't open earlier in a Sunday but it was worth the wait to get in. Always want to try something new but couldn't pass up on the eggs Benedict.  The sauce is consistently the same and the Mancini bread has something to do with the experience I think. Sometimes the eggs get overdone but one of the most consistent places for Benedict."
