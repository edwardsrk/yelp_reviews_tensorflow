b"Sometimes I think orthodontists take pleasure in dishing out pain.  I don't know if they imagine themselves as Dexter and lay out their tools right in front of you while looking at your eyes to see which you're most terrified at.  This is why I haven't trusted a Dental office in so many years, but with Cheyenne Dental Group I found one I can really trust.Setting up an appointment is easy but finding an open spot to be seen is hard, so get your appointments in.  For example and most recently I called Wednesday night close to closing to be seen for a quick checkup and the next available was on Tuesday at 3pm(!) ugh, with Monday being a holiday.  But with great service comes great demand.I then met Dr. Tounian whom assessed and had recommendations on work that needed to be done.  No pressure at all on what I needed and wanted.  My insurance isn't the best but they worked with me on getting the necessary work done as well.  Now lets talk about the treatment.  The assistants and staff were nice but my duel was against Dr. Lisa Hoang (spelling?) and faith was put into her hands.  She did an excellent job and explained what she was going to do and what I might be feeling so I wasn't caught off guard.  I would recommend this dental office and am glad I found comfort (scary thought being in a dentist office) in this visit and my future visits here."
