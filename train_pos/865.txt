b'There were dark times at Livermore.Those times seem to be coming to an end. Management has been reverting bad decisions made.The front door is open again.The snooty host asking for your reservation is gone.You can sit down on a Tuesday or Wed and have a conversation with the bar manager again, and learn about cocktails and liquors.Welcome back, beloved neighborhood bar!That last remaining star is for the food - I need to try it again. The last experience we had was not so good, and portions were a bit small for dinner, and too expensive to be a snack. I do wish they had some cheap bar snacks like they used to - nuts, bread.'
