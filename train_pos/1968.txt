b"I thought this place was great, all though rather pricey.  I went for a work meal while in Vegas for a conference.  As a group we got several appetizers.  I tasted the bruschetta and the four cheese pizza which were both yummy.  The others had prawns and calamari which they raved over but I don't eat seafood.  For dinner I chose the lamb chops.  They were absolutely amazing!  My only disappointment was that it said it came with gnocchi and I literally had 8 pieces of gnocchi on my plate.  For $52 for the entree I would expect a few more gnocchi.For dessert I had the italian donuts which were delightful and plenty to share."
