b'I have been here countless time for the laid back atmosphere, close proximity  and interesting menu options.  I agree with some of the reviewers here about the service.  75% of my experience with the service has been great, and 25% mediocre to bad.  Would love to see the restaurant be more consistent.  That being said, my server yesterday was absolutely lovely.I decided to review today because I just reheated the meatball dish I purchased from Frans yesterday.  BEST MEATBALLS IVE EVER HAD!  The marinarra sauce is unique - slightly lemony with garlic and lots of flavor.  Meatballs are cooked well and have just the right consistency.   Order & try for yourself.'
