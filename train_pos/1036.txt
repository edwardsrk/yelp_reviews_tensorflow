b'Before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 YEARS! That is amazing for any restaurant. Restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time...and you"ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro.I liked the vibe here. There\'s a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. It\'s usually packed Friday and Saturday nights.The owner\'s son played with the Calgary Stampeders once upon a time, so there\'s lots of Stampeder memorabilia. It wouldn\'t be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you\'re eating. My friends and I had pizza, Greek salad and Caesar salad. The Greek Salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. The Caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast.We had the Ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the Athenian pizza (think feta and olives). Both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! I would order both again.Service was great - attentive, polite and friendly.This restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do.'
