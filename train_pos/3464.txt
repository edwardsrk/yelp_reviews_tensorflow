b"What I love about this place is that the owner Olivier and his parents (The Chefs in the back) care for you as a person and prepare your food and coffee with that in mind.  I was speaking to Olivier and mentioned my dietary changes and he offered to make me an Almond milk Latte with stevia, and his mother made me a healthy spinach omelet.  You can't find this type of service and care anymore.  The Baguette Cafe experience is well worth it every time!  God bless."
