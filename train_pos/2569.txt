b"I was surprised to see some of the bad reviews on here, so I want to share my opinion too. A group of us went to the Rok nightclub inside NYNY in early March, 2011. We had a great time! I personally really enjoyed it for several reasons. -It was more casual and carefree then other nightclubs I've been to, which I liked. -I was given four (4!) free drinks and was able to get into the night club for free before 11pm. -Fun and danceable music; it looked like a lot of people were enjoying themselves. -Staff were friendly.-We did not wait in line outside the club. Most importantly, this was all without spending a bunch of money! I recommend this place if you like a more casual and friendly locale and you're looking for good deals. I will go back if they're willing to give out more free drinks. Thanks, KC :-)"
