b"My number one go to place for Chinese food! I don't go anywhere else! You're always greeted with a friendly smile and they make an effort to talk to you and converse with you. The food is delicious and reasonably priced and the establishment is always so clean and smells fresh. Highly recommend this place and I will always keep coming back!"
