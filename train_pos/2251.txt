b"Came here a few time, and it's been my go to place lately because it has pretty good prices, a lot of specials, and the food is decent and always up to par. I've had many dishes from Portuguese chicken rice to various noodle dishes. This place is always busy around lunch and dinner, and is fairly popular. Parking is also pretty hard to find in this plaza. This restaurant is kind of small too and you'll be sitting pretty close to other customers, but this is common in this type of restaurant.I think the rating doesn't reflect how great / fine this restaurant is, it's not bad at all. It's what you would expect from an HK style cafe. I'd definitely come back here again, because I haven't been here in a while!"
