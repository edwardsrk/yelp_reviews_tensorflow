b"The chicken souvlaki on a pita is amazing here. The pita they use has cheese baked into it so it really adds a great flavour to the pita. The pita is also longer than most places and they put enough of meat and toppings in the pita so you feel full afterwards! I usually get take-out and the dine in service used to be pretty bad but recently I think they've gotten better with the service. Its a very small intimate restaurant so its usually good for a couple or for a fairly small group to go together! Also, the only downfall is there isn't any available parking, but centre point mall is across the street so it's a 2 minute walk at most."
