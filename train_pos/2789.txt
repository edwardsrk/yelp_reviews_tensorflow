b"Did a great job, mentioned quite a few things that needed repairs, caught just about all of it. Helpful, pretty accurate. Only problem is they had the exhaust fan noise on the microwave listed, but not the fact that it actually didn't heat up at all. Also, pool filter spitting about a bunch of sand in pool, not cleaning well. All in all good"
