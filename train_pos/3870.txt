b"I'm a local and my mom is in town. We were coming back from Hoover dam and saw this place. The place wasn't crowed and it was clean, fast and friendly place. Food was absolutely delicious and fresh. We had burgers and my mom had fried shrimp. I will be coming back! And oh prices were very good!!!"
