b"I wouldn't consider this Aunthentic Mexican food, like my hubby does, but it sure was tasty.  Portions are nice and price is right.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Chimichanga. The enchiladas, especially the seafood enchilada was flavourful.  I think I was a little suprised to find myself really liking the food.  Its more American Mexican food but it was good!The service I recieved was 5 stars. Everyone was nice, I noticed there was mostly teenagers working there, and they were very friendly and helpful.  They checked up on us to make sure everything was alright, but they weren't overly obtrusive to where you feel bothered.  They put some restaurants to shame, and this isn't even that type of restaurant.  Definitely will be making this a regular place to go to."
