b"I love Am\xc3\xa9lie's, but I was a little disappointed this visit. I love the autumn pumpkin soup and they didn't have it. They also didn't have the seasonal pumpkin macaron. We got some petit fours that were very good with the exception of the one that I was told was white chocolate pistachio that was actually dark chocolate pistachio.On a more positive note, the Croque Monsieur and the Seeded Roast Beef sandwich were delicious as usual. The seasonal caramel apple cider and Russian tea with orange and cinnamon were absolutely fantastic. If you make it in for the fall menu, the drinks are a must try!"
