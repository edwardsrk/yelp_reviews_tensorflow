b"Yes......just yes. Beautiful restaurant, very enjoyable experience and ambiance. Went for brunch....the American breakfast was HUGE and delicious. Perfect eggs, the bacon and sausage were sooooo good....literally melt-in-your-mouth sausage. The potato croquettes were amazing and unique. The brioche toast was a let down....2 soggy flavorless pieces of toast but I try not to eat bread so that was ok with me. The bread they brought for the table was hot, fresh and crispy, and the cranberry jam unique and amazing. The BF's Croque-Madame was out of this world. Fries were good. Chocolate croissant was good...nothing mind blowing but pretty good. Over all, great, filling, quality brunch in a beautiful space."
