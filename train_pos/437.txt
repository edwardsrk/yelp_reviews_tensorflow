b"Amazing service. every time I go in I know what I want and they try their best to accommodate my needs and wishes. Always friendly. good people. although at times they don't quite seem to grasp the fact of that I know about mods and such. however all in all a great company great people who work there. And a great sense of humor. Also on a side note when I had to get my current mod fixed they helped me rebuild it to new specs with no charge as I brought my own materials (they had the tools I brought the wire and cotton.) It's a minimalist shop with little decoration. however it is clean and well lit and well stocked. Also they're more interested in making sure YOU have what YOU need than seeing you the most expensive items they have. My one minor complaint is that they sell yogurt flavored juice. *shudder* but other than that a great place to go if you're new to vaping and want to try it and or quit smoking."
