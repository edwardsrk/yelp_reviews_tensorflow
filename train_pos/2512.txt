b"We used to live really close to this place and ordered take out from them regularly, but forgot about them when we moved. We decided to stop by and check it out again recently and were reminded of why we used to come often. Mostly, we came because it was close and convenient. The food was good, but not blow your socks off great. The service was also a bit slow, but they were trying hard. It was a full house and it's possible they were short handed that evening. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend trying them out. It's one of the better Mexican places in the area. But living where we live makes us all a somewhat harsh critic of Sonoran Mexican food, so keep that in mind."
