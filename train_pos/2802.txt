b"This is the affordable version of Thomas Keller's restaurants. =) Seriously though, the food here was great. Came here with a party of 10+ for the woman's B-day and we were all very satisfied with the meal. We ordered the Grand Plateau - which consisted of 1 lobster, 16 oysters, 8 shrimp, 8 clams, 9 mussels, seasonal crab, (all cold of course) the Porc Brais\xc3\xa9 - braised pork short ribs with onion soubise & celeriac r\xc3\xa9moulade, Gigot d' Agneau - a roasted leg of lamb with flageolet beans in a thyme jus, the Poulet R\xc3\xb4ti - a roasted chicken with garlic braised escarole & lemon confit, Steak Frites - a pan-seared prime flatiron served with ma\xc3\xaetre d' h\xc3\xb4tel butter & french fries, some charcuterie and soup/salad specials as well. Service was attentive and we had some great seats by the large patio windows. Now I need to get in line again for the French Laundry...=/"
