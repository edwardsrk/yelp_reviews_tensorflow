b"Let's pretend for a moment that we're bigshots! We want huge steaks, giant glasses of wine, and beautiful waitresses serving us. It's Friday night and we're getting drunk. That's the feeling at Bandera. Excess is normal and we love it!Bandera intends to be a serious steakhouse, but they only have three steaks on the menu. That's pretty good compared to the rest of Arizona though. I ordered the fillet mignon with spiced curry powder. Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare), the curry powder was balanced, providing a nice zip that vanished as soon as it was detected. The grill masters really know their stuff, as the wood fire grill provides a beautiful aromatic char.My entree came with a gargantuan piece of broccoli, fitting the theme of excess, as well as an accompaniment of shoestring fries. The fries were thin, crispy, and dainty, being the only reminder to an outside world where things aren't always super-sized. It was a great balance to everything else that evening. Service is gorgeous and polite. At the bar, the wait staff is a bit hectic as they need to handle two types of requests at the same time. But it's forgivable and the food more than makes up for it.Highly recommended if you're a voracious carnivore."
