b"We really enjoyed our trip to Mango's this past Sunday! The space was well decorated and there was a lively atmosphere, despite it not being very busy following a big Panthers loss. Our group was promptly seated and offered menus. We selected drinks, including red and white Sangria on special ($5) and cocktails (~$10). The drinks were good, but a little on the sweet side. We also got chips and salsa, and the chips were fresh and crisp and served in a cute cigar box. We then ordered entrees including jerk chicken tacos, jerk chicken nachos, chicken empanadas and curry goat. The main reason for the non-five star review was the fact that the food came out at all different times. The food itself was very flavorful, with the a little bit of heat. Portion sizes were decent for the price, though not large enough for leftovers (I wish! The goat had great flavor and was tender). The only issue was there were quite a bit of bone pieces mixed in with the meat. The best part of the meal was the service! Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating, despite the challenges some of our party threw her way.  We'd definitely be going back soon. Hope word spreads about this place!"
