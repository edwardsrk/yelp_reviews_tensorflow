b"The worse part about the Sofitel was having to leave.I miss the bed.  I miss the robe and the towels and the L'occitane products in the bath room. I miss the quite gym. And the amazing city views from my room on the 7th story. Every detail of my 5 night stay was fabulous.  From the housekeeping to the concierge service.  The location couldn't have been better! The Peel metro stop is just steps away from the hotel.  Also, if you like to walk/run Mont Royal is just up the street (at Peel and Pins).Our last night in the city we were too tired to go to dinner so we sat at Le Bar and enjoyed a flight of French Reds and a cheese plate with 3 different local cheeses.  Although it was slightly pricey, listening to Joe-Luis speak about the wine and food with his sexy French Canadian accent made it all well worth it :)"
