b'My best friend and I loved their shrimp the first time we tried them. We had to come back for more! This is our go to place when we have a seafood craving late at night. Their service is good. The servers are nice and friendly. I get a good vibe from this place, which adds on to the pros. Presentation of the food is cute. Simple but nice.'
