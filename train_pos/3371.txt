b"We chose Dan over 4 other landscapers and found him to be honest, dependable and someone who stands by what he promises.  He delivered our beautiful backyard in 3 days and was on-site and working along with his team.  He not only incorporated our vision but added special touches that just enhanced our backyard.  We haven't seen this level of competence, work ethic and overall professionalism in many years and Dan brings all of that to his projects.  We couldn't be happier with his fair price and workmanship.Lucy & Chris B"
