b"I love Fran's Filling station. Unlike in Europe, the USD goes far at Fran's. The menu has good variety, but isn't overwhelming. It can get crowded on the weekends, so make a reservation and prepare to wait. I've never had to wait for a weekend lunch or weeknight dinner. With its eclectic menu and reasonable prices, it's a great spot for many occasions. The staff is always friendly, but also seem to never know what's going on/ appear overwhelmed. Once I ordered a manhattan and the bartender used dry vermouth. I noticed later that it's on their martini list. I've had orders arrive without sides or with incorrect sides (I just deal with it, but I'm sure they would fix if asked) and a couple of items on my receipt didn't match the menu prices (again, it was $.50, odd, but I was ready to go). I try not to eat out if I'm in a rush, so it doesn't bother me. Some of my less patient friends and family members get pretty annoyed at Fran's. I don't care as long as they're nice and the food is tasty."
