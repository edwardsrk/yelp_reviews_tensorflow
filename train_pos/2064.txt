b"Just finished lunch.  The atmosphere was very pleasant.  The food was really good.  I had a custom pizza and feel that it was reasonably priced.  The service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  I was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther Yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  The fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  My advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  You won't be disappointed."
