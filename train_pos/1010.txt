b"I came here with a friend around 1:45 on a Thursday and we were in and out in less than 45 minutes. Line at the entrance went really quick. Our number was G595 and it was at G565 when we got there. We just passed the time on our phones and I would glance up at the TV from time to time. Something about eating lion fish? I don't know. Clean location. Security guard told an old lady she wasn't allowed to vape inside the premises."
