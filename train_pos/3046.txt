b"Disclaimer: this was our first experience there. Very friendly staff & nice ambiance. We got Wisconsin cheese, The Classic & Fundue Delight for our entrees & The Original for dessert. We chose Mojo for our cooking style. We had the Cesar & the Bacon & Bleu Spinach salads. I was a little unsure coming into it but the staff asked if we've been there & explained the process. We were warmed the portion sizes were small but we got full--guess it depends on your appetite. Everything was very good, even the apples with the cheese. I highly recommend this place. It's such a fun & different experience."
