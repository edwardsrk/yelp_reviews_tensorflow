b"I absolutely love the concept of this place!!!! Its so much fun! Has the best views of the strip, many games to choose from. (Ask the staff if you can move a game closer to your table. They're very helpful). Tipsy giant Jenga was fun. The food is good, the drinks are better.Only thing they lost a star on is they stop serving food at a certain hour from what I was told. Kind of a bad idea to serve drinks and no food...you'll end up loosing money and end up with overly drunk guests. They're still new, so I'll give them a pass."
