b'I would strongly recommend a reservation for this place.It has a truly unique atmosphere and if you are visiting Montr\xc3\xa9al it should be on your list.The service was impeccable (James) and the management (Scott) was very attentive.I love their decorations.The food was beautifully presented .A great place for a date or if you want to try something different.'
