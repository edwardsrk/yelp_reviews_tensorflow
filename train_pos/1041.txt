b'We love staying at the Flaming Hotel. It\'s nice and no one tries to knock down the door at 8am trying to get into clean. The only issues I had were: no "Do Not Disturb" sign (had to make our own), they did not resupply us with clean glasses, no free WIFI, and no pen or notepad to write on. Other than those three, we had a nice stay. Hopefully we can stay an extra day to enjoy the pool area.'
