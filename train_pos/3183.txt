b'The only thing that makes extended layovers bearable, is the Maple Leaf Lounge. this little oasis makes time fly.  If I do not have nay pressing deadlines, I am happy to just read my book and have some snacks.  However, if the pressure is buildling up at work, I enjoy their wireless internet, and Citrix in, and get productive.The snacks are usually perfect for what I am looking for.  They usually have a wide assortment of light items.  I tend to be on and off diets, so if I am craving sugar, they got it.  If i am watching my intake, they have fruits and veggies.The staff are always non-intrusive, and the guests tend to be like-minded. Other than the comfy setting and snacks, it keeps me out of the shops. :)'
