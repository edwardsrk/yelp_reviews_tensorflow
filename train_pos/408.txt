b"After a long day of shopping at the waterfront, I discovered Honest John's nearby and decided to check it out. Homestead is really getting some awesome places to draw in a crowd!I loved the atmosphere here. Clean, rustic, with an awesome bar. The menu is not overwhelming, but there is certainly something for everyone. I tried the lettuces salad with grilled chicken that was incredible and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich and she raved about that as well.  I felt that the food was slightly overpriced ($15 for a salad..) but I enjoyed the experience greatly."
