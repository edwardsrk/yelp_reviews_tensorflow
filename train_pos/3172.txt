b"We decided to try someplace new for our weekly breakfast out as a family, and I'm so happy we went to Lone Spur Cafe. Our server, Michelle, was awesome! We had our two toddlers with us, and she engaged them from the get-go, which is huge for us. She got our older daughter some stickers to play with, and they even had a saddle bag up front with goodies in it that the kids got to pick from. She mentioned that it's a very family-oriented business, and that was very clear in how the kids were treated as guests, not just accessories of their parents. I love it when businesses embrace kids!The food was also top-notch, and arrived to the table quickly. I had the Eggs Benedict, and loved their thick, buttery Hollandaise sauce. Their breakfast potatoes were also very good. My husband had a skillet meal that looked great, and I stole a bite of his toast with house-made jam, that was seriously soooo good. The service, food, and atmosphere at Lone Spur were all great, and we will definitely make a return trip in the future to try some of their other offerings! A big THANK YOU to the management and staff for creating such an awesome family environment!"
