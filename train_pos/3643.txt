b"Great ambiance, gives a authentic but modern vibe. First time seeing such a unique and appealing design.The color coordination of the restaurant blends smoothly but stands out as well. The food is great, you can actually taste 'fresh' in all of the items. The whole staff of the restaurant is great starting from the manager to host to kitchen crew.I highly recommend this place to anyone that has seen it while driving by or browsing on Yelp.It's a must try everyone! Don't miss out!"
