b"The service was awesome, the ambiance was pleasant and I loved the calamari, BEST I have ever had.  It is not fried which is a fantastic start and the sauce was simply divine.  I had Bavette al Cedro which is spaghetti, lemon, Italian butter and parmigiano cheese...delicious.  I loved that I could really taste the lemon.  If you are a fan of pasta I highly recommend PastaBAR but don't expect the typical Olive Garden style pastas.  Different can be really good and frankly I think they do it well!"
