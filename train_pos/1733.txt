b"I love going to local shops and decided to give Sub Station a try. I live right across the street so it was very convenient. I ordered the small turkey and cheese sub (about 8inches). All subs come with lettuce, tomato, onions, salt/pepper, oil and vinegar, but I also added olives and banana peppers. They had tons of toppings and sauces to pick from. I think you can also toast your sub, but I forgot to ask. Unlike other sub shops, they cut their meat and cheese fresh so I was able to see my sub being make from beginning to end. My sub was pretty good. The bread was light and soft and the oil and vinegar mixture made it very tasty. Next time I want to try the spicy mayo on my sub! There are tons of options here so you can't go wrong. They also have daily specials for a sandwich with a drink for $6. I would be back for a quick lunch soon."
