b"Just came here for the first time. Some cool things that set it apart from say, Jason's Deli: Italian soda bar, charging station, chocolate dipped strawberry with every meal. Grilled cheese sandwich was really good, as were the tomato bisque and red pepper lobster soups. Really reasonably priced. The bad: Caramel brownie looked better than it tasted. My boyfriend's soup had a hair in it. Limited seating. Loud."
