b'Had a wonderful meal here. Rib steak for two with herb butter and mushroom onion sauce was excellent, cooked to medium rare spot on, lightly coated with Montreal steak spice. Tuna steak lightly seared just right went well with lentils and mint. I am withholding a star because even though the wine list was interesting and extensive, only three reds were available by the glass, and the pour was nowhere near generous.'
