b'Buchon restaurant is on the  tenth floor in Venetian. Business breakfast place, with  suit people. Croissant was good. Coffee was ok. Bacon was good. Service was a bit slow side. Many empty tables I could see, though they let us wait. Weird. Very. Beautiful place, a bit too beautiful to eat casually or comfortably.'
