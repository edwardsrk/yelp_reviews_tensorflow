b"I normally don't write reviews but this place deserves one. I am not from Madison and may not visit Fast Biryani again for a long time but already know I'll be having cravings for it that will make me want to visit Madison again just for this place alone. Food was really tasty, the Paneer Tikka Masala I tried was not overtly spicy, and the restaurant was clean and nicely maintained."
