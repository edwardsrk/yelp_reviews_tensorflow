b'4.5 stars. I visited this cute place today and was delightfully surprised by how big the space is! The location is a little out of the way for me, but if you live in the northern part of RHill this is a great little bakery/cafe/pattiserie for you! It is still worth a visit for anyone who lives farther like me. All the desserts look delicious, and I tried the Evergreen Tree and the Matcha latte. The dessert was a pistachio mouse with raspberry cream and I loved it a lot! I will definitely try the Hazelnut Cube next time- it looks so good! it is a nice quiet place to have a good talk with someone, and you will leave happy from here. I just wish the location was somewhere more accessible. Highly recommended!'
