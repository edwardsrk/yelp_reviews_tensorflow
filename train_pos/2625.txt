b"This is our favorite breakfast joint. They have the BEST pancakes in the valley.We've only been in for breakfast since their dinner menu doesn't offer any vegetarian options besides getting a grilled cheese or asking for no meat on the salads. Adding a veggie burger would be inexpensive for the restaurant, can be tossed in the back of the freezer and be charged the same price as a beef burger. This simple addition would allow us to come in for dinner all the time!"
