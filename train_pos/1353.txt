b"Impressive selection of sausages and beer! (not that kind of sausage!)I tried their Game Sausage - Guinea Hen for $9.50. They add 2 toppings; their giardiniera/pickled veg is worth a try ($2 extra). Although it was pretty good, my only complaint is that this is a bit pricey for sausage on a bun. I regret not trying the fries. Their range of beers was even more impressive. There were hundreds of dark, wheat, malt, hopped and pale beers, ciders, wines ... more choices than you can wrap your head around.Great casual atmosphere, but can get crowded and loud. You order your food at the cashier (or grab a seat at the bar), grab a number sign, find a seat and they'll bring you the food. There's benches all over (high school all over again?)"
