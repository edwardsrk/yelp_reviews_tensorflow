b"I had heard great things about downtown food - a self described modern bistro on 8th. While it doesn't necessarily strike me as a 'bistro' - it was a lovely place for lunch on a cloudy and windy Tuesday! I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't very busy - good lunch places are hard to come by - but those that take reservations are even more special. This part of 8th Ave (between 5th and 6th Street) is still developing, and maybe that is why it is still possible to get a reservation at 12 only a day or two in advance! But regardless of location, this place is worth a visit.My colleague and I decided to share the Kam Saw Ham Nee Dah Burger (featuring DTF famous 777 bacon) and the Bacon Salad (featuring more of the DTF famous 777 bacon!). The kitchen went that extra step and served the burger as two mini burgers for us - a touch you don't often see when sharing a meal. The burger was DELICIOUS and a salad featuring bacon is ok in my books any day!We had a lovely little server, easily excited by our choice of dishes. The ambiance was also pleasant - not so empty you feel that other guests are listing to your every word, but not so loud that you lose your voice by the end of the meal. And the nice white chairs are very comfortable.So go on, make your reservation for DTF and order the burger with the name you can't pronounce. Do it - do it now!--L"
