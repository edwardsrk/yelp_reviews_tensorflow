b"One of the largest restaurants in Chinatown, the Regency Palace is a great place to go for dim sum, lunch or dinner anytime.... providing that you do NOT go to the buffet and order a la carte.  If you do go to the buffet, the food will be 2 1/2 to 3 star at best, and compares with most chinese buffets at any other place though with a pretty decent dessert buffet as well.Being the largest, I never have problems finding a table for dim sum, and throughly enjoy the food.  Broken into 3 parts, 1 fixed station for the most popular steamed items, 1 fixed station for the most popular fried items, and the traditional mobile carts comprising the 3rd part, dim sum is efficient, fast and fresh.  In groups of 6 or more, their set menu dinners are fantastic.  At a value of 20-30 a person, a group can have a feast of 7-10 dishes, all freshly made to delight friends and all.  One special note, it's probably the best chinese place in Calgary that can accomodate private groups from as few as 10 to as many as hundreds.  Plenty of small private rooms and even a dance floor with a stage for a live band."
