b"This review is for their location on 10431 N. 19th Ave, Phoenix, AZ  60-997-1007Me and my office mate finally tried this location - we both ordered hot subs.  I got the Ham and Cheese and she ordered the Turkey Breast.  I LOVED this sandwich, the bread they use is very tasty - perfect crunch after being heated.  Ham/Cheese and all he fixins were perfect in my book.  I will go back and try the pizza by the slice.  I also like their fries - seasoned steak fries. This location is in a very small and old strip mall next to a dollar store.  Inside is very clean and staff is friendly. We went during lunch hours and it wasn't too busy.   Very filling and the sandwich size and flavor was perfect and i thought the cost was reasonable."
