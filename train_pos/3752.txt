b"Some people have difficulty grasping the concept of Planet Fitness. It's just high quality fitness equipment geared at getting you in shape. No glitzy smoothie bars or aerobics classes for ladies to get all dressed up trying not to sweat. The attendants are pleasant and readily answer questions. The Lunk Alarm can be a little irritating but you overlook that after awhile. Keep doing what you do Planet Fitness because I'm a fan!"
