b"My family has been seeing Dr. Brown and the girls at Comfort Care since the mid 90's when we moved to Vegas. My father had extreme perio problems and Dr. Brown did all of his work.  There isn't a single piece of work in my mouth that hasn't been done there as a result. As an adult, everyone knows me and they are always friendly, really flexible and understanding with billing, and above all else, thorough. Every time my mom has an issue with a crown or abcess she simply calls and they have a prescription ready at her pharmacy so she can start treatment before they get her into the office. I make my boyfriend go there now, too!I recommend Dr. Brown and Marlaney (she replaced Kathleen for hygiene) if they take your dental plan or if you really need experienced and top notch care."
