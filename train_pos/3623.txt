b'Do you ever feel all crunchy and wish someone would pick you up by the ankles and shake you out like a sheet? That\'s how I had been feeling before my massage appointment this weekend. Suzanne is a great massage therapist because I felt great by the time I walked out of there and I\'m still feeling great 2 days later! The location is tucked away in the office complex just east of Max\'s gas station on the southeast corner of 12th St. & Missouri. I had a 60-minute aromatherapy massage ($80). I got to pick the scent I wanted her to use and she blended it with the coconut oil to make a custom massage oil just for me! She also put some in a diffuser and near the head rest. The scent was never overpowering. It was just right! The massage pressure was perfectly firm. While I felt relief from the tension I had come in with, I didn\'t feel like I had been beat up to get there. Also a nice touch, she popped a roller ball in the top of the vile with whatever was left of my "custom oil" and I got to take it home with me for a olfactory reminder of my awesome massage.Next time I treat myself to a massage, this is where I\'ll be going!!(PS I used a Spafinder.com gift certificate to come here. Waaay better than going with one of those chains that seem to be the dominant offering for redeeming those certificates.)'
