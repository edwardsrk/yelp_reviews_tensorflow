b'This is a really nice hotel.  A big step-up for Champaign-Urbana.  The rooms were clean, the beds and bedding were high quality, and bathroom was great.  Free Wifi, and fast too, up to 20 Mbps!  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was a minor mix-up with the reservation but this was promptly taken care of.'
