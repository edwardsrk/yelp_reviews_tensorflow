b'This place tries to be a little of everything,Five Guys, meets, Sushi Bar, meets whole foods, meets Caroline BBQ, meets pub, meets Heinens, etc....   Not a bad choice if you want to grab something to eat and do some shopping. Great beer selection, nice seafood dept and soccer moms! Nothing like the Solon Soccer mom, well except Orange Soccer Moms, or Beachwood Soccer moms, for that matter.Definitely worth a stop just for the Beer Bar alone!  Oh did I forget to mention Soccer moms, hiccup!'
