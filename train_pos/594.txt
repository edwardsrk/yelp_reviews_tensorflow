b"This Fry's is a little bit of a drive from my flat.It's a newly renovated Fry's store with Starbucks in it! *woo hoo*Same friendly faces! And did you know if your item is out of stock you can request a rain check for the same low price that its currently advertised?Parking is well lit, and clean."
