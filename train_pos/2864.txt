b'The food was awesome! Very moist meat and the topping were all fresh and full of flavor. I also got a side of the fries and a shake. The fries were crispy and lightly salted. Very tasty. I got the butterfingers shake and it was thick with just the right amount of butterfinger pieces in it. The only thing that was slightly lacking was service. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgable, however when we asked for extras (ketchup, ranch etc...) it did take awhile before she came back with them. It also too her awhile to get me a refill on my drink. Other than that it was great and everyone was very friendly!'
