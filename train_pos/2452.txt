b"I came to Magic Tailor for alterations on two cheap suits. That includes jacket sleeve shortening, pant hemming, and having the waist taken in on the pants from a 30 to about a 29/28. No judgement was cast for paying more than the suits worth for adjustments and it was done on time exactly as we agreed on, and on time to meet my deadline. As a general tip, before you goto a tailor, do some research and decide ahead of time on the extent of the adjustments you want and be sure to communicate that to the tailor instead of taking their suggestions as gospel. I ended up with a jacket sleeve that had no dress shirt showing, too long in my opinion. I'm not sure how that happened since they measured it right on me and I agreed to where they pinned it. I didn't complain because I had to catch a flight the following morning. In the end, I think it was my fault for not communicating that I wanted a half-inch of dress shirt showing, but I thought that was universally agreed on so i just assumed his suggestion was right. Anyway, that wouldn't stop me from going again."
