b"I love Raising Cane's.  I probably eat here once a week.  I'll tell ya why they're great:1) They're fast2) They're hella cheap3) The food is great 4) They give a military discount I stopped by yesterday 6-7-15 around 2PM for a sandwich combo for $5.89.  The chicken strips were hot, juicy, and crispy. The bread was fresh.  The fries were hot, crispy, and salty.  You can't go wrong with this place.  They are consistently awesome."
