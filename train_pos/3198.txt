b'Really friendly staff, very willing to make adjustments or re-make your drink to your liking. Best boba in town, soft and chewy (even in cold drinks 30 min later), nice honey and brown sugar sweetness...not too sweet and definitely not bland like some other places. Very good tea flavor and great tea:milk ratio. Tried the Okinawa milk tea (not as heavy as Hokkaido and more tea than milk flavor). Loved it!'
