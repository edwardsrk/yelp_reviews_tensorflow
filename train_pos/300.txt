b'I recently ordered here for the first time and they are pretty good and I will be ordering form them again! I was really happy with the menu which offered pastas and salads. I usually order from Pizza Hut so it was nice to have other things on the menu. I ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti and it was pretty good. I also ordered a cobb salad, also good (get extra dressing). I have been eating those 2 things for 3 days! The portions are BIG! Anyway, overall 4stars for this pizzeria :)'
