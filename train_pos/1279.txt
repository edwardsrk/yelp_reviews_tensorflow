b"The fish and chips are delicious, particularly in the summer when the truck offers it for takeaway. Dining in the restaurant is good and I love the cornbread. My typical order is coconut shrimp and a seafood pasta. I've tried most things on the menu except for the steak. I can't recall specific details for each entree, but it's a restaurant I return to with my family.  We are always satisfied afterwards with leftovers too."
