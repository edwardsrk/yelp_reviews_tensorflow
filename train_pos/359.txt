b'I came here for dinner recently and had a very pleasant time. The staff was very cordial and polite. The place at the time we went (around 6:30 PM on a Friday night) was quiet but I believe more people come here for their lunch buffet. The food was delicious and was happy to rely on Yelp to find this little spot.'
