b'This former Mervyn\'s store in a strip mall was our first stop on Black Friday shopping last year. (My MIL lives in the area. So we start here and work our way up to the Boulevard Mall.) We were about number 50 or so in the line, at the door. So, it was funny when we saw our friends in the number 1 position. Small world, huh? It was a little crazy, but that is how it is on Black Friday. We ended up with some good deals- we looked at the circulars the night before, so we were prepared. The Kohl\'s Cash promotion was also motivation to shop here. Spend $50, get $10 in Kohl\'s Cash- specified dates. The line to pay was pretty long, but this is another thing to expect. If you\'re smart, you\'ll have one person in line, another to do the shopping, and switch off- it\'s a system. I bet we\'ll be back again for Black Friday shopping this year- just around the corner.The store was organized, nice displays, and had a good offering of merchandise- surprisingly. (Considering the last time we were in this store, we were there for the Going Out Of Business sale- Mervyn\'s, which was sad- I shopped there as a kid for "Back to School".)We also came over last weekend for an exchange. The selection of Keurig K cups (single coffee brew) was much better than the other one (Blue Diamond): Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa, Raspberry Black Tea, French Roast, Caribou Blend, etc. I mean there were full racks of this stuff. The ladies at the Customer Service Desk were very nice and helpful. It was a quick trip.'
