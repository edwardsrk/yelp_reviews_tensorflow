b"It took me months to get a reservation for two here. We came with anticipation. This place is very eclectic. Expect dark, cramped quarters. The menu is very creative with multiple different types of chip dips and tacos. Our food was delicious and we left satisfied. Despite a reasonably nice dinner, I can't say this place lives up to the hype."
