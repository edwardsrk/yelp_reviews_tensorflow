b"One of my must stops in T.O. is Congee Wong! My MIL recommended Keung's instead this time to try and because she's such an awesome foodie - we went to check it out.We got congee (of course) in Lai Wan (very tasty) and Special (has liver chunks). The congee was really tasty and my hubby had an OMG moment over the flavorfulness of the special congee. We also got Chinese donut (very crispy), Singapore radish cake (not as good as Congee Wong, but decent), and crispy noodles (ok). My GIL says that usually the meals come with a free drink and after a simple asking of the waitresses we got free hot drinks (milk tea, ying yang milk tea, coffee, and lemon tea)! The prices are very reasonable (much cheaper than in the States for sure). Restaurant itself was clean and I can't wait for the next time I'm in town for more!"
