b"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have excellent reviews. Yes it's not located in the best area. I don't understand when reviewers complain about an area, Tropicana is what it is, as expected. There's no surprises here. But this Starbucks is awesome. The baristas are always in a spunky good mood. But most importantly my latte is always spot on. Other baristas at other locations either put too much syrup or not enough but these baristas are consistent with the perfection. Good job!!"
