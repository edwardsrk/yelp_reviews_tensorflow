b"Tasti was one of the first places I used to run to when I visited NYC, and I was ecstatic to learn we were getting one in Scottsdale! Mmmmm...bananas foster is the best! If your favorite flavor isn't on the daily list, you can make it for a dollar extra- which is a great option when you have a craving. I love knowing when I eat Tasti, I'm not eating a whole 600 calorie wreck like I'm sure I do at the self serve shops and honestly, Tasti D-Lites flavors taste soooo much better to me than those places too. I'm so glad trips to Tasti are now a whole plane ticket cheaper!! ;-)"
