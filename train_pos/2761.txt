b"Ahh, I haven't been to Sonic in a while, but I met up with a friend here recently to catch up on some girl talk and chill out.  We parked and sat at one of the tables at dusk, with a nice breeze blowing.  I sipped on a large iced tea with extra ice and watched as she ate a chicken finger meal; she'd never been to Sonic even though she's been in Vegas longer than me (I've been here since 1992!)KUDOS:- They have two food items on the menu that I used to get all the time, but not so much any more:  root beer floats that you can request to be blended when you order (that's how I like 'em); and, tater tots. You can get the special fry sauce for the tater tots and fries, a combo of mayo and ketchup.  My son and I would come through the drive-thru at least once a week for blended root beer floats back in the day. It's comfort food, for sure, and oh so good!  - The ice they put in their drinks is crushed, but there's something special, I don't know what it is.  It's so popular that they even sell it by the bag. - Sonic still has the old-school park and eat concept.  You can pull up, park, order over the intercom, and your order is brought out by someone on skates.- Happy Hour for the drinks, of which there are plenty to choose from:  slushes, limeades, sodas, sweet or unsweetened iced teas (regular or green). 2:00-4:00pmGRIPES:- Really not healthy for you, but, hey, you don't come to Sonic to eat healthy.  Come here for some greasy burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, tater tots, sundaes, floats, and anything else that will make you feel good when you need that kind of comfort."
