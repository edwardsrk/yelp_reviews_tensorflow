b'This salon was new for me and I was so happy I went in for a haircut and color. Daniel and my stylist were very welcoming and Laura, my stylist was just the best. She gave me a new haircut and style that made me look and feel younger and the color was very good for me. I love the casual atmosphere with very professional results from an experienced, knowledgable staff. This was a great all-around experience and I strongly urge you to book an appointment with them. I made my next appointment with Laura, who is so talented, caring and fun! I am thrilled to have met her and look forward to my next appointment at this salon.'
