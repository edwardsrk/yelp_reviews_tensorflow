b"I've attended a few weddings here before and it's a great place and very convenient if you live around the area.   The food here is amazing.  The dim sum is delicious.   I come here normally on sundays for dim sum and it's got it all.   The hall is spacious horizontally but has regular heigh ceilings.   Which is different compared to most other halls with tall ceilings, but that doesn't really matter.  I come here for dim sum any day!"
