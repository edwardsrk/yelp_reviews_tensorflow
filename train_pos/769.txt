b'this place has had a total 360 make over a la "divine design" since the willow house departed and hob nobs took root. it\'s still the same house, it just looks like a really chic, modern, bookstore meets downtown urban cafe. with tons of light shining in to warm you up as the weather starts cooling down.i\'ve been here on two occasions and ordered food on both, as well as an iced americano and regular iced tea.  the first time we grabbed a table inside and my friend and i split the vito\'s favorite in a wrap. it was $8 of pure italian deliciousness. packed with lettuce, tomatoes, salami, ham, and much more. it was huge, a half was more than enough. the side of cole slaw had pepper in it which gave it kind of a kick that i\'ve never experienced in a cole slaw before. the second time i went i had the greek wrap which wasn\'t as good as vito\'s favorite but still packed a kick ass greek punch.  the coffee is good, i was chatting with the [assumed] owner and he mentioned he gets the beans roasted especially for him from the cave creek coffee company. it was brought out to my table with cream and sugar and was perfectly bitter with a hint of sweet earthiness.  the iced tea was average, it\'s not brewed cup by cup but they charge you like they do. they close at 9 during the week which sucks, because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode, and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite, cup of coffee, and focus. i find it to be a laid back place to get work done and bust out that 10-15 page research paper you put off until the day before it was due. FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!*note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it.'
