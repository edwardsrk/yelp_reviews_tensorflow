b"Came here with a few friends after wandering the area looking for restaurants to try out. We each ordered a lobster roll and also ordered the fried clams and buffalo shrimp. While I found the fried clams to be a bit on the salty side, the lobster roll and buffalo shrimp were really good! They didn't skimp out on the lobster for the roll, and the Yukon chips exceeded my expectations. The music was a bit on the loud side, so I noticed that I had to raise my voice a bit during conversation, but it wasn't a big deal. I really liked how the chef came out to greet each of the tables to see if we found everything alright."
