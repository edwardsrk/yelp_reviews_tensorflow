b'I had heard mulitple extremely good comments about "I love sushi" and decided to give it try, even though i am not the biggest sushi fan.  The first thing I noticed when we sat down was the big menu with such great options... The screaming orgasm is absolutely to die for.  Price is good, service is ok.  Wouldn\'t say it\'s great, wouldn\'t say it\'s bad.  Overall, it\'s very enjoyable.'
