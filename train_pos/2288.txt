b'Came here for dinner last night and I we got a flavourful goat dish called Sali Boti and the goat was sooo tender. My boyfriend loved the flavor of the sauce that came with it. The Dum Aloo Kashmiri dish comes with an awesome saffron sauce. By the end of our meal we were full but still craving more. Restaurant had a quiet atmosphere i ln the evening.'
