b'I have to say that my experience there was really great!!! To check in was a breeze everyone there was great I do recommend that you pay the extra 20 dollars for the renovated room. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because every way you turned the staffed tried to sell my boyfriend and I a time share. Dinner at the sushi restaurant was great well priced and the staff was attentive. We will definitely be back especially after all the renovations are done.'
