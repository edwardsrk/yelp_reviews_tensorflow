b"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and I could not resist a slice of pizza and a beer for $5. It turned out to be a good choice. I liked the pizza. It has a crispy crust and they really load up the toppings. It's also a very large slice of pizza. I was pleasantly full after just one slice. Not that it stopped me from ordering a second slice.We also tried the bruschetta appetizer, which was quite good. The serve a bowl of the mixed up toppings with a generous portion of toasted crostini. My only complaint is that the mozzarella really needed to be chopped a little more finely. The chunks were large and there were only about 5 or 6 of them, so you could really portion it out well for a couple dozen crackers. Not a big deal, really.I'll be back."
