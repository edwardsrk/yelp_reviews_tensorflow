b'Yet another great place to eat mexican on N. Tryon.  Bargain prices on the lunch menu, prices ranging from $5.75 to $6.75 including softdrink. Really can\'t go wrong at these prices. As to be expected a basket of chips along with salsa is brought to you with your drinks. The chips here are the best I\'ve had in Charlotte, light with a pronounced corn flavor, the salsa is flavorful as well. Sundays are busy here as a live Mariachi band is on hand. Overall a nice find, but how do I choose ? My fave in the area is El Taco Veloz, and we have frequented Taquiria Guadalajara as well, now we have to add a 3rd place to our list for good mexican. These 3 places on N. Tryon blow away the "chain" restaurants, there really is no comparison.'
