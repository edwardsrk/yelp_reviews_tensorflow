b'Booked the rental online after comparing prices at other car rental locations on the strip. The price was reasonable, a little higher than off strip, but was willing to pay for the convenience. The service was awesome. Friendly, easy and no high pressure upselling. The car was clean and was exactly as booked. Easy to find the car from the clearly marked Hertz stalls.'
