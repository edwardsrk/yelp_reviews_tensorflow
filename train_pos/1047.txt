b"Four stars because this place is an institution.  Not just fries, but a BAG of fries.  Be prepared to share with everyone you know and even someone you don't know.  The pizzas also aren't bad, especially for the price, but late at night, be prepared to wait awhile while all the other drunken patrons are getting their own food.  Oh, the store is not the best place to actually eat you food, but just take it home and start that second party."
