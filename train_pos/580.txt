b'Solid 4 stars.  We have been twice.  The first visit was a little bumpy; however they had just opened a few days before so it was expected to have some rough spots. The food was on pointe and their craft  beer game was solid during the first visit, so we decided to give them another go round.  Service was way better (since it was a Tuesday and kind of slow, our waiter was very attentive).  Again, the food (for the most part) was ah-mazing.  Beer selection has a good rotation.  I was sad they didn\'t have the witbier from last week, however the PB Porter from Peoria Artisan was a welcome addition.  Pros:-PB&J Burger (I swear, try it ala mode - it\'s soooo good! They must think I\'m a weirdo though.  Our waitress said the kitchen staff was confused by my request )-The fried chicken - enough to feed 2 people and the best we\'ve had!-The sloppy corn bread- divine- The Divolono (sp?) Pizza - spicy with a hint of honey sweetness-CRAFT BEER!!!!Cons:-The pretzels - 3 small pretzel "sticks" - maybe 4 would be a better number and they just seemed very small.  Both of our orders also were cold.-Our side of fries came in a large dish, but there were so few that it looked like we got someone\'s leftovers.  They were hot though, and my 6 year old seemed to like them All in all, we will definitely be back.  Maybe not with our littles (they get bored easily).  A wonderful start and I can\'t wait to see State 48 become a solid 5 star rating! (We also can\'t wait to try their beers in a few weeks!)'
