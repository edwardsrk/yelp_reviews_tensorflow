b'I got rid of the bang bang sauce in favor of mustard and I thought the burger was very flavorful and the meat just melted in my mouth and with the bun the flavor was excellent. I could imagine that the bang bang sauce would over power the burger, hence I left it off, plus I am more of mustard guy anyway. I will come back and try something more adventurous than just a regular burger with lettuce, tomato, and onion.'
