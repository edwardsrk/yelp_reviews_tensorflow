b"The whole process of working with American Home Water & Air was great! Scheduling was fast and friendly. My serviceman, Stan, called when he was supposed to, gave a window he stuck to, and worked fast. Very happy overall!The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was due to the overall scheduling strategy. I wasn't given a service window until the morning of, meaning I had to leave the day completely open. Very difficult for working folks that have to coordinate calls, meetings, etc."
