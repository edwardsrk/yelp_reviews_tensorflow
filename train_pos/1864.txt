b"Decent duty free store - lots of the usual beauty brands and jewelry/accessories (Lancome, Michael Kors), and a small Victoria's Secret store (mostly accessories). I was looking to pick up a bottle of scotch and there is a good selection, maybe 25 choices? Prices seemed high for a duty free store but I assume that is because it's Vegas."
