b'Overall very good! Great service and location. Interesting interior, small and cozy. We had 8:30 reservations were seated at 8, the restaurant was not crowded at all. Service was fast, the table was very small but cleared off to make room for the next round very efficiently. The food portions were extremely small but the main course was a great size. Everything was perfect, the only I did not like was the awkward gas station feel bathroom. Also when we called to see if their was any earlier reservation the lady was rude. Try the carrot tator tots and veggie burger.'
