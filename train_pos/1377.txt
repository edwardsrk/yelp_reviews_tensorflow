b'From time to time, my family enjoys a good pizza.  However, the gluten free options are very limited for my youngest son and myself.  We have ordered from Dominos, which is really gross.Streets of New York was introduced to us about a year ago.  We have been back several times when we want to have a pizza treat.  We love the food.  The only issue we have is the wait is often very long for our food and the wait staff seems is always a little on the blah side.  A smile, every once in awhile would be nice.  We will continue to come back, but I would recommend the wait staff perk up a bit, often you look like you (all) hate being there.'
