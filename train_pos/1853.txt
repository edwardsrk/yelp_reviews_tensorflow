b"I just finally got a chance to shop at this place for the first time since it opened. There are two reasons I didn't give this place a full five stars. One of the reasons is that it's a little bit pricier than Seafood City or Ranch 99 in the middle of town. The other reason is that it is smaller than Seafood City or Ranch 99.One of the things that I love about this place is that it's on the Southeast side of town closer to where I live. This place is great for people who live in Henderson because we finally have a fairly large Market to shop at 4 Asian and Filipino foods. This place is just a little bit pricier than Seafood City but if you live in Henderson and don't feel like driving to the middle of town then this is a great place to go. It's also a little bit smaller but they seem to carry all of the basics.The restaurant that they have inside is also really good. Because of the amount of traffic that seems to go through there the food seems to always be fairly fresh. I tried the Sisig, beef steak and BBQ Chicken skewer. The food was great. Although the Sisig was made a bit differently than what I'm used to it was still very good and full of flavor. I would definitely go back to try other dishes.The one thing I was really surprised with the huge selection of ice cream. So many different flavors of ice cream like mango, Ube, Green Tea and Coconut. Next time I go I'm getting the Halo Halo ice cream.To summarize if you live anywhere near Silverado Ranch and Bermuda you definitely need to check this place out, even if it's just to eat Filipino food in the restaurant."
