b"I'm a fan of Bobby Flay, so while I was in Las Vegas, I decided to give Mesa Grill a try. Located inside of Caesar's Palace, right next to their sports book. We made reservations and were seated after waiting for a few minutes for them to get our table ready. We walked right by the bar on our way to our table, and they had a nice selection of bottles to choose from on the wall. I had a great first impression of Mesa Grill and the ambience was very positive and upscale.Our waiter mentioned that their specialty drink is a margarita, so we were sure to try their white peach margarita, and it was very good.I ordered the Lamb Porterhouse Chops and my wife ordered the Pork Tenderloin. WOW. That was the first thing that I came to mind when I tried my lamb. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was absolutely phenomenal. My wife let me try her pork tenderloin and it was amazing as well. You can't go wrong with either choice! We both left Mesa Grill feeling very content and our stomachs were happy too!Great restaurant! I would definitely eat here again."
