b"I was in town visiting over the wekend and stumbled upon this gem!I was amazed that it had only been open for less than a week!Being from New England, I stopped in to watch the Patriots game.The Video presentation for the sports were second to none.It didn't bother me that I was the only Pat's fan. The ambiance, energy, and professioanlly trained staff, made me feel right at home.The selction of beers were amazing, as well as the food that I sampled! I would pit their burger against any other high end burger joint that I dined at.I even challenged my girlfriend to a game of Billiards, because I was having so much fun there. The icing on the cake were the reasonable prices! I didn't get sticker shock, and it the experience didn't burn a hole in my wallet.If I lived in AZ, this would definetely be my new hang out!"
