b"This place is awesome!! The atmosphere is very cozy and if you are a veteran you whole meal is free! I've been in the military for almost 4 years and have never been to a place that has offered something like that to veterans. It was a pleasant surprise. The staff is very nice and the food is great!! Definitely worth the stop!!"
