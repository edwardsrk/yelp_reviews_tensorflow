b"I always make it a point to visit hash house while in the Vegas area, the portions are large and the food never disappoints, our usual is the Andy's sage fried chicken and waffles but this time we went for the man vs food special, the chicken egg Benedict with chipotle cream sauce. Holy moly delicious!! So much cream sauce over perfectly crunch fried chicken and mashed potatoes. It's my new favorite and I was overstuffed after splitting the plate. The service at the Stephanie location was good, I have no complaints, however the wait was a little long seeing how many open tables were available. Overall a great experience and even better food."
