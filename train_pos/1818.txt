b"Being from California and mostly attending clubs in the strip, this was a perfect change of scenery. It's not that big and it's located in a town shopping center which means free parking and plenty of it. Came to celebrate NYE with my friend and her cousin.  What I like about this place is the ambiance and it's locals. You don't get that stuck up crowd that you find when you go to club in the strip who think their butts don't stink. The service was pretty good.  50 bucks and free drinks till 10 sounds like my kind of place for NYE. The drinks are strong which is perfect if you're looking to get your buzz on.  I recommend the cosmopolitan and the lemon drop. The band is great and the DJ even better. I may just have to try to book my birthday here."
