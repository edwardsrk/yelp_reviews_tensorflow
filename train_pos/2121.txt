b"Great new location on 12 street north of Glendale on the west side of the road. The place is BRAND NEW and the atmosphere is just awesome. I come here on Thursday mornings after a run with a few friends and the food is pretty darn good. So far the biscuits & gravy with subside egg is just ridiculously delicious.  I also love the chiliquias (probably spelling it wrong), the oatmeal is great and so are the burritos. I do wish the coffee was self serve but it's good also. They have lots of room inside and just a beautiful courtyard outside where we usually sit. They sell lots of little stuff too like Cracker Barrel but not nearly as much, lots of pastries too."
