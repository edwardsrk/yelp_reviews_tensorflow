b"AccuTemp Refrigeration was the third company I called for a repair quote for my A/C unit which quit working back in October.  I had been told previously that my current unit was undersized so I expressed interest in possibly getting a new unit instead of repairing the old one.  The technician who came out was on time and after assessing the situation recommended that given the relatively young age of the my current unit and smaller duct size, that repairing the unit was probably the best way to go.  I really appreciate the honesty and not trying to sell me anything I didn't need.  On top of the professional service they also ended up with the most affordable.  I will definitely be using Accutemp next time I have an A/C issue."
