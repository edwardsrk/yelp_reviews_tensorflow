b"We were going on vacation and flying out of Phoenix and this Hotel offers a park and fly program. They have a nice big parking lot in front and in back and while on our trip they had us park in that back lot, we had no problems with our car. The rooms are very comfortable and since the outdoor temps were right around the 99 degree mark the house keeping staff kept the air conditioning in the rooms turned down so it was comfortable if not almost too cool, but after  driving up from Tucson and unloading our luggage it was welcome.The shuttle bus to the Airport is shared withe the neighboring hotel, but is big enough for most trips to the airport.Don't miss out on the free Breakfast  everything from eggs, yogurt, cinnamon rolls and cereal. don't sleep to late if you want to enjoy this meal as the close it at 9am.We will defiantly stay here again."
