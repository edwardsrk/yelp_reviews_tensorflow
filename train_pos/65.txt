b'Wow! I\'m the first to review! How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there\'s no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.My meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they\'re not tiny, and aren\'t considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn\'t your typical thin, fried, "papery skin". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it\'s crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I\'ve ever eaten.I also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They\'re pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I\'m pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don\'t like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.My main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It\'s a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don\'t need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. Other great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso\'s Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.Plus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!'
