b'I have only come here at night so I only know how the nightlife is, no idea what the food is like. The back patio is really nice on summer nights, it does get packed so if you want to get a table I suggest coming early. They have the usual drinks and there are a few bars in the restaurant. One side and 2 outside so it is pretty easy to get drinks. They play great music and they have TVs outside so you can catch any game you want. The service has been great both times I went. I would definitely suggest this place to come when you want a simi-chill night with friends!'
