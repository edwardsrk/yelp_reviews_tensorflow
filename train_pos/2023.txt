b'This store is full of funny saying on clothes of what you want to really tell folks how you feel ;))  "rock is dead.  long live paper and scissors."I just loved this store and got my husband a t-shirt and myself one as well.  For some reason I can\'t remember what they say right now!  They also have stuff on keychains, pj\'s, baby clothes, etc.  I paid like $18.00 per t-shirt and they had ton\'s of sizes and colors.You must stop by and check it out!'
