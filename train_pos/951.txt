b'Pretty much the only Indian resto in this neck of the off the beaten path NDG. The store front says " Yagel Bagel", but go right in , you\'re at the right place. The establishment is small, only a few tables, and I\'ve only ever been here for lunch, and so far so good. Reasonably priced , well prepared Indian food, perhaps not gourmet, but good nonetheless. I never had to wait forever to get served and the food was always piping hot, and prepared as I prefered. (medium spiced) There are 2 menus, 1 a la carte and a special lunch menu, featuring the veggie or meat thali, or briyani, with daal soup & naan, extra. The soup could have used an extra flavouring  of something or other, the naan was good & served toasty warm, the  chicken thali better than at some other places I\'ve tried. The only other dishes I\'ve ever had were: chicken Kashmiri, chicken Korma and the ever popular butter chicken... all good.  Overall, I\'ve always left the place feeling pretty good, satiated and happy to have been referred here by a colleague.'
