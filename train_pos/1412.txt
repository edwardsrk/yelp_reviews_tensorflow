b'Went to Las Vegas for a family event taking place in North Las Vegas.  This hotel was centrally located to all of our activities.  The rate was great and I was pleasantly surprised with our room.  The hotel was full on Saturday night but we did not hear much hall noise at all.  Bed was comfy and the air air conditioning was better than most places.  Breakfast on Sunday morning was pretty good.  Lots to choose from:  cereal, waffles, fruit, fruit juices and the coffee was good.   Would definitely recommend this place to anyone with business in this area.'
