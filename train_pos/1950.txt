b"Soho is an adorable lil eatery! We decided to try them out for brunch and were pleasantly surprised. I was able to make a reservation over the phone and only waited a few minutes when we arrived. It's a small place but is set up nicely with a cute Bar. The mimosas are delicious and averagely priced. I order the shrimp and grits and my gf got the chicken and waffles. Complimentary biscuits with rosemary butter and apple butter almost filled me up! They are soooo good. Our server was nice and speedy. Our water glasses were always full and she refilled my coffee without asking. The wait for our food was a little Long but you didn't notice with the constant refills and biscuits! The food was absolutely delicious and filling. The ONLY Downside is the large loud party sitting behind us. With it being a smaller place the laughs of the jolly party were overbearing. Other patrons were visibly annoyed but no one asked them to quiet down. I would definitely come back here! Great decor, great service. Next time I'll just ask for a booth away from the hooligans. Lol"
