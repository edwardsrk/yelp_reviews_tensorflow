b"I decided to check out this place with a friend based off of a recommendation and i'm so glad I follow through with it! This is one of my new favorite spots. Totally worth the drive across town. Happy hour is from 5pm-6pm and the selection is great. We ordered the Calamari, Amberjake Ponzu Salsa w/ Sweet Potato Chips, Blue Crab Hush Puppies, and the Spicy Tuna TarTar w/ Waffle Fries. Everything was flavorful. Everything was delicious! Reasonable prices, delicious food, chill atmosphere and friendly employees. Cannot wait to go back!"
