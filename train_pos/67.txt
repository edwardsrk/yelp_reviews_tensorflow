b"I chose La Quinta over other pet friendly hotels because they don't charge an extra fee for them, and I had two little doggies!! So, plus, plus there!! Room rates very reasonable.  Room had no lingering smells of any sort, very clean.  Location for my needs, right on! Had complimentary breakfast, yum!  And free wifi.  So, really saved on a lot.  Staff was friendly.  Will recommend to others especially if travelling with pets!!Only 4 stars because the only night I had a chance to relax and enjoy pool, the pool was temporarily closed down til the next day when I check out! Boo!!!"
