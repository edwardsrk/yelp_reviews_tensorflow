b'Tasty food, solid drink selection, and great location in the heart of downtown Champaign. It\'s not on my "must-visit" list, but it\'s one of my regular options for lunch or night on the town. I\'d recommend the beer battered bacon cheeseburger. It\'s delicious and beyond indulgent.I\'m not a fan of their house brews, though. It seems like, regardless of style, most of them taste too much alike. I\'m just not a fan of the brewmaster\'s style.'
