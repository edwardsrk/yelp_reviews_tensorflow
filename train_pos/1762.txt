b"Hmm, it is what it is. It's an okay Mexican fast food joint with a decent selection. I consider the food bland, but you can doctor it up with the sauces on the side bar area. The food is cheap and made fresh on the spy, so it's a notch above taco bell. The place was clean even though I went at what consider a busy time (lunch). I'll come back the next time I want something fresh and cheap, but not because the flavors are great."
