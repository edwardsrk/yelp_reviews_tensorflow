b'Great big salads - make your own or choose from a list.  Made right in front of you and if you add meat, I think they grill it while you are waiting.  Very fresh!Now with their wine selection, and the way they dim the lights and place candles on the table - it makes it a great dinner/date place.The staff/service is very friendly, too.'
