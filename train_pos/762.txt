b'HUGE televisions, sports, gambling, and beer. What more could a guy ask for! The Mirage Sports Book is definitely a place to visit if you enjoy placing some bets on your favorite sports team. The atmosphere on a college football Saturday or NFL Sunday is electric. When a team scores or a big play happens, the place goes wild! It is a great atmosphere to enjoy watching numerous games at once!My only complaint is that in order to get a complementary drink ticket, there is a minimum of $500. For casual sports gamblers, this could be difficult to reach the minimum.'
