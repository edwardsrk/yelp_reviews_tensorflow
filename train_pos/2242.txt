b'Cajun fries with vinegar (dont judge me!!): GOOD!Burger with everything (including grilled mushrooms and onions) plus A-1 sauce: GOOD!Very nice staff: GREATHigh tech soda machines: AWESOME!People that compare to in & out: boo! Of course it\'s a bit more here...but I think it\'s worth it.. Or maybe I\'m just not an In & Out fan, sorry.I guess I only review places I really really like. FYI the "little" burgers are a single patty while the regular burgers are double... I didn\'t know that but the guy at the counter offered this info.'
