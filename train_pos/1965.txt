b"This is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas. Convenient parking. Clean and hip atmosphere. The service... It doesn't get any better! Superb!  Incredible attitude and genuine interest in pleasing the customer. Bacon, pancakes, coffee, eggs... Perfect!Quality food at affordable prices. Stuffed myself and ordered enough for 2 and the Bill was $15. BOOM! I want to come back and try some of the signature dishes, which I didn't know about when I arrived. I Didn't even look at the menu when I arrived... I just ordered."
