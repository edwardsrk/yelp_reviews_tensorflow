b'This place is outstanding!  I usually don\'t write reviews for chain restaurants and franchises, but this place was so good that I think people in Las Vegas should know about it.  At first, I thought this place would be like a Panera.  It serves the same types of food as Panera, but the quality is significantly superior.  I\'ve been here twice, and each time I got the Pick 2 option for $7.99.  This includes a full-size sandwich and a salad or soup.  I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich both times, and I had the vegetable soup on one occasion and the MangoBerry salad on the other.  All of these items were excellent.  the MangoBerry salad was the best salad I\'ve had in a long time.  It\'s actually a very healthy salad, but I felt like I was eating candy.  The soup was also really good.  They also have a very extensive soda selection, and additional flavors of syrup that you can squirt into your soda to give it unique tastes.  The complementary chocolate covered strawberry is also a very nice touch.  There\'s a very modern, clean feel to this restaurant.  They have a "recharge station" where you can plug in your laptop or cell phone.  It seems like the type of place where they wouldn\'t mind if you want to come and work on your laptop for a while.  The only reason I didn\'t give them five stars is because their employees are a little overly-friendly.  From the second you walk in to the place, there\'s a person holding the door open for you, and all too eager to tell you about what\'s on the menu and how to order.  Whoever owns this place would do well to tell the employees to back off just a little and give customers a chance to look up at their menu on their own and take it all in.This is definitely a great place with nice atmosphere and good food at great prices.  I\'ll come here again.'
