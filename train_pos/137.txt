b"I came right after the New Year for my birthday thinking that everyone was gone already... nope, the party's still going! I walked here during the day and thought it was okay. During the night? That's when our fun start!! The lights were just amazing and really had us pumped up!With shows, shops, casinos, and buffets all given to us on one long street, we had plenty of things to keep us busy. However, it does get pricy so I would definitely come when you have the cash to burn. Otherwise, you can just watch people gamble, attend free shows, and window shop."
