b"Clean, nicely decorated pizza place. The Margherita is simple and delicious. Ingredients look fresh and the service is friendly. Every time I go it's in the late afternoon so the place is pretty empty and the service is fast.  I would like to try the bruschetta... have only tried the pizza so far."
