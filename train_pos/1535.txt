b"Yes, I came to Noodles Ranch for a rushed lunch a few weeks back.  It was really good and I wished I had more time to spend here.I ordered the cashew chicken curry lunch special with a Thai iced coffee.  Everything wasgood, again I had to go to the counter and pay before they could even bring me the check, but I was impressed with this place and I'll gladly return!"
