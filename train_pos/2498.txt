b'Groupon brought us in, good food brings us back. Order one of their signature burgers, or build your own. We\'ve done both. The signature Blu Burger came exactly as described, and cooked to perfection (medium). The onion bun was fresh and the side of onion rings were great. To build your own, select your burger (beef, turkey, bison, chicken, veggie, salmon, Portobello....), select the bun (you can even get a lettuce wrap), cheese, toppings, sauces and any specialty ingredients (egg, guacamole, ham....). I highly recommend the Kobe beef; it was so flavorful and that will probably be a go-to selection in the future. Must say I\'m not overly impressed with the sweet potato fries, though. Hard to find good sweet potato fries it seems. They do offer salads and sandwiches, but if they have "burger" in their name, you should at least try a burger. And with all of the options, why wouldn\'t you?Family owned and operated - gotta love that! Fellow Yelpers, let\'s do our part to support family owned businesses! All in all, good food, nice staff. I recommend.'
