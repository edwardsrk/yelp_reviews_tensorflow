b"So this place is definitely unique and a great place when you really want to go out hardcore. Friday night they have great techno upstairs...it's $5 cover and the alcohol is dirt cheap.The only thing bad about this place is the lack of carding means there are quite a bit of under-agers, but it's still a good time."
