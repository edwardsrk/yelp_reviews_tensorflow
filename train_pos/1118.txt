b"I came here with my SO after I was done work around York U. It's right across the street basically on Keele. I finished work round 4, so it wasn't too busy. The staff here are very friendly and attentive!We ordered the dinner for two special which came with two vegetable spring rolls, chilli chicken (either gravy or dry style), beef and vegetables and chicken fried rice. We also ordered chicken pakora with our meal and everything was very reasonably priced. Portions are generous and we left really full."
