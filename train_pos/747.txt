b'The Trump is pretty rad.Pros: -Beautiful rooms with kitchenette, fridge, jacuzzi tub, 24 hour room service-Free shuttles to Wynn and Caesars palace that we never waited more than 5 minutes for-Fashion show mall across the street is awesome-Cheap for a five star hotel- "Free" wifi included in the resort fee- Quiet and smoke free-free 4pm checkout time if you call the desk! Loved this.Cons:-No casino for those who do care-pool is dead, go to Wynn for a real pool!-Cost us 6 bucks to use the business center Internet...-Limited restaurant choices ... I.e. there is like, one really expensive one-Since it is off the strip views are kind of weird in most rooms.The Trump is a great hotel for those looking for a luxury experience without a big price tag. We spent most of our time at the Wynn /encore anyway so the shuttle was perfect. Would recommend for sure especially cause I don\'t really gamble. Not gonna lie pool was disappointing though! Oh well..'
