b"We went here for my bachelor party. I wasn't drunk when I ate, so I can say that I'm able to write an honest review.I ordered the dry aged NY sirloin. The portions are huge, and it was cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's porterhouse, and that was even larger, but well cooked. We ordered some sides, including mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mac & cheese. Overall, service was really good as well.If you want to finish your steak comfortably, I recommend skipping the bread they give you at the beginning.By the way, we ate in the other room, and it was all guys - not a single girl in the room. I wonder if that's the all guys' party room."
