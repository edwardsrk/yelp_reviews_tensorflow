b"We came here for dinner last night looking for a healthier option compared to our usual restaurant meals. For around $15 each you can get a main meat option and two sides. We got the chicken adobo, miso eggplant, roasted sweet potato and the turkey meatballs, eggplant, and potato salad. The chicken adobo was really, really good! It's a new item on their menu. We also loved all the sides we got (particularly the eggplant). The turkey meatballs weren't my favourite - they're spiced in a certain way that I didn't quite like and when the dish came out the meatballs themselves were no longer warm.They have a really nice summer patio in the shade of a large arching alley way and they had cute lights set up which made it a great place to eat. And on Monday nights they offer a bottle of wine for $20!I've heard that the portions when eating out are a bit smaller so it's better to eat in if you can. My friend also comes here regularly and suggests the beef brisket sandwich. I'll definitely come back to try it!"
