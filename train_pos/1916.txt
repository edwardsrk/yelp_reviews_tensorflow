b'Tons of squeeky cheese curds on oversized poutine... Share 1. hot dogs were under a dollar so how judgy do you want me to be...they are not sabretts or nathans or hebrew national but they are not gross. Burger was good not too much bun like some places do. We had 1 giant potine, 2 cheese burgers, 2 hot dogs, 1 hamburger and 1 soda for $30 Canadian. Cant beat that.'
