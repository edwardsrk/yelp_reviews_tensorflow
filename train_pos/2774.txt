b"This place is a standout in the middle of Chinatown; it really belongs Downtown. Hip, casual ambiance. Friendly service. We ordered the oysters, steak tartare, Japanese sweet potato, pigs ear, charcuterie board, scallops, short rib, and duck. Everything was above & beyond delicious, but we could've done without the pigs ear. It was described as if it was layered and each piece was crispy like chicharron. Instead, it was served as one ball of breaded pig's ear. So the breading fell away and we were left with just cartilage.Main reason that this was not a 5-star Experience was the pace of service, which was oddly slow. We received one dish at a time with uncomfortably long wait times in between."
