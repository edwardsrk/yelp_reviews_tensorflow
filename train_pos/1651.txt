b"It's not the best pizza ever, not the best in the Strip. For the best pizza I would probably go to Grimaldi's at the venetian. But this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the Aria. For a quick bite, it gets the job done. You won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the Aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes."
