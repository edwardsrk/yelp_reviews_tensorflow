b"This place is great! An excellent selection of dim sum dishes. Fresh! Noisy because busy. Good value.One of the best dim sum experiences I've ever had. The atmosphere is fairly standard but dim sum restos that I've been in aren't really big on that anyway. I found the staff helpful, you might have to flag them down to get their attention but once you have it they are quick to sort out your questions/requests. Definitely worth a visit."
