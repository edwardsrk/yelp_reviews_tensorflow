b"Talk about a hot spot, this place sure is on the rise. Beautifully decorated restaurant and full of life, with a very accommodating wait staff to boot. Was attracted to the unique menu offerings, like crab stuffed chicken, which was great by the way. Make a reservation, or you'll be eating elsewhere lol"
