b"I decided to try this place based on the reviews. I had an appointment at 2 and had to wait until 2:30 to start which is fine because my nails ended up looking good. I was probably in the salon for 2 hrs and all I got was an acrylic fill so it felt a little slow. Also, it cost $50 which was more than I normally pay for that service. In the end, I love my nails but don't think I'll be back because I've been to other salons in Scottsdale that I like a little better."
