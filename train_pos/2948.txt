b"If you're strolling the streets of the Grand Canal at the Venetian, then you need gelato. This is the place in Vegas to get gelato. It's the perfect space to stop, rest and have a treat.I was impressed by the selection. I'm picky about gelato. I actually prefer the sorbetto and this place had a good selection of both. I got cherry and pear sorbetto and it was delicious. It had so much flavor.Sure, this place is ridiculously expensive, but what isn't in Vegas? But you're on vacation so stop and have some great gelato under the clouds of the Piazza San Marco."
