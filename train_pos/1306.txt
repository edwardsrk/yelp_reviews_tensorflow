b"I came in for a quick lunch on Tuesday and really enjoyed it. I had the chicken souvlaki pita with a side of chipotle hummus. It said the lunch special came with fries, but they didn't charge me to switch it out, which was nice. The pita was great-- fresh pita, moist chicken, perfect amount of sauce. The hummus was also very good and you get a ton of it, along with pita bread. Unfortunately, although I like it, the chipotle flavor didn't go with the chicken souvlaki. I think next time I would sub a salad."
