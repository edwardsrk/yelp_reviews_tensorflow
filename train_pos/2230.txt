b'We were hesitant to try Hemispheres after reading the Yelp reviews, but our laziness got the better of us (we\'re staying at the Sheraton) so we ate dinner there (Saturday night, 7:45 PM). There were only 3 other tables populated, so it was nice and quiet. The menu is new as of this month (perhaps less extensive than described in reviews below) and has a section for locally-sourced foods. I had the Lake Erie Wahoo over risotto and my wife had the chopped chicken salad. My dinner was excellent - the large portion of fish was cooked properly and tasted fresh, the risotto was rich but not overpowering, and the broccolini was not overcooked--5 stars. My wife\'s salad was okay - multiple greens but more romaine than others, and the romaine looked and tasted like it has been in the refrigerator too long. It was probably just too cold, because by the time she was half-way through, it was significantly better, but the salad was "average."For dessert I had their house-made Peanut Butter Cheesecake, which was a generous slice, not bland but not so rich I felt bad finishing it. My wife, who has many food intolerances, saw nothing on the dessert menu she could eat, so our waitress suggested a bowl of cut-up fruit which was fresh and good. Our waitress was very nice, attentive, and helpful and improved the experience. Were we in the Cleveland Airport area again, we\'d be comfortable eating at Hemispheres.'
