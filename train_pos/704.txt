b"Great little breakfast spot in the Stratosphere. Good service and good food. I had the caprese benedict that had fresh tomato, mozzarella and a pesto hollendaise that was amazing. Comes with hash browns and strawberries. Just yummy.Hubby has a breakfast that included eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, hashbrowns and toast.. .a carnivores delight. He said his was good as well.  I'll go back."
