b"Better than your usual dive casino cafe. Went to AZ Charlie's for the first time just to check out their prime rib and it did not disappoint. First of all: set your expectations right. AZ Charlie is a dive casino on Decatur. For $13, the 12oz prime rib was probably 85% as good as Lawry's. The sides were standard diner fare, so don't get your hopes up on that. Negatives: be prepared to smell like an ashtray coming out of this place."
