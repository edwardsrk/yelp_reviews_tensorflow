b"Food Quality: 5/5Parking: 4/5Service: 4/5Kitchen Speed: 4/5Wait Time: 1/5The food is great at Olive Garden.  All you can eat salad, and fantastic pasta dishes.  Try the Seafood Portofino!  The down side of Olive Garden in Calgary is that there is only 1 location and they don't take reservations.  That means that unless you go really early, or really late, you'll be waiting in the lobby like a knob for an hour or more.Once you get in, the service staff are quick to take your order and on a good night, the kitchen has your order done quickly and correctly.  On a bad night, it may take half an hour or more to get your dishes out to your table.  You'll love them when you do get them though.For the entrepreneurs out there, think about putting a burger stand in the parking lot, the people waiting will make you a millionaire!  Seriously Olive Garden, just open another location in the south!"
