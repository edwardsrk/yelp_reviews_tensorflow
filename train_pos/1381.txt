b"Every time I do a search on Yelp for fish, Pete's pops up but I've always just passed it by. Today I actually decided to stop by and see what it was all about. I can see why one could pass it by, it's just off Central with no flashy gimmicks and no drive thru. I was lucky that the rain stopped long enough for me to get out of my car without getting drenched. I didn't know they only took cash and with only $7 in my pocket I came unprepared. I decided to order the 3 piece Fish and Chips for $5.35. I can barely finish the second piece of fish but this sauce is amazing. I will definitely call ahead with a large order of Oysters, Shrimp and Crabettes!"
