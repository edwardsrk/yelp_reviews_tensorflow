b'Pretty good Chinese food. We had a variety of old traditional Cantonese dishes and they were great. $160CAN included tax and tip for lobster, Chinese broccoli, pork with salted fish, greens with pork, tofu, flat noodles with beef and black beans sauce, oxtail clay pot and the house soup and rice. Perfect for 7 of us. Good down home cooking!'
