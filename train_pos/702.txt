b'This is the best sushi I\'ve ever enjoyed. Although the wait for s table on Saturday night was close to half an hour and akin to waiting to get into a club, the impressive menu, super friendly staff, and phenomenal food was well worth the wait. The sake selection is impressive, as are Ru San\'s specialty rolls. For those who enjoy nigiri, an equally impressive selection is available, at a reasonable price, and is very high quality. Pricing is actually less expensive than many "wannabe" sushi places. I\'d give Ru San\'s five stars if they could work out their wait list and waiting area issues.'
