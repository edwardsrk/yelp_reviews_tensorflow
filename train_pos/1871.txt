b'I always enjoy shopping here because for me this place is a time machine to when I was a child and I came to this very location to shop with my mother. Being of European heritage we found a lot of our ethnic foods here, brands we recognized from back home in our Native Spain. My favourite part of the store is the coffee isle, I love the smell of the different coffees. Plus I get to grind them to my liking, I know that its probably not a big deal as all stores allow you to do this, however, as a coffee lover this is big to me. This location much like all the others are very clean, lots of good produce and what I like the most is that the bananas are always yellow, being part monkey I love bananas but only when they are yellow!'
