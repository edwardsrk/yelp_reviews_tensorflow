b'This place is one of the few that I have been to that serves great ramen, along with other amazing menu items.  I had a chicken ramen, with lemon grass broth, the flavor was amazing!  My most recent visit I was accompanied by a friend who happens to be vegetarian, their menu had more than enough options for him which was great!  They also off Gluten-free options. Will definitely continue to stop by!'
