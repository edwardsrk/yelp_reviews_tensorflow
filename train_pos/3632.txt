b"Just under 50 million visitors a year to Las Vegas, and so many of them no nothing about Red Rock Canyon! Granted you'll need a car, but about 20 minutes off the strip you'll find what nature can provide that Steve Wynn can't! Natural beauty that leaves you staring in wonder and listening for....nothing! It's deathly quiet out in the desert and especially so out at Red Rock! Beautiful red rock formations for the experienced hikers to even the casual novice! More importantly it's just breathtakingly beautiful and well worth stepping away from the Blackjack table for a afternoon! This southern gentleman does every time he's in Vegas!"
