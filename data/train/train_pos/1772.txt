b"this place has a great vibe. i love how cozy and hip it feels at the same time. my house-made granola with almond milk was yummy and my husband said his egg, cheese,  and bacon breakfast sandwich was delicious. i also got the karme latte and my husband got the mocha. i thought it was strange that they only do one size on the espresso drinks but i can see why considering the cute mugs they use. the only caveat is the menu is very limited and it doesn't say that soy or almond milk is available even though they offer both. it'd be nice to see those options listed on the menu."
