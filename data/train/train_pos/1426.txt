b"Was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  I'm not typically a fan of downtown Vegas for dinner but was really glad we tried this spot.  The ahi appetizer was delicious.  The tuna was fresh and the accompanying sauces were a perfect match.  I had the sea bass and risotto as my entree.  Cooked perfectly.  The orange vinaigrette, cranberries and apples garnishing the sea bass provided the perfect combo of sweet and savory.  Something I was not expecting.  We also enjoyed a signature chocolate lava cake. It takes 30 minutes to prepare so order early. Decadent but the red wine recommended by our waiter helped to make it the perfect end to dinner."
