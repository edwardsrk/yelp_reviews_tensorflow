b"TLDR: A pintrester's dream restaurant that serves simple but delicious food.First, if you can you have to sit on their beautiful terrace. It is colourful, fresh and a laptop free zone. Enjoy the koi pond and the greenery as you eat light and refreshing food. The first time I ever went on a Saturday evening, we also enjoyed live music from a fun little indie group.Their sandwiches are big, and they offer you the choice to substitute half your sandwich with a soup. I ordered the CBLT as I am a huge fan of coconut bacon, and substituted half my sandwich with a sweet potato and almond butter soup. The soup was velvety smooth and tasty. The sandwich came with a little bit of salad and was delightful. Cafe Santropol is definitely my top pick for when I'm craving a sandwich.Definitely, a restaurant you should visit in the summer and a great place for food date."
