b"This is a great little breakfast/lunch spot off the beaten path.  Gets a little busy if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, so plan accordingly.  They have a good selection of items and the service is always friendly.  Definitely give it a try if you're looking for a good, hearty breakfast."
