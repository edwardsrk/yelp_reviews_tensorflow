b'We came here with a bunch a friends and had a real good time. Service was great as they were able to accommodate 8 of us with no problem.The food was just as good. I had the shrimp skewer dinner which was really good and just what I expected. We also had 3 pinchers of margaritas too. Gotta have my margaritas lol.  No one in my group had any issues and we had an overall good time. This place is definitely recommended!!'
