b'You are greeted immediately upon walking in!  The hostess/server was kind and inviting.  You feel very welcome here, and the atmosphere is clean. The food is good and the yelp 30 for 15 is awesome!  Just know that kids eat free Monday thru Friday unless you use the yelp coupon.Overall a good place with excellent customer service! :)'
