b"There's just not much that can go wrong with deep fried chicken! The meat fell apart so easily, and it was so tender and juicy. The outside was really flavorful and crunchy, and the chicken was extremely hot, fresh out of the fryer. DAT SAUCE THO! Dip it, drizzle it, drench it, bath it, slurp it, lick it, either way it's D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.Texas Toast! I was thinking that this would be like french toast when I heard about it, but it's more like a really yummy dinner roll. Coming back to Raising Cane's again."
