b"Thanks for our wonderful CM for organizing a CMYE at Pazan. If not I never would have  experience the hospitality of the lovely owners and I wouldn't have know my work of art can look so awesome with a 3D glasses!Marcelo is just so charming and sweet! Just look around the gallery you would see his wonderful work of arts. Full of life and vibrant colours and definitely inspiring! Thanks for the special opportunity for a few yelpers to able to create/draw under Marcelo's guidance: our own piece of 3D painting! He shown us different techniques, giving us suggestions and I just love everyone' s paintings after this little hand on workshop!Of course, you can also purchase the lovely paintings in the gallery or even bring in your own to get it framed!!Drop by Pazan Gallery if you are in the neighborhood!
