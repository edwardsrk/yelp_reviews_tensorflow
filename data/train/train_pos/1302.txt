b"I love the food in New Orleans, so I was looking forward to trying this place out. The staff was very friendly, and great with answering any questions. I ordered a lot of food, but I wanted to try a lot  of items. I had the Crawfish Chowder, Red Beans and Rice, Jambalaya, and some free Hush Puppies for checking in on Yelp. The crawfish chowder was good, with a bit of a black pepper kick, which I liked. I'd probably enjoy eating this more when it isn't 110 degrees outside....haha. The red beans and rice was ok, but I was a little disappointed. I love red beans and rice, so I supposed I expected too much. The jambalaya was good, but I was hoping it would be a little better. It was quite tasty, though. The hush puppies were really good. I don't think I was expecting them to be as good as they were. I liked the food, but if you're looking for something comparable to food in New Orleans, I don't think this is the place. It would be better to come here without those expectations. I did enjoy my experience, and I did enjoy the food. If I'm ever in this part of town, I wouldn't have a problem stopping by again."
