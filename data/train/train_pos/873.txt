b'We recently went to Burgatory and it was amazing.  I made my own burger creation which included the following:Hormone Free Beef, Brioche bun, Sweet Onion Rub, Buffalo Cheddar, Habanero Jelly Sauce, Baby Spinach, Organic Field Greens, Arugula and Sliced Tomato with free chips on the side. And I love it!!! Most delicious burger ever!!! There was a sweet taste with a spicy sensation. Very unique taste! Also our server was friendly and helpful; however, the service was a bit slow since it was very busy and packed. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to try this place out.'
