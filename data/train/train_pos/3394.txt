b"This is the best restaurant under $30 per plate in Champaign-Urbana, and it's the best food in that price range that I've had in extensive traveling in downstate Illinois. It's nationally recognized for quality, and it shows in every aspect of their food. The barbecue is flavorful but never dry. The sauces are varied and incredibly tasty. Their sides are delicious. Their sweet tea is to die for. They have a great selection of craft beers. The only problem is the wait - they're such a popular destination that you'll frequently have to wait 15-20 minutes (or more) for a table at peak mealtimes, But with their new Champaign location starting to kick off, that might start to get better. If you're just passing through and only have time for one meal in Champaign-Urbana, do yourself a favor and make it Black Dog."
