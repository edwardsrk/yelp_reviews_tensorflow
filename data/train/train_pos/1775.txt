b'$27.99/person weekday. One of the better AYCE in the area.- Good stuff: tataki, sashimi (especially the stuff on weekends only), beef skewers, mango roll, golden shrimp, salmon roses, sirloin steak, mango yogurt- Torched sushi - OK (not outstanding) - Pressed sushi - meh (rice too soft and warm, fish to rice ratio not good)- Sashimi - Good (fresh but thickness of slices are inconsistent)- Better selection of cooked food than other AYCE- Cold soba noodles is neat to try but taste-wise was OK- Desserts are average tasting but a wider selection than other AYCE (except their mango yogurt which is outstanding compared to others)On average, the service was good but some stuff came out slower than others. Can get very busy. Will continue visiting Matsuda :)'
