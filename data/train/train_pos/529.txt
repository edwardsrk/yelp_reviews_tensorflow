b'While I don\'t have a green thumb, I very much enjoy having low-maintenance plants around the house. It\'s nice to be able to walk into a bonafide garden centre and proclaim, "I just want a plant that\'s hard to kill," without the judgment! I\'ve consistently found that the staff are helpful and courteous. What\'s best is that they stand by their plants with a 3 month satisfaction guarantee!'
