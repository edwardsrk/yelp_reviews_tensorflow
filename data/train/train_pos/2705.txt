b"This was my first time here with one of my friend here. We were truly amazed at how authentic the food was. Do yourself a favor and get the grape leaves! Excellent option for just a meal! We could not stop raving about how fantastic they were! The gyros are fantastic as well, and the baklava is phenomenal, I say this because I don't even like sweets. I took a little bite of the one that I got to go, and nearly lost my mind. It should really be a crime to make something that good! I have def found a new local favorite spot in CLT. I will def be frequenting this place weekly!"
