b'Been here many times! Friendly, helpful staff, Never had a bad experience. Clean place, comfortable seats, popcorn & nacho chips are always fresh +++++ . Rooms here are smaller than other theaters, which is why you probably should arrive 1 hour + early if you are watching a new release! Hint *** Before you ask for your tickets Buy a $25.00 gift card and receive a free medium size popcorn voucher(You can pay the difference to upgrade for larger size at the concesi\xc3\xb3n stand)  use it to pay for your tickets/snacks. Keep it and Reloaded it over & Over! :)'
