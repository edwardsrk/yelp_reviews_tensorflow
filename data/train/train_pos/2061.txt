b"We wandered in because I was looking for breakfast & I had driven by lots of times, but with all the construction in the area found it difficult to find a parking, thankfully, I found one. Not only were we greeted warmly, our server was friendly & seemed to genuinely like what he was doing. I find that so refreshing as working in the food industry can be overlooked. I find this kind of work is extremely difficult & have mad respect for those who choose to work in it. Now to the food... absolutely delicious. I had a breakfast bowl and my date had a burrito. The coffee was fresh & delicious. If you like strawberry lemonade definitely try theirs. It's made fresh to order and almost like a dessert. They serve wine & beer as well. The atmosphere is open, relaxing & can't wait till the weather cools, to be able to relax sit outside & enjoy more of their delicious food, which I am looking forward to. Only bad thing, as with most downtown areas, parking can be difficult at times.   Once construction is done I'm sure will get better."
