b"We had a great experience leasing a new Equinox at Henderson, Chevrolet. Joe Gallagher spoke to my husband after we made an internet inquiry. They came to terms on the phone, and Mr. Gallagher was true to his word. We went there, secured the lease, and drove away in our new car in just over an hour. That set a new record in efficiency, at a car dealership, for us. We appreciated Mr. Gallagher's attention to detail and making the transaction process a pleasant experience."
