b"Not sure everyone feels about going to a Dealership to get their car fixed, but I've been a VW owner for almost a decade (which - don't say it, leaves me feeling pretty old!)  Nevertheless, I had an awesome experience today, and have to give Loretta and the rest of the service team a shout out.  They are really amazing - they provide great recommendations and timelines for when the work should be done (not gounging, particularly for a dealership).  They are truly great, and make me feel less bad about spending my hard-earned cash, on my well-loved car, keeping it well maintained and trouble-free."
