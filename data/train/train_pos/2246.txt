b"With all my favorite places in SouthEnd disappearing, I welcome an ABC store that I can walk to.This location isn't the largest store, but it should have what you need.Lots of windows seem to let a lot of light in and all the liquors are organized by type.  Large NC local selection of spirits here.Convenient parking lot, but also super walkable from the light rail and all the apartments that are being built all around SouthEnd"
