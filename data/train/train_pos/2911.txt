b"Don't come here if you need do buy DRANOOr something for your kid, like Lego or PLAYDOUGHOr if you're from Dallas (or Mesquite or PLANO)But if you want yummy pastries, get down to SPANOWHAT.Owned by Jessie Spano, from Saved By The Bell. If you Nomi, then you know I feel very Malone in the world.Pretty awesome old style European bakery in the heart of the West Side Market in Cleveland. Service wasn't great and I had to wait quite a few minutes for the person to come back. But that's okay because I managed to give Piccadilly's Ice Cream a try while I was waiting. Once the worker did come back, she acted like she didn't like me very much... but her pastries were pretty good, so I have no reservations in awarding four stars to this cheap and delicious little Bakery."
