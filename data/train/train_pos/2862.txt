b"Stopped by on Christmas Eve and the gym was pretty much empty aside from a few people on the cardio machines and a few in the weights area. The gym seems a bit out of date and I noticed a few broken cardio machines. My boyfriend & I only came here to get a quick workout sessions with the weights what we didn't really like was the fact that there was only one power rack and one squat rack. Both happen to be taken so we were working out nearby waiting for one to finally free up. Aside from that it has everything you would need to get your workout done. Workers here were really friendly, greeted & said bye to us. Wouldn't mind coming back in the future if we were in the area."
