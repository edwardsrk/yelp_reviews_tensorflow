b"Visited Soho once for dinner awhile back but this was my first time going for brunch. We arrived around 11:30, which is early for brunch time, and were seated immediately. We ordered two breakfast cocktails that I cannot remember the names of. Mine was tequila (I know it's breakfast) and citrus juices and was very tasty. My boyfriend got some whiskey and coffee concoction which he said was delicious albeit pretty strong. Before your meal arrives they bring out warm biscuits with Apple butter and Rosemary butter, which I think is a thoughtful, homey touch. For our meals we ordered the breakfast skillet and the chicken and waffles and both were great. The house hot sauce they put on the table was a great addition to my skillet, spicy and tangy, but not overly hot. We also got a side of the bacon, which was four large thick cut and glazed pieces of deliciousness. Overall, a great meal. There's a lot of brunch competition in Ohio City with many great contenders, but I will definitely come back to Soho again!"
