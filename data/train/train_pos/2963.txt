b'Came here today and had the "Surf and Turf" Pho. It was the lobster + ribeye slices. The broth was very good, a little on the sweeter side. The lobster had some sizable pieces including the claw and the ribeye was of higher quality. The only drawback to the "Surf and Turf" pho was that they do not give you as much noodle and it was fairly expensive. It came out to a whopping $33. I would say that you should either try the "Maine Lobster Pho" or "Surf and Turf Pho" at least once, but its probably something that I would only get once. They seemed to have a decent collection of whiskey here. I was surprised that they had the Yamazaki Japanese Whiskey which is a definite plus.'
