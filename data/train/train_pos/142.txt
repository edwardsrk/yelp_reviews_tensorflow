b"This is one of my favourite places to brunch in the East End. I was a bit surprised at my last visit because the prices went up on the menu. That's what made me put a 4 stars instead of a 5, because I would recommend this place ! It used to be very affordable (it still is!!) for very generous portions. For an example, I have a hard time finished the whole serving of benedict eggs by myself. I love their potatoes / crispy !The staff is always nice. In the summer you can eat outside. You should get there before 10h on the week-ends, it gets busy quickly.Easy parking around."
