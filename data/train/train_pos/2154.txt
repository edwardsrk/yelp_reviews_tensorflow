b"Marina and her team are always very pleasant with me.  She always keeps me entertained with stories and more importantly, does a great job on mani and pedi.  As a male client, I've often felt uncomfortable, awkward or treated poorly at other salons but here I feel very comfortable and relaxed.  I'm really glad I found this place as it is - refreshingly-  not like most of the other salons in the valley.  I also like the fact the salon is very clean."
