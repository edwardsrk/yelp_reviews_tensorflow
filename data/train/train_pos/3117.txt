b"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. We always start with their wontons which are some of the best I've ever had and then get the red curry. The food tastes amazing and you can tell the vegetables are fresh. We have also had their BBQ chicken which is reminds me more of a curry chicken but is good nonetheless."
