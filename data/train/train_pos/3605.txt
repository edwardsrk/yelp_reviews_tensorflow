b'Sad to hear that this place has possibly closed for good. Awesome little hole in the wall shaved ice joint. My favorite flavor is tiger blood and banana. This place was great during my summer pregnancy last year! The owner is friendly and seems to love what he does! You absolutely cannot not beat the prices! Try adding a scoop of ice cream in you next shaved ice!'
