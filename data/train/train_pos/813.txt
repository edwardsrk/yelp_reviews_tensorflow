b"Went there for my first winterlicious dinner of 2014. We had a large group, and restaurant handled it very well, service was efficient and prompt, and a waitress was a wonderful young lady who alone handled such a big group with outmost efficiency and speed. As an appetizer I ordered Caserole d'escargot which was in my opinion a highlight of the night. Mushrooms, escargot, and cream based sauce complemented each other well to create a perfectly balanced dish. Totally a must try!As the main course I ordered a grilled angus striploin steak, prepared medium rare close to the rare side and served with perfectly grilled vegetables. The steak was a little chewy but it must have been just a piece like that because it was perfectly prepared. Sun dried tomato and butter topping gave a steak a wonderful touch. As a desert I orderes Creme Brulee which was tasty, but surprisingly cold, which was slightly disappointing. Overall,  a very good experience,  and the whole 3 course dinner for only $25 per person was a true bargain.  Would definitely come back again! P.S. this place is more suitable for a small group of people or as a date venue. It's very small, cozy,  and romantic."
