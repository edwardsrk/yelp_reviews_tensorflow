b'These guys are amazing.  Great use of time.  Amazingly friendly people.They use all of the latest technology and really get your teeth crazy clean.  As some of the other reviewers stated, some of the newer "deep cleaning" services are a little on the pricey side (few hundred dollars) -- but, this not your grand dad\'s cleaning -- I mean, when I was a kid we went to the dentist, got a little scrape and a polish and on you went.  If you get one of the deep cleaning they do a *lot* more to get your clean, namely using a ultra sonic water scaler, scrapping, then using a laser to kill ever more bacteria, then they inject an anti-biotic into your gums etc.  The upshot: your mouth feels amazing clean, fresh and just *happy* afterward.  Do it, the next day you will feel great, and its well worth a few extra dollars to get cleaned right. I recommend them to all my friends... and you!'
