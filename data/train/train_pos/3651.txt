b'My friend and I went to eat lunch last weekend and I was amazed to taste such fresh and traditional Thai food.  Flavors were excellent and food cooked to perfection.  Their was a very sweet Thai lady serving us.  She was extremely attentive and asked us several times if the flavor and spices were okay.  I give this restaurant a 5 star because it was truly a perfect experience!'
