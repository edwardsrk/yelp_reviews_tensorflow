b"Wow! Don't judge a book by it's cover! Although Original Gyro looks like a hole in the wall that would serve poor quality cheap food, I assure you it is quite the opposite. Per hubby's request, we stopped at the OG on our way home the other night for some quick take out.  For $8 each we got a meal with our choice of protein, pita and two sides. I chose the chicken with fries and a salad while hubs got the pork kabob (forget the official name) with rice and a salad. We watched as the cook cut the potatoes and cook my fries on the spot! Delic! My only criticism is that they were is desperate need of salt. The salad was huge with large chunks of cucumbers, tomatoes, olives and feta. The vinegarette was tasty but a bit sweet for my liking. My chicken was spot on. So much so that my husband quickly gobbled down my leftovers before I could save them for tomorrow's lunch. All in all, good food, great quality and huge portions. I'm a fan!"
