b'My boyfriend and I came in here for the first time for dinner. I had Lasagna and my boyfriend had the waiter by the name of Jared build him a pizza it was very good and we had chicken wings. The restaurant was very clean but it felt a little warm in here. I would recommend this place to my friends. We will be back to try their chicken.'
