b"Wow! I called this company based on these positive reviews and I was not disappointed. It was the first time in ten years of homeownership that I had to call an electrician. Grateful I haven't needed one before, but pleased with the service!I called on a Friday, mid afternoon. I spoke with Andrea and let her know we were having an unknown issue with something in the pool area. I asked for Saturday service, but she said the next two Saturdays were booked. I was ready to scoot off the phone, but she then asked if the next hour would be a good time for the servicemen to come out. I was stunned that they were able to come out so promptly and diagnose the issue. It luckily turned out to be a minor issue and the cost was less than $150.00. They didn't charge a rush fee, didn't try to upsell, got to business and got the issue resolved. Dennis and crew were professional and efficient. Our pool pump had been inoperable for months. We were having out of town guests in and didn't want them to see our discolored water and stagnant pool, but problem solved. Our guest also complimented the pool. Yaay.Thank you very much!"
