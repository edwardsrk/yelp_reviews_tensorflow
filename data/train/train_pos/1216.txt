b"Really 3.5I think came here in an off night.First I wanted the beautiful tacos I see in the photos  on Yelp.  The menu I had only had one taco on it.  When I asked the waiter.  He told me that was the only menu they had.  I then ordered the fried burrito and it looked amazing!!! However the burrito tasted pretty bad.I don't think I'll be coming back here."
