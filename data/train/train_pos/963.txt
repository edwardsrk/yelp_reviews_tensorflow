b'After seeing Hash House A Go Go on a Food Network show, my hubby wanted to go for the famous chicken and waffles for Sunday brunch. We arrived around 10:40 and were immediately seated Ina large booth in the corner. Our friendly server came over right away and took drinks orders while explaining a few particularly popular many items. Items chosen; chicken waffles (he loved it), apple-cinnamon pancake (yummy and seriously the size of a medium pizza!), kids hamburger (huge, said to be a little oily tasting), and egg white scramble with avocado and sweet potato fries (good). While the portions are easily large enough for 2 people to share, one will not be disappointed if comfort foods is your hankering.'
