b'Pretty tasty!  We ordered the Pork and Shrimp Dumplings, Beef Bejing Pancake, and Beef Chow Mein.  I\'m not a fan of seafood, but I did try the dumplings.  They were really "shrimpy"  which I guess is the point.  LOL.  The Beef Bejing Pancake was interesting.  It kind of looked like a burritio that was cut into slices.  The outside was crisp and the inside was very flavorful.  There was something cold inside of it.  I didn\'t take it apart to see what it was, but it kind of threw me off.  It wasn\'t bad, just different.  I still ate it.  The Beef Chow Mein was great and it was enough for me and hubby to share.  I also had Shanghi Wave (drink)?  I think that was the name of it.  Soooo good.  We will definatley be back.'
