b"Finding Italian worth eating in north west phoenix is not exactly easy - there are very few spots that offer good quality Italian food - i will say This place is one of them! I found this place through a best friend of mine and now frequent the establishment often. I love love love there pasta! Its cooked to perfection and there sauces are spot on! Pasta Giovanni is a fave but i also love the Alfredo and there pesto Alfredo - all of there sauces are on point! There is also Pizza and all the classic favs like lasagna and eggplant parm! They have great appetizers like Italian fried cheese and Calamari - believe it or not there fries are amazing!!!! Ever try fries with red sauce or pesto aoli ?  You should :))) they have killer huge salads as well - i love the tuna salad :) The service is awesome! Im a bar girl so i never sit in the dining room but the bar service is on point! Especially when Suzy is on Shift - she is friendly and funny and always glad you came :) not to mention how she cares about the little things like Halloween Napkins - that made my day brighter! Oh yeah! If your into clam chowder they serve it Fridays made from scratch and it is the BEST in the Valley! Why 4 stars and not 5... Well i don't like there bread. The bread tastes cheap and preservative like - its just not good. I would love if they stepped there game up and tried a better Italian or french bread - i would eat sandwiches then - which they offer quite a few of but the bread is so bad i will not do it as of now. Overall its awesome - and i love it here!!! :)))"
