b"I'm really new to all this, but always like to try new things.  Makes life more exciting. But I digress...Went with a friend and we both ordered Thai Curry, which consists of veggies and tofu in the curry paste I believe.  I was in the mood for rice noodles and had that added and replaced the tofu with textured vegetable protein (TVP), along with extra spicy.  Like, hot hot. :) The TVP takes some getting used to.  For me personally, I liked it at the beginning but not as much at the end.  It was very different for me but the dish itself was yummy and had a light curry flavour.  Fresh peppers, onion, cabbage, etc.  The spicy was light for my taste.  It might have been the fact that I asked for them to add more stuff to the dish to make it spicy, but it kept leaking over the side onto the table.  Had to keep mopping it up with a napkin.  For dessert I ordered vanilla bean ice cream made from coconut milk. Couldn't go without a double chocolate chip vegan cookie.  Kind of funny but I envisioned the ice cream sitting on top of the cookie and never mentioned it, but that's how it was brought to the table.  Crazy.  Like they read my mind.  Staff were really friendly and attentive as well.  Cute little place to visit."
