b"I saw Big Jim's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Went there when in Pittsburgh with my son visiting Pitt, had a great lunch. My son went to Pitt and I have been back several times. The food is very good, large servings and reasonably priced. This place will surprise you. It is off the beaten path. You have to be looking for it because it is below the highway in a neighborhood that leads nowhere to my knowledge. It is unattractive at best but the service is good, food is very good, fresh, plentiful and very reasonable. If you like good food, funky places and you are not a snob stop in and give it a try."
