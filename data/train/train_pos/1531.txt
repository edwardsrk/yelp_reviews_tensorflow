b'Every once in a while I crave a Gyro and when I do, this is my place!  The tortilla is so soft and yummy and the beef-lamb is so tender and flavored just perfect!  The family meal deal is great as are the kids meals which are half a gyro with a side of fries and a drink.  Great place for a gyro!  The Baklava is amazing and a very good portion, best for sharing!'
