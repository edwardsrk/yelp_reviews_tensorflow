b'Great state park, only downside is that they charge $3 or $5 for folks who dont live in the county on weekends thru mid-spring to fall...we go daily to walk dogs on the 1.4 paved circle around the park, plenty of nature to be seen, lots of "inlets" for grilling & picnic-ing...uou can rent the clubhouse area for functions or weddings...it is almost all on Lake Norman, to note-no public swimming'
