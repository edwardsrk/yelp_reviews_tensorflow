b'I have been here about four times for lunch over the last two years and each time it has been consistently good. I am not a Mexican food aficionado but it definitely seems different than the usual Tex-Mex a la Laredos.  On my last visit two weeks ago, I had the 7.95 grilled steak lunch special.  Rice and beans accompanied a nice grilled piece of flank steak covered with a deep dark mole sauce hinting of chocolate. Subtle + simple = sophisticated.  Nice. Tasty and fresh guacamole too and homemade tortilla chips!  It is not a large restaurant and some would say it is a little cramped. I call it cozy and serene.'
