b"I was referred to this location because a casual friend knows Jacob.  He was very helpful, explained how warranties & service agreement work.  He even thought of things I didn't even think about while seeking a new refrigerator.  I feel like I'm getting the best fridge for the money.  I even referred my mother-in-law to him.  Neither of us live on this side of town but trust is worth the drive."
