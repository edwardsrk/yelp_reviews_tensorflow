b"Being from Arizona and working in Southern California I grew up eating Jack in the Box.  Too bad Virginia doesn't have them!  Anyway, I already knew some cities in North Carolina have my favorite fast food restaurant!  So, I purposely planned my road trip route just to get my Jack in the Box fix!  Ordered a couple of Meat Lovers breakfast burrito's (with no egg, of course) and a good ol' Jumbo Jack with cheese.  Customer service was great and so was the food!  More details coming soon!"
