b"Been coming to this Resort since it was the La Posada in the 80s. They have completely  rebuilt and revamped the entire property. Definitely one of the beautiful resorts in the Scottsdale Paradise Valley area. Excellent place to come to relax at the pool brunch at the restaurant as well as drinks at the M Bar. During the summer if you are an Arizona resident they give you a discount on the rooms. If you've never been to this property I would suggest going and checking it out."
