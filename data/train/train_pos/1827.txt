b'Best place to get quick food, especially if you work around the area.Their combo comes with rice and 3 side dishes that you can pick. I like their popcorn chicken combo the most, usually I get a combo without a rice (so you will get additional side dish).Missing one star since they used to give a chinese soup (and now they increase the price and no more soup *sad*) and average service during rush hour.'
