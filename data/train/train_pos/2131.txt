b"I have always loved going here you can call me bias because this was my grannies favorite but they recently re-did the linq which is just outside the casino and makes the appeal of staying at the flamingo even better. It's on and poppin over there every time I go. Plus all the new food and restaurants are so dope and the atmosphere is great. If you want to be in the middle of everything stay here and the rooms aren't great but who's tryin to stay in the rooms anyways. Just a little dated. The dranks be flowin, they are not stingy at all."
