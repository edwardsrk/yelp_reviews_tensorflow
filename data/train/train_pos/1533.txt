b"Seen this place a couple of times  finally went In , and I gotta say the food was pretty amazing. The babe back ribs were tender an delicious , the greens were good an juicy, the Mac an cheese was ok but the corn bread muffins were to die for ! We also got fried chicken which was most defiantly finger licking good hshaha ! But how ever we also got the smoked ribs , I was so hungry when I seen the pictures of the beef ribs but it ended up being no meat on the bones what so ever. Also liked that I called in an they had no problem making portions for me an my family . Over all we were excited to eat here an give it a 9 /10 . On a side note I wish I knew the whole me u I would have got sweet potatoes an a few other things that I'm sure would have been delicious"
