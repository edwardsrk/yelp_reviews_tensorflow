b"I just moved back to AZ from LA and I've been dying for some GOOD pho. There are not many places here like there are in LA and when I found this place I was super excited because it was nice, not dingy, and looked clean and well kept. I got chicken pho and it was very fresh and delicious! I can't wait to show my boyfriend  my new find ;) he loves pho too! I will be back soon!"
