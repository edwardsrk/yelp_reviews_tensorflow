b"Went to Thomas Keller's brunch here with 6 friends.  It was early in February of 2018, and was nice enough to dine on the outside patio that overlooked a small pool inside of an elegantly decorated courtyard.  The service was polite and very prompt.  For starters we got mimosas, cofffee, OJ, and a few screwdrivers.  All of the drinks came out great.   Food wise we started off with an order of beignetes, smoked salmon with a petite baguette, a croissant and a pecan sticky bun.  All of the starters came out and were spot on delicious.  I tried each of the above which completely met my expectations.   For my main, I ordered the chicken and waffles and the table ordered croque madam (breakfast sandwich) and the Oeufs Benedict.  All of these meals came out great- a funny note about Croque madam was that it was served with a side of fries the size of a small wastebasket.  In all seriousness, this was the largest side of fries I have ever seen. The sandwich was excellent, and the chicken and waffles served with a crown liquor maple syrup.  It was amazing. The table enjoyed the Benedict but I didn't try it. I'm just not a fan of that dish.  I will definitely be back here."
