b"I would like to give Danny Boys three stars, but it's better than all the competition that I've tried in the area as far as taste, price and quality of pizza. I really haven't found a pizza I can devote myself to in this area. The garlic knots that came with the salad were delicious. We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza we had when we dined in. Very tasty pepperoni and Parmesan recipe. The regular crust pizza we ordered for carry out next time was pretty good too, but not as good as the thin.Some of the specialty pizzas really looked good. Can't wait to try them. It's not Coccia House, but what is."
