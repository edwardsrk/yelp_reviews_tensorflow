b"I love this place - I find they restock very often, so their produce is fresh. I've had better luck with finding fresher fruit and veggies here than I do at Loblaws, where things tend to be older and more expensive. They have a great selection of produce, stock Asian cooking essentials, and have very reasonable prices. The staff aren't particularly talkative, but are friendly and helpful. Only downside is they don't take credit, only cash and debit."
