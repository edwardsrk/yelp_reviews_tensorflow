b'Very helpful staff.  Location was a little farther than the Home Depot.  After the Yelp coupon, the prices for the items that I purchased was on par with Lowest and Home Depot.  Those big box stores are OK.  However, I am trying to support the local economy.  With an adequate selection, friendly staff, and close location, I will continue to spend my money there.'
