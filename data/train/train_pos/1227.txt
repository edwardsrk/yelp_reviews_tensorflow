b"I don't usually do reviews, but ignore the 2.5 star rating. I had the pho dac biet and the broth was on point. My wife had the banh mi and she said the bread was fresh. Pricing was good, but don't forget your cash b/c it's cash only. Service was typical for an Asian restaurant. Overall, come try it out if you're looking for Asian food in Vegas. It also open 24 hours."
