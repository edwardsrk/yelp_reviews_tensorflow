b'We were looking for a quick bite on the way to Taliesin West - thanks yelpers for helping us land here.  Quickly seated, super efficient waitress, chicken beer bread for me (which is really like a wrap - but it was delish). Husband got the double nachos, which are smothered in cheese and beef and have their own pot of more goodies to dump on top..  Nice.  Kid ate a burger - thumbs up...we got out of there and up the road in the nick of time.  Efficient, fast, family friendly - it gets four stars for being a good sports bar'
