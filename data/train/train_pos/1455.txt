b'Stumbled upon this place driving by and decided to stop in with no real expectations.  It is almost cafeteria feeling, just one big square with some booths on the outside and tables in the middle.  Decor is pretty run down and dated in that typical "Vietnamese Restaurant Decor".  We were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wished.  The menus were clear and simple with a form to fill out what you wanted to order.  No sooner had we ordered than about 5 mins later our entire order arrived!The food was fantastic, fresh and full of flavour.  I always order salad rolls and these ones were rolled to a perfect size with shrimp and pork rolled up inside.My beef pho was excellent - they have size choices, which is great considering usually the average size bowl is huge.  I ordered the small and even it was a good sized meal.Customer service is exactly like the other reviewers stated - strictly business.  Polite but no frills for sure.All in all, it\'s a new favourite for us!'
