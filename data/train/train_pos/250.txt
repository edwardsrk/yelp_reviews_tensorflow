b"Great beer selection, friendly bartenders, fun trivia night, better-than-average bar food.This bar is located where I grew up in southeast Charlotte. I make it a point to stop in whenever I'm home. During the day you'll find families eating in the dining room and at night the typical crowd is local twenty/thirty-somethings. Not quite a dive bar, not quite a sports bar. There is generally live acoustic music on the weekends and trivia is every Tuesday. Trivia night really brings out the local characters and can get competitive. The first ones to the bar on gamedays get first pick of what games go the bigscreens in the bar, kinda cool. My only complaint is the location- I wish it were stand-alone and not in a stripmall. Try the fried pickles!"
