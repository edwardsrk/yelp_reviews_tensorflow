b"You can never go wrong with a simple meal from Rickys. Don't go expecting a high class meal because you aren't going to get one. That's one mistake I made once with the seasonal menu ordering 'Crab Cakes'. That's one thing I know- I will never order fish from this restaurant. However the meal I had today- the chicken tender breckie bowl was delicious. I was also very impressed because when I was joe able to finish my food, rather than having a styrofoam to go container they had paper so it is much better for the environment. The only reason this restaurant received a 4/5 is because they were busy and apparently our waitress had so many tables that we didn't have 1 consistent waitress - we had 4 and it seemed like they weren't communicating. We had our order taken twice and drinks, etc. :)"
