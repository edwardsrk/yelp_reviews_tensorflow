b"I went for rolls, had the coconut and Mango roll, and spider roll.  Coconut roll was great, Spider roll not quite as crunchy as I like.  Miso soup was very good, although not a Japanese standard version, it was some variation of that.   Hot Sake cheap and good. Waiter was great, although he kept kissing up to the couple at the next table.  Kind of annoyingI don't order sushi here, but I do always like the rolls."
