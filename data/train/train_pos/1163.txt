b"Cool place to have a few drinks and dance. Nothing too crazy because the DJ never change the genre or want to take request. But after a few of their yummy strong drinks, you kind of just go with the flow and forget that the DJ really SUCKS! Just go with a group of friends and you'll enjoy your night."
