b'First of all: the pictures on the website are incredibly outdated. My boyfriend suggested we go here at first, but when I googled it, I exclaimed that I didn\'t feel like watching the Jays\' home opener in a "dumpy ass place". Imagine my surprise at the nice newly-renovated pics on Yelp! It\'s a gorgeous space now. We live in the area, and I think this is our new go-to bar. We got a comfy spot in front of a giant TV to watch the Jays game, and our food/drinks were great. The salmon salad came with a huge piece of fresh, healthy tasting salmon filet. It was just what I wanted. The one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn\'t do "those kinds of substitutions" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn\'t put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you\'re Terroni you can have a "no substitutions" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? The server really made an effort though, and said he\'d bring over some guacamole instead. That was much appreciated :) The hourly rentals to use the pool and ping pong tables are pretty pricey ($25/hour) but it is a really nice space now, with nice, clean washrooms (important!), comfy seats, and lots of TVs. Will be back to watch more sports!'
