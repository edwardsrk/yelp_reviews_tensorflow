b'Consistently our go to breakfast spot in sprawling Phoenix.We thought it was worth the 20mi drive this past weekend while visiting.Next trip we will try dinner.Great creative menu leaning toward healthy options.Being healthy here does not mean sacrificing taste.Great option among commonplace franchises and boring eateries.'
