b"I ordered  a Polish boy and mild wings with Bleu  cheese. I didn't know that they forgot my dip until I got home. The food was absolutely delicious but I had to go back and get the blue cheese which was inconvenient but I don't eat wings without it. I understand that people make mistakes.. my plan was  to give this a 5 star rating. Had the lady apologized for her mistake I would have but the fact that she didn't really seem to care in fact, seemed a little annoyed that I came back for it. I really should give it a three-star but the food was good enough that I'll go back I just know to check my order. On top of that I did pre pay her and gave her a $2 tip on an $8 order which is over 20%."
