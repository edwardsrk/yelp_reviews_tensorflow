b"I went here over the weekend and it was AMAZING. We were told it would be about 15-20 minute wait and it said that was fine and sat down to wait. About 10 minutes later, we were seated. Wait staff was great and food was wonderful. It's not cheap, but you do get what you pay for in my opinion. Great food, great environment!! This will be a regular place to visit!"
