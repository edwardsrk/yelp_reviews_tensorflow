b"This was my first time dealing with Joycity and I was satisfied with the process and pricing.  I purchased a set of Continental WinterContact SI (225/45/17) for $865.00 all-in on Nov 29, 2016.  I also received a $65.00 mail-in rebate with Continental.  They accepted Visa for full payment.I emailed Joycity for a quote and they responded within 24 hours with all tire options for 225/45/17.  The price was slightly cheaper than SimplyTire who I've dealt with a couple times in the past.  SimplyTire was selling the same tires for $770.00 plus taxes plus $3.75 per tire for the Ontario Tire Stewardship (total $887.05 all-in).  $22.05 in savings isn't a whole lot to try a new tire shop but I wanted to give Joycity a shot so I have another option in the future.I ordered the tires online, paid a $100.00 deposit via PayPal, and booked an appointment date/time.  Due to the busy season, the earliest (and most convenient) appointment was Dec 13, 2016 (about 2 weeks from the order date).  I showed up for my appointment at 2:30PM and was out by 4:00PM.  1.5 hour wait.  The wait wasn't terrible but I was advised by the older gentleman at the front counter that it would take less than 1 hour.  Timing is very important to me as my job is based on scheduled appointments so due to the delay, I had to push out a few of my meetings.  A customer waiting with me experienced the same delay.Besides the timing issue, everything else met my expectations.  Customer service was fine and I didn't expect more.  Other reviews claim that they're not very friendly and I can understand how one can feel that way.  But keep in mind that this is a Chinese-owned business.  You can't expect white-glove service with smiles and hugs.  I'm Chinese and have been experiencing this type of service my whole life.  Straight to the point and efficient.  No pleasantries.  I find SimpleTire the same way.Overall, I would go back if the price is right.P.S. - Some brands that Joycity carry are cheaper or more expensive than what SimplyTire carries.  I suspect this is due to the relationship the shop has with its suppliers."
