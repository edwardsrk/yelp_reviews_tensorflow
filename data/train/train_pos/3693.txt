b'This place is a true gem!  Well worth the short block and a half walk from Fremont Street.. The food was delicious and surprising, more than just authentic Mexican, it was new, fresh and original.  I loved every bite.  BEST guacamole I have ever had.. We will come back again and again.  Cool casual vibe, super friendly staff, and fun atmosphere.'
