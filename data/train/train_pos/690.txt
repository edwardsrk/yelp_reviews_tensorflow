b"Buca is a lovely intimate space to celebrate any special event. The space is a great blend between industrial, rustic and upscale aesthetics. We had great service and our waitress was very helpful with recommendations.We came over the holidays to celebrate a birthday and had a great adventurous meal. You can definitely come across items that can't be found anywhere else! We started the night with Salumi De Buca and we got the lardo, spalla and the salsiccine. It was my first time trying lardo in this way, and it's texture was like caramel but tasted like cream. Very interesting! Next was the Trota, steelhead trout with a yogurt and herbs on top. The raw trout was fatty and meatier-tasting than tuna sashimi (as a benchmark) but the preparation kept it light and balanced. The most adventurous dish of the night was the Cervello. It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese. It was a fun dish.Of course, if you want to be less adventurous there are plenty of pastas, pizzas and entrees to choose from. The table next to us had some younger kids and the kitchen was able to accommodate making simple pastas for them."
