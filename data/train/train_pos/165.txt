b"The second most authentic Mexican experience I've had in Pittsburgh (see Edgar's Tacos in the Strip for the first).Chips and salsa are brought to you as soon as you sit down, there are plenty of options, even for a vegetarian like me (that don't involve tofu, which has no place in Mexican food). It seems to be the only place around that has a wide selection of traditional Mexican beers.I find the atmosphere a little hokey, but I feel like that goes with the territory."
