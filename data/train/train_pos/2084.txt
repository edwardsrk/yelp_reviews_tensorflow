b"I was surprised that I hadn't written a review for this place.  I've been here at least a dozen times in the last year or so.It's a great place, friendly staff, easy parking, convenient location, free refills on sodas.  I've really only had the Barry B which is a turkey/swiss/bacon sandwich because I ordered it the first time I came in and never changed.  Their menu selection is just huge with lots of unique sandwiches.  Get the Dutch crunch bread with the crunchy, buttery top.  I think it's probably the best sandwich bread I've ever had.  Expect to pay about $10-$15 for a sandwich, chips and a drink.Forgot to add:  I went in recently for their breakfast sandwiches.  Try The Hangover.  Eggs, your choice of meat, cheese, tater tots, and a really spicy hot sauce."
