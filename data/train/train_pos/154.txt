b'Great Mexican food! We had green and red enchiladas. YUMM! Beautiful white Burgundian wine offered by the glass. Lovely ambiance. Ask to sit FAR away from the door in the winter. Or upstairs. They could use a heavy velvet curtain to block out that cold Montreal air! Thank you so much for the lovely dinner and good service.'
