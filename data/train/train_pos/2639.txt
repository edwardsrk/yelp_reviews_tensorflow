b"Split a sushi boat with 3 others. Good variety and quality for the price. For $45, you get 4 full rolls (cali, shrimp tempura, las vegas, and spicy tuna) and an assortment of sashimi. We originally came here to try out the AYCE but our lack of appetites and the limited choices of the AYCE changed our minds. I like the ambiance and the big wipes they provide. I wasn't in love with the TV programming.  Cartoon network has super weird stuff nowadaysThey provided free miso soup before the meal and watermelon afterward!"
