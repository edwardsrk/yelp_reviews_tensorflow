b'I was in here yesterday to check out what they had on offer. This store recently opened in a refurbished strip mall along 42 ave. When I walked in the first thing that struck me was how nice it was. I was expecting it to have sort of a warehouse, industrial type feel - just supplies. Instead there were plenty of retail displays, esthetically placed.The other thing is that the store is quite big filled with all sorts of stuff, from pans to knives to gadgets. I saw a few things that I have never seen before. I am looking forward to going back to pick up. There were probably 15 people milling about looking at all the stuff - a bit of a suprise considering that the store itself feels like a little tucked away secret in a strip mall. The prices are reasonable -but more than that, there is great selection.  Limited parking out front.'
