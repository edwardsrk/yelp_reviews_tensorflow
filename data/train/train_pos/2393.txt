b"I ordered food from here and it was still so tasty when I got home. I got pad z ew and chicken green curry. Both dishes were very good, especially the green curry. I have had super milky green curries at other places which luckily wasn't the case here. I loved it. Nice rich flavor they immediately reminded me of my time spent in Thailand. I look forward to dining in and exploring the menu some more"
