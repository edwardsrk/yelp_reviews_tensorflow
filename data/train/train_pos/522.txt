b"Wolfgang Puck has like a million restaurants in Vegas and this one is similar to most of his other traditional Italian restaurants.  You're still able to order gluten free and whole grain pasta if that's what you prefer.  The restaurant was average and service was good but the real review here is for the dish i ordered.  We started off with a caprese salad and it was so good!  The buffalo mozzarella was just right and fresh.  But the memorable part was the entree.  I ordered the pancheta bucatini is it was so well balanced.  The pasta was perfect and the sauce was so good with bites of pancheta was just right.  The portion was good and i ended up finishing the whole thing and even used the bread to soak up whatever sauce was left on the plate.  I would definitely go back for that dish again.Also, try and grab a seat outside the restaurant if you're looking for some entertainment and don't mind the noise.  I was here during dinner on a Friday night and the restaurant is right across from Light night club.  It gets interesting as the line gets longer and longer.  Vegas never disappoints."
