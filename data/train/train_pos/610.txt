b"had a good experience last year with EZ in Vegas.Shuttles from LAS to the car rental center are constant, and took maybe 5-10 min each way. Waited in line 10 min, the guy who helped me was nice, didn't try to upsell me anything, and we were on our way. Car was in good shape, and drop off was also easy."
