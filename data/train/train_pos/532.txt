b'** 4.5 Stars **15 Word Summary: Best takeout Asian BBQ Pork, in terms of price, flavour, and quick takeout turnover     blah. (there it\'s 15 words)BBQ\'ed food is already legendary as is but Asian style BBQ is some sort of mythical magical food expedition that you only get to experience if you\'re lucky and end up in a great restaurant.Luckily Kum Hong BBQ is one of those great restaurants. For $5.25 (CASH ONLY) you get a bed of rice with a good serving of juicy, delicious, amazing BBQ pork. In terms of price, flavour and texture, this BBQ CANNOT be beat (yes I challenge you to find a competitor!). However I have to say that this place really isn\'t much of a "restaurant". Tea is self-serve, there\'s no real dining space except for two small counters where you will be crowded by the lineup of people looking to fill their appetites with BBQ Pork, chicken, duck, etc. But I don\'t really care as long as they can keep the cost as low as this!'
