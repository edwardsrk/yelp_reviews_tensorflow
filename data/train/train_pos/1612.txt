b'This place is kind of a hidden gem at The Venetian. I would never have thought to give this place a try had it not been for the thick "Yellow Pages" type book in the hotel room (where it was listed) and for Yelp. My friend and I came here around 5:30 on a Saturday and were, luckily, seated right away (I don\'t believe they take reservations). It is a small restaurant, but quaint. I love that the waiters spoke Italian; it made it more authentic to me. Also, our waiter was funny and really nice.As for the food, it\'s yummy. The portions are big and you won\'t hurt your wallet eating here. Thank you to whoever suggested the meatballs. I think they are, by far, the best I\'ve ever had. They were full of flavor and super moist. The garlic rolls were delicious as well. I was torn between the Penne in Vodka Sauce and Linguine Carbonara and the waiter suggested the latter. I am definitely glad he steered me that way because it was really good. If I had more room in my stomach I would\'ve devoured the last three or four bites. My friend had the pepperoni pizza (I can\'t remember what it was listed under on the menu) and that was good as well (super big portions, it\'s like ordering a medium from Pizza Hut). The tiramisu was a perfect ending to the meal. I\'d love to come here again and try their other dishes.'
