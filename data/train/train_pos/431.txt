b"Well, who doesn't like Eaton Centre? I sure do!We did Toronto for Thanksgiving 2017 and we had the obligatory visit to Eaton Centre for some shopping --specifically at Roots, and with the convenient exchange rate, this was a must for our visit.We had a quick bite for breakfast (food court is not life-changing, I should say) and then went on shopping. Roots was our first stop and they were having this massive sale. Got some things there. Then TNA, some sports store, and a couple of other things here and there.Place is clean, modern, well-lit, seasonally decorated, wide open spaces.Will I come back if I ever make it back to Toronto? Sure."
