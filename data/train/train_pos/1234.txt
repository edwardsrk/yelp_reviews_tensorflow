b"Wow, I was very impressed.  I've passed this place many times while shopping nearby.  I purchased a gift certificate thru Amazon Local and decided to give this place a try.   This rating is probably closer to 4.5 stars.  I was greeted immediately, and seated on a Saturday evening.   I proceeded to review the menu and decided to try the Fried Cheese as an appetizer and the Shrimp Aglio for my entree.  I was immediately presented with a basket of warm clustered garlic rolls (they were delicous!).  The house salad (included with the entree), arrived within a few minutes and it was GOOD, fresh iceberg lettuce, topped with cherry tomato and loads of fresh mozarrella with a side of their delicious house dressing.   I ate every bit.  The fried cheese arrived, 5 large planks of fresh mozzarella, nicely battered and fried with a side of homemade marinara.  The marinara was filled with chunky tomatoes and had a very nice flavor, just a little bit sweet, just like I like it!   The entree.....where do I begin!!!!    The server brought out a huge bowl of linguine, topped with fresh basil, loads of freshly topped tomato and an ample portion of perfectly cooked shrimp.  I also received a side of freshly grated parmesan without having to request it.   The pasta was piping hot, flavorful and the portion was HUGE.   Everything about this meal was great, the food, service and atmosphere.   I would definitely return!"
