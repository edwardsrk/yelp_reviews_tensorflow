b"Surprisingly pretty great food. I ate here for breakfast twice with a group of 6-8. The service was very good both days and they were especially accommodating with our group - even bringing 6 separate checks one day, which was so appreciated. I had a goat cheese, sundried tomato omelet one day which was fresh and flavorful. The next day I had french toast with a side of fresh berries, which were equally as good, though didn't come with real maple syrup. The menu is your standard diner food without the greasiness and grunge of your standard diner. I would recommend."
