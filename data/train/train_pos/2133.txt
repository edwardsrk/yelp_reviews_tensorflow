b"Stayed here between 12/26-12/28. Nice hotel with a few problems associated with aging hotels, and it is a bit off the strip. The room was excellent. My friends and I stayed at a studio suite, and it was a great room: two televisions, a queen pullout bed, a king bed, single bathroom, stocked fridge (you have to pay if you want any of the items), a fridge below that for your goods, an electric stove, a blender, the full works! It's a great room. There were a few things that were associated with general usage of the room like the lock on the bathroom door was a bit jammed and the television was slow when switching channels. Wifi was a bit slow, but works fine.My biggest problem with the Palms Place is that it is disconnected with the casino and parking. It is a big annoyance and takes about 10-15 minutes to walk from the hotel to the casino. If you don't mind walking (time to walk off the buffet!!!), then it should be fine.Bill Tip: There is a free shuttle that goes from the Palms Casino to Caesars Palace every 30 minutes until 8pm. Take advantage of this!Bill Tip #2: Depending on your location, a cab ride from the strip to the Palms Place would be between 12-18."
