b"This place is the best hole in the wall with delicious food. There chicken fingers with seasoned fries drizzled with the same sauce, are the bomb!! I've followed them since I was 15, when they were at Stop n Shop. People complain about the area and the ambiance. That's all part of the package, you know if you go down there to find them, that's how good they are. 28 years later, I now take my kids there to eat or order out to take to drive in this place is on point!"
