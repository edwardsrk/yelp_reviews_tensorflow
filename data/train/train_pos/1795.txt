b"The food is beautiful! This little hole in the wall restaurant is a wonderful surprise. I've been there several times now. Heart value for the money. So far over had the Al Pastor, Barbacoa and Carnitas de Pancita. All flavorful meals in generous portions. For dessert we've had the Tres Leches (our favorite) and the Pastel Impossible (quite good).I've been there on date nights and with groups.My only complaint; and it's a silly way to ruin such a great experience, you order extra tostadas, they never arrive but are there on the bill. This has happened about three times now.   The last time, we asked three times for an order of tostadas which never came. However the bill had us down for three orders of tostadas. When we told our server, we were completely shot down and were told we had to pay. It was only a couple of bucks but the experience left a poor taste. So, we no longer order extra tostadas. Other than that, the food and price are well worth it."
