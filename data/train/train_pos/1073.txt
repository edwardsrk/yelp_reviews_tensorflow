b"Finally made my visit to Tacos Huicho as my ongoing trek for the best tacos in Arizona continues. Read good reviews by fellow yelpers of this place. I believe they just renovated the dining area as I did not see the broken chairs, sticky tiles, nor limited seating that some yelpers experienced. I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck. Though it won't hit my top 10 tacos shops here in AZ, it definitely lands within the Top 20. I shall come back again and try the rest of their listed tacos!"
