b"Shady rolled in to Mastro's to commence his epic 8 night assault on Vegas on a sunday evening 8.30. Housed in the Crystals Mall(one word of caution-if u come to Crystals with a special someone plan on dropping a few k$-its 5th ave on steriods). Seated in the neat tree house, Shady and Co. started with some seared Ahi tuna, well presented and delicious. Shady and lucky guest split the bone in ribeye and the crusted Halibut special and side of roasted sprouts. The steak and brussel sprouts were spot on. The Halibut was a touch disappointing, undercooked in spots and with no real oomph in the flavor. The dessert had to be the signature warm butter cake. Big enough for 8, Shady and friend got 1/3 through and called it quits. The creme fraiche was outstanding and the cake as good as advertised. But why so huge? Service was very good, and the vibe very enjoyable. Shady always have reservations ordering fish in Las Vegas, and next time will stick with what Shady thinks is their forte-the meats. 3.5 stars."
