b"I have eaten at Great Wall since they first opened and I must report that the food and service are sorely lacking as to be not recognizable from the past. The overall rudeness of the wait staff beyond belief. I went back last week for Chinese New Year's and had a wonderful experience with the staff and great dim sum. They must have been having a real bad day earlier in the year. I'm very pleased because I did not want to lose this place as its the last dim sum place in Phoenix. All the others are in the east valley."
