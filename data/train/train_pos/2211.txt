b"Stopped by for waffles after a trying day. They had exactly 2 left, which was our luck. Apparently they had quite the breakfast rush, it was a Saturday. The waffle was good, tasty, sweet. They were out of ingredients for the lumberjack too, so I ended up with the peanut butter cup. I typically go light on carbs but made an exception. It's probably not a place I would go back to, but it's great for its niche."
