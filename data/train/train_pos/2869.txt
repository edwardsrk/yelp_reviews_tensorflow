b"Being a born and raised Mexican I must say this is as FRESH and homemade as it gets. Starting with the salsas that are made daily from scratch, the AMAAAAAZING and unique horchata I'd gladly buy gallons of, and surprisingly fresh and SO tasty salads..i just cant get enough of do\xc3\xb1a Celina's cooking. She is the sweetest and warm owner that welcomes everyone like family. Plus they have raspados (snow cones) and elote en vasito (corn in a cup) to die for!!!. I am officially the biggest fan and Id gladly direct everyone looking for AUTHENTIC MEXICAN food!!"
