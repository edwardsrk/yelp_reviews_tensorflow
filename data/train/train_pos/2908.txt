b"It was really good, as always. We had three rolls left with one to two pieces on each and they wanted to charge us extra. I've eaten at many sushi restaurants. I get it, I do, it didn't help our third person was missing at the end of our meal and we were stuffed! We had to eat two more pieces each to not get charged. Not cool to be that stuffed! Then they were like hey you want dessert? No I want to throw up because you forced me to eat! But the food is really good"
