b"This restaurant is one of my favorites! Their pita bread is the best I have ever had... it's fluffy, light, & super fresh! The hummus of course is to die for and they have all different types as well! The flavors here are exceptional, and I could eat there food on a daily basis. The staff is also super friendly, and the vibe and atmosphere there is top notch."
