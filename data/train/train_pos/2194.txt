b"I love the food here and it's pretty much one of 3 vegan/vegetarian spots in Phoenix but the service is UNBELIEVABLY slow. I don't even walk in the door if there is a line. Even with no line it took about 20 minutes to get an acai bowl on a Wednesday at 10:40am. Don't ever come here if you're in a hurry, but it's a lovely place to sit and chat a whole morning away with a friend."
