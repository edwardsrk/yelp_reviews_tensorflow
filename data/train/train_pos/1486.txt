b"I've eaten here in several times when visiting  and have always enjoyed it. Had lunch today and it was tasty as always. I had their lunch special of Red Curry Shrimp. For less then eight bucks, I had soup (broth was good but didn't care for the veggies in it), a small side salad, spring roll, Jasmine rice, and a good serving of Red Curry. I left very full and satisfied. The level of spice was perfect and everything flavorful. Service was quick and friendly. I also had the Thai iced tea, which I found was heavy on the milk. Overall, i really enjoyed my meal and would come back next time I'm in town again!"
