b"First of all, I'm Chinese, and I'm carbophobic. No, I don't really like rice or noodle, so why do I come here when I come to Vegas? I love the Lan Zhou hand pulled noodle, specifically the broth, beef, and veggie in the noodle soup. I love the fact that they always accomodate my request for less noodle but more veggie with extra cilantro and green onions. The broth is so yummy, light yet flavorful. I also like their black pepper filet migon cubes (very tender!), yangzhou style fried rice with shrimp and beef (suprisingly not greasy at all), and dim sum dishes.  I've come here with non-Asian friends (white, Indian, and Jewish), and none of them has ever complained about the quality or service or flavor of the food here. I agree it is quite pricey, but again you are in Vegas! Also I'm sure those stunning-looking fish cost a fortune."
