b"Our group enjoyed this place! nice atmosphere and great service. great Michael Mina restaurant and pretty affordable. They have daily specials for $50 pp and comes with app, main entree, and dessert. Love their fries and my steak was yummy! I tried my luck and got medium well (i usually have to order medium or medium rare so it's not overcooked), and they cooked it perfectly! The beignets I got for dessert was also delish."
