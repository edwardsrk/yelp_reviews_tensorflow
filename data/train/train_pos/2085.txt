b"I had the Victorian fillet with salad and sauteed mushrooms. Steak cooked at medium was perfect and mushrooms had great flavor. They were ssuteed in brandy i believe. Salad was ok. Be better if they used green leaf. Steak had a lot of flavor too and very tender. Good service, not busy so we were seated right away. My mother had April'schicken?? She thought it was very good. I'm on a diet so no dessert but i'd really like to try the salted caramel skillet. It looked sooo good."
