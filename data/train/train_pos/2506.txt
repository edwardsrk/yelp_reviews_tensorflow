b"This place is 1/4 mile from my house and I have passed it many times. I looked them up on Yelp and their reviews were not the best. I finally needed to Smog 3 Car's so I can register them here so I tried Jiffy Smog today. There were 2 people in front of me so there was about a 10 minutes wait. When it was my turn I drove up and Mark was friendly and personable. He noted that my car had been tested in California very recently but unfortunately would have to be re-tested in Nevada. He asked me if I knew about the VIN Check required (I did). I asked him if he had change for a tip and he said yes. So, in summary I highly recommend this place and would say they are friendly and efficient!"
