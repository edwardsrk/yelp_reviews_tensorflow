b'This is a fairly new place, and we have been meaning to check it out.  We will for sure be back!There is an extensive menu.  Sushi, chinese, japanese, and curry options, so there is something for everyone.  As strange as this may sound, the highlight of the meal for me was the free appetizers they gave at the beginning of the meal.  There was a "hot cucumber" item (for lack of a better term) that was simply amazing.  The cucumber bits were still nice and crisp, but had a hot tangy flavor to them.  I asked if I could get seconds and they were nice enough to oblige.My fiance and I split a Rock N Roll and it was tasty.  Not that original, but we both enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavor and each of the flavors did stand out.  I ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner bento box and was quite pleased.  It came with my choice of soup (I had hot and sour), a sald, white rice, and then several choices for sides.  You were able to choose either tempura vegetables, chicken katsu or seaweed salad, shumai, Gyoza or a spring roll and a choice of one of three sushi rolls.  It was a bargain for the amount of food you got at $15.  My fiance ordered one of the traditional chinese dishes and was quite pleased as well.   Service was quick and attentive, even with my multople requests to refill my water glass.  We will be back!'
