b"I got to check out this place twice when I was visiting a buddy in Charlotte.  It is an awesome place for breakfast.  If people are whining about spending a few bucks on a bagel for breakfast, they need to make their own food.  A business has to make a profit.  There is a Caribou Coffee bar in the restaurant if you want something more than just a cup of a coffee from the Bruegger's side.  They make a great latte. I was boring and got the same thing twice, but it was well worth it.  I think it was the sun -dried tomato sandwich or something like that.  I put a bit of hot sauce on it and DAMN it was good!  If you want to try a good bagel sandwich, give this place a go!"
