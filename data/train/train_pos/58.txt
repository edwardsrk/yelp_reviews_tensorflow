b"I'll admit it was hard to get used to the smell as you walk in, but I'm glad I did! I'm big on their baguette's which have the perfect crunch offering a great ratio when served with their sandwich meat. You can even buy day old bread at a steep discount to have with dinner! I normally opt for the turkey and cheese that comes out fairly quick. Give their dried fruits, smoothies, or one of their many pre-packaged oriental desserts a try. I love coming in when they are baking the bread for the day and the line always moves quickly. They have recently started accepting card so that's a major bonus!"
