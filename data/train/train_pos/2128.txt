b'If you don\'t like French cuisine, don\'t bother traveling to Montreal :D...you might as well pack your own food from wherever you\'re traveling from. Fortunately for me, it\'s my favorite cuisine so Montreal is heaven, for me at least; 2nd to Paris of course. Restaurant G-M is a good spot and this is why:Food:+ Short Ribs. It was written on their blackboard and is one of their staple dishes. It was damn good...a bit salty for my liking but it was done as short ribs should be. Lonnggggggggggggggggggggg slowwwwwwwwwww and falling off the bone when your fork touches it.Service:+ It was good, friendly, attentive and "just there."Fermented Grape Juice:+ It\'s a French restaurant and thus the wine list is mostly French wines. I love Bordeaux and thus for me, it was an easy pick :)I will definitely go back especially because it is located very close to the Westin Montreal (within walking distance) THIS has been a review by Gaurav'
