b"My hubby and I went here on Valentine's Day. It was our first time there. Even though it is BYOB, we were not prepared and did not have a bottle with us.  Then, when I checked in on Yelp, I was surprised to see that an offer popped up for a free glass of wine.  When I asked the waitress about it, she asked the owner, who came over and made sure we each got a small glass of red wine!  Pleasant surprise.The restaurant is in a small, intimate space. Tables are close together, and the wait staff is very friendly and seems like part of a family.  The owner came up to our table and greeted us and chatted with us.  The relaxed atmosphere made it feel as if we were at a large family event, like a wedding reception.The food was great. We had a selection of cold and warm appetizers, and a shish kabob entree.  Having been to Istanbul, I was hoping for a vibe that might take me back... and I must say, it did not disappoint!For a special occasion or just a dinner out on any night of the week, I definitely recommend Istanbul Sofra."
