b"so I've been here a few times and every time I've come, this place never lets me down. I had a pomegranate mojito which was super yummy - not too sweet and still able to taste the mint with a decent kick! To start, I had the pumpkin soup - which was a lot better than I had expected ... there were pomegranate seeds which sounded weird, but added a great contrast of flavors. It's pretty rich, and I didn't even finish it. The portions are pretty generous and his sauces are amazing. Everything has just the amount of fire to it! I ordered the pork with the sweet potato tamale. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and we were stuffed to our max capacity! Cute bartender and really friendly staff. Our waitress was excellent - very attentive and hilarious! Only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars is that their desserts haven't been top on my list."
