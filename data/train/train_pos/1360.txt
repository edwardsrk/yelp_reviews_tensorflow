b'Lauren C\'s review of Prime described her waiter as a "Jeeves Wannabe," and she couldn\'t have been more correct.  And when I told the Sommelier I was taking the Level 2 exam after passing Level 1, but that I wasn\'t a "real" sommelier at the time, he practically scoffed.  The correct response is: "Good luck!"  I told the same thing to the Sommelier at Gary Danko last week, and he gave me his business card and asked how he could help.  THAT is how you treat a customer!Being a top-service-rated restaurant, even if it\'s super-high-end, means having servers that are professional, and knowledgable, but also cool and who act like "real people" at the same time  Example:  Go to Gary Danko.  It\'s a high end establishment, but people are just cool.  No snootiness, and they have a natural flow to how they interact, with a sense of humor as well.  Perhaps I was at Prime on an off-night, but other reviews have confirmed the same attitude.To Bellagio\'s credit, however, I must say that my experience at Picasso two years ago was unbelievable, and the service at Picasso blew me away.  Furthermore, the wine pairing at Picasso was one of the best I\'ve encountered in my life.My Prime experience was overall a good one, saved by the bartender (I had a glass of wine at the bar before dinner, he picked one blind and I guessed it), and the unbelievable bone-in filet.  There was a little too much "rub" on the filet, as I\'m a pureist with my steaks (like to have several bare bites before I go to sauces).  That said, I did try the four homemade sauces, which are pretty incredible:  bernaise, soy reduction, a mustard sauce, and peppercorn.  The bone-in filet is ginormous, and is an amazing cut of meat.  At $60, it\'s probably the best bargain on the menu, because a cut of that quality and size is very rare.Wine list is great, although they only have one Rioja; which shouldn\'t be the case with a list of that size.'
