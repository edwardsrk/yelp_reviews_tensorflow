b"We stayed here for Labor Day weekend . The hotel was very nice. The pool was nice and safe for my child  I was a bit disappointed because they didn't offer any coupons or free buffet like other hotels ... But did I mention the buffet was good for breakfast  the room was big and clean . AC WORKED perfect"
