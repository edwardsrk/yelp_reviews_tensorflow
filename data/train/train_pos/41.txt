b"Spent only one night here and the main reason is because they're pet friendly. Our room was the Queen suite that had a stove and full size refrigerator and pullout sofa bed. Check in and check out was a quick and easy process.Free continental breakfast which, according to my brother, is pretty decent and they offered good food. Overall, decent and quiet place. Far from the strip, which is good if you're not into partying and the Vegas nightlife."
