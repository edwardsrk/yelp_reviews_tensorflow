b"I love this place, skinny girl margaritas are where it's at so you can use most of your calories on the stuff that matters like chips and dip. The guac is 'you need a fork because your chip is going to break its so chunky' good. I had the veggie enchiladas which I highly recommend. The only reason this place gets a 4/5 is because I only got two enchiladas and another time I got three."
