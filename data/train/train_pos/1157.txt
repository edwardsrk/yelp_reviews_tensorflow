b"Let me start this review by  saying I've never been a fan of spring rolls.  You know, those fired, stale tasting, bland things you get as a side with your chines takeout.Rice Paper DOES IT DIFFERENT AND DOES IT WELL! Its like sushi meets a burrito is the best way I can describe it, I could have ordered one of everything off the fresh spring roll menu.Stopped in here on a whim and tried some fried tofu and a glass of beer. Okay, things went well, taste was good so on to the spring rolls. The rolls had great texture and were full of fresh ingredients with tasty dipping sauce.Great place to eat (additional parking to the north) and the bill for two was under $20.I'll be back!"
