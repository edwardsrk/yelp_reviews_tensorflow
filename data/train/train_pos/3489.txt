b"I heard about this place from shark tank so I obviously had to go check out. It was everything I expected and more. The presentation was not only adorable but the tea was amazing. I'm a full on coffee addict and I told my boyfriend I would drink this tea over coffee any day! Tastes just like how I would drink my tea while I was in London. Definitely telling all my friends about this place and next time I'm in need of any custom cakes or pastries I'll be ordering from here as well. Thank you guys!"
