b"Despite being raised in the Sonoran Desert, I love Chicago Dogs! You can blame the Cubs for that. So how come I've never tried a Sonoran Hot Dog before? They've gained a lot of popularity in recent years thanks to Tucson restaurants like El Guero Canelo. I was very happy to see they opened a new location in the west valley on McDowell Road.Today I picked up lunch for a friend on my way over to his place. Without asking what he wanted, I decided to pick up some variety. Two Sonoran Dogs were an obvious choice. I also chose two chicken tacos, a side of refried beans and chips.The cashier was very friendly and when she suggested the chips, she mentioned that they were made fresh each day (and they were really good). In fact, they were better than some I've had in nicer restaurants. But the beans.... They were amazing. Seriously, the refried beans here are better than homemade! My friend mentioned how much he liked the chicken tacos. For something so simple (grilled chicken, cabbage and corn tortillas) they were incredibly flavorful. All I added was some pico de gallo.And finally, the Sonoran Hot Dog was worth every penny. Bacon makes everything better, but the hot dog itself was tasty. And you wouldn't think that mayo and beans would go together, but it all works. The flavors may not be as bold as the sport peppers on a Chicago Dog, but I will not pass up another opportunity to enjoy a Sonoran Dog again. Welcome to the valley El Guero Canelo!"
