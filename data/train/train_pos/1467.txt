b"This was one of the best massages I have had, and I have been in many luxury hotel spas.  Diana was my masseuse and she was wonderful, ask for her there.  The price was very good ($90 CAD) for 60 minutes.  I did not give it 5 stars because the amenities are ok but it is clean, and has a steam room.I recommend it highly if you're in the area."
