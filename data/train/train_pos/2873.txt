b"Very decent sushi and Thai in SolonThe bento box was great for the price. It came with two small Thai rolls with a Thai chili sauce for dipping, fried rice or lo mein, a 4-piece California roll, and (I chose) chicken teriyaki. It also included a salad or soup. The teriyaki chicken and vegetables in the bento box were very good. The chicken seemed to be freshly chopped off of whole breasts and there was an impressive amount of vegetables (carrots, broccoli, onions, mushrooms and zucchini) included.After a little negotiation I was able to substitute the included California roll for an up-charge. The salad was swimming in dressing and could possibly be confused as lettuce & carrot soup. I had to request chopsticks, and they were the absolute cheapest chopsticks they could buy.I also ordered a Mama Roll off their 'special maki roll' menu. After I left I took a to-go menu with me and found they have a lot more sushi options than what was included on the lunch menu. If you are here for sushi you may wish to ask for a menu that contains more of the sushi options.Both maki rolls were good. The raw fish was fresh and the rice was very good. It included a very small amount of unimpressive wasabi and pickled ginger. They did fashion my wasabi into a little leaf shape which was neat though.I saw three servers serving about 16 people at 7 tables. The servers seemed to bounce back and forth between tables so I assume tips are shared. When my food was delivered the one server asked me if I wanted some low-sodium ketchup; he meant soy sauce, and that mildly amused me.The whole restaurant seemed pretty clean. The men's restroom was dimly lit, but clean.Overall, I had a very good experience and will definitely return."
