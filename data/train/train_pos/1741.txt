b"I went with a group of girls and we had soo much fun. We got the ruby package jsuk.WIth that we got to learn how to lap dance. How to strip without looking like a dork(we've all been there) And how seduce our men with a few looks. THEN the difficult part. well for me. I couldn't swing around the damn pole. Luckily the thing lights up and it's rather cozy and small inside. And it goes tos how the one girl who did cheerleading was the best at it. She even got to learn and upside down move.  And my friend who is obsese even finessed the pole. I got it eventually. The instructor was super super nice and fit. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!Also! with the package we got t-shirts and photos. With feather boas. and a card that has our stripper name on it lol. Don't ask. I couldn't think of one. :) oh and it came with a complentary drink at the bar. You know to help relax the nerves! I could have used 4 of em. But eh. It was free."
