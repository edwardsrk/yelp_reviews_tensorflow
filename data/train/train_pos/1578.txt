b'I pass this place everyday  on my way home. I decided to send hubby for an almond croissant. It was delish! Delish  I tell you. Words cannot describe it. It had the right amount of everything. I think it was about 3$ for the croissant, in my opinion it was well worth it. I am unsure of everything they sell, but once I go for myself  ill do a review for sure!'
