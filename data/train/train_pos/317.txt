b'Mesa Grill is located inside Ceasars.  Its nice that we were able to make reservations for a party of 5 people.  When you make your reservation, you have to give them a credit card number to hold your spot.   We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, and we were still seated immediately.  I loved how the servers was very attentive and chatty. The complimentary bread basket was very good.  I loved how there was different selections (jalapeno bread, cornbread, walnut bread).  For an appetizer, we decided to try the chicken quesadilla, and it was really good.  I would highly recommend it.   We decided to order the 22 ounce Chipotle Rib Eye Steak for our entree.  The steak was huge and can definitely feed 2 people.  The steak was cooked pretty well.  I loved dipping the steak in the sauce. Overal, service was really good here.  I really enjoyed the bread and apps.'
