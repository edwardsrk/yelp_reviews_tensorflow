b"Summary: This review is long overdue.  I travel frequently to LV and make it a point to stay at a variety of hotels; I figure work's paying for it, so I may as well live a little :) .  During those trips, I've stayed at PH Westgate several times.  For the money, PH Westgate is one of the better deals on the strip.Plusses:* The rooms are awesome.   My coworkers said they were nice, but suspected they were a bit cheesy with the whole PH themes for each room.  But I must admit I was pretty impressed when I opened the door to the room and the blinds automatically opened to a pretty awesome view.  The decor is very nice, clean and modern.* Bed is very comfortable.* Good location.  Midtown.  Lots of stuff nearby.* No resort fee.Minuses:* You will have a long, long walk to and from the garage.  And that's assuming you don't make a wrong turn :)"
