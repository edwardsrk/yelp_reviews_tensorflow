b"I went to the Pond today and there was no cover for locals as well as no-minimum for a cabana because it wasn't very crowded being a Wednesday.  It was super hot and I couldn't get in the pool though because the pool was glacial-cold!  I was surprised because it's been so hot I'm surprised the sun hasn't heated the pool to a normal-cool temperature.  I wasn't sure if I was just being crazy but my girlfriends also couldn't get in the pool.  No worries though because we sat in the cabana a bit and the misters came on and it was pretty nice.  It also was a nice time because we had an amazing bartender who kept walking over to check on us.  She had long blonde mermaid waves with some purple in it to match her bikini.  She was super nice and really did everything she could to ensure us a great time.  While I was there I had a lobster and avocado salad.  For $18 you get a dark leafy green salad with thinly-sliced avocado on top and lots of lobster- two entire claws plus it seemed!  I was pretty impressed it could be $18!  I don't think the lobster was super fresh but for $18 that was a steal!  The service really was stellar."
