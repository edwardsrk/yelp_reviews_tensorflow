b"Walked in here expecting just a full bar and restaurant, but was met with amazing energy, good music and even better VEGAN food. Also couldn't stop freaking dancing while I was eating, the server Israel was kind and had super amazing suggestions on his favorite bites and drinks. We had the street tacos set, Amelie Lens, Dubfire, and  I forgot the last one. (Amelie Lens one was my personal favorite). The wasabi tofuna poke bowl was so amazing!!! Will definitely make it a habit to come back every time we are in Vegas!!!"
