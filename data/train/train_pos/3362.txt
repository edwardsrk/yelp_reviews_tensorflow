b'I love these girls. I have two schnauzers, Sasha and Corleone but Corleone is a very nervous guy. This is the only place where he will actually leave unstressed. We have been here and there trying to find the right groomer for him and this is it. My two pups come in and out without any issues. Thank you girls! (I promise to take names down next time)'
