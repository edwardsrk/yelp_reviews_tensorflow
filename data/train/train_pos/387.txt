b'What a great little place! They offer a 2-for-1 drink specials all day everyday with All-You-Can-Eat for Lunch and Dinner 7 Days a week, including an appetizer and dessert item! There are literally over 100 rolls to choose from, categorized by style (Baked, Tempura, etc.) Be careful though, anything you don\'t eat (unless you don\'t like it) they\'ll charge you for individually. I suggest (as do they) ordering little-by-little and opting for half rolls, when you can. This is to prevent people from ordering extra rolls "to-go."My friend and I sat down about 2pm on a Saturday and the place was occupied but not packed full. Our waitress was also very patient as we perused the menu over and over each time to decide what we wanted. Running staff was attentive at refilling our water glasses regularly but the one odd thing was our soy sauce bottle was replaced...three times. THREE! The first bottle was half empty, the second 3/4 full and the 3rd completed filled. It wasn\'t obtrusive to our meal, just comical. Even without the All You Can Eat, the prices were incredibly reasonable. It\'s not much for ambiance, but it looked beautiful and tasted great!'
