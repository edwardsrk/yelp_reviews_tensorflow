b'The hotel is just average, but I give a good review based solely upon the pool. The pool area is very large, and they have an adult only pool. The DJ at this pool was pretty cool. Also the servers were very attentive, and their drinks and daybeds were very affordable. The vibe at the pool was awesome.The rooms here have been updated, but the bathroom seemed old. This hotel has a great location, pretty much the center of the strip.'
