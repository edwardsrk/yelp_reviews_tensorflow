b"First time there, ordered food to go on a Friday evening by phone. It took a couple of times of trying for the phone call to be answered, so I knew they were busy. The wait is a little long on the weekend, fyi...40 min. When I got there every table was full, good sign.We ordered the gyoza, the pad thai shrimp, the pad see ew with chicken, and the house fried rice with chicken. They were all good. The only two small things were the gyoza were no longer as hot as the other dishes, and my husband said medium on the pad thai wasn't hot enough. But the quality of the food was good, plus for next time they said they deliver within 5 miles for orders over $35, with a $4 delivery fee. I have a toddler and gave him the rice, pad see ew, and gyoza and he liked all of them."
