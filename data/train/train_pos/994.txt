b'Over all this is a decent bar. The daily food specials are always good. There is a good selection of beers on tap all the usual faves but also a good selection of guest taps thats changed up to keep things fresh. There is a great patio out back that fills up quick on a nice sunny afternoon. If you are heading over and have a big group then i suggest a reservation. There is a bunch of booths that will fit 6 average people almost comfotably. The service can be a little slow if your in a rush i would try and find a spot at the bar but if your not rushed then sit back and relax with a cold one'
