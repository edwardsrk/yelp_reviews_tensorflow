b"We ordered the following for delivery:-Wonton soup(small). -Beef broccoli combination with house fried rice.-Chicken teriyaki(small). -Vegetable Lo mein(extra vegetable)-large. -Vegetable rolls. -Szechuan pork (small). Restaurant was smart enough to create vent holes on the lids of the takeout boxes so the condensation doesn't drip into the food during delivery-Thanks Chop chop. Delivery time was said to be 45 minutes. Food arrived in less than 30 minutes. All the food was fresh (not over cooked), delicious and the quantities were very abundant for being small (please see posted pictures for food quality and appearance). All this, under $50.00. Can't beat that. And to top it off, the delivery driver was polite and courteous.I give them a 4.0 for their food and 4.5 for their service."
