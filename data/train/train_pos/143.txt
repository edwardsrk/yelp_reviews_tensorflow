b'Being in Vegas for nearly 1 week, I was craving for something hot, spicy, and flavorful.  While there are numerous "famous-chef" restaurants and buffets galore on the strip, sometimes you just need a break from mass produced hotel food.  Penang Malaysian Cuisine fit the bill perfectly.  Located on Spring Mountain Road on the second floor of a mini mall, Penang is a medium sized, modest looking restaurant on the outskirts of Las Vegas\' Chinatown area.   The first thing that struck me when we arrived was how empty the restaurant was...where were the people?  Only 1 table was filled, but from the way they were eating, it looked like they were enjoying the food.  The menu is extensive and offers a large variety of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, curries, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables.  I loved that in addition to the list of menu items, there are pictures for every dish!  This helped a lot since my husband and I are not all that familiar with Malaysian cuisine.   We ordered the roti canai, a stir fry vegetable dish with shrimp paste (similar to chinese spinach, ong choy), a spicy curry chicken, and a rice noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were delicious.   The roti was light, flaky, and hot.  The accompanying curry dipping sauce was the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yummy sauce.  So flavorful and spicy.  The vegetable stir fry and noodle dishes were also tasty.  The star of the show, however was the curry chicken.  OMG!  I wish I had a second stomach to eat more of that dish.  The curry was spicy and dripping with flavor.  Just thinking of it is making my tummy grumble and mouth water...The service was friendly and attentive.  They kept filling our water and wanted to make sure we were happy with our food.  The prices were reasonable and portions just right.  Overall we were extremely happy with our meal and will definitely be returning!'
