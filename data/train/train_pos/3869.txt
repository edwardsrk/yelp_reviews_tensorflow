b"When we moved into the area we found this place and I used them once for a shampoo and nail trimming for my old man, Roscoe (Chihuahua mix). They were nice and affordable, I however was still going to try one more groomer in the area, before calling anywhere home. Well Roscoe had other plans, a week later he got into the trash and was covered in bbq sauce right when I was on my way out of the house. I took him back to All Dogs Go To Bev, without calling and they happily took him in and cleaned him up for me while I was out running errands with my kids. Now both of my dogs go here because it's hard to find such good customer service, especially on this side of town! Clean, affordable, good with my pets! All around win in my book."
