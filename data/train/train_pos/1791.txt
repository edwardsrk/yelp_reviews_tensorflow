b"I went here once for a DJ night and love love loved the place. Not just because of beer selection, not just because the staff were friendly and nice, and not just because everyone there was so fun.The bar itself has a great setup, lots of room, and feels like a cozy bar home. Love the name, love the decor, love everything about it.And I didn't even know they had brunch! Sounds exciting.The only downfall: I'm usually too lazy to go all the way up to Bloor. Yes, I know that is supremely lazy. But I sense I will be coming back. For brunch and brunch cocktails."
