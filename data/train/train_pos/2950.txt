b'This review is for 4.5 stars.I had a great experience at Hobak.  Even after months of being open, the lines are always incredible.  There will be a wait and they do not take reservations, just just be aware.  But once you get to the table you have a perfect meal with tons of food at a reasonable price.  This is a great venue to take friends from out of town, the family, or even as a date night.  We had the pork and beef marinated platter.  Cooked for us to perfection, this is for sure not a "2 person" plate like the menu states.  With drinks and bonchon, this is easily a 3 person, or probably a 4 person platter.  They have the typical soju as well.  Service was good and the waiter was actually talking it up as he was cooking so it wasn\'t awkward or anything which is nice at a place like this.My main issue with Hobak was that it was Americanized.  They didn\'t have many of the sauces and bonchon options that you would see at a more authentic place and instead stood firm with sriracha as their hot sauce and bok choy as their veggie. COme here for a top Korean BBQ experience in Vegas.  These places have become hot lately and are popping up all over, but Hobak is still right up their in the top 3 for sure.'
