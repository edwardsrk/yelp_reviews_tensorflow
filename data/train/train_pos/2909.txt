b"We ordered delivery from Barros and got an XL pepperoni and 24 wings. The pizza here is AMAZING! It's hard to go anywhere else, get pizza, and say it's good after eating Barro's. The whole pizza, cheese, sauce, crust, pepperoni, and spices make this pizza extremely tasty. Again, I cannot reiterate how good it tastes. The wings, were meh, and a little soggier than what I prefer. The buffalo sauce tasted good, but I think the wings would be better if the either fried them or baked them a little longer. I wanted to give them 5 stars overall but feel all items should be up to par to earn this rating. The wings need a little work but were not bad. The pizza is for sure 5 stars. The price is decent too."
