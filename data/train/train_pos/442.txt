b"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! The location is right in the heart of Chinatown but it doesn't make you feel like it...like you're cramped in a small restaurant, touching elbows with the next couple. It's very spacious - you have options of sitting at the bar, nicely spaced out tables, or booths accommodating large groups. We're addicted to pho hence our regular check-ins here! This is one of our favorite spots in town. Pho Tai Nam is my go-to dish to order. The secret is in the broth and it is delicious. My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves to mix it up. He likes the Pork Belly Buns, Hot Pepper Wings, and always has room to devour those Crispy Egg Rolls. I think the Vietnamese Coffee is to die for.I love Happy Hour! Monday thru Friday 3pm-7pm and Sunday 12am-3am. There are specials on drinks and appetizers."
