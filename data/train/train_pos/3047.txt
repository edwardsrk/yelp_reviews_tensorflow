b'Excellent food, service and ambiance! The tapas are truly infused with spanish flavours. We had the Octopus, Dates wrapped in Bacon and Figs with Goat Cheese, but if I have to pick a favourite it will be the Foie Gras "sliders", they were unbelievably tasty!! We had the \'Paella Patria\' you could see the saffron, beautifully done. For dessert I ordered the Chocolate pudding, it was sublime, rich, decadent. Infused with olive oil and salt, it couldn\'t make me happier. Ohh I just can\'t wait to be back!!'
