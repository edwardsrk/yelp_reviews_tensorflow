b'Any place that has jars of candies lined along the ceiling is your first clue that I\'ll love it. Second clue? The fact that ALL they serve is dessert. This Marble Slab Creamery is tucked away in the corner at the food court inside Market Mall. It\'s hard to miss however because when you step into the vicinity, all you can smell is the sweet scent of waffle cones. And considering you can smell THAT in the middle of a food court - that\'s pretty damn good!Their ice cream is made daily in-store and they definitely hold true to their slogan: "The Freshest Ice Cream On Earth".Marble Slab has an insane amount of flavours. Everything from Vanilla Cinnamon to Cotton Candy. And of course to celebrate the holidays, they also have Egg Nog and Pumpkin Flavours. Oh, and did I mention that you get to choose mixins?!?!? So not ONLY do you get to pick the flavour of ice cream you want, but you get to pick the mixins you want mixed in. We\'re talkin anything from chocolate bar pieces, to fresh fruit. So it\'s basically like a blizzard or a Yogen Fruz but in a cone, and with the freshest, most delicious ice cream you can imagine. Once you\'ve picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it\'s all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you\'re good to go.I haven\'t even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.I know, RIGHT?!?!??!If you hadn\'t guessed it already, I\'m definitely a fan. In fact, it\'s \'Ice Cream Break\' time! See ya there!'
