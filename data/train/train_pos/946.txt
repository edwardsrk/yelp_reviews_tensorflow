b'Great service, super nice managerial staff, and supurb food.We went one Saturday night for a belated birthday dinner. After a 15 minute wait (no reservation so to be expected) we were seated. The waiter we had was shockly good! He was formal and poliet, he did not try to act like we were his best friends but that he was providing a service to us. His manners were outstanding. The food was made perfectly and our order came in exactally how we ordered it. We got the mozzerella cheese fonda as our appitizer. We split a chicken alfredo dish, which they separated for us as our main course with salad and soup. We finished the meal with dessert, white rasberry cheesecake. At the end of our meal the manager came to our table to ask how everything was. We of course let him know the service was great!'
