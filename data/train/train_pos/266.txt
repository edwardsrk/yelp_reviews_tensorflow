b"Clean, friendly and very user friendly. Close to Wonderland and a great choice of fun for a rainy day. Reasonably priced and food available for purchase. They are generous with portions as well. Shoes are typical and very used as expected. Bring your own socks!!!! Sensors for lanes actually work! Don't pass the line:)"
