b"After all the reviews and social media posts I have been seeing about this place I decided to stop here during film festival week. This is definitely a neighborhood bar. The bartenders seemed to know everyone who stopped in and what they were drinking. The bartenders/staff were very friendly and welcomed me as soon as I walked in. I love how cheap the drinks are here! I paid $2.50 each for my vodka sodas and $7 for my huge chicken salad sandwich. I think this is a spot that everyone needs to check out at least once and I've heard the corned beef is stellar!"
