b'I\'ve been coming here every Thursday now for awhile and really like it. I meet a running group close by and after our run we normally meet at Blasted Barley for a couple beers & fries. For as often as I\'ve been here, that\'s pretty much all I\'ve tried. One time our waitress convinced a few of us to try what she referred to as "vegetarian" wings (mozzarella sticks that are covered in the "dynamite" wing sauce) that were very tasty. The fries here are yummy as well. They have a good HH for beer. All of the beers they brew themselves, plus all local beers are $3 a pint until 7. The couple of beers they brew that I\'ve tried were good (I really like the Orca, but they haven\'t had it in a couple months). They also do a "lucky lady" special ($3 for a "surprise" brown bag canned beer). Sometimes a few of us will try this. A lot of the time it\'s Keystone or Nati Ice, often times they\'ll have something good from San Tan brewery. It\'s never been overly crowded when we come, and service can be hit or miss, but it\'s never terrible.'
