b"This place is right around the corner from my apt so I've been dying to check it out. My roommate and I made our way over around 9pm on a Saturday. The atmosphere was very low-key and casual while still giving off a slightly higher end feel. It wasn't crowded and we were seated right away. We didn't bother ordering any food, but rather stuck exclusively to the drink menu. I got the seasonal BLVD martini, which was delicious and a great summer option. Though the price was steep ($10 for one drink) overall the experience was really enjoyable!"
