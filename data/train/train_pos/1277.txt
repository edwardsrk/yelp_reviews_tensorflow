b"I came here for the Lego Kids Fest, and as intimidating as that sounds, the convention center staff and the Lego associates kept this event running smoothly.  The convention center is very clean and easily accessible for anyone wanting to come in and visit, with elevators and escalators located everywhere for you to use.  With a Starbucks located inside, as well as a Bojangles, you really wouldn't have to go too far for all of your basic needs."
