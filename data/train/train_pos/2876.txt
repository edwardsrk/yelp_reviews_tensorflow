b"OK people Blush is not a club at all but a lounge. So if you are looking for the mega Vegas club experience, I would go to Tryst instead.But I had a good time at Blush. It was a cute lil spot in the Wynn where it's not super crowded like the bigger places and it's a nice spot to stop by at before headin' to Tryst. And just like Tryst, it has that indoor/outdoor motif so you can either dance inside the club or go outside to the patio and smoke a cig. Hey my BF and I didn't have to pay cover here or at Tryst and got walked up to the front of the line so regardless, we had fun. Yeah we had to go outside to sit down for awhile but while we cooled down we also got to gamble! Music was okay - they would have spurts of bad music mixed with the good but oh well. I was too drunk to care and when I didn't like it, I just went out to gamble and came back in when the music picked up."
