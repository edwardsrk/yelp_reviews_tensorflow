b"Great ice cream!Fun place near Old Port on the Square to get ice cream.  We had four different flavors.  We enjoyed each of them.  The employees are efficient, but they weren't overly friendly.  (Possible language barrier?). We ate outside and it was an enjoyable way to end our arrival day in Montreal."
