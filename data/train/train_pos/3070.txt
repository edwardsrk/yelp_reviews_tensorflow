b'Came here on a Saturday for dinner.. there was a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar for a drink until the table was ready.Ended up ordering food at the bar and giving away our table because Emily was so cool!!Seriously, my favorite bartender. EVER.Attentive but not annoying.Handled everything (being the only bartender there) very well.. timely and efficiently.Drinks: Moscow Mule and Vietnamese DonkeyBOTH SO GOOD.Food: Lobster Pho.. 5 stars. DeliciousOx Tail Fried Rice: 5 stars. Really good, and actually had good chunks of meat and a yummy over easy egg on top. Fried calamari: big portion (we had leftovers) really good kinda spicy dipping sauce! Overall, 5 million stars'
