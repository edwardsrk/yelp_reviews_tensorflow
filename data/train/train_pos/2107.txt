b"I love a gourmet burger and this place has a fabulous burger: great quality meat, sharp cheddar cheese, crispy bacon and on a toasted pretzel roll.  I substituted fries for Brussels spouts and they were delicious. They have an expansive list of local beers on draft, with representation from many of Charlotte's local breweries.  I'd pass on the beer cheese soup next time; it wasn't very flavorful or creamy."
