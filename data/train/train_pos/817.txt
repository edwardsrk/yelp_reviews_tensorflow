b"We loved the choice of 3 tacos. We ordered the Carne Asada (LOVED), Rotisserie chicken (hated the sauce on top), and Estella's fish (loved as well). Took almost 10 minutes for someone to come take our order and they weren't busy. Again, took a good 10 minutes after we were completely done eating for someone to check in on us."
