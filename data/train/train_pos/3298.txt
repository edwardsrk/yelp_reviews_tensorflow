b"Ordered food to go, so I haven't had the full experience, but as far as I'm concerned, I love this place already. The Florentine and the Smoky Eggs were both delicious, although they didn't come exactly as described in the menu. Customer service was on point from the moment I walked through the door until I left. I sat on the patio while I waited for my food and soaked up some of the sunshine. It felt like I was back in Italy. Great vibes all around."
