b"Here's why I don't write reviews for Chinese restaurants: I have to look up their English names... It's so popular that I didn't try it until recently. The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more. I like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish.Dan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me.The noodle with wonton is flavorless to me. The soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it.I'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.The appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...The owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners."
