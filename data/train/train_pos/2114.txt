b'We come here every visit to Vegas, so once a year? And every year the food gets better and better. I always order the combination beef noodles aka boat noodles. Excellent! Almost comparable to the boat soup in Thaitown, California. This time I also ordered the papaya salad lao style. It was okay. I can make better, hah!'
