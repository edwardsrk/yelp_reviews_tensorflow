b"I love Tryst because it clean eating, whenever I feel like something healthy and easy, Tryst is always on my list. The fish taco's are amazing. The presentation is always fantastic and super tasty. The service sometimes on a busy night is a little slow and could be improved a little but I'm always willing to wait as they are really friendly. There also could be a little more range on the menu."
