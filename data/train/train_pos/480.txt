b"We went there to try this non Asian food restaurant right inside of Chinatown. We had the ribeye taco and also the pork and mushroom tacos. I tried two meat ones, both are ok, not bad but I feel it missing a bit seasoning. The baked or grilled spring onions are quite flavourful,but the portion is way too small! We paid 4or 5& for just 4 pieces of spring onions? That's just not funny."
