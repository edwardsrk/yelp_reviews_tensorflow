b'I must say that I was very happy that they brought back my favorite menu item braised beef and cheese tortellini! Ordered an appetizer Lasagna Fritta which was delicious! Ordered some white moscato wine which was very good and the hostess was kind enough to give me a free glass of red moscato just to try :)'
