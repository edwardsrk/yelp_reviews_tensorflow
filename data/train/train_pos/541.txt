b"I've been coming here for a little over a year and love it. The girls are great and remember you and it's always very  clean and a happy atmosphere. My only feedback is for the girls that open to actually arrive to work on time. I usually come early in the mornings due the night shift that I work, and there have been four instances in the last month where I arrive around 8:15 on a week day and there is still no one here. I'll usually sit around and wait, but it's a little unfair to expect your customers to understand why a business isn't open on time. Today the girl got there around 8:15 and proceeded to lock the door behind her and didn't open it again until 830. Definitely love this place and would always recommend it but definitely think the openers need to be a bit more punctual."
