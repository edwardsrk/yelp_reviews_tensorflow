b"my friend and I had a marvelous time at the gallery, though admittedly we didn't leave the first floor. we got lucky because I found out that free night coincided with our very first night ever in Canada!I really loved the room that juxtaposes the French Academy style with more progressive impressionists. I couldn't stop staring at the big Monet landscape. I also thought the temporary exhibition of Japanese photos from Hiroshima and Nagasaki were really special, albeit sad. My friend particularly enjoyed the medieval stuff. all in all, a nice mix, and a good way to spend an evening"
