b"South Point is just so far from everything else on the strip, why go here?You end up seeing all the great points about this place.- Lots of unnecessary space throughout the casino and hotel room, you feel like you can move around freely.- A good mix of food places, although there are pretty much generic themes of ethnic foods, I found it good to have alot of options.- Smoke smell on the casino floor was not as heavy compared to places on the strip, I think this goes with the unnecessary ceiling space which I can't complain about.- Free Shuttle to and from the airport, it is first-come first-serve, but both trips to and from weren't full.I guess the only bad point was again the distance from the strip, if you don't use any of the strip shuttle, it's about $30 to Caesars Palace one way.It'll be hard to come back for a Vegas trip here, but for a convention, not a bad place to stay. Plus the room prices are very reasonable."
