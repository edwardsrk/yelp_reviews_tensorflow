b"I was referred to Rick through a trusted friend and Rick has been nothing short of incredibly professional and a real pleasure to work with. I had to have a very large picture window replaced as well as a shower door. He came exactly when we scheduled the time to measure and returned within a week to replace both glass pieces. He went above and beyond to make sure both glass pieces were installed as perfect as possible and also checked every other shower door in my home to ensure they didn't need any adjustments as I have two young children at home. I wish every contractor was as easy and professional to work with."
