b'I was there for the first time yesterday.  I received a gift certificate for my birthday from a friend that has gone here for years.  I was EXTREMELY impressed!!  She did not try to fight my calick to go a different way, she cut my hair to lay as it normally does.  It took no more than 25 - 30 minutes for a consult, wash, cut and style. I love the cut and my husband even loves it.  (this from a man that never gets excited about my haircuts)  I will be going back!!'
