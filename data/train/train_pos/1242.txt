b"Came for a weekend skate with my girlfriend and her little sister. Employees were all very nice, and courteous. Interior design was a bit lacking, as building is pretty dated and little to no effort was made to cover up the cinderblock construction. Seemed very 80s or 90s but not really in a good way. Food prices were good, but food itself was lackluster. I wanted a slice of pizza that was advertised on the menu and was told slices were not available and I'd have to buy a whole pizza that would take about 30 minutes to bake. Settled for a hot dog and watched as the stale bun crumbled apart after the first bite, but I guess I shouldn't expect a whole lot when it was $2."
