b"I am such a fan of Bobby Flay (or any Food Network personality, for that matter) that I gravitate towards his restaurants, even in cities known for having other bigger, better, badder eateries (NYC, Las Vegas, etc.) Mesa Grill is a spacious, comfortable, contemporary spot located in Caesar's Palace.The bf & I walked in at 10:30m p.m. without a reservation & were seated promptly. The restaurant was still about 30% full. Our waitress was patient, energetic & did not rush us through our meal. 5 stars for service & for checking on us often.Food, gorgeous, food:- bread basket: loved the blue & yellow corn muffins- appetizer: tiger shrimp with corn tamale (not my favorite thing-corn was more dense than fluffy, shrimp was slightly fishy.)- side dish: double baked potato (loved the subtle spice & heat from the horseradish.)- bf's entree: new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin- my entree: fillet rubbed filet mignon (well done & still tender & juicy. huge portion.)- desserts: (yes plural.) the bf & i shared a slice of coconut cake & i brought home the cookie sampler (6 different delicious cookies, 2 of each: snickerdoodle, biscotti, nutella/chocolate sticks, brownie bites with peanut butter icing, pine nut cookie, chocolate chip with nuts.) Awesomeness to the 10th power.Total: $135 (not including tip.) I am not a cheap date (well, ok, sometimes I am, but not today.)"
