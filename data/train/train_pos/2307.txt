b"Just left and it was my second visit. I really love everything I've ordered so far! The butter pecan shake is to DIE for. You get pecans in every sip, it's amazing. I am not a soda drinker at all but I LOVE the tractor soda and I wish there was somewhere I could purchase it! The only thing I didn't like today was how long everything took. It already took us 45 minutes to drive there, another 30+ minutes of waiting to order and 30+ to get out food. Our food also came out all separate. We got our milkshake first, 10 minutes later my bf got his burger and 15minutes later I got my pizza."
