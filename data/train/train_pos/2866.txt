b'D\'s is just a great place to hang out. We biked here that single nice day in April and had lunch. The atmosphere is very chill, and the servers just wait on whoever needs help, which is cool. I am not a beer drinker but the beer cave is so impressive! I\'m sure I could have found something special but wasn\'t in a browsing mood. Another thing, when I heard "dogs" I thought great - not veg friendly! But mistaken! They had tons of veg options! Not only veggie dogs are offered, but they have a great hummus platter, salads and more! I LOVED the hummus... so tasty! All in all, a great experience! I would love to come back and watch a daytime game here and grab a tasty bite!'
