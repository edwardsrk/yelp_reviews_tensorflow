b"The pho was great and the soup was very tasty. The only reason I gave 4-star (I would go 4.4 but Yelp only do integers) because they don't have enough menus and it took so long for them to cook the pho. We sit there for at least 5 minutes until 1 menu was available and the waiter gave it to us and we gotta share. I know the restaurant was kinda packed when we were there but 25 minutes for 2 bowls of pho was a little bit long. We saw every employee was working very hard but to be honest a clear job allocation would help the situation. Personally speaking, the tile they used on the floor can be very slippery for the waiters especially when they are holding 4 heavy bowls with full noodle soups."
