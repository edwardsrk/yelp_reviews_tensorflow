b"We were traveling in the area and our first visit we both ordered seafood dishes and were less than impressed. My brother's shrimp gnocchi dish was fishy smelling and tasting, my crab fish dish tasted like cheap frozen fish or old fish. However, the 2nd night we ordered Italian and were very satisfied. We enjoyed both the Mediterranean and the Caesar salads and then a pizza and a stuffed pizza (their version of a calzone). Definitely go Italian."
