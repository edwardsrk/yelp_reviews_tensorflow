b"This guy is the best. My washing machine pump went out and the company that was originally suppose to show up on a Saturday never did. Late Saturday I called Allstate and he was easy to talk to on the phone and assured me he would be at my house between 7 and 8 am Sunday morning. He was on time and replaced the pump in no time. With all the shady businesses in Vegas it's nice to finally deal with a down to earth businessman. . I have found my repairman from now on. Thank you so much"
