b"I had a wonderful time at this steakhouse ordering from the bar.  The bartender was attentive and offered me some wine tastes to see what would go best with my meal.There was a small mistake on my appetizer, but the one that they brought me by accident was awesome and much better then what I had actually ordered so that was great.  And they took off my first glass of wine which just shows how awesome the service is.The skirt steak I ordered was wonderful and I was almost tearful when it was gone; the side of scalloped potatoes were equally amazing.  It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil.I think that they were supposed to give me some complimentary fries, but I never got any until I called up my friend to come and join me; and then I ate some of his.But I enjoyed the meal so much I didn't mind the few mistakes.If I had more time I would have come back!"
