b"I've been to the Fashion Show and Town Square locations, but I'll just review my most recent experience at this location, which I like just as much as the others. I set an appointment online with no problem. Arrived about 15-20 minutes early, but I was greeted right away and asked to check in with another representative. Cool beans. Noticed they were slightly behind, but I'm not in a rush, plus going in I had expectations of them being busy. It's Apple. Gah... I wish I could remember my tech's name 'cause she was just as nice and courteous - just remember it starting with a D. She let me fully explain my iPhone problem, then she walked me through diagnosing with their speakers. She literally could tell that the difference I had with it compared to hers. Before trying to replace my phone, she wanted to know if I had any questions for her and I brought up how I bought the device from my cell provider. Not wanting to cause any problems with them, she wrote me a notice to bring to them just in case they wanted proof that the device needed to be replaced. All courteous and thoughtful. Other than my experience, I can commend them on trying to accommodate/help a mom and her 2 kids. The little brother overheard the patron say she had the wrong appointment time, but she had been waiting for awhile and had other appointments elsewhere. Before they could get to me, they helped her out first. Her tech was nice, trying to be personable with her and the kids while diagnosing the problem. Took him about 10-15 minutes to help her out, hopeful that she'd make it to their other engagements on time, and thankful for her patience."
