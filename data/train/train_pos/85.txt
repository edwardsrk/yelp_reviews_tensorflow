b"Yummmy!!!Last weekend I was visiting Scottsdale with my mom and we met up with a friend of mine here. That was definitely a good choice :)Pros-- Lots of options on the menu, and they are clearly explained so there is minimal confusion- Every dish has the option to be changed (perfect for picky eaters like myself!)- Generous portion sizes- Fair prices, nothing was over $20- The staff was very personable! Such nice people who love what they do!- Efficient serviceCons-- I ordered a side of noodles and never got them :(But above all else DON'T FORGET TO:TRY THEIR NEW SPRING ROLLS BTW. I forgot the name, but it's the Chicken ones on their latest menu. SOOOO good!"
