b"My go-to spot whenever I'm craving chicken and rice (since Halal Guys is too far) and it always hits the spot! The chicken on the rocks is my all time favourite, with little spice (their hot sauce is super spicy!!) and extra garlic sauce. Wish this place was around when I went to school right by this plaza!"
