b"Best pick-me-up EVER.Vegas usually means being nocturnal and forgetting to eat. Aka during EDC weekend, I somehow didn't eat a meal for 26 hours. Yes, horrible planning on my part...  so I was ecstatic to eat some filling ramen!!Definitely a fun place to visit and under $10! When we walked in, we were greeted by girls dressed in cute outfits and wearing wigs. It was fun to pinpoint the anime posters adorning the walls, too.After flipping through the manga-styled menu, all of us ended up getting the Shoyru ramen. Yum yum. Perfect way to recover. Really, no complaints. Our server was helpful and the food tasted good. Not too salty."
