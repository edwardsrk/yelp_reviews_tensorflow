b"Cozy. Colorful. Lots of places to sit and work. Nice staff, good food and pastries - this is a great place to meet for a cup of coffee, sit and study, or grab and go.The coffee is absolutely fantastic and seems very consistent. They brew Ancora coffee, which is made right in Madison and very, very good. I rate their coffee better than Peet's or Starbucks, both of which are available nearby. Coffeebytes only opened a few years ago, but it's really flourished. Nice to see a local business doing well!"
