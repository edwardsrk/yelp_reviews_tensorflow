b'This is a great little neighborhood pet food market that also has grooming available.  More on that later.  There are a whole host of foods to choose from including very expensive premium brands.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful and will help you make the choices that you need.  I always give them my phone number each visit to look up the items I got last time and they help me find them, as products do tend to move month to month.  There are lots of fresh made treats and snacks for your furry friends.They have a groomer on staff, but best of all are self service tubs of various sizes that you can bath your own animals.  Depending on what you pay, you can get different kinds of shampoos and skin conditioners to bath them in - and then move them to a drying tub.  This is a great little mom and pop place.'
