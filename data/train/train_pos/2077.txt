b"So many great choices. Glad that we had a large group to order a bunch of dishes to try. The favorite was steam egg custard with lobster roe, perfect smoothCooked just right, tasty dish to go with white rice. The second favorite was the salt egg with bitter melon, a specialty that you don't find in too many restaurant. braised whole duck, spare ribs, tofu with cod fish,fry noodles with seafoods and snow pea leaves are all delicious! Service was good. Great dinning experience especially when the check comes, so inexpensive, such a bargain for a great meal!"
