b'I\'m forever looking for a spot where breakfast is not going to cost a ridiculous amount. I found this gem today at "Our Spot" on Kensington Market. I have nothing but great things to say, our waiter was excellent, our coffee kept flowing, an actual huge bottle of water was left on the table at our disposal. I had a breakfast sandwich and a regular coffee, refilled three times, all for less than six dollars!My friend had a delicious omelette, a flavored latte and fresh orange juice, so she paid a little more but was also very happy with her choices.They left us alone to talk and eat in peace, never felt rushed for occupying the table, even after we were long finished eating.I highly recommend a visit!'
