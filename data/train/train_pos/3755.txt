b"Absolutely delicious! This was my first time here (or having a poke bowl in general) and it's similar to like a chipotle or subway where you tell them what you want in your bowl. My friend had the sushi burrito and it looked amazing. Fresh ingredients and quality tasting fish. I devoured my bowl and I'll definitely be back. Also the place is very clean and has modern interior design which is pleasing to the eye. If you're hesitant about coming here or even trying poke, don't be."
