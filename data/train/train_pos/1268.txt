b"I, along with three friends, went to this location on Saturday night. It was very busy, and there were lines, but they moved along pretty quickly. The Dining Host table gave us an estimate for the wait for a table, and they were pretty much on the mark! We played several of the MANY, many games until we received the text message that our table was ready. I was impressed with the menu!  Great selections, including beer and mixed drinks. The only reason that this review is not 5-star goes to food service. Let me be clear... the selection was great, and the food quality was great, but the service was struggling. We had a wonderful  waitress - very friendly and knowledgeable, but either she was overwhelmed, OR they aren't properly organized. I don't attribute that to her, but to food service management. We had a very good meal, but it took a long time. The waitress got her full tip, management got four stars instead of five.All that being said - go there!  It is so much fun! Everyone enjoyed the evening and we will return soon."
