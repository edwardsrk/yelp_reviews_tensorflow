b'We have dropped by 2 days in a row for hot drinks and pastry. An eclectic looking place with wifi as an added bonus, which my husband greatly appreciates.Their Americano...8 oz which i always like with 2 shots was pretty decent yesterday, though they were cleaned out of pastry except scones (which were okay)  Today I requested tea but a not too sweet variety and tried a chai spiced latte, which was delightful. Muffins and cookies are baked in house.It seems a pretty popular spot and one we would return to again.'
