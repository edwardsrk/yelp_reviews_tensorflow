b"My mum celebrated her *21st* birthday a couple of weeks ago and her pal dropped off a cake from Mon K Patisserie. It was delicious so my mum and I decided to check out the store today to try their other desserts.They opened 6 months ago so this place is fairly new; however, the baker has experience in many fine Toronto establishments. It's definitely a nice addition to the shopping strip along Coxwell. Mon K is a small family-run business with a very French flare. When my parents lived in Paris, there were many cafes and patisseries that looked like Mon K.Seating is limited, but if you do snag a table, it's a nice place to relax over coffee and something to eat. Their pastries are both savory and sweet; they also have sandwiches, soups, coffee, and chocolate. We ordered a few things today, which were all FOUR STARS:Egg Salad with Avocado and Tomato in a croissant Spinach QuicheCreamy Mushroom SoupGreen Tea TiramisuFrench Style Short CakeBoth the tiramisu and short cake come in a cute plastic container.Good for: sweets, coffee, lunch"
