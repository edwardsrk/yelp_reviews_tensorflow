b"Satisfied caffeine fiend.  I decided to branch out from my daily starbucks visit and went on a coffee date with a friend of mine at Avenue instead.The place is quite small but spacious and I found the decor to be a fabulous black and white, creative yet simple space. The people are very friendly and efficient and they serve illy coffee!!! SCORE!!!!! Granted I only went there for a coffee, the food selection looked very fresh, healthy and hearty, and the prices were quite reasonable. It's a great place to grab a snack or beverage alone or with a small group of people/on a break..... as it has an intimate, yet casual atmosphere!"
