b'Happened to be walking by on Taco Tuesday.  SO, I decided to stop in and try some tacos.  Got a couple beef and pork and chicken.  Very good!!  Great actually!  The reason I gave a 4 star rating is because I got these to go, and I jumped in the car and only had to go a few miles away.  They were wrapped in foil, but, they were not hot when I got back to work.   I wonder if they could warm the shells, too--just a suggestion.  BUT nice, nice guys who work there and the tacos are delicious!!'
