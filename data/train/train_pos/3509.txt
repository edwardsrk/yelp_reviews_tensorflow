b"My boyfriend loves this place! They have about the nicest staff you could ask for. There's no stereotypical haughty, know-it-all, jerkhole comic book clerk (think the Simpson's comic book guy) at Samurai. They know their product and enjoy discussing comics, toys and anime with anyone and everyone. Their selection of current comics is unbeatable, although they really could use more back issues. When the death of Captain America issue came out, they sold out pretty much immediately. Because the owner knew my boyfriend was a fan and a regular, he saved an issue just for him. Ya can't ask better service than that!"
