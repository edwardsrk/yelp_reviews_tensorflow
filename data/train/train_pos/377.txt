b"We have been there twice now.  The fish tacos are absolutely the best I've ever eaten in a restaurant, period, and I am a fan of fish tacos.The coconut shrimp appetizer is also very good.I gave it only four stars simply because we have only tried a couple of items.Need to try the clam chowder (when it cools down a bit), and the fish pasta before I can give it the 100% five star rating!!!That said, the fish taco's are a 10 STAR in my book."
