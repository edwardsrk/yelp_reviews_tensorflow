b'Stopped by for a second to grab a quick pick-up dinner for my family.Our pita sandwich with steak and hummus was delicious! Rice and lettuce bowls were ok too. Unfortunately, our lentil soup was way too thick and tasted like burned lentils. Also, their steak had a weird texture... it tasted as if it had been boiled, not grilled. Overall, we were satisfied with the food quality.'
