b'Grant his crew have been amazing. Had a few different repairs done there and very happy. Got a used car that knew needed work. Took it to BMW and they quoted me $2700 for the cooling system. Munich did a full repair on that, plus a valve cover gasket plus fixed another leak and found that my check engine light was bc a bad air/fuel mixture and the total repair was less than one at BMW. Then had my shift mechanism go out after I picked it up from those repairs and was like "this is weird". Talked to Grant and he said there wasn\'t a direct connection to their work as they were in a different part of the car but was willing to fix it at cost using a used part with a warrantee and it runs great. Had them do a little more like a battery and stuff and they will defiantly be my shop of choice. Having a German car isn\'t cheap but finding someone in the battle with you is key!'
