b"Stopped by for the complimentary glass of champagne for Delano hotel guests, and enjoyed the great view of the Vegas strip from a peaceful and quiet setting. Typical pricing for cocktails and small plates, friendly staff, and again... the view cannot be beat! Classy, relaxed location with a great vibe, especially compared to the craziness of the rest of the Vegas strip. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here for drinks or appetizers and to take in the view."
