b"The salad is unbelievable... my wife and I have been coming to one location of the restaurants for two decades, wither in North Royalton, Macedonia or Twinsburg, and they always have great food.   But the salad.... amazing!   My wife is vegetarian but I'm a big meat eater but we both usually get the large salads."
