b'very awesome dive bar. the staff is super friendly. although we were their as tourists one of the things I liked about this place was that it wasn\'t flooded with tourists like the rest of the bars in downtown. we met a group of friendly locals and had some friendly bouts in billiards all night. good beers on tap. id definitely recommend the "mad &noisy IPA".'
