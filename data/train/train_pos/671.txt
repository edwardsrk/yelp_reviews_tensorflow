b"We came here with 2 other couples. We usually eat out once a month. We made reservations 6 weeks ago. We were all looking forward to eating at Becketts Table. We sample a different Phoenix restaurant each month. This is the 6th restaurant this year that we have tried. The restaurant was the right amount of noise. We were able to carry on decent conversations here compared to some other places we tried. The beet appetizer was like nothing I've ever tasted. The sweetness of the beets and the spice accompanying it was unique and delicious. The Mac n Cheese appetizer was creamy and comforting. My husband and I split the chopped vegetable salad. This was very refreshing in the summer heat. The pork OssoBucco was tender and a little too salty. It was accompanied by a spaetzle which was even more salty. The beef short ribs were tender and tasty. Maybe a touch too much salt. 3 people at our table had the salmon. It must have been good because they did not say a word. The broccolini side was perfect as far as sides go. I'd like to go back and try this place again."
