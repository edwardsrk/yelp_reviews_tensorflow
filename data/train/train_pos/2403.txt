b"the perfect place for an afternoon pint!stopped in around noon on Saturday for a pint, but as soon as the waitress mentioned 'spicy caesar' i got one of those instead - Martie makes a killer one! my sister & I shared some little snack type things - bacon wrapped dates, pulled pork slider, deep fried Shepards pie balls - and while none of it was mind blowingly awesome, it was all still good, and together with the setting, the service, and the caesar, it was a pretty great experience!"
