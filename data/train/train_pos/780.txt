b"Service is typically quick. This particular trip I had to wait 15 minutes but there were 3 people in front of me. Whenever I've come to this location in the past I was usually in and out. This location used to be in south hills village mall. They also used to be $10 for eyebrows but are now $12. The techs are always nice and friendly. You can pay cash or card and you can tip on your card as well."
