b"One of the best pizza places in Old Montreal. This place is packed during the weekend, so don't forget to make reservations in advance. The ambiance here is trendy. A fancy cast iron chandelier hangin, 80's music playing in the background, what's not to like about this place.  We ordered the Arancino, Antipasti, Meatballs and pizza's. The Arancino's are delish. Deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce.   Antipasti was ok. Meatballs were delicious too. Now for the pizza's........Not one of  the best pizza's I've had, but they were good. We tried the Bosco in Bianco, Capriciosa & Cotto E Bocconcini.  The crust is flavorful. Woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, Though I prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt.  The Capriciosa was interesting as I'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. It actually tastes really good. Also ask for the spicy oil. That adds a lot of flavor to it.Definitely worth a visit ...... Again & again...... At least for the Arancino's  Food -  GoodService - FriendlyAmbiance - TrendyWorth the money - Aw yissss"
