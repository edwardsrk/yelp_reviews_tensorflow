b"Visited Captain Steve ' s for the first time today.  There were 11 in our party. Our servers were great. They had 2 large parties at the same time.  But we NEVER felt neglected. Our food came to our table at one and it was all HOT! Everyone received the correct food, our drinks were maintained full, and the amount of food was generous. We order fish, shrimp, broiled items, & steaks. Smiles all around.  I WILL return whenever I visit the Charlotte area."
