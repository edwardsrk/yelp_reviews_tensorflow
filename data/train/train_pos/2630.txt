b"Excellent new sushi spot right around the corner from my house! how much better does it get than that? Tried the : Shrimp popper, Salmon Special, The Hanabi special, my absolute favorite roll was the Crispy rainbow i love the combination and sauce. I also tried the salmon poke and tuna poke i personally did not like the seaweed in the poke.  For dessert i tried the Honey Toast it was good, The bread was nice and chrispy but it's just hawaiian bread and vanilla ice cream with honey. Just a reminder fellow yelpers the umm 8.01 discount for Ayce has expired. Idkif they just have not gotten around to taking that down or just smart business lol ;) Either way give Hanabi a shot!"
