b"The best Steak Ive ever had.Ive tried steak from just about every place known for great steak and the Rib eye here is completely unbelievable. Charred just right but still perfectly medium, it was lightly flavored with pepper and salt thus letting the flavor of the meat shine through. For the four of us we had three entrees, Lamb- pretty good but I have had betterPrime rib- incredible but I have had better Au jus, though the cut and the meat was excellent. The portions were so big though that four people couldn't finish it all(we always share so that we can get the maximum variety of tastes)"
