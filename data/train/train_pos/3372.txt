b"Recently was there with a few friends. Have been in the service industry for nearly 20 year from bartender to security to GM and like. What I expect for service execution and attention are often rather high. The attention received from the staff was wonderful. Our bartender Cassandra was one fastest and attentive I've ever had the privilege to watch. A smile and a thank you with every single transaction as well her head on a constant swivel. Paying attention not only to guests but her teammates as well. As we had no food our drinks were never empty and water was offered at nearly every exchange. We'll be back again soon!"
