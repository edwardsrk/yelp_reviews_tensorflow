b"Dizzying array of everything under the sun...like the Matryoshka dolls of vintage stores. Just when you thought you've run out of racks of clothing to peruse, you turn a corner and boom, there's a whole other room hiding just beyond, waiting for you. It never ends......which is usually a good thing, unless you have a SO asleep in the car,  waiting for you. Allocate plenty of time, bring some snacks and water, and wander to your heart's content. Very fun, and lots of smile-inducing items. Some things are totally overpriced, but for unique pieces and especially the clothing, there are plenty of gems waiting to be found."
