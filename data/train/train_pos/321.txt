b"Breakfast at Bouchon in the Venetian.  We had Croque Madame, Corned Beef Hash, and Jambon et Oeufs.  My croque madame was serviced with slice of brioche, ham slices, another slice of brioche with a sunny side up egg on top and a white sauce on top.  There may have been other stuff between the broiche slices, I just don't remember.   To fill, I mean really fill up the rest of the plate, a huge mound of thinly sliced fries.  I would have liked the fries to be a little more crispy.  The sandwich was good.  Even though it looked small, it was a lot of food.  Corned Beef Hash was just how I liked it.  Corned in small cubes, potatoes about the same size.  Peppers and onions.  with your style of egg on top.  This is how, I think corned beef should be served.  5 stars for this meal.Ham and eggs were just ham and eggs, with some scallopped potatoes.  Nothing special about this meal.  For some reason it was $25 and in my opinion, shouldn't be more then the other meals.  The pan d'epi bread was good, with butter and the homemade jam.Overall, a good place for breakfast.  Good service."
