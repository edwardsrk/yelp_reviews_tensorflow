b"I have loved this place ever since it opened. I've never had a bad drink here, and I find it fascinating to watch the incredibly hipster staff make them with so much attention to detail. I love the way they serve you a glass of bubbly when you first get in.I also really enjoy the food - you should definitely consider ordering snacks to go with your cocktails! They rotate the menu so it's hard to keep up but everything has been delicious.What keeps me from giving it 5 stars? The prices. The price of even standard drinks (e.g. a gin and tonic) is a little high for my liking. I would come here all the time if it were just a tad less expensive! I still come here at least once a month because I just can't resist."
