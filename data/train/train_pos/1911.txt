b"Of all the Chinese I've had out here in suburbia, this place is the best by far. If you're going to eat there, the decor is rather simple... it's nice and clean for sure.... but generally when I order Chinese it's takeout anyway.Spring rolls and potstickers are top notch - pot stickers have the option of steamed or fried, which is nice (I prefer them steamed).All the main courses we've ordered from here have been awesome - no complaints at all. The people working there seem super nice too.Best Chinese in SW Charlotte for sure."
