b"Damn. First, I thought, $4.50 for a gelato and only one scoop of it...that's a lotta money even for Vegas.Then I saw the scoop. It's like 2 pretty big scoops pretending to be one. I ordered the blackberry one since I've been obsessed with blackberries lately and damn, it was good.A great light dessert before dancing the night away in Vegas."
