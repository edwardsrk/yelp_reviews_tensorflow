b"We had a taste for BBQ last Saturday and after seeing all the great reviews decided to try Twisted Cactus since it's so close to our house.  We were greeted quickly upon arrival and told we could sit anywhere we liked.  In just a few minutes the waiter brought menus and we ordered our drinks.  Food came up fairly quickly. My husband ordered the brisket, pork and potato salad with an extra side of Cole slaw.  I ordered brisket, ribs, fries and an extra side of Cole slaw.  The brisket was very tasty and served on Texas toast, but it was cold.  The pork was excellent and warm.  The ribs were outstanding and warm.  If the brisket would have been hot we would have given the meal five stars!  As for the sides, the fries were awesome, but the Cole slaw and potato salad weren't worth it - both were totally  tasteless.  Prices are reasonable.  Will we return?  Probably, when we want bbq and don't want to drive far."
