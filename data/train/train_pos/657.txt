b"What a concept! Open earlier than MVD, locate in a nice business complex, have pleasant staff!  These folks aren't just for renewals. I got my title, plate, and registration in short order, with a low fee.I'd give you 5 stars if the computer login worked and you didn't have to call IT or whatever.  But honestly, who deserves 5 stars? Aren't we inflating empirical rating systems by giving everyone in the world full credit for doing a clear-cut job fairly well?Great job!"
