b'We just dropped in on a weekend evening and the restaurant was packed. We were given 30 minutes wait time to be seated but after 10 minutes we were given our table.There are lots of food/pasta options on the menu; I tried the Olive Garden Trio which had 3 small portions of Lasagna/Parmesan Chicken/Pasta and everything tastes really good; portion was enough for 1 person.We tried couple of different wines by glasses and they were just OK. Overall good food quality, service was good, atmosphere was good, kid friendly environment.Price is a bit on the higher side. Location on the NE, parking availability is good.'
