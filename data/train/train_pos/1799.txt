b'Call me a bit biased but I LOVE Scottsdale stadium. The home of my beloved San Francisco Giants spring training site. The prices to catch game are little pricer than the other spring training stadiums but WELL worth it. The food is pretty good, for ball park food. The guy who shouts "lemonade lemonade like grandma made." Is everyone\'s favorite vender. So many memories have been made here over the years. However I do have to say the seating is horrible. More than half of the seats are bleacher seating and there are hardly any shady seats. We had bleacher seats this last time out there but ended up sitting in the grass for a time and then leaving early because it was just TOO DAM HOT... here\'s to hoping they work on the shade situations or add misters to the bleacher seats. Other down fall to these bleachers unlike ones at other stadiums is My husband has long legs and the bleacher seats have zero leg room. His knees end up on the person\'s back in front of him. I\'d rather not be packed in like a sardine either. I will be going back for another game soon, but hope that they make some changes for the fans that love to watch their winning team keep winning. go Giants!'
