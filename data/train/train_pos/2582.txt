b'Very recently during my stay in Windsor for business I ate lunch here.  The waitress was polite and attentive. I was told I needed to try the chicken delight which I did. Now I can say I know what a chicken delight is.  The order cake with a side which I hit the cedar salad.  The only thing I disliked the chicken delight has way too much creamy sauce as well as the salad   The salad was soggy. I ended up picking up the chicken from the wrap.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Really busy when I was there for lunch.'
