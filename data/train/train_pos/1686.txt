b"Brand spanking new!!!! Very spacious and clean rooms. Ashlee who helped us at the front desk is very sweet! They only give you two pillows on the bed but the sheets are SUPER soft! Softest hotel sheets I've ever slept on. Lol Breakfast leaves much to be desired! A waffle is the only hot thing you can get/make. No meat. No eggs. 3 cereals to pick from. Frozen sandwiches that you have to microwave. Yogurt. Toast & bagels.  We decided to go to Chick-fil-a around the corner. This is a pet friendly hotel and they don't have specific rooms that they use for guest with pets so if you have a severe pet allergy I wouldn't stay here. Overall it's a nice hotel and we would probably stay here again"
