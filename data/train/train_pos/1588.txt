b'This is a GREAT place, this is my second time coming here. I will come back, but  I am a little confused about a treatment I received at the salon about a month ago.  I was told I got a GK treatment. and it would last for about 8 washes, after one wash, my hair was back to the same thick hard to manage hair. Several of my friends have had the GK treatment and when I told them what was done to my hair, they assured me I did not get a GK treatment not unless the process has changed. My hair was washed, a product applied to my hair  I was placed under heat lights for about 15 mins, my hair was blown dry and flat ironed. Did i get a deep conditioner and paid the price for a GK treatment????  I have watched several videos on the GK treatment and I am sure I did not get the GK treatment. Its a great place but this has me worried.....'
