b"This place allows you to sample before you purchase, so that was very nice as I was trying to decide between peanut butter or coconut. Both were delicious, but I was craving peanut butter. The toppings were standard for most froyo places, but I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chocolate covered pretzels or yogurt pieces. I saw a lychee flavor which I thought was really cool. Perhaps I shall get that next time. The other flavors I could remember were blueberry (no sugar added), red velvet,  and vanilla. There were at least a few more.The seating and decor is cute."
