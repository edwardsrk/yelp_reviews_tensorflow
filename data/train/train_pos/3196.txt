b'July is my One year anniversary of practicing under Aina, an Authorized Ashtanga Teacher from Shri. K Pattabhi Jois Ashtanga Yoga institute in Mysore, India. My practice, knowledge and consistent dedication has progressed tremendously in 1 year versus to all of the years that I have practiced yoga on and off, for cleanses, challenges, girlie times, skittles and giggles....since 2001.I am so blessed to have this sacred space to traditionally practice the Ashtanga System. Aina has an amazing way to observe, adjust and allow you to grow into your own practice of Mysore Magic. Ashtanga (8 Limbs of Yoga) has completely changed my life. Ashtanga Yoga Las Vegas is the place for you to delve further into the world of sun salutations/Surya Namaskaras at 5:30 am as it was traditionally taught.'
