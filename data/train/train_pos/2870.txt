b"Was in town town for a concert and have friends that live here and we're raving about baguette cafe. I was so excited I started reading the menu on the plane so I knew I was going to try  the raisin pastry (sorry don't know the French name for it). It was perfectly crispy flaky on the outside with just a touch of custard running through curves. So good that I want one right now. We also tried the plain croissant and apricot croissant. I would definitely order the plain croissant. But I would pass on the apricot - it wasn't bad, but not nearly as good as the the other two. We ordered the quiche with pancetta. The flavor and the crust were amazing the only thing that held me back from a 5 star was the texture. It was so creamy (do they use cream cheese?)that at first I thought it was undercooked. It was still good - just was a little odd - but change is good right? The owners are from France and are the nicest! I'm so glad we don't have one of these in my neighborhood - because I wouldn't be able to resist dropping in every day!"
