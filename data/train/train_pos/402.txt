b"Ordered lunch using Foodora. I ordered the Chick'n Pot Pie with a market salad on a side, and a Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake. Overall, I was pleased with my order. This is a restaurant I'd try again. I gave 4/5 stars for the great pot pie. I wish the price was cheaper though but it's understandable since most vegan restaurants have this price point. See details on the food below!Chick'n Pot Pie = 4/5 I really enjoyed this one. When it arrived, it was a bit warm, which is expected since it was delivery. I bet if I had this in the restaurant it would have been hot, comforting, and perfect. It had potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, beans, peas, and a nice crust. I wish it had more chick'n though. The salad had spinach, shredded beets, red bell pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely filling and I'd order it again.Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake = 2.5/5This was a fancier banana bread. The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet. I was disappointed with this one since I found it pricey for what reminded me of a school snack. I thought it would be a slice of cake, but it looks just like that snack. I wouldn't repurchase this again. Definitely try a different dessert."
