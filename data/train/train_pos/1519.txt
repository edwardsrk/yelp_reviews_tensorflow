b"Barre 101 is a great workout where you can pretend you're a ballerina.You'll sweat a ton and feel defeated but it'll be worth it with those quads you'll acquire. Unlike other barre classes there's a greater focus on strengthening and endurance vs. cardio. Who needs cardio ;) Weights are used so you can choose how difficult you want it to be. Just wish the classes had some more variation with the playlist / choreography.  I can probably list the songs to each segment of the class. Ps. There's also student discount."
