b'Food is great. Really really Great. Portion sizes are adequate. Prices are a little too high for the portion sizes. Last time we went their AC wasnt working well. Spoke to a friend who also went recently and the AC wasnt cooling during her visit either.  All in all, Ive been back a few times however, will try a few other Mexican joints in South Scottsdale before I go again.'
