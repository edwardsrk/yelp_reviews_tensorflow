b'There is a LONG wait here, so if your are in a hurry or starving go somewhere else. I ordered the cobb salad that was HUGE and wonderful! The applewood smoked bacon made it....huge hunks of eggs and avocados. It\'s a cute little place, but be patient and don\'t be a clean freak....I ordered coffee and water & could see "stuff" like lip marks on both...it was interesting!'
