b'I came on a busy Saturday night, the wait was reasonable and staff was new (you can just tell) but working hard.  The food was so so. I had a cheese burger and fries. The burger had a single leaf of wilted lettuce, nothing else. It look sad on the plate... Flavor was just so so. The biggest disappointed that the menu board, the big lite one behind the bar advertised Rebel IPA they were out of... If you want chain style bar food, resort prices, lots of big TVs, cute hard working staff... This is your place.'
