b"This review is focusing primarily on the catering services provided by Olive Garden.I have catered from OG numerous times to my work, and I have never been disappointed. For big group meals, OG is a great option. They have a huge selection of catering options so you are definitely always able to find something that will work for your group, whether 10 people or 100 people. We often order 1 or 2 pans of pasta, one of the big salads, and soup. They salad comes with their delicious bread sticks. Everyone can then choose what they want and have options. One thing I really like is that the pasta (most of them) comes with the sauce separately so people can decide for themselves how much they want. I personally don't like a lot of sauce when it's a red sauce, but do prefer it slathered on when it's a white sauce, so you can see how this is handy. Another huge benefit of OG is that I can place an order at 8:30AM and have it ready to be picked up by 11:15! That's awesome turn around and very uncommon in the catering world. I have had it delivered a few times (I usually just pick up as I am very close) and the delivery folks have always been on time, courteous and friendly. They set everything up very professionally and it looks great. And, they really are not very pricey when it comes to how much food you get! Overall, they are a great option and have helped me out many times when I was in a last minute pinch. Bonus - They allow you to order individual meals along with catering. A lot of places don't have this option. So if you have that ONE picky person who wants something different, they can choose a dinner meal and it will be no issue what so ever."
