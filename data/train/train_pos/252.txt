b'We came during happy hour 8-10pm on a Saturday.  Reviews are dead on for this place. Wait staff was a bit inattentive, but was nice and food was served fast.  Four stars because the food was excellent!  It was also inexpensive. We had a salad and four different rolls.  The bill was $26!!!   All the rolls were beyond our expectations and when the bill came we could jump for joy!  This place is definitely worth checking out.  Cravable sushi.  I recommend the kodiak roll (that rocked), an el pollo roll-- also yummy!!'
