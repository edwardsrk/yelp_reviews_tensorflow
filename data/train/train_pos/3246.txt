b"I have been very on the edge about trying this place after reading it's health reviews, but I threw caution to the wind and I'm glad I did. It is Oakland Restaurant Week and they offered yellow chicken curry for $6. I must say that this was some of the best curry I have had. It has peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, and chicken. I do not like my curry spicy and it was perfect. Amazingly sweet and creamy with the right amount of spice. I will definitely be eating here again."
