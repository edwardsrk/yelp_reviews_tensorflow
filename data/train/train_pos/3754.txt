b"We were very pleasantly surprised with the care and service that we received at Express Auto Spot. My daughter needed to buy a new car, Jason was more than helpful, mannerly, and truly cared about the entire transaction. He explained everything, and answered my daughters millions of questions. After all was said and done, it was a very fair price for a car and he made sure we were completely happy before we left there. I would recommend going there if you want a no pressure, fair, car sales experience. It was a pleasure and what's more, the car lot is indoors, that means no AZ heat!  Thank you Jason, this was great!!"
