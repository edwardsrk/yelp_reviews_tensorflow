b'out of all the cafes in this town, this was one of the best but also one of the priciest. had a very good new york steak here for 22 and the chicken Marsala was very good too. the apps, we had a southwest egg roll that was surprisingly spicy and  good, i like it hot too.all in all i would spend that much on something else where, but i did enjoy the meal.'
