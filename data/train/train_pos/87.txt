b'My husband and I started eating here a few months ago. It\'s close to home and convenient for a quick bite. Food is very good. We\'ve only tried the Mahi Mahi and fish n chips, but recommend both. Prices are pretty resonable for the area and not much different than any other restaurant. Service is a hit and miss. The young gals working there are mostly very friendly and attentive with an occasional employee not wanting to put much effort into work. That doesn\'t compromise the food however. The one thing that took me by surprise on my last visit was watching a gentleman pick up the wash rag off of the FLOOR behind the cash register and start wiping tables with it. When we were leaving I asked the gal at the counter who the manager was and she said well he\'s the owner and pointed to the very gentleman that picked up the washrag and wiped tables. I said to him, "I just watched you picked up the wash rag off the floor and start wiping down the tables." I\'m sure (or hope) he teaches his staff restaurant cleanliness. You can tell he was embarrassed  (which was not my intent at all), but he did apologize. I think he will be more conscious going forward. I DO NOT WANT THIS TO DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT AS THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD AND WE WILL DEFINITELY CONTINUE EATING THERE. Because of this however, I could only give it four stars.'
