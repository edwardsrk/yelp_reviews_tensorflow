b"This was such a chill little gem overlooking the casino in NY NY. We stopped by here when we found out the bar next door was charging a cover to formulate a new plan for the night.  The bartender was very friendly even though as we sat down my friend knocked my water all over the counter. Kudos to him for still serving us with a smile. We had had a few at that point. We had a couple rounds of their 2 for $5 jello shots and reasonably priced red bull vodkas. I wish I had gotten our bartender's name because he closed us all out on individual tabs quickly and efficiently. I would have spent much longer here since I loved the comfortable chairs and people watching but sadly the group wanted to keep moving after our drinks. Until next time Pour 24!"
