b"This dessert place has been on my radar for quite some time now. I've always wanted to try the baked Alaska and the soufle! My boyfriend and I came to the cafe on a random Wednesday night around 9pm. The cafe wasn't too busy, they had about a couple customers. The baked Alaska and the soufle is made to order so it's dine in only. I love merginue a lot so getting hazelnut ice cream in the middle was a nice surprise. The baked Alaska was delicious.. I would it it 7/10. The vanilla soufle was nice and fluffy but nothing too special. For my next visit, I do want to try the take out stuff to try. My dessert craving was satisfied and I would definitely come back again!"
