b'Blood Brothers Brewing is worth the trek to at least a visit. I have been drinking Shumei and Paradise Lost for awhile which are available on taps at Good Catch Boil House. And here I was, finally here and able to try out more of their beers! You can either order a sampler or a half pint or a pint from their ever rotating draft list. And in case if you rather just want to pick up a bottle or 6 of them from the shop, you can also ask for a taste before committing.If you are into sour beers, you would be delighted with their interesting IPA, Sour Ale which used different kind of fruits. And their Sour Ale White Lies series uses different grapes was also quite interesting too. Come by for a drink or 2 and enjoy their casual setting with friendly service and of course some good beers!PS. You can even order bottles delivered to your place via their online shop.'
