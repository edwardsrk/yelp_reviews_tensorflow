b"So I was checking out the container park and seen this on the way out. I said to myself... self you need to try this out tomorrow since I was too full from drinks earlier. The next day returned at lunch and it was busy but fairly fast checked in and received a free soda. Stared at the menu for awhile because I was having a tough time on deciding which dog to get, they all looked so good! Finally went with The Godfather and it was very delicious. I would of never thought of some of the toppings going together like the mango with red bell pepper haha but with all the other goodness on there it did very well! Would gladly eat again. The only thing I'd change if I could would be to have a larger dog or even a sausage option Also had some friends loaded fries and chili cheese fries. I'd go with the loaded fries and add a little more sauce or hey mix the chili cheese fries with the loaded mmmmm"
