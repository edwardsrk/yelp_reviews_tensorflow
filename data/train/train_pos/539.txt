b'With a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th Avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, Cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date.Far from classic, Cibo takes Italian and turns it Calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can\'t help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests.Cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the Uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of Calgary shouting "you gotta try this!" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food.Cibo is fun, it\'s fun to hang out at for a drink, it\'s fun to talk to people there and it\'s a fun place to eat.T.'
