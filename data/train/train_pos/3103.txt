b"On March 15th my husband & I decided to celebrate his retirement at Lawry's Prime Rib. We had made reservations for a busy Friday night but due to circumstances out of our control - we called & let them know that we were running a half an hour late! Well Ms. Carolynn Stevenson greeted us as we again apologized for our tardiness. She immediately put us at ease, told us she would get us seated as soon as possible, and show us to the bar. We waited maybe ten minutes when we were called and seated! Our server turned out to be - in our opinion - the BEST - Mun Froilan!!!!!! If you want the most awesome dining experience then ask for him when you make your reservation!!! It is a must! He makes you feel as if you are the one and only guests he has to please and take care of and everything he did he seemed to truly enjoy! The restaurant's d\xc3\xa9cor is a 1930's-40's era which I love since the staff's attire also reflects that time period. You start off with the artisan bread (OMG - SO SO DELISH) and their famous spinning salad. The prime rib just melts in your mouth! The cuts we had were good size - Mun made sure of that! - and I had the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach which was so fabulous. The dessert cart that he wheeled out looked amazing but we couldn't fit another morsel of food in our mouths! Highly recommend this GREAT restaurant!"
