b"I would say that it's safe to disregard most of the aspects of the reviews that are prior to 2016, which is when the bar changed ownership (from what I understand). This bar has quickly become one of my favorites and many of my friends agree. With a fun diverse menu (for a bar) AND a smoke-free environment, it's hard not to like this casual and friendly neighborhood meet-up. The location is convenient and the charm is all there, especially since this house-turned-bar is nestled in among the quiet residential streets of Avalon. The bartenders have quickly learned our name and are quite hospitable. The same goes for the chef, who is not only talented but seems caring about quality and pleasing the customer. Their fish sandwich deal is one of the best around - scrumptious, satisfying, and only $5 when on special. Drinks are cheap and sometimes the pool table in the back is free along with the jukebox. Give this bar a try and you shouldn't be disappointed!"
