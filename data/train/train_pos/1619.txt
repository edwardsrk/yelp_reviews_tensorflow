b'Great place to hang out with your friends. Although I was going to take another star off for the hefty price tag (around $45/p), the friendly staff made up for it. When you enter, you will be required to fill a waiver on an ipad. Then you will be guided to a laneway with a staff member who goes over the rules with your group. Everyone then gets a few tries at throwing the axe. Bullseye is 5pts, inside the red is 3pts and blue is 1pt...etc. When the instructional time is over, your group will get to play against each other in a round robin game. Basically, the players with the highest points goes into finals.Axe throwing may sound intimidating, but it gets much easier as you go. The staff is great in helping each person along the way. I also like how they let you bring outside food and beer. Our group was able to order pizza delivery while we were playing. Overall, you should try this if you have not tried this latest trend in summer activities! :D'
