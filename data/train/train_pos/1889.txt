b'The first thing you see upon arrival is a spacious, dog friendly patio, complete with heaters for those colder months.  Inside has plenty of seating, bar, table, and booth.  There is a small but well rounded beer selection, and keeping with the Irish theme, a large selection of whiskys.  On the down side service can be a bit slow even on the less busy nights, and the food is good but not great.   Overall a good place to grab a drink and even get a snack.As a side note, there is Music Trivia on Tuesdays, and General Knowledge Trivia Wednesdays, both at 8:30, either of which are worth the trip.'
