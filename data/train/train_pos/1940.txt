b"I am more familiar with inflatable bouncies, but this was still quite fun for little ones.  We didn't feel like bouncing that day, so we left it to the kiddos go at it while we sat and chatted.  I do like the separate little children's area. There's a coffee bar, drinks and snacks are available at the cafe.  Nice lounge area with a flat screen for daddies that couldn't do without sports.  Overall, a good place to relax and have the children play.  I can see this again on my list come summer time!"
