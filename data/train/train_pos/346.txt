b"Although this location is in a busy spot, it's a cute little place. You have to ring the doorbell to get in. I guess because of homeless. The pharmacist is extremely nice and so was the gal who helped me. They have free delivery too. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because they don't have an automated refill line to request refills. Other than that, not a bad pharmacy!"
