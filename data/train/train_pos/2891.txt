b"Indeed, you're correct!  Thai places are a dime a dozen, but Panna may just be what you're craving.  Do you have a hankering for spicy eggplant, wait dumplings did I hear you whisper?!  Something extra spicy aka hellaciously hot is what you wish for- go ahead and let them know when you order:)  Please opt for a fried rice, yes I do always opt for the pineapple fried rice.  Hell, if it's not broke don't fix it! Insert wink emoji here please! I add snow peas into one.  Please note the picture I posted this time around:)Meats are succulent and scallops are always cooked accordingly!  Panna provides one with traditional & distinctive Thai in all levels.  Panna is the spot on place for to devour bowls of curry! So hurry!"
