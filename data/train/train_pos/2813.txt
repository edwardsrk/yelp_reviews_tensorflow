b"This is a cocktail bar, there are no beers on tap. However, the best thing about SideBar are the cocktails, don't go and order a bottle of beer. There are tons of options, I personally can vouch for the White Rabbit. It is basically a delicious alcoholic horchata.SideBar is small and located up a flight of a long flight of stairs so don't get too inebriated before leaving! On busy Friday nights it can be difficult to find a spot to sit later in the night. Noise level isn't terrible compared to other bars which is a plus. It's loud, but not unbearably so."
