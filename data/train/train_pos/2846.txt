b"Flavorful. Savory.  Amazing Food. I really enjoyed Mesa Grill.  We ordered the mushroom quesadilla (that is topped with a perfectly fried egg), the grilled mahi mahi with risotto, and the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with tamale.  Everything was so good!  The service was ok.  Our server was not very enthusiastic and didn't seem like she ever tasted the food herself when i asked her questions about the menu.  The bread basket was cool because it comes with 3 different types - a jalape\xc3\xb1o cheese sliced bread, a sweet raisin sliced bread, and a corn muffin.  My least favorite was the corn muffin because it was really dry, cold, and crumbly.  I would skip it.  My boyfriend agrees that the food tastes awesome, but that the portions are too small.  He was still hungry after the mahi mahi, and said he could probably eat another one.  I thought the portion size was right for a balanced meal.  I ate my entire plate!Overall, tasty hot entrees and appetizer.  I would come back again!"
