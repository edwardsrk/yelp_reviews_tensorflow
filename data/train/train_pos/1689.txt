b"I'm a true fan IHOP fan. Always have been. Always will be. While I will say his isn't the most top notch location, what keeps me coming back is the server that usually works the over might shift Jamal. He hustles and gets it done. Always has a smile on his face, positive and friendly attitude. The food is the same as usual. Tasty inexpensive. Simply love it"
