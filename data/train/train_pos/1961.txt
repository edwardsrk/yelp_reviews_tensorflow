b"Time for lil' update:The Dog's Bollocks was open on Labour Day, and we popped in for some food. It was salty and meh, but the booze prices remain great, and this unassuming place didn't judge us for anything. Not our childish food orders, not our pitchers of cocktails and not having our baby with us (playing on the table and then sleeping in her stroller). Thank you, D's Bs."
