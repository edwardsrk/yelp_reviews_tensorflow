b"Having nom'ed my way through Toronto, Bestellen is my favourite restaurant in a city if great ones.Food? Off the charts. The famous cote de boeuf, the burger - phenomenal.Service? Brilliant. Friendly, welcoming, funny, engaging. The vibe? It's a hip place without the hipster dip$hits. It's the best of both worlds.Highly recommend. For the win."
