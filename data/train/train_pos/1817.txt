b"I landed in Las Vegas at the ugly hour of 6:55 a.m. By 7:45 a.m., I was at Egg Works. Upon walking in, you wonder if you might suffer food poisoning later. The decor is pretty run down, the layout isn't very pretty. But oh my gosh, I had the best waitress ever. She was wonderful.I ordered a mimosa, I was given an individual size bottle of champagne, along with a glass of orange juice, so I could make my own cocktail as strong as I wanted to, without anyone raising an eyeball at me beginning my day of drinking at such an early hour.The service was outstanding. The food comes in pretty large portions, and wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was hot and good. I had french toast, eggs, hash browns, and bacon. And of course, my beautiful mimosa. My companion had chicken fried steak with potatoes and gravy.  Both dishes were yummy. The menu is varied, so even if you are a picky eater, you will find something that makes you happy. When you go, ask for Melinda. She's awesome. I'd add more descriptive words. But someone stole my thesaurus, which is bad. Very bad. Yes, bad.P.S. - Melinda, if you are reading this, and I know you told me you check Yelp every now and again - I hope you won the $100 prize for your Halloween costume!"
