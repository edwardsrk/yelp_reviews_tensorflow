b"This is typical quick and friendly service Starbucks location. They facility is clean and they have free wifi, so it is a nice place to pop in and get some work done. I've never had issues when ordering in the store; however, they frequently mix up orders if you order through the drive through. Just be sure to double check your pastry or sandwich order is correct! And of course, the holiday season always brings pumpkin spice. The pumpkin chai is amazing!"
