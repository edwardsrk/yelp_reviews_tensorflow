b'Came in for a quick bite and the cheesesteak looked so good in the pic. Plus they have some good fries. Got the normal/reg cheesesteak which I got to go and it was placed in a nice big box. The problem with that is my sandwich got super soggy. Fries stayed crispy but I like it better when they wrap the sandwich and put the fries in a cup. Overall the inside of the sandwich was good. Next time I will have to opt for provolone on the reg sandwich as they put white American which is not the classic cheesesteak cheese in my book. Service could be nicer but what do you expect from a food court in the mall'
