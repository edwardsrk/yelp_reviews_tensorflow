b"Finally visited this place and tried the Spartan which is peppadew mustard chicken themed.  After visiting some other Madison-area sub chains, I wasn't expecting much.  But E&G exceeded expectations.  Friendly and fast service, and suuuuuper tasty sub, complete with actual crispy bacon pieces and non-slimy meat.  Bread was fresh.  Only downer is the inside seating is a bit dark and dim, but otherwise I'll be back to grab & go."
