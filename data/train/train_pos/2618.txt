b"They have good charbroiled pork spring rolls and the atmosphere is nice. But the bun bo hue is a little disappointed to me because its flavor is not tasty as I expected and I'm sorry to say but the broth a little bland. I was also a little sad because I didn't get my veggies with my soup. But I want to try more food from the menu and I hope I will have a better experience here."
