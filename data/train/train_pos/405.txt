b"Love this new location! Has all the charm of the NODA location, just a lot more spacious with lots of seating and a nice long bar. There are three (I think) lines. If you're ordering dessert, make sure you get in the line closest to the pastries. All the servers were super friendly and smiley. Even though it was crowded, our order came out quickly. I've only been to this new location once but I had a great experience. Great addition to Uptown."
