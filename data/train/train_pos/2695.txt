b"Always searching for a lunch deal - that's me. Luigi's may become my near West side place to go when I am out doing errands and crave some cheezy fresh pizza and a salad.Lunch special - ANY pizza at 6 inch size with ANY small salad for $8.99. That is a good deal when the pizza is truly handmade with fresh mozz.I chose the housemade spicy sausage pizza and the arugula salad. Crust was thin and perfect really. (fyi- I am super picky about pizza crust.) Sausage was tasty. The salad was BIG for a small salad; it came with lots of caramelized onions, walnuts and fresh goat cheese.While a 6 in. pizza would not satisfy my husband - for me it is exactly right for lunch.Service was very friendly and prompt even though the place was busy at noon with 80% tables full and one large kid party.Tables have paper covers and crayons- fun!They were offering some fresh fruit Sangrias - which sounded awesome - must go back and try those!"
