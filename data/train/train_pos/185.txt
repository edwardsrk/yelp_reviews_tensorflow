b"While I was marking my Toronto itinerary, Allan Gardens kept coming up on places to do. Apparently this is Toronto's best kept secret and I could see why. I've been to a lot of conservatories and this one is up there. We were greeted by a staff member upon entering. The place is breath taking as I stepped foot inside. The dome glass ceiling brings so much sunlight into the place. We followed the path, one room lead into another and another. There is an outdoor vegetable garden, do not pick them! There are 2 cool looking sculptures with plants growing all over them outside. There's a small coy pond and another one filled with turtles. It's very calming and relaxing in here, you forget the crazy hustle and bustle going on outside. There are bathrooms here. AG is open 365 days a year from 10am to 5pm and the best part it's FREE! Beware of the all the homeless people hanging out in the park."
