b'This place is great for a healthy lunch option. You start by picking a hummus bowl or pita. I chose hummus bowl: with kale, spinach, lamb,veggie toppings, topped with taziki dressing. If you like falafel, this place has a really delicious one. Their portions are large and can easily make 2 meals. Their flavored sodas are really yummy and they also have sugar free natrual juice (with free refills). The dinning area is small, but the bowl can easily be made Togo, they have lids at the end of the counter. If you are on a special diet or health conscious, this place is a great option.'
