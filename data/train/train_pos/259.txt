b'On every Las Vegan\'s "Off-the-Strip-Dining" list probably lies Marche Bacchus, a charming bistro and wine market overlooking a peaceful lake away from the main strip.  The diverse French cuisine will appeal to Francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.The French have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.If it\'s spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don\'t forget the Mimosa.  If it\'s summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  If it\'s fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it\'s a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  And if it\'s winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it\'s a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it\'s Vegas harsh dry winter.Dessert is their weakness.  I haven\'t fallen in love with any Marche Bacchus sweets; although I daydream about imported truffles from La Maison Du Chocolat or Patrick Roger whenever I visit.'
