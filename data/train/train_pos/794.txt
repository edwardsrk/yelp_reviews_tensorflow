b'I see Aafka here and she\'s great. Everyone here is licensed and that\'s SO important to me because as an athlete I\'m going to these places to be fixed during competition and not really for much relaxation. Hours are great, there\'s parking and the places is clean and professional. They have hot stone massage, aromatherapy and some other offerings as well. What I signed up for was a monthly payment package that actually makes getting massages a great deal AND keeps you there at least once per month which is exactly what I need.Take time out to try this place, you also have Panera right next door to enjoy a coffee after as well as a parking lot which is busy but makes it so easy to pop in and get some serious bodywork done. I"ve only lived here 1.5 months and have been 3 times.'
