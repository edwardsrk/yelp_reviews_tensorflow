b"This was a wonderful dining experience all together. Service was fast and polite. The food was great! I chose a sausage with mashed potatoes and prunes as my main course and was thrilled at both the large potions as well as the taste. The sausage was fluffier than any omelet I've ever had and a delightful surprise. The potatoes and prunes were a nice heavy side to balance out the dish. The thin crispy fries were great and came in large portions. We started the meal with some oysters which really got us excited for our main dishes.Every dish I saw waiters carrying around looked amazing. Going on appearance alone, next time I'm going to try the roasted chicken."
