b"Parents took me here while I was home for Labor Day. We walked right in on a Saturday evening, no wait. Place is nice and open inside, especially on a nice day with the patio open. We got a large pizza with mushrooms and sweet peppers and an order of their wings. I was intrigued by the wings because there isn't a vast list of flavors like other wing joints--just their blend. I was a bit skeptical when my dad told me they come covered in saut\xc3\xa9ed onions, but wow were they good. Seasoned perfectly with their special blend of spices and the onion flavor seeped in. Tasted like a chicken wing should, not trying too hard to mask the actual taste. I wish I had taken a picture so you could see the onion pile, which we ate on the pita bread that came with It (my dad also added some to his pizza when it came.)The pizza was also quite good. I loved the mushrooms because they were cooked differently than the normal soggy type that shows up on pizza. My only complaint, and I know it's coal oven pizza, is that the edge of our pizza crust was very burnt. The bottom wasn't, but the edge of about half was extremely blackened. I think it needed spun more in the oven while cooking to even it out. But I'd still definitely return, it was even good cold for breakfast leftovers the next day!"
