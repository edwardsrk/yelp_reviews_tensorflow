b"I am not much of an outdoorsman, but you don't need to be to enjoy this place, surviving a Canadian winter is reason enough to come in. I have purchased much of my winter workwear here, and have even found some of the Redhead branded clothing better than some of their big name brand counterparts they even have a lifetime warrantee on some of their socks which is a great bonus. They carry a wide selection of name brand clothes such as Carrhart, The North Face, Under Armour and Columbia. I have also purchased BBQ utensils from here and have been happy with them. They carry a wide variety of items from tents and BBQ's to socks, shoes and boots, knives, guns and clothing and that's what keeps us coming back, we just might find what we're looking for at a reasonable price here."
