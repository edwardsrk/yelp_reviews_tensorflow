b"We went to the new location this past weekend and it was much better than the last time we ate here.The restaurant is way nicer and brighter than before, which I liked.  The servers were super nice and friendly.Three of us ordered the mahi mahi special and it was delicious.  We all loved it.  It was perfectly cooked and on a bed of spanish rice which was good too.  My husband ordered the lamb and he enjoyed his meal as well.For dessert, we got the tiramisu and thought it was excellent.  Can't wait to go back!"
