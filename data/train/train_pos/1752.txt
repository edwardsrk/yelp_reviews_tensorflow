b"The first thing you should know about La Paloma is that it is CASH ONLY. Being one who relies solely on debit, I had to return another day after reading the sign on the counter. But even if you forget, they have a system where you pay for your order first and then stand in (a massive) line during which time you get to gaze in at all the flavours.I'm often frugal, so the $4.20+tax for a small (1 flavour) sent a sharp pain to my chest at first. But honestly, once you taste it, you'll be glad you chose La Paloma over the $1 McDonald's soft serve down the street. Your best bet, if there are two of you and you're down to share, would be to purchase the 3 flavour dish for about $6. Truthfully though, the 1 flavour was very filling and it would've been a stretch to scoop any more into my mouth.Staff were friendly. The first time we went in (before quickly walking out after seeing CASH ONLY), it was busy but not a complete madhouse. There were a few children at the counter asking for samples. I wouldn't recommend trying this on a Saturday afternoon when all hell has broken loose in the place, but it's neat that they offer this.I got some chocolate flavour I could barely pronounce, let alone remember the correct spelling of days later. It had hazelnuts and tartufo inside. My boyfriend got the biscotti. Both were rich, creamy and better than any ice cream I'd ever tasted.The best part is it's located right beside Giovanni Caboto park. There are little tables and chairs in front of the park where you can sit to enjoy your gelato. Also, lots of free parking as long as it's not rush hour. But even then, there are several side streets nearby."
