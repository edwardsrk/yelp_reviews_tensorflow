b'Great choices, great flavors, fresh oysters, crab legs, sushi ... Prices were fair, service was good. Dining area was clean, the only downside that took a star away was the restroom! the bathroom was really bad , no soap, stalls  low on toilet paper and so stinky I was overall happy!!  I will be back'
