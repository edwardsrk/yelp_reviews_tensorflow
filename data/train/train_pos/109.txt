b'Friendly staff, a great job detailing my car, and gas is always 2 or 3 cents lower than "Big Oil" . The place is just east if Islington on the south side of The Queensway... I have had exterior washes there for years (Used to be a Shell) today is the first time I spent 38 dollars for the express interior detail... Great Job ... one of those times when you just have nothing but happy thoughts ...And a nice shiny car inside and out...'
