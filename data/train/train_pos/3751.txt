b"Went here after seeing a positive review in Phoenix magazine. Did not disappoint ! We had the chorizo and black bean queso - seriously, possibly the best appetizer I have ever had. We both ordered rather eccentric sounding main dishes. I actually was presented a different meal than I had asked for, but when I tried it, it didn't matter! Everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. The outdoor area is nice too. Staff friendly and timely. Definitely coming back again."
