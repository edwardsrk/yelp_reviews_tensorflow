b"I really enjoyed my brunch! We were in a decent size group with a small baby and they were great about accommodating us! Since it's a buffet it seems that table turnover is slower than a normal restaurant, but they were great about putting tables together and making it work. As for reviews that mentioned food not being served hot, I did not experience that at all. Everything that should have been in chaffing dishes was, and the staff was great about keeping all the food stocked. The buffet line can be long at times, but it really just depends on when you go up. The made to order omelette was a great option, though no one at my table ordered one. Overall great experience, and would be five stars if only North Carolina could serve alcohol before noon!"
