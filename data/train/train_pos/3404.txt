b"These guys just left my house.  They.  Are.  Awesome.By way of full disclosure, I'm a male single parent of two (and a dog) that wishes he could afford a cleaning lady.  As such, the carpets in my house were pretty, um... nasty.  Like 'my girlfriend doesn't want her feet to touch the floor' nasty.  Anyway, these guys came in right on time for the appointment and made the place look brand spanking new.  I would give them five stars even if they were some mega-corporation-chain... but they're not.  They're a small family owned and operated business... which feels even better.Thanks, yelpers, for turning me on to these guys.  I wouldn't dream of using another company."
