b"Asked my manicurist twice to round out my nails, twice to make them even lengths, heck she even tried to pretend not to notice that she was missing 1/2 cm off the side of one of the nails (that one I refused to let slide). All in all, my nails look ok, but after spending a frustrating hour and a half having to repeat (with photo) of short acrylic nails, I left feeling flustered, and that's the third time in a row. It's a cheap place to get your nails done but if you're the kind of person who pays particular attention to detail, beware. I leave the 4 stars because they'll correct it if you point it out to the manager, but I don't like the fact that I would have to. None else will ever notice, but my left thumb nail sticks out 2-3 times further from my fingers edge than my right, and I shouldn't leave the salon to go home and fix my own nails."
