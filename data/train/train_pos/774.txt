b"Had to take my IPhone cause it wouldn't take a charge. No appointments available in my schedule but I got on the list. My helper Winnie was awesome! Sweet girl who knew what she was doing. Out the door in less than an hour with a replacement phone. My only short in the full 5 star was the lack of appointments available . Love Apple stores but this one is the best I've been too! You're always busy, hire more staff!!"
