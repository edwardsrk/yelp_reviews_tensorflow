b"I always feel like I've eaten a healthy meal when I walk out. Feels good! I went in today with my teen daughter. We love this place. Food is great, staff is quick and always very nice. I love that the food changes so I always have something interesting to eat. The restaurant is clean. BUT.... the women's bathroom is always filthy. Minus one star for the bathroom. I paid $30 for us to eat. I'm sure they can afford a deep clean and some paint."
