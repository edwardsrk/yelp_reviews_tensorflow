b"We went to celebrate my friend's birthday last week. I'm telling you, the filet was amazing! He got the boned in rib eye, also phenomenal! We ordered the mashed potatoes as our side, not that original, I know, but it was creamy buttery deliciousness! The service was impeccable. Seriously, no complaints at all. Go and enjoy this gem!"
