b"Delicious! We split the house made balsamic glaze mozzarella, it's a must have! I had the butternut squash ravioli. I ordered a small portion and it was the perfect size. My husband had the carbonara, which was pretty tasty, but would have been better if the huge, stringy chunk of pork was cut up a bit more. When asked if you want a side of bread with your meal, one order is enough for two. We will definitely return next time we are in Toronto."
