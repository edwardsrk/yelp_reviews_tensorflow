b"Want a warm bowl of spicy noodles or wontons?  Mian is your place. This noodle restaurant serves dishes that comes from the schezuan area of China. It's cold there year long so people love spicy food to keep warm ( or at least that's what my mom told me). I got their chengdu zhazheng mian that comes with a spicy sauce( definitely not too spicy) and it comes with veggies fried egg and ground pork. It's broth-less. I thought the dish was really good. At the end the peppers got a little gritty but this is a delicious hearty bowl of noodles. I would have liked more veggies but you can always order extra on the side.  They have non spicy options as well. Also they serve their meals with mung bean soup which is almost like a surgery tea. It seemed like dessert to me and paired really well with their spicy food. The must try dish here is their steamed egg. I missed it on the menu but my friend ordered it and it was so so good!  It comes in a cup and the egg is topped with a sweet soy sauce and ground beef. The egg texture is so soft and velvety!  It's amazing. I will definitely order that again the next time in back."
