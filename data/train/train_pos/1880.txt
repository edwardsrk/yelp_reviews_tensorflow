b"Pretty fancy restaurant especially since its across the walk way to Herm\xc3\xa8s lol. There's a dress code- no tank tops for men but they will accommodate you to the outside patio , which was fine. The waiter was really nice and professional even though we were kind of tipsy and being annoying. I thought it was fancy how the popcorn chicken came with actual popcorn(never seen this before). The green pizza was great as well; who could've thought that a pizza with no meat could taste so delicious. The food was great i just wished the waiter told us about their gratuity fee. I always thought that was a requirement."
