b'Ohh, Las Vegas. "Kid-friendly" doesn\'t generally come to mind when you think of Sin City, but clearly that moniker was developed before the brand new My Gym Children\'s Fitness Center  came to town! The new gym is in Henderson near Whole Foods...(The old one, btw, is closed and this new one is under different ownership/management!)The facility itself is so fresh and so clean... My young daughter can run around barefoot and not walk away with black soles on her feet or grime on her hands, and it\'s the only children\'s facility I\'ve been where they use only organic, natural products to clean their equipment (and it doesn\'t smell hippy dippy). In addition to a safe, clean place to play, the program is FANTASTIC. The teachers, Jeremy and Ben, pack so much into an hour...! It\'s definitely not a free-play sort of place (you should expect to do everything with your child if they\'re under 3), but I wouldn\'t *want* it to be; we love singing and dancing together at circle time, trying out the different tumbling skills, and climbing together on equipment together. I feel like a little kid again, haha.Best of all, they offer free trial classes. I definitely plan on coming back with a friend or two so we can take class together. :)'
