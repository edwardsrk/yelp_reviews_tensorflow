b"The thin crust pizza here is the best I've had in the valley. The thick or deep dish is just okay it doesn't really do it for me to say the least. But boy are the flavors there when you order the thin crust.  We always used to come here on Tuesdays to get the Tuesday take out special which apparently stopped. When we called today to go get the usual Tuesday deal to us the dead give away was when the man over the phone had asked us what kind of large soda we would like and when my boyfriend had asked if he meant to say 2 liter he said no. So now that they have taken away my Tuesday special I can tell you at this moment that the chances of us going to nellos after this are slim to none.I'm severely disappointed that they have no specials anymore but nothing lasts forever I guess. I will miss you nellos very much I will but I guess we will be sticking closer to home and trying out pizza on 87....sigh.... :("
