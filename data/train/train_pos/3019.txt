b"As a spicy food fan, when I see a restaurant called Hot & Spicy, I add it to my must try list.I decided to give Radica's a shot shortly after seeing the title of the restaurant. On first glance, the restaurant was super clean and new. A really nice environment for a fast food style joint!  Between my fiance and I, we ordered two roti's - one spicy chicken and the other a medium goat roti. Oh boy, the roti's were awesome! Fresh, packed with flavor and actually spicy.  Portions were huge as well! We also tried a shrimp double. This was my first time trying a double. It was ok, but the real star of the show was the roti's.If you're looking for genuinely good roti with a kick of spice, I'd say this is the spot!"
