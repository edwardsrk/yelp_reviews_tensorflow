b"For those who enjoy Italian, and really who doesn't, then you are not limited to Pizza, especially when there are exquisite Italian restaurants like Prop. It was a Friday night, and we were out with another couple - so I was forced to order fish -but  I was not disappointed - we shared, shrimp crostini, salmon ricotta crostini and grilled sardines as an appetitizer, (I'm sure the other couple ate more than their share) - the apps were thoughtfully prepared, and abundant in fish. Not to mention that having such a variety of fish to choose from is a rarity. The mains (no sharing) we had a hearty fish stew,  grilled salmon and the special Spigola and- Sea Bream - wow, this isn't even a seafood restaurant. we were overwhelmed, the fish properly cooked - showing off the true flavour and proper texture of the fish - beautifully prepared. But it's not just seafood, it's a fine Italian dining, at very reasonable pricing -  I watched other tables enjoy a liver dish, and risotto nero, a black ink risotto.  The portions are filling and you don't feel bloated, and the freshness and quality of the dishes sets Prop ahead of some of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood."
