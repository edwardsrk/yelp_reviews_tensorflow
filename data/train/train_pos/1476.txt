b"Spotted Erin's at a gas stop during a six hour trek to the north woods.  Let's see, lunch at a greasy spoon or at an Irish pub? No-brainer.  The kids loved their sandwiches and the wife said her reuben was yum.  I had the chicken spinach-artichoke sammy and a tall draft Guinness.  Happy Dad.  Server was efficient and friendly to the kids.  I can't comment on the Friday night drinking scene but this may become a regular stop for us when traveling north."
