b'I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =)'
