b"Awesome little shop! Been meaning to come here for ages, finally in the area for dinner, wasn't quite full enough so decided to check it out! Love how they not only have dozen plus flavours of creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e but also authentic Belgian waffles and homemade ice cream! They offered us when we came in if samples of their ice cream and it got me hooked right away! As I was still a bit hungry from dinner I decided to indulge and try their Belgian waffles! So glad I did, usually I prefer light airy waffles and worry Belgian waffles might be too dense for my liking but nope it was just what I needed!  My friend ordered the honey lavender creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, I had the Belgian waffles with earl grey lavender! Can't wait to come back to check out all my top flavours of creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e! (Ube, pandan coconut, Vietnamese coffee, Earl Grey)"
