b'I love T\xc3\xa4k\xc5\x8d! The atmosphere is wildly awesome, dark and loud, not the best for conversing but fun in its own right! The wild mushroom tacos are incredible as are the signature T\xc3\xa4k\xc5\x8d tacos, which features octopus as the main meat! The grapefruit and sage margarita is refreshingly divine! Highly recommend for a cocktail afterwork or Friday night downtown!'
