b'Had dinner here the other night, Chef Luigi did a fantastic job again.  Started with the oysters on the half shell, very fresh Newfoundland water oysters served with mignonette--always one of my favorites.  Second course was the corn and lobster chowder from the menu--as always very delicate and the sweet corn adds to the flavor of the lobster.  Third course was a special salad Luigi made--fresh sliced pears and arugula lettuce with a lemon and vinaigrette dressing with walnuts, very nice.  Fourth course was a wonderful saute sea scallops, normally not on the menu so thank you Luigi.  Fifth course was a special steak tartar and brioche.  My main course was a wonderful Lamb chop served with garlic mashed potatoes--very nicely done.  And to finish it all off, had a simple cheese plate--again not normally on the menu but well appreciated.  The dining here has always been great and with the special attention from the chef as well as the regular staff, had a great time.'
