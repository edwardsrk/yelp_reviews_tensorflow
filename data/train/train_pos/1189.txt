b"*editing my lower review*After speaking with Deanna, I am altering the review since they are franchised and I wasn't aware (my bad), although communication on canceling could use work... After weeks of attempting to sort out an issue only Yelp could really get attention my husband could have used on day one... The massage therapists are attentive and I enjoy each massage. Much more relaxing atmosphere than other massage businesses... I hope to use this facility again once we have time and the extra funds."
