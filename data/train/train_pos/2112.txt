b'We came here with the MGM execs and they hosted our dinner with patically everything on the menu, steaks were well aged, sides were as expected of Michael Mina. Delicious.Must orders: appetizers wagyu satay or tartar, lobster fritter or bisque dont forget the foie gras slidders. Main, dry ages bone in rib eye, american wagyu rib cap, of course a5 japanese wagyu enhanced with grilled foie gras, king crab or just top any steak with foie gras butter. Why not? Sides spicy zucchini, smoked mushrooms and bone marrow. Deserts: everything..we literally had everything. A true perk when you work for an event company, the restaurant sites. They serve you only the best on the menu, at this place they served everything and everything is the best.'
