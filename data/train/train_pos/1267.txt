b'A golden hotel without a casino. You think Trump would have built an elevated golden sidewalk to lead his masses from the hotel to at least Fashion Show, but sadly no... A bit of jay walking, dodge that taxi and loffers in the dirt get you to the strip. On the bright side, the 49th floor standard room has a GREAT view of the strip, is super spacious, has free Wi-Fi, kitchenette & a WHIRLPOOL Tub! Well worth the Jay Walking ;D'
