b"Whether you call it Shannxi Biang Biang or House of Egg Roll, the idea of new regional Chinese food is exciting. China is a huge country and as a Millennial I'm all about trying new places and things. I've read Fuchsia Dunlop. Of course, none of that goes very far towards helping me understand what I've eaten from a cultural perspective: the Shaanxi sandwich tasted great and it's hard to go wrong with the Shananxi-style handmade noodles. I liked how the dish veered more towards vinegar. It's something I wish I knew more about, but in the meantime I like the idea of this very specific Chinese restaurant offering something that's difficult to find anywhere else."
