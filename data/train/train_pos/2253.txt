b"I love the supreme pizze here, we always order delivery and they've never been late. The wings are AWESOME. The only reason why they got 4 out of 5 stars is because the last time they delievered, they brought BBQ chicken wings instead of the hot wings I ordered. Otherwise, they are pretty friendly and fast. I get a craving just talking about it..."
