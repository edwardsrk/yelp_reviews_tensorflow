b'Can I say how amazing it is to drive less than 5 miles for a trader joes?! If you\'ve never been, lots of organic and non gmo foods, but also many pre packaged things, like bagged onions vs picking your own.  No butcher, no deli, and limited on \'regular" supermarket items like cherrios and windex, but you will find "trader joe-o\'s" They have great food stuffs, but this can\'t be the only market you shop at'
