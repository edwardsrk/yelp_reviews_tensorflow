b'Had the beacon burger, was a good burger. They ask you what you want on your burger from there choices on the menu. Fries were different,  unpeeled and a little soft. I would go back, but in not 100% sold on this place. Do sent look like there are many choices,  but is very clean. Took a little long to get my order, but employees were very nice. I would say this is a place that you might like.'
