b'This was a wonderful little throw back!  Had seen the place in Family Circus cartoons and it was neat to go in and have ice cream.  Great menu with a lot of different things (not just ice cream).  Super pleasant staff and a cute atmosphere made this place a winner.  Left without finishing my ice cream and stuffed after we had lunch elsewhere.  It was an old fashioned ice cream parlor and was a pleasure.'
