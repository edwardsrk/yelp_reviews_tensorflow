b"From NYC, so after a long day of walking. My BF and I decided to rest, drink, and eat at this pub. Honestly, there is nothing to complain about the service was on point, the pub was clean and had a rustic European look to it, and the drinks were reasonable size and price (they have HH from 4-7). The food was actually fresh and super good for pub food. Vegetable Gyoza had a very unique taste to it, the peanut sauce was a little spicy and thick, which I was dipping my fries into it. Dragon Wings are a must to get, these wings were spicy and a good portion, the meat was super tender and not over, which they'll make your mouth water. For those that do not eat meat, I highly suggest trying the Marinated Olive, Hummus and Taramasalata Plate. It was super good and flavorful. You will not be disappointed stopping into this spot."
