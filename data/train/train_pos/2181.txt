b"Pros: I can't find a better massage place than spring spa. I went a couple months ago with my boyfriend and we both thought this place was amazing. I slept on my neck wrong the night before and had terrible neck and back pain and didn't tell the lady before the massage. She spent majority of the time on my back in one specific area and went hardcore. She also popped my neck and put my arms and legs in weird positions that popped my entire spine. How's that even possible?! Anyways, super intense massage and I felt amazing afterwards. Con: just one. The price! We went in thinking it's around $30 an hr like many other Chinese owned spas but this place costed $60/hour per person! That's so much for a massage spa on spring mountain... We usually tip at least $20 per person but since this place is super expensive already, my boyfriend tipped $15 a person and paid a total of $150. Please lower your prices!! I want to come back but your pricing is way too high compared to other places on spring mountain :("
