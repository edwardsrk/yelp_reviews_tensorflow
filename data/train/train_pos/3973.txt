b"Best happy hour!!! Very rare to find a sushi happy hour especially one so good! Had to try the intriguing blackened tuna pizza which was actually very delicious.  Crunch roll and harmony roll tasted fresh and had great texture! Our hostess greeted us warmly and we were sat promptly, forget our server's name but she took great care of us and always checked back. Glad I live close, boyfriend and I are most definitely coming back"
