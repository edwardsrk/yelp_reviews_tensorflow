b"I went for brunch twice in two days! I recommend the cheese curds-they are the best I've had in Madison! I got the fried pickles too, they were ok. The drinks are great, the service is awesome-great attitudes, friendly inviting smiles, quick attentive service! I had the huevos divorciados-very good! On my second visit I ate the pulled pork and sweet potato hash. I recommend both!"
