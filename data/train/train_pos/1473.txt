b'Tasty and delicious I keep coming back for the walnut cakes. The staff are extremely friendly and I absolutely love the walnut cakes. I also tried the red bean sherbet which was okay but I am not usually a fan of shaved ice. Whenever I am in koreatown, I always have to make a stop at Hodo Kwaja before I leave.'
