b"I think this is a great place for grabbing happy hour after work.  They recently re-did their menu and cut back on a lot of things so they can focus more on less food, which is great.  They have trivia on Tuesday nights, start as 7 and goes to about 9.  I had a such a blast playing it with my coworkers, and I think the girls in charge of it did a good job of keeping a good mix of questions.The last few times I have been here, I have only had a couple different apps because I was on the happy hour menu, but even their burgers look pretty good. It's a place you can go a couple different times and get something different each time. I usually get this older red-headed waitress that tries to be as personable and friendly as possible-you can tell she's trying to make sure you have a good time so they can get repeat business, which is refreshing.  You can that employees like that care about the business (and why not, considering it's probably their livelihood).  Also a cool thing about this place: they have one of those popcorn machines so you can get yourself some popcorn to munch on while you're waiting for your food.  Or just as a side with your drink.They made some changes to the place that I think are going to be for the better.  Just be careful where you park, because some of the surrounding businesses will tow your car if you park in their lot."
