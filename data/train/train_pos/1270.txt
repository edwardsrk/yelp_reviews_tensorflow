b"First time at D'Angelo's in Twinsburg (I gather that they are related to Casa D'Angelo in Macedonia, which we always like).Everything was great.  I had the tortellini with grilled chicken (in a very nice pink sauce) and my wife had the scallops with risotto.  The scallops were very slightly salty, but tender and tasty and the risotto was excellent.  Nice piece of tiramisu for dessert.  Had a $12 off coupon, so with two coffees and a glass of wine it was $57.  Not cheap, but the food was very good.Very good service too and a very friendly waitress.  Will definitely be back."
