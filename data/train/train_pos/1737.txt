b"This restaurant is subtle on the exterior, but what it offers is unique and comforting. Bannock focuses on rustic Canadian cuisine and its interiors definitely reflects that. Candlelight (albeit fake) illuminates jars of preserves and cottage-like wood walls; while the tables and seats bring a contemporary flair.The menu's dishes reflect what Canada has to offer in ingredients and style. On my visits I have had their boiled dinner and pork belly tortiere; both fantastic. Flavours were great in both dishes (especially the boiled dinner) and was not overpowering. The beer selection is not big, and features some rather standard Canadian choices.I really like this restaurant for its relaxed atmosphere, and its delicious and simple menu. Great for dinner after or before a nice skate at Nathan Phillips Square!"
