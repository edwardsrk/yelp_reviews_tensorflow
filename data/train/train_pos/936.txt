b'Finally got to check out the new uptown Guu, and happy to say it was a success!More than a year after my last visit to their Church St. location, I was happy to thee that the North York menu was the same! We got to try all of our old favourites, and all were fresh, delicious, and plated wonderfully :)My favourites: Kinoko (cheese and mushroom) bibimbap, Gindara (black miso cod), Ebimayo(fried shrimp doused in spicy mayo...drool), Takoyaki (octopus balls) & Okonomiyaki (japenese pancake).The only item that fell a bit short was the seared tuna....the fish was a bit too cooked and the toppings a bit band.. but still edible. 3 happy full people, 8 dishes, 3 drinks (lychee mojito! yum!) and 1 dessert later (delicious green tea cheesecake) the total per person came to $43 including taxes and tips.Set-up is nice, and staff is super friendly, and just as loud and vibrant as the Church location.Will be back!Perk: We live close by so we called for them to hold a table for us - they texted us when it was ready with 15 to claim the table which was great since we are only a ten minute walk away. Nice to not have to wait outside for an hour!'
