b"I got the signature platinum blow out from Bailey B, it lasted me literally 6 days and had volume and bounce the entire week. I was so impressed I went back the following week and received a good blow out from someone else. Although they use same technique and tools, I didn't leave with same amount of volume and bounce, however it is still a good blow out.  The coconut scent  was delicious without being overpowering. I would recommend if looking for good blow out for night out or even a blow out to last monday-friday work week. Only negative is they are not open Sunday or Monday, so if you wanted to start week fresh you have to go Saturday. Scheduling sometimes goes over, so make sure you allocate at least 60-75 mins."
