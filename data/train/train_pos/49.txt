b'Hair Classic is a great value for a haicut in the downtown Toronto area.  I was introduced to Hair Classic by a friend and have been getting my hair cut by Yoon for the past six months.  He is superb - quick, friendly, and always delivers a solid and consistent cut.  Overall, excellent value at $20.'
