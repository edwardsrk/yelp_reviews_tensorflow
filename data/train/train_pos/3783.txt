b"We were honestly headed to Applebee's and came in here on a whim. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Our server, Crystal, was attentive and served our drinks within minutes of us sitting. I ordered the meatloaf plate with a cup of broccoli cheddar soup instead of the vegetables. My fianc\xc3\xa9 got the Holy Davoli Burger with a side of fries. The soup was so delicious... I could have ate only that. It was creamy and full of nice pieces of broccoli. Then the meatloaf came and WOW! Juicy, tender, full of flavor! Comes served with mashed red potatoes and brown gravy. I'm so glad I decided on that meal. My fianc\xc3\xa9 was also impressed with his Burger and was glad we decided on Metro Diner over Applebee's. I definitely recommend this place and will be back to try their breakfast!"
