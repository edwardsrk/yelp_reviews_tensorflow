b"I went to La Distillerie on Mont Royale with my sister on a Saturday evening at around 7 o clock. The place wasn't packed, but there was a nice vibe going on, and everyone was enjoying themselves. We were seated for around 10 minutes before a waitress brought over an extensive cocktail menu. Once we ordered, the drinks came very quickly in their signature mason jars, and were fairly strong and sweet. It was pricey but worth it!"
