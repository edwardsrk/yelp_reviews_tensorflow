b"Loved the food here, portions were a little on the smaller side, but the food overall was one of the best for BBQ that we have tried. The brisket was excellent very tender and juicy and smoked just right we also got the chicken which was pretty good as well, we were a little disappointed that they didn't have beef ribs only pork because we go to BBQ places a lot and love beef ribs, maybe someday they can add them to their menu. The sides were ok but very small like I had mentioned and the Mac n cheese was a little original not much flavor. I would definitely go back maybe for takeout but the overall service was horrible the woman at the window was extremely rude to every customer and very irritated with everyone, we felt like every time we asked something we were a bother and she said you cannot even sample the sides or sauces and just the whole way she proceeded to take our order and others was with an attitude when we came up to order wings as well it was like wecouldnt even ask any questions, because she didnt want to be bothered,  poor customer service and business ownership. To add to this...the wings we tried  at the spare of the moment, garlic parmesan and they were excellent, some of the best I have had, or maybe it was the sauce?"
