b'Honestly the Flamingo is a 3 or 3 1/2 in my book but I will rate a 4 to average out the scores.  The Flamingo is perfectly summed up by the phrase "you get you pay for".  People ... if you want a high end Vegas casino experience the Flamingo is NOT your place.  However, those places cost double or triple of the Flamingo!  Plan and spend accordingly.  I have been to Vegas probably 25 or 30 times.  I have been in a ton of hotels.  I have stayed at some of the highest end places to dives on Freemont Street.  The Flamingo is certainly one of the more affordable hotels and casinos on the strip.  I would rather stay at the Bellagio, Wynn or Encore - but I liked my bill for the Flamingo.  I like the location of the hotel a lot.  I have stayed here for business 4 years in a row.  The Flamingo is right on the monorail track and has its own stop.  I am always here to attend a trade show at the LVCC so this is super convenient for me.  The rooms are fine and definitely can be called kitschy cool.  I have had better and I have had WAY worse in Vegas.  You get what you pay for in LV (like everywhere) and I was fine again with the value.  If you want to situate yourself on the mid strip (and on the monorail!) this is a great location.  Also, since the Linc has opened up with the street mall on the walk to it I like the food & drink options immediately outside the hotel a whole lot more.  Caesars is right across the street too.  I was in here at like 100 + a night with all the resort fees and taxes.  AGAIN, if you want a high end experience don\'t stay here, it\'s that simple - but plan to budget 250-350 a night instead.'
