b'My wife and I came home from a trip to find one of the drip outlets had been running for hours.  My yard guy admitted he had no idea.  I called these folks and the next day Jake showed up.  After some looking he was not sure what caused it.  To be on the safe side I had him replace a valve that was old.  He did it well, quickly and checked everything, including all the settings.  Will definitely recommend.'
