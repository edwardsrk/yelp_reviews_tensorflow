b"Port City Club is a great place to unwind. They have a nice view of the lake (though it's a bit crowded by all the docked boats) and a lovely beachside area where you can relax. As a Charlottean, the crowd is definitely older than what I'm used to, but it's kind of a nice change of pace. The decor is a bit outdated but it really does feel like a club.The drinks aren't too pricey. I highly recommend getting there early, adding your name to the inevitably long list, and posting up on the couches outside while you wait for a table. The food was decent. The four stars are definitely more for the location than the food. The zucchini chips are clearly one of their most popular items and they were delicious, albeit a bit salty. I then had the Greek salad which was sub-par. The feta came in a solid block (why?) and wasn't super high quality. As a vegetarian, they don't have a TON of options for me, but just enough."
