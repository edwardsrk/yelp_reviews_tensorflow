b"The waffles here are to die for.  Having been to Belgium, I can say that these are almost just as delicious.  It can be a bit pricey but for all the waffle and toppings that you can get with it, it's definiely worth it!Try the waffle with vanilla bean ice cream and fruits/chocolate sauce! The map on the wall is also cool to look at while you're waiting or enjoying your waffle."
