b"Back when this was Cactus Jack's I went in once and it was super dirty and sketchy. What a difference new ownership makes! The place is sparkling clean, including the restrooms. I am super weird about cleanliness especially when places serve food. The staff has been fabulous every time we've gone in with friendly people working there. The food is also super yummy! The chicken fingers and burgers are to-die-for! I didn't care for the wings but that was a personal preference as their flavoring is good but they aren't as crisp as I prefer them as they aren't grilled. It's a very interesting crowd of all different kinds of people and it has a fun mix of music along with a pool table. This is a great casual place to hang out and grab a bite to eat."
