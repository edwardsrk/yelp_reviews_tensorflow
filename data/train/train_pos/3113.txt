b'Okay so this place rocks.You cannot go here without getting tyhe Prime Rib, it is amazing. The stick some mash potatoes and Yorkshire Pudding and I am in ex pat heaven. My one tiny tiny gripe is give everyone the yorkshire puddings in one piece so you can pour the gravy in and have a delicious bowl. That is how it is done, none of this cutting the yorkies into pieces business. The decor was semi fancy and the service was brilliant. Our servers all had a sense of humour, which you need when faced with a group of 15 guys out for shenanigans.This place is a must when you visit Vegas.'
