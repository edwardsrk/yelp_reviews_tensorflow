b'This is new and a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Very tasty. Spacious so you can get a table, a bit noisy but not overwhelming. The food is authentic and very good. A little bit sweeter than I like, and "medium" is not spicy enough. But flavors are very savory and cooked well. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall very good and will come back, but only rated 4 stars compared to our favorite Bangal Kabab House.'
