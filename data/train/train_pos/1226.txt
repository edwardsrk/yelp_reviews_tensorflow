Unfortunetly for some unknown reason my christmas tree had absolutely no scent this year ...i mean i could smell my basil plant over the tree lol. Anyways i called and john was very nice and told me he would swap my tree out at no extra cost which they did and they even through ina. Bottle of plant food for the inconvenience! I am very pleased with my new tree and i deffinetly will be back next year all thanks to john and his excellent customer service! Keep up the good work see you guys next year!'
