b"Recommendation: Large Stew Chicken ($10). The meat is tender, sauce is delicious... it's SO moist. Cooked to perfection. I've had it about 5-6 times and it's been sensational every time.The portions are large. The rice is cooked perfectly, is moist, and is most delicious with a bit of gravy. I've also tried the goat and the jerk chicken, but Iike the stew chicken more.I haven't tried the ox tail yet... (loved the stew chicken too much to pay an extra $3) but ox tail is amazing, and I'm willing to bet that it's terrific here.I'll report back on the oxtail and roti when I try them.Terrific value considering how good the food is.FYI - It's a take-out joint.BONUS: Open late!"
