b'Was a little skeptical the first time I came in so I am updating my review as I have been back multiple times, the ethiopian food is soo on point its rediculously good! The service is ultra casual and chill. This place is by far my favorite ethiopian restaraunt, and I highly reccomend it. The spice is perfect n the raw beef is delicious! Worth your hard earned $. My wife says she looves the cabage dish!'
