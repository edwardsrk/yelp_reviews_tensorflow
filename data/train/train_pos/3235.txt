b'I really enjoyed this place. I\'d give the decor 4.5 stars and the service and food 5 stars. Our waiter was super nice and he seemed to really love his job. My family got 1 lb of shrimp "hot feel" and mild. The sauce is good! The shrimp are big too. We also got 2 free pounds of combination seafood because of a newspaper special they have. The lamb skewers were bombbb! The location is kind of tucked into the plaza across Tea Station.'
