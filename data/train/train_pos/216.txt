b'Great restaurant in the Sheridan Square neighborhood!  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful night with misters.  The service was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good.  I started with the pork spring rolls and followed it with the lemongrass chicken.  Both were very fresh, flavorful and tasty!'
