b"WOW! The sandwiches here are off the hook! Not expected considering it's sitting inside of a mega resort. My wife had a club sandwich and I had a pastrami sandwich. Both were excellent! The bread was fresh, the meats were utterly tender, and oh so flavorful. You get a whole pickle with your sandwich, not just a spear. Here's a tip if you want your sandwich quicker. Have a drink at the 32 bar right next door and order your food from there. It took less than ten minutes for our sandwiches to get to us after we ordered them. That's fast considering the line for this place is always super long."
