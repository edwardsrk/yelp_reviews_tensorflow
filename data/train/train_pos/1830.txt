b"We came here for my lovely gal's birthday dinner and I was overjoyed to learn that the place had a Japanese flair to their menu. And if anyone knows me, they know I have a sick addiction to edamame. Sick. This place didn't make that addiction any better whatsoever with their delicious garlic stuff, but it definitely hit the spot good. And that's just soybeans, I'm not even talking about the awesome meat! We chose the brisket, the filet mignon, the pork belly, just about anything and everything; all were delicious! All decently priced. They give you 3 different sauces to dip your protein in- there's like a ponzu tangy one, a house special one, and a spicier version of the house special- which I preferred- cause I loooove spicy. Only thing that was so-so for me was their steamed egg. It's one of my favorite things to eat when I go out to eat Korean BBQ and I was just a little disappointed considering everything else was so good. But if anything try some of their gyoza. Deeeeee freakin licious! Service was good and the room we got was pretty awesome. I'll be back for sure."
