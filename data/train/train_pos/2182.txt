b'We probably have tried all of the guac flavors by now. All of them were tasty and unique in their own way. My favorite was the crab meat and roasted garlic. You can clearly taste the crab meat, but not over powering. They used to have a roasted garlic, honey with goat cheese and that was very delicious as well. For the main courses, I love the short ribs tamale and the lamb shank. The lamb was literally falling off the bone. Very delicious!!! However, the wait was very long (about 90 min) and that seems to be typical for all of the times I have visited.'
