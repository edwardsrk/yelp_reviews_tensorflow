b'we had a large party and the staff was excellent.  they have a prix fix which I would recommend.  Portions are quite large and the deserts are excellent.  I had salmon but if I were to order it again I would ask for it simply grilled as the sauce was a little over-powering.  It is a very beautiful place and elegant in a casual way.'
