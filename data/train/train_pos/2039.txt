b'+1 right off the strip-1 $20 cover+1 large enough dance floor, well, when you\'re the only one dancing, the floor is huge+1 almost everyone is friendly-1 the bartender measured every shot and when I told him heavier on the Jameson, he pointed out the camera and made a scared/sad face he gets watched-1 hustlers everywhereSo, I arrived with my crew 10:30ish Saturday night. Some guy tried to hustle us for half the admission price with his passes. Sure, buddy, let\'s move along now.After some wait, I paid my $20 cover only to discover the club was practically empty. We did some drinking and then by 11, I was the first one on the dance floor. The music was good but they claimed it was Madonna night. And they only played three Madonna songs. What\'s up with that?I met some nice gay boys. At some point, one of my friends was asking why I was meeting some many people and not them. Ha! What can I say? Gay men love me because I\'m one of them?If I had to compare this club to something in LA, I would say it\'s a really big Mickey\'s type club. People are more into dancing here than say the Abbey. I have no idea how much drink prices are individually but I think it\'s on the steeper side. I bought two drinks and a bottle of water and got charged over $35. Make sure you get stamped when you go inside. I somehow ended up outside for a bit and they wouldn\'t let me back in the way I came because "they were now a different club" and the bouncer wanted to charge me another $10. Hustlers everywhere, I tell you. I had to go back to the front and the bouncer there let me in.'
