b'This place is a hidden gem! The pickle fries were a great app! My steak salad was a little over priced for the amount of salad that you get but it was good. My mom got the summer blt sandwich and said it was delicious. We ate outside on the covered patio which was beautiful. Great place to eat on Neville'
