b"Cute froyo shop near home. My favorites are the coconut and the pineapple. I was super excited when I saw taro, but was disappointed when I got a taste. It is tart and I personally think taro shouldn't be tart.  Anyway, the pineapple is amazing and I'll just stick with that.They have lots of unique toppings, including different flavored bobas. They aren't really bobas, more like round balls shaped like boba that burst with juice when you pop them. I usually steer clear of those and goes straight for the mochi. They also offer the usual fresh fruit, candies, chocolates, cereals, nuts and etc... Price is comparable to all other self serve yogurt shops."
