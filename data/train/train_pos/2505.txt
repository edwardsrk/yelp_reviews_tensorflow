b'Nice chips and both red and green sauces to start.  Had the slightly sweet chicken mole enchilada, tried the paella that seemed to have more veggies than rice, nice flavor from the chorizo.  The star of the night was the pork belly burrito, having that crispy porky flavor was great.  Nice house margarita.'
