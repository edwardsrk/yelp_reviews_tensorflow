b'Andrew has done my taxes for the last 3 years based on a friends recommendation.   The first couple of time he helped me navigate through some serious financial issues I had made in my early years.  The outcome was very favorable thanks to his excellent advice.  This year he really came through for me and my family, and it took less time the the previous years and emailing back and forth made things very convenient.   Thank you andrew for the excellent work!'
