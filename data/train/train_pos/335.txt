b'I\'ve been frequenting Harris Grill for a few years now and it typically doesn\'t disappoint. Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order "Britney Spears"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.Anyway, I\'ve ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their "church basement pierogies." They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I\'m graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I\'m a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.The downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.'
