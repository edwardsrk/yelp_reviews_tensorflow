b'For a 24 hr place it was a very pleasant experience. The person at the front didn\'t notice me for a very, very, very long time... Ok, so it\'s not Starbucks. Then, I asked her about the pastries, and she\'s basically like "Well, is that what the tag says? I can\'t see it?" Ok the tag said just "dairy" and I found out those were their non-vegan selections... She turned it around and was lovely. The lack of a star is because I was expecting more food choices. The outside seating was nice and clean. I wasn\'t able to sleep and that place was somewhere to go and just write and think. If I was vegan, I would have probably stayed longer and had plenty of food choices. I have vegan friends who struggle so I see what it feels like.'
