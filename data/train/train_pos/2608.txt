b"Tremont Scoops has REOPENED under new ownership!  They've refreshed their branding, and they're now scooping a variety of ice creams made by a local family-owned ice cream company.  I liked the dark chocolate, mango sorbet, moose tracks and peanut butter flavors the best, although they have a nice assortment of flavors that they've clearly put some thought into.The focus is on the classic ice cream flavors, with a few interesting ones thrown in.  In addition to the standard cone selections (cake, sugar, and waffle), they also offer something called a pretzel cone.Overall, it's a nice addition to the neighborhood and a welcome improvement to the old Scoops."
