b"We love coming here! Most of the people are great- but occasionally you find the one nutcase or helicopter dog-mom, etc- but that's with any dog park. The enclosures are large and well-maintained... But watch out after rain as it gets pretty muddy. Also, in the peak of summer there is oftentimes algae buildup in the water... Wish there was a way to fix that- then it would be PERFECT."
