b'Want to live in a millon dollar urban apartment--or just borrow one for a night? The one-bedroom suites at Palms Place are a fantastic execution of sexy, sleek, classic cool. Done in muted, masculine tones, the mod digs feature addictive beds, showers-for-2 (with rainfall), a freestanding spa tub in the bedroom, plasma Tvs (with DVD), an automatic fireplace, long couch, all-stainless fully appointed kitchen, and balconies (a rarity in Sin City). And the room service is by Iron Chef America winner Kerry Simon--who also does a unique Sunday brunch downstairs. Nice details like dimmer lights throughout, Aveda amenities, and well-placed mirrors seal the deal.The spa here has a super sexy co-ed Turkish hammam.'
