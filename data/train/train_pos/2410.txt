b"Wow, such a great find in an airport of all places!  The dark, upscale ambiance here was a welcome contrast from the usual airport feel and I'm glad that the food and service matched it accordingly.Our meal began with some chips & guacamole and while the former could've been fresher, I loved the creamy guac.  Next, my carnitas pork roast was sliced paper thin and topped with just enough BBQ sauce to deepen the savory flavors without drenching everything.  Finally, the key lime pie at the end was sweet and refreshing.A five up high goes out to the waitress too as she really did an excellent job throughout the meal - well-spoken, enthusiastic with recommendations and very attentive to our needs."
