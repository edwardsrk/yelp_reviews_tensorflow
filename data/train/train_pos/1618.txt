b"These guys do such a great job with event security, cleanup, and organization.  Every year I attend the Waste Management Open, they make our experience in the Bird's Nest VIP and corporate cabanas top notch.Their staff is well trained and understands the flow of a large event.  They not only handle the WMO, but several larger events in the Valley.  Each time, my experience with them is great.  Kudos to their events team!Return Factor - 90%"
