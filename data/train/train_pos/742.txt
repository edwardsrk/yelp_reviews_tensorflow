b"If you people really think that this Safeway is all that ghetto then I'd hate to see your asses try to get by on the east coast...or maybe LA.  Granted, this Safeway does have its share of transients (who overnight at the park across the street), but all in all it's a pretty good grocery store.  For the most part it's clean. They provide those sani-wipes at the front door, and the wine and floral selection is kickin.  On occasion, I've seen some check-out mayhem, but for the most part they do a good job (during daylight hours anyway) of adding checkers when needed and are usually very helpful and pleasant (considering they're being paid minimum wage to do a job that you do yourself at Fresh & Easy or any supermarket on the east coast).I will say I was bummed today when I did 95% of my shopping only to get to the end and find that they had neither the brats, nor Italian sausage I was looking for and i had to make a double grocery excursion to hit up the ghetto Fry's on Thomas.I also have to give this Safeway props, b/c while my fave Starbucks (in the same shopping center) was being renovated, that S'buck's kiosk kept me amped in the AM."
