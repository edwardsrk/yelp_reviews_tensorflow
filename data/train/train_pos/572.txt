b"On the recommendation of our AirBnB host, we had a delightful diner breakfast at the Coach House while visiting Toronto.  You get a huge plate of food -- I had sausage, home fries, and eggs, and my guy had French toast -- for under $10.  It's not especially fancy or gourmet, but it fills you up and hits the spot.  Coffee is decent, and your cup is continually refilled.  Service is friendly and efficient.  I'm from NJ, where we take our diners (and our diner breakfasts) seriously.  Coach House passes muster with me!"
