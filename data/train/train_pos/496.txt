b"My family met here tonight to grab some food and catch up. There were 10 of us and they accommodated us on the patio. Vanessa was our server and she was fantastic. She helped us with the menu and was super funny. She handled us all ordering at different times like a champ. I've waited tables for 20+ years and needy tables are the worst but she was not bothered by us at all. When I come back, I'll definitely ask for her again. Ok, now the food. I had the bbq burger, cooked to perfection with sweet potato waffle fries. It was absolutely delicious. Mom had a chef salad, uncles had a club like sandwich and a french dip. Sisters had prime rib sliders and a chicken sandwich. Nephew got the philly cheesesteak. Everyone was happy with their choices. We also got all 3 cheese, meat and fruit boards which were 7 bucks each! Loaded with cheeses, all kinds, salami, prosciutto and  fresh fruit. A-MAZ-ING. I can't wait to go back! Only complaint was that stupid jenga game. They should put a rug underneath it so it's not so loud when it falls."
