b"Stopped by today for the first time at lunch. I had never heard of the place although it has been open a few months. I got the smoked turkey club, it was good! Not a huge sandwich but with a bag of chips was enough to be satisfying for lunch. The turkey didn't taste very smokey but was still good. They need to replace their window signage to get noticed. It is black lettering on glass storefront with dark backdrop which disappears and is easily missed. I drive by 44th and Lorain daily headed to 90 and have never even noticed the place. They need white lettering or a fascia sign.  My only gripe is I feel the sandwiches are $1-$2 too expensive. If they were $8 I'd be more likely to be a regular. When you start talking $12 for an average sized sandwich and bag of chips it is borderline pricey."
