b"We had an enjoyable meal at Hank's.The food was excellent and everything was prepared wonderfully.  From the Steakhouse Salad, Crab Cakes, T-Bone for 2 and sides...all delicious.  The drinks were equally awesome.My rant, however, would be the service.  We came here a month ago and sat in the main dining room.  Again, food was awesome but service so-so.  They forgot my birthday dessert but we were full anyways so it wasn't a big deal, just disappointing.This time, we sat in the bar area to hear the live music.  Atmosphere not as romantic as it was crowded and noisy...but it was to be expected.  No biggie.Our waitress was nice and helpful when around, but most of the time...WHERE DID SHE GO?She was too busy helping the party near us with cocktails.  We were the least of her worries, or at least it felt that way.  Everything was sloooow.  Spacing between appetizers, main course and dessert was T O O FAR A P A R T!  Other than that, we really did like the food and music.Hopefully the third times a charm, should we frequent Hank's again!  :-)"
