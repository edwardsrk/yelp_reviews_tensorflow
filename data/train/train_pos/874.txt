b"Had to run to WalMart last night and decided to see if this Chandler store had opened yet.  When I walked in I saw tray after tray of gorgeous cupcakes and just could not decide what to try.  The very cute, nice guy working behind the counter asked what I liked.  I said peanut butter and he suggested the *something* Elvis cupcake (can't remember right now).  It was banana cake with peanut butter frosting with little chocolate chips on top and a little glitter to it.All I can say is, next time I will eat 1/2 at a sitting.  Holy cow!  It was the best cupcake I'd ever had but I ate the whole thing and felt a bit more than full afterwards.  The frosting was delicious but a little rich, the cake was moist and perfect.  This place will be the destruction of my good eating habits for sure.  Thankfully, I don't go to WalMart all that often ... but I WILL be back.  Too many amazing flavors I want to try. ;)"
