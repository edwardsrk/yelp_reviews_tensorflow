b"This is my go-to when I don't bring lunch to work as it is just across the street from me. It is a quaint little place, with authentic Turkish dishes made fresh every day. I gave it 4 stars just because I noticed that the portions are much smaller now than it was when it first opened. They also stopped making the orangey rice that I loved. However, I love how tender the chicken is--the meat falls off the bone. If you're ever in the area, you should give this place a try. It is quiet, has amazing food and the servers are really accomodating. Plus, they have Turkish coffee!"
