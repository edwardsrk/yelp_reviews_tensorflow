b"Handful of items are one order per person like salmon belly, oysters, seafood salad (like mixed fish poke), ocean trout, ama ebi... Etc. But well worth it for AYCE. Been here many many times since this is the hubbys favorite sushi spot at the moment ;) if u get Kevin as ur server ur in luck! Always attentive and super fast. Love it. Fish here is twice the size of the rice and they serve fresh wasabi for a $3 upcharge so this is a definite must try. You won't be sorry."
