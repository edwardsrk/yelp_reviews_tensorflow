b"This place was great! The rooms were clean, everything was well organized, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I loved the choices in sound. Check-in was fast and simple. My favorite part was the relaxation lounge. There were books, oracle decks, crystals, tea, all kinds of things to relax and enjoy after your float. There was also a book you could leave a journal entry in, it was fun seeing everyone's doodles. Highly recommend this place :)"
