b'I came in for a late dinner on a weekday and it was very busy! Luckily they sat our large party very quickly even though only a couple people were there.  The service was outstanding and I am fairly certain our server was the only one in the two front rooms, I frequently observed him picking up and delivering food on both rooms to the left and right of the lobby including other large parties.  We started with the mini chimi platter pretty standard as an appetizer.  For my meal I usually get the chimichanga with chicken fajita filling, seasoned pieces of chicken peppers and onions, sour cream, guacamole rice and beans.  By the time you pay $2.25 extra for the chicken fajita filling its around a $15.00 chimichanga so it\'s a little pricey but so good.  Tonight I decided on the Chilequiles since I had never seen it in their menu before.  It is kind of a Mexican casserole with chicken cheese sour cream and green sauce this version said it had corn chips baked in, usually it is made with corn tortillas but I thought "why not I love their chips".  Let\'s start with the good news it was jam packed with shredded chicken that was moist and had great flavor.  Now for the bad the chips just turned into a soggy mush and the green sauce made it feel more like a thick chicken soup than a casserole.  The rice and beans were fantastic so after finishing those and the appetizer I was okay just picking at my soup.  2.5 stars for that dish due to the chicken everyone else\'s food was good now I just know what I can skip next time'
