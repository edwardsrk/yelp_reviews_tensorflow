b"It was a last minute decision going to Vegas and because it was last minute we had not booked a room. It was a decision should we stay on the strip or off the strip? So the executive decision was to stay off the strip and South point was our go to hotel. How did south point get a country decor? Wasn't it just name because it was south of the Las Vegas strip? Hmmmm! is that why they did the country theme? Hopefully someone would answer my questions. Casino was bright and surprisingly very upbeat. The rooms were roomy and clean the only down fall was you couldn't get the curtains to close all the way and that bit of sunlight seeping through early morning can be a drag. I had a ray of sunlight across my eyes at 6am it was perfectly set on my eyes. $5.00 dollar blackjack tables, hello is this 1999 again? When your poor and have somewhat of a gambling addiction $ 5.00 tables are so enticing. Crap tables super fun if you have the right group. If you get a players club and spend a good amount at the tables they will comp you. No vegas hotels comp much anymore so South Point was a real Gem. Buffet is terrible but if you look inside your coupon book its 50% off. Who can beat 50% off for a buffet it was satisfying. Also in the free coupon book you get a free souvenir.  You can get a shuttle to drive you into Vegas for 8 dollars and if you have a car then its only 15 minutes away.I would stay here again it was clean and inexpensive."
