b"I recently went to this restaurant with a group of friends as I had heard so many positive reviews and must say Artigiani definately lived up to expectations. This resto serves up one  of the best wood oven pizza's in montreal.Their  pizza is thin crust  and  they a have wide variety of pizza's that will please your pallette.  Ambiance is cozy and modern decor. They also serve up a great seafood pasta dish for all you seafood lovers and must not forget to mention their fried calamari entree. Lastly, be sure to leave room for their wonderful tiramisu dessert served in a gelato glass. Would definately recommend!"
