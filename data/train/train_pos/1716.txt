b"Easily some of the best Chinese food on this side of town! I can only speak for the vegetarian options. The veggie fried rice does have egg, though you can of course ask for it without like I did, still tastes great. Veggie lo mein is great, vegetable potstickers were great, a little flavorless, but they were satisfying. For $20, I got portions large enough for two or, if you're eating alone, enough for a large lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, roughly $6 a meal, so not bad! Service was quick and staff was friendly, not busy. Fresh veggies, everything was thoroughly cooked. Highly recommend this place and I've tried a lot of Chinese food on the east side."
