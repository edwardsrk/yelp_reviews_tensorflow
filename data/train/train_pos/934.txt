b'Check in time stated 4pm our room was not ready until 6pm. We enjoyed the pool and the staff provided complimentary drinks coupons. Our reservation was by phone and we requested the late checkout at 4pm.  I have always wanted to stay at Fire in the Sky and wanted to give them a fair chance. I love resort stays!*****Unhappy Surprise -lobby staff AKA- the smart mouthed blond kid behind the desk- told us the next day "you won\'t be able to check out late-for blah blah reason and that is not on your paid itinerary."My husband attempted to work with him but he clearly doesn\'t care about his job or the resortFor the most part staff is very helpful and the rooms are clean. The resort is smaller so it is was far easier to walk to the pool then other resorts.  My daughter and I spent  quality time together and finished off our Labor Day stay by indulging in the tiramisu by the pool.  The dessert is made when you order and very worth it.'
