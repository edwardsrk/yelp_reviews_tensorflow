b"This is another great ayce sushi place I visit at least once a month. The biggest selling point is the fact that they actually have little rice with their sushi. I hate how some places have rice that's size of my fist with such a small sushi piece. However, the Entrees here are comparably worse than Sushi Legend (my favourite ayce place)."
