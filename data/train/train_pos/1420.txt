b"Date night doesn't happen enough for my husband and I, but when it does, we like to try restaurants that we haven't been to before.  So last night, after a quick shopping stop at the Crafeteria event hosted by Frances, we headed over to Otro Cafe for dinner.  We were not disappointed!I used the Yelp app directions to find the location (duh!), and were psyched to find plenty of parking + no wait to sit down when we arrived without a reservation around 8pm on a Friday.  All of the employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and personable from the hostess and our server to Heather, another staff member that we recognized from another local cafe.  Our server, Randy was attentive and offered recs on the menu when we asked.  We ended up sharing an order of the Guacamole Classico as an app.  I ordered it with both chips and raw veggies.  I love that the veggies are an option.  (Veggies are chilled just right and include carrots, celery, cucumbers, jicama and radish).   The guac is chunky and includes avocado, cilantro, serrano chiles, lime juice, salt, white onions, tomatillos, orange and cotija cheese.  We each had a beer from their selection of both Mexican and local options, and then shared two entrees: the Pescado del Dia and the Mole Negro.  The fish came with veggies and the mole chicken came with fried rice and tortillas.  The ambiance is casual and features art on the wall from local artists.  The prices are moderate, especially considering portion sizes.  There is something for everyone on the menu too... and it's worth noting that Otro opens on Saturdays and Sundays at 8am for breakfast.  They get their coffee from Lux as well!We'll definitely be back to Otro, and hopefully pronto!"
