b'This is the best Shawarma I have had in Calgary! (That is not something that I would say causally) ... and I was sober when i went there!This was a fabulous surprise, ... until I tried the Falafel sandwich , ... Wow! The best Falafel I have tasted on this side of the Mediterranean.Their secret is ... Fresh ingredients, and traffic.The service was great, I plan to go back again at an earlier time in the day to try the Foul.'
