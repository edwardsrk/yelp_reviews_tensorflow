b"So glad we ventured off the strip and found this place. I've been so tired of overpaying for mediocre at best food. This isn't high end sushi, it's AYCE but that said...I'm glad this AYCE sushi joint isn't one where they have sushi out for people to sneeze on and put their dirty hands all over! //// ---- How it works:- For $26.95: Order whatever you want, as many times as you want from the waiter- Menu includes appetizers (miso soup, Japchae), skewers, nigiri, tempura rolls, deep fried rolls, classic rolls, no rice rolls and deserts! Whatttt///// ---- Would recommend:- getting any rolls with spicy tuna- asking for no sauce (their sauces were either heavy mayo or sweet) - swapping crab mixes for crab sticks (avoid all the heavy mayo)- skipping the skewers: most too oily, but if I had to pick one - go for the shrimp - passing on dessert: really wasn't impressed by the mochi or green tea ice cream, but hey it's included haha //// ---- Tips:- Free small Sapporo for Yelp review- ~5-10 min ride from encore depending on traffic Would definitely come back. Come early to avoid a wait, great service"
