b"The food, service, everything is fantastic here. We love the warmth everytime we step in the door. As soon as you walk in you're  greeted with a warm hello and tonight was seat yourself please. We ordered everything from fried chicken to burgers and the best for me, tonight's special which was prime rib. Not a bad price of 16.99 which included a potato and a vegetable. I chose mashed which were nice and fluffy and I devoured them. We chose to pass on dessert tonight but we did start with a zucchini appetizer which was fresh and tasty. You will never go home hungry, this joint is a diamond in the rough."
