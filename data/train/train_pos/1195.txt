b'I loved this place!  I definitely recommend downloading the "nowait" app to make sure that you don\'t have to wait for a table for two hours.  We got a few plates - the dirty south nachos, fried meatballs, shells & cheese, and the Ki roll.  My favorites were the Ki roll and the shells & cheese (which were PHENOMINAL!!).  The dirty south nachos were good but different, and the fried meatballs were good but a little dry.  I got an amazing cucumber vodka mojito to drink, which was a perfect pallet refresher!  The interior is super cute and very intimate.'
