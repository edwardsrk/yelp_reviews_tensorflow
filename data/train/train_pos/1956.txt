b"I like Cynthia's, if for no other reason than it is completely accepting of its own drama.  There is a kind of theater that goes on the moment you walk through the door: waiters and waitresses in faux-satin costumes that depict everything from modern Chinese jackets to ancient flowing robes.  The carvings on the wall, the golden soup-bowl holders, the menus printed on fabric fans; it's all just a little bit cheesy, but in a way that speaks more to pageantry and decadence than it does to mockery.  Cynthia's isn't some corporate entity trying to hock Chinese culture on unwitting Canadians; it's an earnest attempt to make a restaurant into a Chinese dining experience.  Whether it succeeds or not is a question I leave to you, but I love them for the attempt.As far as the food goes, it's good; you're paying a premium more for the atmosphere than the food.  The quality is consistent which is more than I can say for a lot of Chinese restaurants - they have an experience staff of both servers and cooks who deliver the same experience every time.  Do they have the best Peking Duck in Toronto? No.  But their Peking Duck isn't bad.  Do they have the best Chow Mein in Toronto? No.  But the Chow Mein is pretty good.  I mean, there are restaurants out there that have amazing noodle dishes but horrible rice plates - Cynthia's is neither of these; what they do, they do well, I find no complaint for their food - but it has never blown me away either."
