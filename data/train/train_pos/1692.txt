b"Monday night wait was surprisingly long.  Plan ahead.  Food was excellent, although surprisingly pricey given that there is no meat.   Wasn't given the option by the server to order the smaller bowl, and therefore ended up with the larger bowl which was far too much food.  Ended up taking a lot of the food home with me."
