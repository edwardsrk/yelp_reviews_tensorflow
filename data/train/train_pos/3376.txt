b'Got the brisket sandwich. Was not drowing in BBQ sauce which I appreciate. Great flavor, great texture, nice and soft. With onions and brioche. Nom nom. Although the food was great, the gents running the place try to really do what they can for you. They let me try a sample, very engaging and fun. I will be going back.'
