b"This is small quaint little place to get some tasty, but still very affordable pho. The gentleman (and I'm assuming maybe the owner) who greets,seats, and takes our orders is very friendly, patient, and quick to make recommendations if you have any particular requests (as I heard him do when a lady seated nearby told him she was on a diet). We usually stop in to get an order to-go and the service is always quick, with the food usually taking only about 5-10 minutes.My husband loves their iced coffee with condensed milk and I usually go for their Pho Ga, which is offered with their lunch special ($6.50 with a soda or tea included). If you're ever craving some delicious pho, but are in a budget this is the place to go."
