b'The cost to enter this conservation area is $7 per vehicle. It is a one-way loop that is to be driven very slowly. There are many cars on the road or parked on the side of the road, so keep your eyes open for moving objects.The scenery is quite beautiful. The red rocks and mountains are stunning. There are many places for climbing or hiking, from easy to more difficult trails. Turtlehead Peak was the reason for our visit, and it did not disappoint. It is a fairly strenuous 5 mile hike. Parking is located at Sandstone Quarry for Turtlehead, but there are many areas on the side of the road to park, if you wish to visit other areas.'
