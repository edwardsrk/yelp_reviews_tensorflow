b"I love, love, love the Picado salad at Crazy Jim's, but today I ordered one for takeout and will never do so again. When they handed me my order, I jokingly asked why it was so small. She just laughed. Now, when you dine in, the salad is large and you have enough leftovers for a snack later. And at $10 it's worth it. The flavors are amazing. The take out portion is half the size. Not worth $10. I always add some feta to my salad when I dine in...and I don't mind--so much--paying an extra $2. But today, adding feta to my to-go salad cost me nearly $4 and it was sparse. Oh Crazy Jim's, I'll be back. I just won't ever call anything in."
