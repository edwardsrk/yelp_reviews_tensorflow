b"We went really early to beat the dinner rush and were rewarded with a great booth. The ambience is relaxed and cozy, though it's not dressed down by any means. The staff wear cute bow ties and are very attentive and friendly. I was pleased with mostly everything except the Aloette Punch. The jasmine tea and champagne syrup were nice, but I was hoping for a stronger aromatised wine, well, punch. (You saw that coming and still kept reading so whose fault is that, really.)Toasted bread and yeast butter comes with your order. The roasted squid was great but considering that's what it's called, perhaps they should pull back on the pork belly so it's not 50-50. Needs more squid. The crispy squash with brown butter hollandaise is very good, you can't skip it. And another must for meat lovers is the rib eye steak. Cooked slowly to perfection so order it early if you're starving. The king oyster mushrooms that come with it are almost as good as the steak itself. I'll definitely be back."
