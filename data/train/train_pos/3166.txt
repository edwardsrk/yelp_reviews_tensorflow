b'AMAZING. Absolutely love this place. For pilates and barefoot bootcamp, Martin and Liz are unreal. Janelle and Mark teach an awesome TRX class. Strongly recommend that you arrive at least ten minutes before a class. One of the reasons I love this studio is the number of classes they have in the day. I can go to the 5:45 and 6 am classes or hit the 7:15 and 8:30pm classes depending on my schedule. On top of the great instructors and class times, it is also really affordable. Especially compared to other studios nearby.'
