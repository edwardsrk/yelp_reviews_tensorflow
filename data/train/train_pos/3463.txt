b'I think I reviewed this already but....You expect a great steak with great service to be a bit  expensive.  You get what you pay for.  There were 8 of us and we had reservations..  The service was great.  The food was great and the wine list was a book of great wines available at all prices.  I will be back to try their dry-aged bone-in rib eye.  All of us that the whole evening was wonderful.'
