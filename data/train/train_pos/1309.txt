b"I brought a large group here for a friend's bachelor party. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive, though the food was somewhat slow to come, perhaps due to the large size of the group.The steaks were all perfectly cooked and delicious, and the signature complimentary popovers were also quite tasty. We also received an amuse bouche of chicken liver pate and crostini which, though not in line with my personal taste, was a nice touch. Our waiter was also able to recommend a nice bottle of wine which was reasonably priced. My one complaint was the deserts, which each lacked flavor and creativity. All in all I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
