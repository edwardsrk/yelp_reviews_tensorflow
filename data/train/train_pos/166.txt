b'Went in to check out the different phones that ATT has thru Best Buy. After looking at several models decided upon the Motorola Atrix. This is where it gets complicated. I have four lines and some were ready for upgrades....well anyway it took us over two hours with the store and ATT to get everything straightened out.  Kendra who was helping us was supposed to leave early to spend time with her family and never once did she act impatient or on a hurry. GREAT SERVICE!  Very Happy with my new phone...the only  reason they do not have five stars is because there were only two of them working and the line got backed up.  But very happy with my service!!! Thanks Kendra!'
