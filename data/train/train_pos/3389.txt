b"Better meat than most buffets I've had in the valley. Pretty new place, but the owners were previously owners of a different restaurant that was sold so seem to have the mixture and admin down right. Very nice people and good service. My favorite on the buffet was the goat---which is usually difficult to find. They did a good job and didn't skimp on the meat."
