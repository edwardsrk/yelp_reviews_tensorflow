b'First time here, the staff is hustling back and forth. Yet, they took their time to go over our questions and customization.  Prices are super reasonable. Unfortunately, food took 24 min, they said the other store had a malfunction and this kitchen was getting "slammed".  Got my order wrong. Second chance order took 16 min, orders are all correct and delicious. 4 stars because of the initial infraction.'
