b"I don't have much to say about this place except that it's cheap and it's good! I stumbled in here one night with a friend when we were craving sushi, and we weren't disappointed. We did have to wait a while for a table, but service was quick and polite.I ordered the deluxe bento box for $8 and it was almost more than can I eat (which is saying something for me ;) ) I'll definitely be back!"
