b'Using the groupon for $27 for one person to get two races and $48 for two persons to get two races was easy.My first car was awesome and so is the curvy and perfectly banked course. My second car had some issues but still managed to get me to speed and the three of us had a blast. But do be prepared for a upper body workout while you are having a thrilling experience.This experience is such a good deal, and the staff are very organized, helpful and polite.'
