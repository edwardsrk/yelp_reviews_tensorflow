b"Many of my friends have raved about Akahana because (a) their sushi is ALWAYS bogo and (b) their sushi is delicous. After a lovely rainy stroll through McAdenville last night, my fianc\xc3\xa9, a couple of friends, and I decided to test the waters.Service: The service was great. We were seated immediately and our waiter was very attentive throughout the evening. Only issue was that it did take quite a while to get the food out.Selection: I am not sure I have ever been anywhere that had such a great selection of sushi. They even had some Christmas specials. Everyone got two rolls (because bogo) and no one's rolls overlapped.Food: Damn. I'm going back tonight. First, my rolls were huge. Six pieces each, but definitely bigger than most rolls I've had at different sushi establishments. I had the Maui Wowee roll (I was on a plane to Hawaii a year ago today) and the Snapdragon roll. EAch was awesome in its own way. the Maui Wowee had some jalapeno pieces in there, so it was a fair spice, and the Snapdragon was topped with mango, so a good balance to the jalapeno. No one at the table had ANY complaints.Price: Akahana is a little more expensive that most sushi places, but where else is there always bogo rolls? well worth it.Like I said, will definitely be revisiting Akahana sooner rather than later. They also offer carry-out if you just want to swing by after work."
