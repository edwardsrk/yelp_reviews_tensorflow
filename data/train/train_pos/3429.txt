b'Great selection and yes they have it in stock ready to go in my case. I went to 3 other established places had selections but nothing on hand.  Either it was 2 weeks away or we only have a few boxes somewhere. I needed over 1000 sqft. upgraded laminate job and got it done with American quality stuff none of the overseas issues on Formaldehyde off gassing.  Thanks Ramin.'
