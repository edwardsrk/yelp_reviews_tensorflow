b"Stopped by there for a refreshment on our way from Ikea Tempe to Tucson. I've been seeing everyone's drinks on insta and had to try it out. We got there and their posted menu is small but there is more on their website!! They have every flavor you can imagine. The employee who took our order was very nice and helped us make a selection based on what she thought we would like. I ended up with a grapefruit berry soda and my sister with the red white and blue. If I lived there I would spend $$$ at Dutch Bros. Check out their Instagram (we missed Shine by 1 day!) and website to curate your best drink."
