b"Tacos are good and the salsa bar is always a plus. No soda machine, just cans. If they got a soda machine in here, I'd go more often. The sushi is just ok, but it still a pretty cool concept :) biggest drawback is the parking because there isn't any so if you are going with other people, go in one car!"
