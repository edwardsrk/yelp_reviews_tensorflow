b'Ended up eating here on 3 occasions while at the GVR. This is a small space, with only a few tables, but plenty of seating at the sushi bar. Lots of creative and traditional rolls on the menu. I pretty good selection of nigiri, and a nice variety of sake. My favorite was Sparkling Blueberry Sake, very refreshing and you can taste the berry flavor.They offer an all-you-can eat option from 5-7 pm for $28.95. This is a very cost effective way to go when you are hungry and the all-you-can eat menu has almost everything on it. Beware, they will always serve rolls first to fill you up, so if you order nigiri make sure to specifically ask to have it brought out first.P.S. You have to try the steamed chicken dumplings off the fresh sheet.'
