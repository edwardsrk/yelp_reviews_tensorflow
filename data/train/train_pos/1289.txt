b"We came here because of yelp reviews and it was close to where we had been staying for the week.  Hubby and I shared the Popeye's scramble with an upgrade to the  banana cream pancakes. We both also ordered coffee too.  Our waitress was so sweet and always kept checking on us by making sure our cups of water and coffee were always topped of which I appreciated. I am so glad that I read the reviews to know that the portions here were very generous.   Needless to say, the hubby and I were very happy we shared our plate.  It was a lot of food and enough to fill us both up. The coffee was so good too!  I definitely would come back to eat here again if ever in the area again.  The price we paid for four of us and the large amount of food was very affordable."
