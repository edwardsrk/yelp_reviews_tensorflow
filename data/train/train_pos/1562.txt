b"Ok, so other than the skull art all over the place, which kinda freaks me out, this place is amazing!  It's a bit small inside and not ideal for eating in, just a few barstools, which is OK, I'll takeout and eat my yummies at home.  This little joint in Port Credit is worth a little trek out of your way.Three tacos for $10?  Yes please!  Fish, chorizo and babacoa for me.  Great guacamole too, and churros for dessert to finish things off.  Yummy!!!"
