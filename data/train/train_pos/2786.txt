b"I work at Glen- Montreal Children's Hospital. When the end of year approaches, we need to let go. It's time for celebratory dinner, drinking, dancing ... to pay off our hard work. A group of nurses, the organization... throw us a vibrant Christmas party. Vieux-port Steakhouse received us.It's a huge, three floor restaurant. We got the top floor, which includes the dance floor. The restaurant has the rustic decor. It feels cozy and warm since the cold has wrapped us. We were 110 people; I was amazed the service was satisfactory. The waiters did their best to accommodate all of us in timely.To start off, we had bread. It was warm and soft. Then house salad, sadly it was soaked in the vinaigrette. Then the main dish, steak with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. Well cooked, and super delicious. Our table had wine, which was a bit too strong for my taste, so afterwards I ordered my favorite cocktail, whiskey with ginger ale. Then we had three layers chocolate mousse cake. It was light, fluffy and yummy. The music was fantastic. The vibe was hyped up. Wonderful place for a party!"
