b"I've been coming to Moishe's since I was a kid. It was our go-to family restaurant in the 70s and 80s. The decor has been updated and the waiters are as professional as they come. This is not a fancy restaurant, be comfortable. The portions are a good size so don't fill up on the pickles & cole slaw though you will be tempted to!I always get a half-order of boiled verenikes as an appetizer before my baby shish-kebab. (The best marinated filet mignon on the planet.)On a recent trip with a Moishe's n00b, we were offered a selection of special dry-aged meats. The regular menu was perfect, so I didn't try and my n00bie friend enjoyed his regular rib steak to the point where I had to stop him from ripping the bone in two.We were there as soon as they opened at 5 because we had to make a 7 pm show down the street and we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal but chose to skip dessert.Sure, it's expensive but for the price, you get time-tested quality, experienced staff that won't rush around without seeing you and won't get your order wrong. I still love going there but now that I pay the bill, I prefer to keep it for special occasions when I need to know what to expect!"
