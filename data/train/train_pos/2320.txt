b'Food is awesome. I highly recomend Loco moco if you like hawaiian style. I also enjoyed breakfast menu which my other parties ordered and shared together. Two tips: you have to expect of waiting for15-20 minutes(worth it), potatoes as a side on the plate is seasoned and salty(tell them light seasoning or without)'
