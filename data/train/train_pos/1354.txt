b'Went to this store to buy duct tape. Staff didn\'t know where stuff are. I was directed by a staff to aisle 10 but it was wrong. At the paint area I was told it\'s aisle 11. Also wrong. A customer heard me and said it\'s actually right in plain sight, in front of the paint counter. This is beyond sad. A staff doesn\'t even know the products within his area of responsibilities.Gave an extra star because they messed up with the pricing label. I went to returns and the staff knows "scanning code of practice" after I said those magical keywords. Knocked $10 off my $15 duct tape even though the difference was only 70 cents between the pricing label and the barcode price'
