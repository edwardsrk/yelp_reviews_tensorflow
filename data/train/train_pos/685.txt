b"This show is all about managing expectations. If you go in the show expecting some type of Cirque-show you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it thinking you'll hear some good tunes and see some spot-on Beatles impersonators then you'll have a good time. :) My family and I were in Vegas during the week (M-Thu) and would you believe the top shows that we wanted to see were all blacked out (Jabbawockeez, O, and LOVE), but in order to make the best of the situation we decided to see the BeatleShow, mostly because my Mom is a huge Beatles fan. I would have to say that we really enjoyed ourselves. My parents enjoyed singing along and the emcees (in the form of Ed Sullivan, Austin Powers, etc.) tried to make it interactive as well. I do have to say that they really don't look too much like the Beatles (although the person who was George was really the closest match), however, they sounded just like them! And if I had to choose between looking like the Beatles or singing like the Beatles I would of course choose the latter. They sang and played their instruments wonderfully!The show seemed a little short (85 mins I think is what other Yelpers are saying)  and I would've enjoyed hearing more songs (Obla-di-oh-bla-da, more psychedelic Beatles songs--Lucy in the Sky, Strawberry Fields) but for the price I was okay with it ($35). BTW, they are constantly doing deals on this show whether it be through Yelp, or Tix4Tonight, etc. so there is no reason why you should be paying full price!Overall, if you are in Vegas midweek like I was, a Beatles fan and would like to see a good show at a good price, this one might be for you!"
