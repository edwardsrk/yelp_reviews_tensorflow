b"Subway, smubway. Sub Station II wins in my book.Nothing fancy here. Just a small shop that cranks out delicious sandwiches. There's usually a line, but the wait is never long. Pressed for time? Call in your order and pick up. You'll be in and out in five minutes.Most of the small sandwiches you can get for around five bucks. They have a sandwich for everyone. I usually get a small #10 (turkey and cheese), all the way, add mayo and jalapenos. Sometimes I get crazy and go for the #13 (ham, salami, pepperoni). They do not skimp on the meat. The veggies and bread are always fresh.Sandwiches not your thing? SSII does salads as well. Heads up: make sure the person at the slicer gets your ticket. I see so many people who forget and then can't figure out why it's taking so long to get their food."
