b"So I decided to take an easy walk along the Lakeshore in Port Credit and lo and behond...I found Seasons during the summer (is this a really bad pun??).This place is small, quaint and cozy, but in a good way.  It's not hustling and bustling (keep in mind, this was around 9:30-10:30 am in the morning on a Sunday) and provides a nice relaxed informal atmosphere...perfect for a Sunday morning. Ordered the eggs Benedict, which were excellent. After watching many episodes of Masterchef US and trying it myself, I am very picky on them (poached eggs need to ooze out the yolk without being under-cooked, English muffin has to be crispy, bacon needs to have the right texture and hollandaise sauce needs to be tasty). Seasons hit all of those notes, so it was perfect.  I also got a coffee and it tasted good too (not sure if it was the relaxed atmosphere - but it was much better than Timmy's).  The only downside is I'm such a cheapskate, so $15 for breakfast is a bit much to me, but it was eggs Benedict (that really could be for two people - at least for breakfast) and a coffee.  It's not expensive at all, but I'm just cheap.  I'll probably make this my once a month special treat breakfast.   Overall, great spot."
