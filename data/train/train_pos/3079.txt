b'My adorable but klunky big puppy from the local shelter accidentally locked me out of my car while I was removing the trash bins from the driveway.  I was locked out, blocking the road, during a freezing Madison winter night. The dog (and a second, her small dachshund brother) were really scared. Really not fun.I called Marvin, the owner of M&M.  He sped over and rescued all of us.  Within 45 minutes I was back in my house, all curled up with the dogs, and the road was clear for others to use.  Marviin provides quality service with Wisconsin friendly charm.  No hesitation to recommend him for any vehicle-related emergency.'
