b"Visited here on 06/05/14.This shop is located in the Forum Shoppes in Caesar's.Samples of everything from the bars to the toffees to the caramels to the truffles.*Pinch Me Cause I Am In Chocolate Heaven*The sales staff knows their products, inside and out. They are friendly, encourage tastings, offer suggestions without being pushy, offer free shipping or cold packs (depending on your needs), offer extra gift bags so that you can present your gifts in true Vosges style.Beautiful packages for incredible chocolates.I walked away with peanut butter bonbons, 5 small boxes of caramels, 2 bacon chocolate pigs and a Mexican hot chocolate for $44.00. I was pleasantly surprised at the price and knew I had done well for the quality of my purchases.My Hot Mexican Chocolate was to die for as well.Definitely will seek their website out when I need to send chocolates and will make a point to visit them on my return trip to Vegas in the late fall.A must stop at shop if you appreciate good chocolate!"
