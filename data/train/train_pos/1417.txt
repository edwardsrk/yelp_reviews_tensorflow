b"Great suite. Great service. Loved the Valet crew. Across from Fashion show shopping mall. Fresh flowers everywhere and the hotel smells great at every turn.Great for kids because no casino, no smoking and low occupancy rate.What's up with the single 24-in TV at the bar? What are you thinking Donald?"
