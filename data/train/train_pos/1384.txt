b"We visited on Saturday April 15th, 2017 for dinner. I don't know why people are saying the portions are small, because they are NOT small. It is regular to large size portions, in fact, two out of three in our party packed our main course leftovers for home.  Also, I looked around the room at other tables to see the dishes we didn't order and their portion sizes were decent.  For Starters we had Bloomin onion (smaller than Outback's version yet good) and a bowl of tomato soup (I thought it tasted like marinara sauce). For main courses, I had the Grilled Whole Sea Bream white fish served with vegetables and basmati rice. It was a good thick piece of fish but be careful of tiny bones. My hubby had the delicious meaty Beef Short Ribs on top of a mound of garlic mash potatoes. We both had leftovers. And my daughter had BBQ Pork Ribs served with chili, corn salsa and fries which she enjoyed and finished. Dessert was one piece of their homemade Cheesecake shared between three of us. Americano is only coffee served and it is strong and frothy. I took one star off because it took almost one hour before we got our main dishes and there is only metered street parking.
