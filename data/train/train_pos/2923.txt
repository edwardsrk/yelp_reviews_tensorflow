b"Went to the Thai Style Noodle House for lunch today with a couple friends, (one of who is a regular there). He's addicted to the beef noodle soup, so naturally, I had to try it out as well. The first thing I noticed about this little place was the Tshirts pinned to the wall, so cheesy and SO THAI! Of course we were greeted warmly with the never fail big Thai smile from the hostess that I've come to expect from the Thais when I meet them.There were computer printout menu items with pictures scattered around the walls as well, and coupled with the Thai TV programming and Tshirts, I was reminded of a typical Thai noodle shop one can find all over Thailand.....(sigh, I miss you).I noticed on one of the printouts a picture of Penang Curry with avocado. One of my buddies wanted that, and when I mentioned to the waitress that he was a vegetarian, she quickly produced a completely separate vegetarian menu. That was cool, although he stuck with the avocado Penang curry with tofu. He ordered it at #9 of 10 in spiciness.My noodle soup arrived and was promptly devoured and washed down with a Thai iced tea. The broth was hearty, the noodles soft, and there was a large chunk of baby bok choy, and plenty of bean sprouts to compliment the meatballs and sliced beef. I thought the soup could've used a touch of cilantro, but it was very good and well balanced. I also tasted some of the avocado Penang which I thought would be too hot for my tastes, but turned out to be just right. The flavor was full, yet balanced and the tofu & avocado with the coconut & curry worked well together. The portions here are large, and overall it was a good value for the money. I look forward to returning to explore the other menu items and hopefully finding another Thai gem for my palate."
