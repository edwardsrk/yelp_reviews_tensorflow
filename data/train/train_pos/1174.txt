b"Great service. Always fast and always friendly.I have only ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen so far. Soup base tastes great, and I find it not too salty. The black garlic oil adds a nice flavour and I highly recommend getting it. The pork is a little bland for my liking and there is a decent portion already with the soup so I wouldn't bother getting extra."
