b'Sake Rok is a newer restaurant in Vegas that is close to Shake Shack. I personally thought the food was a bit over priced, but still decent. We had shrimp for appetizers and then had sushi rolls (Volcano Roll, Cucumber Maki (veggie), and the Colorful Roll (asked to make it veggie). They were accommodating of the fact that my wife is a vegetarian and, she really enjoyed the rolls she had.This is a trendy, hipster place to enjoy a meal. We went around 5pm, and it was starting to get crowded, and the one downside was that there was just 1 waiter to take everyones orders. But, they were still very quick and had great service.Overall, I think the food was really good, and if I am in Vegas again and crave Japanese food, I would definitely come back.'
