b"I've been here a couple of times and the Thai dishes are always consistent! I highly recommend the curries (Panang being my fav) and can't go wrong with the Pad Thai.Recently, I've this has been added to the menu but unclear of what the original prices are. So be careful when ordering as it doesn't specifically indicate how much each item will be, just an average increase of 15%, which if you check the bill is a little more than that."
