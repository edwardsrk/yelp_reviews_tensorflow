b"WOW!!!! I have never walked into a bakery that smelled this good.That is the first impression. The pastries are unique: not dried out, crusty pretty pieces. Fresh, flavorful, not-too-sweet... just the right touch of flavor to leave a vibrant aftertaste. Only a few variations. That is because everything is fresh, made from scratch. No commercial mixes here. I really can't pick a favorite item, but the small loaves of bread are really special. Large enough for two. No leftovers. If you have ever been to a bakery with dozens of different cookies, pastries and cakes... this is not that kind of bakery. Better than I have tasted in Germany, France , Denmark or Switzerland. Fresher. Remember the word FRESH. It defines La Gourmandine.I wanted to add photos... but, sorry, I ate everything!"
