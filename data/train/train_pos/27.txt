b"3/5/11Considering how disappointed we were with Lotus of Siam last time in Vegas the bf was wary of trying Thai again until we found Thai Style Noodle House! We tried the thai style noodle with beef which is their pad kee mow...and the beef combo noodle soup...Super crowded and cozy...the service was good but there was a slight wait for food obviously...the beef combo noodle soup was very interesting... not sure I'd try it again because it wasn't spicy at all! LOL One of the better tasting Thai places in Vegas..."
