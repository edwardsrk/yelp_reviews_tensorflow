b'Exactly the place we were looking for. Guacamole is so good and you can add 3 different homemade salsas to get the spicy-ness you want. The tacos are delicious. Good portion size. Enchiladas are also amazingSimple menu but it is perfect! The restaurant itself is small but cozy. Waiter was very friendly.'
