b"Pretty good - a nice option for pho in the north Scottsdale area.  It's in a nondescript strip mall that's easy to miss.  In addition to the pho, which was quality stuff, I gave the shaken beef a try - a bit oily, but overall tasty.  They've got a whole menu chocked full of rice dishes and I'll likely go back and try some more."
