b'I\'ve donated since college when I started organizing blood drives at our school. I try to donate during holidays since it seems that\'s when more activity happen with tourists in town or DUI accidents. It\'s a great way to give back and get some neat freebies, movie and Penn & Teller tickets, Amazon gift cards, blood donation promotional and "hero in you" t-shirts. :)The West Charleston site is the UBS I\'ve donated to for many years. Location is within 15 minutes from home and has great parking. I am thrilled they now have a questionnaire they email me the day of my donation so I can jam through it while having my morning cup of joe. I love Mimi when I donate platelets. The other phlebotomists not so much. Last Sunday went and had an unsuccessful donation and a bruise for four days from my stick. I will only donate from this point forward when she\'s working. She knows me by name, happy, bright, sunny disposition, always has a loving presence and checks up on me throughout my 1-1/2 hour platelets donation process. Afterwards there are always lots of different juices in the frig, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies, Oreos, nuts and wheat thins. I actually raid the canteen area BEFORE my donation when I have to sit get my vitals done (BP, temp, pulse, iron). Due to being a pescetarian, my iron usually teeters on the 12.5 mark.Please donate! We need more people to give in Vegas.'
