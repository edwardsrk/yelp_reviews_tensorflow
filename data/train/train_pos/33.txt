b"Q&D: Some of the best Chinese I've had in AGES!  Great atmosphere too.Long & Fishy:  I'd be surprised if you could walk by this place in Caesars and not notice the huge fish tanks filled with hundreds of goldfish, it's unreal.  People stop just to take pictures of the tanks.We came in to grab some dinner and I have to say I honestly wasn't expecting much based on the yelps I read.  My experience was nothing like everyone else.  Our server was nice and friendly, the menu was big, the atmosphere was ultra cool, and the food rocked.The one downside was that the food did take a few minutes longer than I expected, but when it did finally come, boy was it worth the wait!Would I go here again?  If I ever stay at Caesars again, sure.Should you go here?  Yes, it's pretty darn good Chinese.,Sam"
