b'I had heard terrible reviews on this place but decided to give it a try anyway.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised at how amazing the food was and the service was a+ as well, even went back a few days later.  The only down fall was that some of the employees would congregate by the bar area, goof off and be really inappropriate.  My advice is to notify the management if you see this behavior so they finally understand that this is the main reason they have a bad rep!'
