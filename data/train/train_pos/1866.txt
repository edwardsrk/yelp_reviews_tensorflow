b'Charming cupcake shop in Puckering Village. Started following them in Twitter when I moved to the are a few weeks ago and needed to check it out for myself. We ordered a lemon cupcake which was yummy, regular coffee and hot chocolate which were both made to order and just what we needed as it was a chilly day.We will be back!'
