b"This was a great dining experience.  I had never been to one of Bobby's restaurants and I can honestly tell you that I had very high expectations.  There were met and exceeded!  Our server was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable and the food was absolutely incredible!  The appetizers were perfect, we had the ceviche and the tuna sashimi and it was great.  The drinks were pretty great too!  All in all, this was a great place that I would return to."
