b"Chris is awesome! So easy to work with, allowed us to change plans and add another club on another night. Didn't charge us a thing. And, the best of it all, on our last night in Vegas we chose to go to a different club (Blush), and the whole experience there was just awful. But Chris came through when I called him at 1230am to see if he could hook us up somewhere. Not only did he get us into Playboy and Moon at the Palms as VIPs last minute, we also got free drinks, and a complimentary limo ride there. What a fantastic way to end our Vegas trip! I would definitely work with Chris again and recommend him to everyone!"
