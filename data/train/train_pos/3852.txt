b"This restaurant is awesome - it's just down the street from me and I am SO thankful for it. Since moving to Beaconsfield, the restaurant choices nearby have been limited/very disappointing. Plus, the rest of the West Island kind of sucks. But this place is excellent. I'd also say it's fairly priced. The restaurant is located in a converted home, making it very cozy. The staff are so warm and friendly, and it's clear that the restaurant is family-owned and that the owners actually care about their customers. Despite its location, this place could compete with what you find in the city, no problem. It is also consistently excellent. I would definitely recommend that you check out this gem!"
