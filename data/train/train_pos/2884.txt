b"I love the ambiance and the service.  I especially love that vegan options are specified on the menu, so it's easy to dine there with my meat-eating friends. The food is good, my favorite is the veg out wrap and the red chili glazed sweet potato (I love sweet and savory foods).I'll be back to try the complete menu and ill update my review accordingly."
