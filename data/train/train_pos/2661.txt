b'I do love this place. Never gone wrong with the food and the craft cocktails are incredible. The restaurant and bar are all upstairs off of Jefferson so you have a nice view of the area. At Christmas time it over looks the skating rink and Christmas tree so I receommend making reservations by the window so you can view PHX during the holidays. Over all this is one of those places that is a must try in Downtown PHX!'
