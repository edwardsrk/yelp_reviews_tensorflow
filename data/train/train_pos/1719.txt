b"I was a bit scared when I arrived at 1pm on a Monday to find exactly 1 other person in the restaurant. I was cold and wanted soup, though, so I stuck it out. Glad I did, as a few more people eventually showed up and my braised beef noodle soup was quite yummy. The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were filling and had a nice texture. The service was super fast and smiley. The only cons were that some of the beef pieces were on the tough side and I was expecting a little more spice to the soup, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again."
