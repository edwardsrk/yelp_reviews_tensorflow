b"I've always been of fan of Baskin-Robbins but that's because I LOVE their rainbow sherbet.  I love the taste of the raspberry and pineapple that a lot of other sherbets don't have.  Download the app before you go so you can access their coupons.  On the 31st of the month they have $1.50 scoops. They also have a different feature flavor of the month that's limited to that month only.  There's lots of parking at this location but it can be difficult to get in and out of because of the traffic on old statesville road. It's on my way home from work so I like to pop in for a cold treat on hot summer days.  They have always been prompt with their service to get me in and out of the door.  It's attached to a Dunkin' Donuts if that's your thing.  It's cleaner than most other locations I've ever been to.  Stop by and enjoy a scoop but don't forget to download the Baskin Robbins app before you go!"
