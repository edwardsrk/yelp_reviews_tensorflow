b"Jack was the seller's agent I met while looking at a house, I called him on a Sunday evening to take a look at a house and he answered my call and was very responsive. After meeting him in person and seeing how knowledgable he was I had him assist me will buying and selling my house. I feel like I made a great choice to employ him since he was very passioniate about his work, responsive, and knowledgable. I probably called him 40 or 50 times over the time that we worked together and the longest I had to wait to get a response back was maybe 5 minutes, it was amazing."
