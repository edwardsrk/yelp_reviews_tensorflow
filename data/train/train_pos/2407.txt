b'My husband and I went here to dinner for the first time last week and it was fabulous.  I had the pork medallions.  I am not one to order pork, but the waiter assured me they would be delicious--and they were.  My husband had the veal chop and it was also flavorful and yummy.  For starter were shared the shrimp tamale--which was to die for.  Should have ordered two--so very good.  Each entree came with a tamale with pecans, and it was unbelievably good.I was so impressed we returned for brunch.  I was not so impressed, and was actually disappointed with my dish.  I had scrambled egg chilaquiles.  I did not like the flavor of the sauces at all, and had really expected something great.  Would not recommend at all.  They were more like deconstructed chilaquiles.  My husband, on the other hand, ordered two appetizers.  He had the shrimp tamale--which was every bit as good as before, and the bacon and egg quesadilla, which again was superb.   Service was goo, and the bread baskets on both trips were very good.  I would go back again, but certainly would skip the chilaquiles.'
