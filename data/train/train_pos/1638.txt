b'Good food, great drinks and fun show. The sushi can get pricey fast, but it was a nice change from other strip restaurants. The drinks were fantastic; of course they had the sake but the other drinks were quite yummy too. The show that goes along with your dinner was hilarious, certainly a good time. The servers were all very attentive as well'
