b'I was away from my typical neighborhood stomping grounds when I suddenly had a craving for fried chicken. I found this spot, Soul Foo Young and just had to try it - Chinese food and Southern food - together!I walked into the bar, went to the order window and dinged the bell. Georgia came to the window and started up on telling me all about the food she was serving that day, she is so nice and clearly cooks with southern love. I went for the Bruce Leroy special - which is from the movie  "The Last Dragon" from the 80\'s. I used to watch that movie all the time! The Bruce Leroy consists of 3 southern style fried chicken wings with Chinese fried rice. The food is cooked to order - and good fried chicken takes at least 15 minutes. So it is fresh, it just takes a little while. When it did finally come out, it was soo tasty. The Chinese fried rice really goes well with southern fried chicken which was crunchy and well seasoned. Her fried chicken took me back to the time I visited Jackson, Mississippi. So yummy. Next time I would like to try her chicken smothered in gravy, egg foo young, and collard greens - since I have to get my veggies in somehow.One of the things about this spot is that it inside the Double Diamond Bar and because it is a bar, next time I would definitely order ahead for take out - unfortunately eating at the smoky bar can take away from the yummy food Georgia is serving up.Call ahead, ask Georgia for recommendations, and order for take out!'
