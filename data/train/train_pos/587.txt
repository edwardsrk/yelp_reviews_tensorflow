b"After trying their tasting at Toronto Underground Market last fall I was eager to check this place out. Not taking reservations is always a little annoying and I ended up waiting an hour for a table of four around 5 on a Saturday. Once we were seated the service was speedy and the menu was great. We ordered the poutine, mac and cheese, surf and turf and lobster roll. The portions were enough to give you a great taste but if I went back I'd be sure to get some appetizers. Decent selection of beer and loved the decor. This place is very Toronto right now."
