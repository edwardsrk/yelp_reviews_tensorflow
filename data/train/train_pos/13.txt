b"Great fresh seafood spot located in the Scottsdale Quarter. Enjoying a nice dinner out and felt like seafood so we decided on this restaurant. We were greeted and taken to our seat right away. The restaurant sets a more professional, upscale type atmosphere.We were greeted by our server and he took our drink order. We started with the seafood platter which had shrimp, oysters, lobster tails and a crab mix. Love seafood? Get this for sure! The oysters were quite large and not amongst the freshest I've ever had but they were still good. For dinner we enjoyed the chicken and the scallops with a side if crab fried rice. Crab fries rice was full of flavor and really good! Scallops had a citrus flavor added which made it even more tasty. Service was above par as well. Our server was attentive and friendly. I'd go back if I wanted a nice night out and craved some seafood"
