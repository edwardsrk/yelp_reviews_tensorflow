b"Not all restaurant reboots are successful but Avenue Bar seems to be one of the fortunate few. As someone who loved the old school wood paneling, original furniture and supper club fare, it was a bit of a shock to step foot into the bright, mid century modern designed space with cool earth tones and new cream colored leather booths. The menu has undergone a considerable makeover (e.g. oysters and carpaccio) and we happened to dine during their Sunday Chicken and Champagne (mind blown), which is case in point that this is not your dad's Avenue Bar. Also the staff has been overhauled with the median age 25--they're all friendly and attentive, seemingly at home here or in an Eddie Bauer catalog. Cheese curds were ordered -- they're definitely bigger and seasoned differently than the old recipe but it's a flavorful upgrade that was approved by the table. Brandy old fashions were still well made with a strong pour and classic garnishes. The chefs kindly accommodated our request and made deep fried walleye (typically reserved only for Friday), which came with fries (average) and cole slaw (above average with a nice vinegar and sweet balance). The 4-piece fried chicken was light and crispy, the oil was definitely fresh. The side of green beans were also a bright spot, wellblanched and lightly oiled and salted, which complemented everyone's entree. Well done Food Fight, well done."
