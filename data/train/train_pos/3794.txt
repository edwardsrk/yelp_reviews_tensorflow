b"I've only come for lunch and I was very intrigued so much so I wanted to have dinner here. Tonight it so happened my boyfriend and I came to have dinner and we were blown away with such stellar customer service. We met Nick who is one of the owners as he walked around and made everyone feel so welcomed. He introduced himself and asked if we needed anything. After that we felt we had made a new friend. While sitting at their Wok Bar the second owner who appeared to be the top chef was so informative with the dishes. Jarred was phenomenal and extremely thorough. He even made us a dish and said it was on the house. Over all our experience here was the best I have ever had in an establishment like this. I will definitely come back.!!!!"
