b"Came here on a weekend night around 10pm, and it was surprising quite empty. However they close at 11pm so we had to get our orders in quick. We sat by the window, which is sadly really cold as the air was seeping in. But the place looked clean, bright, modern and welcoming. We didn't have a problem ordering, I guess we knew what we wanted. However the other tables which had a lot of questions may have faced a bit of a language barrier, but the servers seemed nice. I got the kimchi fried rice with cheese. It comes piping hot in a sizzling hot pan and its smothered with cheese! The hot pan creates a nice crispy cheese crust on the edges. The side dishes were a bit sad looking though and didn't feel it was at peak freshness. The cheese is a lot and fills you up fast, so I eve had some leftovers to take home.They had a lot of variety on their menu, so if im ever in the area I'd probably come back and try some of their other things."
