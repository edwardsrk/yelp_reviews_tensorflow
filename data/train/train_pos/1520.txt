b"Came here for Valentine's Dinner (because all of the local Asian markets sold out of Lobster) and that was our desired main course for dinner. The lobster is 15.00 per lb and it was just upsetting that they automatically tell you the lobster is 4.5 lbs exactly on the dot. It would be more comforting to see a receipt of the actually precise weight of the $65 lobster just to make sure we are truly getting what we pay for. However, the lobster was incredible and we had no complaints of how flavorful and delicious it was. It does not compare to the fresh lobster back in New York, but it was delicious I must tell you that much. It comes with a pot of rice and we got a coconut gelatin dessert at the end not sure if it's the usual thing they do or if it was a Valentine's Day special? We've been here once before for a wedding reception and the food was one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever had here in Az. Would love to come try their Dim Sum another time!"
