b'Just got back from 4 hours at the spa and it was such a great experience that I have to leave a review. My partner and I paid an affordable price (due to a current promotion) for access to the baths and saunas. The spa encourages a "circuit" where you first visit the hot bath, then do a cold water plunge, and finally relax. Half of the floor has bean bag chairs, couches, and beds for you to relax or nap on. The conditions in the spa were so comfortable that we knocked out a couple of times as we relaxed. Theres also a steam bath room and a sauna. The spa\'s "no talking" rule is taken very seriously, which adds to the calming atmosphere of the spa. Although this spa is on the smaller side, it\'s an incredibly relaxing experience.'
