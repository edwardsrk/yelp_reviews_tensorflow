b"I loved their mission and atmosphere.  The food was some good, some not so good.  The fried chicken was very dry, but the collards, black eyed peas and creamed corn were great!  I love pie, but why do so many restaurants fail at piecrust.  It was uncooked tasting and thick.  Piecrust should be flakey!  So, would I go back? Yes, but would probably order the vegetable plate.  Love what they're doing."
