b"I've only been here a couple of times, mostly for the cajun fries. Truly fresh cut fries and it's awesome that they load it up in your bag so a small order is really a medium. Although I did enjoy their burger, it was typical. I didn't think it was outstanding in any particular way. Worth the try though and you can snack on peanuts while you wait!"
