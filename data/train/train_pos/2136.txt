b'Looks kinda sketch from the outside but the inside of the bar is surprisingly well kept and updated. I came here with a group for New Years Eve because simply put, PT\'s is the only bar around offering a happy hour all night long on NYE in Vegas. I cozied up to the bar and was immediately seen to by the bartender - I had a big boy Coors Light ($2.75 HH) in my hand in no time. I loved that this PT\'s had a crazy diverse playlist. Any bar that plays "Stillborn" by Black Label Society is fine by me. There\'s quite a few pool tables here and even shuffleboard! Service throughout the night was great. Employees cleared empty glasses from our table multiple times by the pool tables and asked if we needed anything else. As midnight approached, we were handed small cups of champagne and party favors.  My only complaint is that I smelt like an ash tray after leaving the bar. :( Most PT\'s bars I frequent do not have this residual effect. All in all, I had a great time here for NYE.YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #1'
