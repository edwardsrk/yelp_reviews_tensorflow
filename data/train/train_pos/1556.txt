b"I come here when I'm in the mood for some fast food that is seemingly pretty healthy. I usually order the same thing... The chicken bowl. I get it with brown rice. Usually brown rice can be in general grainier than white rice. However, I never really notice that at chipotle which is a plus. The chicken can be a bit charred or dry sometimes but it's normally not a problem. I also get the fajita veggies. However, the veggies can be a hit or miss for me. I normally like my veggies more the in the saut\xc3\xa9ed side but sometimes they can be more crunchy and raw for my taste. I love their corn salsa so I tell the person to like that stuff on my bowl. I do notice that this location does tend to give me a little smaller portion than at other locations."
