b'Considering this restaurant is located directly below my office, I\'ve never partaken in a meal here until the other day.  Literally, I was a "kid in a candy store" and was amazed by their setup here.  Almost cafeteria-esq style, you walk in, get greeted by the hostess/greeter person and he/she will give you a plastic card.  Depending on what you would like to eat for that meal, you walk up to the counter and order.  Place your card on the "magic" slot device and the put the item you are about to receive on it and you pay the cashier on the way out.  Kinda genius if you think about it.  Less waiters (they still bus the tables for you) and the tables are first come-first serve.I think my favorite part of this place is that they make their pasta in-house.  Even have a room dedicated to it.  During my lunch, I totally watched a guy make pasta from scratch and then put it through a machine.  Rotini was being made at that particular time.I ordered from the pasta station and the chef?/line cook was super nice.  I think he could tell I was a newbie, and was patient with me.  Deciding on the Smoked Salmon Carbonera... the started making my lunch right in front of me.  In about 7-8 min... I had a delicious, steaming bowl of pasta presented before me.  My buddy had a salad which involved a beeper (so will have to try that next time).  And their pizza\'s look pretty awesome too.The restaurant space itself is modern with clean lines, but warm woods and decorated with small herb plants.  Each table has its own oil, salt, pepper, balsamic.  I tried to take it easy on the bread, but it was too hard to resist.'
