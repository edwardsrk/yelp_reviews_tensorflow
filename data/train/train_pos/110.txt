b'The restaurant was very busy on the Saturday evening, but a table opened up just as we approached the counter to place our orders.  My wife and I each each chose the Great Greek gyro - lamb and beef gyro meat wrapped in pita bread along with lettuce, tomato, tzazki and feta. At a nominal additional cost, these were upgraded to a platter that included a small Greek salad and soda.  We were more than happy with our dining chose this evening.'
