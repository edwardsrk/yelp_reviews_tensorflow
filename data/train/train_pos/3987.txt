b"My favorite Giordanos in AZ! The service and food is perfection. What I appreciate about it is that it's the closest tasting pizza compared to my hometown of Chicago. We love deep dish and the crust doesn't disappoint. The sauce is well seasoned which is also something I pay attention to. This is our family spot."
