b"Went here for a concert in their basement venue. Very cool space. Intimate, cozy, nice ambiance. They seem to have a real handle on crowd management. The event was sold out, but still comfortable - they clearly take care to not oversell the space. You get the vibe of being in a friend's basement, except there's wine and better decor.The wine itself - I'm not a connoisseur by any stretch. I thought it was good, but not exceptional. Cheapest bottle is a $21 white blend.  They had a total of 4-5 varieties that night, with varying prices. Overall, it's a cool place to see a show. Might  go back for a tasting sometime to get a better handle on their wines, but they did seem slightly overpriced to me."
