b"Ultimately, I'd eat here again. Minus one star due to the slightly confusing setup for ordering/service. It was our first time visiting. The deal is that you are greeted by a host/ess, sent to order at the counter where you don't pay, then sent to an assigned table to wait for your food and be waited upon by a server. You pay your tab at the table.  I feel like we were unintentionally rushed through the whole process of ordering and dining even though it wasn't busy. The Magic Shroom Burger was divine. I'm actually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was sold on the goat cheese and pesto. I think the tomato on the burger was even salted, which is an amazing touch if that small thing were actually thought about when crafting a burger.The Green Chili Queso fries were top notch, although the fries could have been salted a little more heavily. The Nutella Chocolate Pretzel shake was ho hum. I didn't taste any Nutella. Hmpf!I'll make a return trip. Yep!"
