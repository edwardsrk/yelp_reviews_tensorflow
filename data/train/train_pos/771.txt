b"This is a very good shop, with a pretty wide selection for how small it is.  They've organized it well so there is lots of inventory without making it too cluttered.Gun prices are excellent, and they are happy to show you any guns you want to see.  They are knowledgeable and helpful.  The only thing preventing this from being five stars is that the accessory prices can be very expensive, you should price things out before you decide to buy.  Ammo prices were decent."
