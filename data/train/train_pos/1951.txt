b'Awesome! Came here for my girlfriends birthday and to propose to her as well. When we walked up to the host stand it was semi out on the casino floor and were expecting it to less intimate than what we saw. The host and who seemed to be her boss greeted warmly and we were seated promptly. Our waiter Patrick was the "best". He took care of all of our needs and made us feel as we were MGM Grand high rollers. The night was great and will be remembered for a life time takes to the wonderful service at Crush.'
