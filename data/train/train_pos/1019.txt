b"I moved to Scottsdale a year ago from the midwest and have been to Geisha at least a dozen times, all during happy hour. The drink and food specials are awesome so even if it's really busy I don't get too cranky about it.The only day that's been really tough is Friday - between 5 and 7 it's packed and sometimes the service gets a little sluggish. I don't blame the wait staff, they're all hustling, it's just that the bar is slammed. Honestly, I normally just double up on my drink order instead of running dry... it might not be the classiest method, but it works.LOVE the Vegetable Gyoza and the Phat Daddy roll. Totally recommend their flavored sake and the Harajuku Lover.Also, I've heard that karaoke here is a blast, but I haven't done it yet."
