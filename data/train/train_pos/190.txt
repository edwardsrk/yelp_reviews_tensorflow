b"Pork bone soup seemed to be the specialty here but I wanted to try something different so went for that sweet/spicy noodle dish with squid (cant remember the name! grrr...) and some chicken bulgogi. I was not disappointed with my choice and was quite happy to try something so interesting and tasty.With the Korean staff, customers, and kpop shows on tv, I have to deduce that they serve pretty authentic Korean cuisine. t I actually found the non stop boy and girl band performances quite entertaining making my meal a memorable one. Prices are pretty standard. around 10 bucks average per dish and you have the option to get bigger orders that serve 2-3 for $20. Not a bad deal at all. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants Korean food."
