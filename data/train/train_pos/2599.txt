b"Love the food here and typically love the servers. I eat here at least twice a month and the food will never fail you, its that good of quality. Noramlly get the coconut shrimp, edamame and sushi off of the appetizer menu and the jeweled beef or Buddha's feast off of the entree menu. Our server this time around had zero customer service skills and zero personality.  She walked up to our table and was like 2 ft away asking what we wanted to drink.  Didn't introduce herself or anything. No smile at all...seemed miserable. If it wasnt for the food i would be giving this place and experience this time around 2 stars."
