b"2018.08.03 Friday morning Visit.The atmosphere resembles a college town atmosphere, which is appropriate since the University of Wisconsin-Madison is pretty much right next door.  Lots of Bucky Badger & old school signs all over the walls.Service was pretty good.  I ordered the breakfast special.  Two eggs, bacon, & ham, along with Orange Juice.  For a breakfast place on Friday morning in the summer, there were lots of people here.  Even though I ate at the bar, My server was very good.  He replaced my drink without question when said orange juice was accidentally cleared away when I went to the restroom.It is a good place to eat at, but make sure you have cash on you as they don't take credit cards.  They have signs as you enter to notify you of this, along, I believe, with an ATM on the premises."
