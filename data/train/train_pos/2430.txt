b'Great wings & ribs! Very pleasantly surprised. Meaty, lean wings (full wing) with BBQ char - much much better than standard wings from the fryer. Amazing draft beer selection; never would have guessed it from the outside. Very reasonable prices too! Highly recommend for a very casual dinner to catch the game.  Will be back!'
