b'Huge breakfasts served all day. "the all American" was very good if you want something simple. Service was spotty mostly because the waiters would disappear when we needed their attention. They were able to separate the checks which was great. The waffle was forgettable and expensive. I recommend egg dishes! If you need a quick yummy breakfast in downtown I recommend this.'
