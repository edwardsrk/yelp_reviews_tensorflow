b"I enjoy staying at the Residence Inn brands because it means you get a suite in your room. It's so convenient to have a little kitchenette and living room area. Granted, I was in Vegas this time around and didn't get to take advantage of it since I was eating out, but at least the option was there. The best thing was that I got a great deal on Priceline for this room for New Year's Eve. Woo hoo! This place is a little off the strip, but it's not that much further. It's about a block down from the Westin Causarina. This hotel has free breakfast in the morning where they serve juice, coffee, milk , cereal, scrambled eggs, waffles, yogurt (both Activia and the packaged kind with granola on top), sausage patties, and assorted breads and muffins. You can get a filling meal here without having to go out to the buffets or local restaurants. There are several restaurants within walking distance too if you choose not to go far for lunch or dinner - McCormick and Schmick's, Bahama Breeze, Gordon Biersh,  Hamada, and Morton's across the street. They also offer free parking and free wifi, which is a always a plus in my book. Being that it is a Residence Inn, the in-room amenities also include free coffee, tea, and popcorn. Next time I'm in the area, I definitely would not mind staying here again."
