b"The veggie wrap is good, there are bands Wed., Thurs., & Sat. ....oh yeah and lots 'o draft beer - available in pitchers. Half off appetizers during happy hour (4-7). Lots of flat screens (even outside) to watch sports. No cover UFC. Good service and personable management. I would give 5 stars if they added a bike rack."
