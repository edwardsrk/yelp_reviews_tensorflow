b"This place is exceptional from start to finish! Needed to have my bumper replaced along with other front damage. I contacted and visited several other companies prior to FIX auto. The other companies told me I had to schedule an appointment just to get a quote. And those that did see me, told me I would be without my car for weeks! I called Fix Auto, and from the beginning Al was very kind and informative. He told me to bring it in anytime for a quote. I brought it in hours later and after Al explained what needed to be done and how long it would take , I booked my appointment. While the other companies were telling me it would take weeks, Al said he would have my car ready by the end of that week. Four days later and hours earlier than promised, my car was ready! Couldn't be happier. They did an excellent job and Al continuously kept me up-to-date on the status of my car. I highly recommend Fix Auto. Al even offered other services they do aside from bodywork. I will definitely be back to take care of any updates my car needs such as headlights windshield wiper replacement, etc....A+++++ work & customer service !!!! Happy customer"
