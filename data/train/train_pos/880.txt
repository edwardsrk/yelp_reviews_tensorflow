b'I really appreciate that the owner took the time to reach out to me after my last review. I really had a bad experience and the fact that the customer satisfaction is taken so seriously made me feel wonderful. I was comped a massage in lieu of the bad one, and ended up with Rony, a therapist who came highly recommended from the staff. My massage was very good and seemed to be an adequate "make up massage" comparatively, but it still wasn\'t great. I give the European massage school 4 stars because it really is a SCHOOL of aspiring professionals and they have not mastered their skills just yet. Overall, staff is amazing for working with me on this one, and the price is very exceptional for the amount of time you get on the massage table.'
