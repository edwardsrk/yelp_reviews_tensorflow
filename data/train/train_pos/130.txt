b"Now let me start with the good.... 1. Great location2. Very clean3. Most comfortable bed in Vegas4. Fashion show mall is literally right across the street5. Large roomsThe bad....1. Noisy. Train comes by 3 times a night and it is loud and they honk as they are going by.2. Pool is just ok3. Rickety pull out sofa creaked all night4. Not 5 star property like Priceline saidI would stay here again if a deal popped up and my trip didn't revolve around the pool. I love a clean non smoking hotel and this definitely beats my go to JW marriott in summerlin"
