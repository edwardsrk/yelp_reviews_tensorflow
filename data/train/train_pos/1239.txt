b"We just can't get enough Thai food lately, and Yupha's didn't disappoint.  We were there on a Friday at lunch time. The included salad and soup are modest, but a nice touch.  I ordered Prihk King, medium. The flavor was right-on, but the spice level was WAY higher than a typical medium.  The chicken and vegetables in the dish were fresh and tasty, not over or under-cooked.  Also at the table was the red curry, which was pretty standard, but very good.  That was ordered medium as well, and came out at a more expected spiciness.Service was prompt and friendly.  It was a great deal at $22 for two...would have been $17 without our two frosty Thai iced teas!"
