b'I attend these every year and wouldn\'t go a year without going.  We went 4 of us this time and had a fun time again.  Tons of food choicesTons of booze choices Tons of dessert optionsLots of hot sauces available for saleSO Many options!  BEST food this year was:Hawaii\'s restaurant - Beef ribs over rice with crispy onion OMG!!!! This is the only business card I took as I would order catering for sure from them.  Lawaia Poke Bar - www.lawaiapoke.com Sorry I don\'t remember the restaurant names that I will mention below.Best dessert was the Lemon Rum cupcakes and the Pineapple rum cupcakes! Indian food not so good so don\'t waste your time trying it.Jerk chicken was ok.Filipino food was delicious but terrible service.  Too much staff "working" there and not enough helping hands.The spicy pickled asparagus and olives were amazing!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for you, your love, your friends and family to go.  Something for everyone!'
