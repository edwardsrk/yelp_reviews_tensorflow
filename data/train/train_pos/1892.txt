b'Crepes... what more can be said?  The place was very busy, but the waitress was attentive and friendly.  I ordered a dark chocolate praline crepe, and the bf got dark chocolate with strawberries.  It was awesome being able to have an option for the chocolate.  When we ordered "dark", they asked if we wanted bitter or semisweet.  Unsure of how bitter the bitter dark would be, we both went with the semi sweet and were pleased.The dessert they were churning out all looked amazing.  We both left the place in full-fledged chocolate comas.  Full, but satisfied.  If you are a chocolate lover, this is definitely a place to check out!'
