b"Huge selection.  Friendly SUPER helpful (and funny) sales woman.  As a plus size woman I am used to having maybe one rack of clothing to look through.  But not here!  I spent at least an hour looking around at all the fantastic modern and vintage tops and dresses.  I will be going back.  There IS a market for plus size women and I'm delighted that this place exists."
