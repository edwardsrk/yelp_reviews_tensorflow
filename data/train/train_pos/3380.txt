b"Simply put: These guys are amazing. Two of my friends had their Tacomas worked on by these guys and they recommended I check them out when I needed some work done on my truck. I had them do my timing belt and water pump on my 04 Nissan Frontier. They did exactly what they asked and when it ended up taking an extra day because a part needed to be ordered they set me up with a loaner car. They told me about a few other things that might need to be taken care of in the future but they didn't push me to get it done right then and there like most shops would. They are very trustworthy and honest with what they do. They won't BS you and they definitely aren't the kind of place that's just looking to make a quick buck off an unsuspecting customer. They will tell you what you need and what you don't need without a bunch of salesmen like antics. I highly recommend Yota Pros."
