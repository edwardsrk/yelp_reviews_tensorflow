b'Had a groupon for the high roller which included either a picture of the high roller ( eh!) or 1$ off of 6 pictures of our choice totaling 5$! This was fun and easy and the picture came out amazing! I rather do this then pay 30$ for one picture with a fake background from high roller! It took less then ten minutes for the pictures to be printed! I walked to yard house got a beer and walked back - beer in hand! Great experience! Very helpful associates! Amanda helped us and she was sweet and full of smiles for us!'
