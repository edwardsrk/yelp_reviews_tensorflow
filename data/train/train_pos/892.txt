b'I like to bowl about once a year & this fit the bill!  We went on a Thursday afternoon & they had a special to bowl unlimited games with unlimited pizza for two hours for $14/pp.  We weren\'t hungry & said no to the special until she told us the total ($70???) so we got the special & just didn\'t have pizza.  The alley is nice & they played an excellent mix of music with the videos on the big screens at the end of the alley (even a Jerry Lee Lewis video from the 50\'s!!!)  They even have a "jukebox to choose music from.  The staff was pleasant & very helpful & even picked out the perfect ball for me before I even asked (they are behind the counter).  They have 1/2 sized shoes so we bowled away & had a great time!  (I broke 100 twice & my sweetie broke 150!)  The were several people/families bowling & everyone was polite & appropriately behaved (always a plus)'
