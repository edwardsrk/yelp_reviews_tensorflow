b"Update: They did fix the problem to make my mom's car start. But I had also asked them to check everything else and they said it looked good. Within the following week, her car battery died. She was also leaking a lot of brake fluid and had to have all of the brake lines replaced.  I wish I would have been given a heads up about these things as well. Autozone replaced the cat battery and the brakes were fixed somewhere else."
