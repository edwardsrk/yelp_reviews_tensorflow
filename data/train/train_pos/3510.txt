b'I love everything about Windsor. I\'ve been here a couple of times, and I loved them all. The last time was my favorite. We came here on Saturday night for my boyfriend\'s birthday and got a candlelit table on the patio. Patio\'s are perfect in October, and this one rules. The music they play is really good, but loud..which we enjoyed. It\'s busy, but not so busy that you have to sit and wait forever. I\'ve gotten the brown bag chicken sandwich and the Windsor burger. While the brown bag has all the amazing ingredients to make an amazing choice, it lacks just a little bit of flavor and is a little dry and "herby" tasting for my liking. The burger however, is amazing. The sweet potatoes and fried okra are delicious as well. Four peaks pumpkin porter is a seasonal and we had that and the Sam Smith\'s cider.  (Two of my favorites). One of our friends ended the night by getting the birthday boy a Chocolate Elvis...which is ice cream, bananas, peanut butter and whipped cream.Windsor is awesome!'
