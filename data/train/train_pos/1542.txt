b'I like it here. It has a nice diner vibe without being overly retro-fetishist.I have only been once so far. The service was super good and the eggs and potatoes were yummy. I liked the lightly grilled tomato slice.It was a very cheery place to spend a Sunday morning catching up with a friend. The music was a bit bouncy so if you need a mellower mood, be forewarned.They were making beautiful-looking, boozy breakfast drinks at the bar but I had errands and chores so stuck to coffee - an excellent americano. Next time :)'
