b'The food is very amazing. I had the rice and chicken steak and the chicken suqar and rice. Both dishes were made with excellent taste and I and a blast eating them. I would recommend this place to my friends any day of the week. Great customer service and great ambience. Also the mango shake was pretty good with the ice cream topping and I also like the strawberry shake as well. If anybody lives in the Rex dale area, stop by this place and order something off their menu, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.'
