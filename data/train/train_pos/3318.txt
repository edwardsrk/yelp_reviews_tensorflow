b"A good indication of a great experience is wanting a repeat ASAP. My husband and I came here for dinner after a long drive from So Cal to our new home in Mountain Bridge. We were immediately impressed with the attentive staff and blown away with the portions of delicious food. (I had such a plentiful plate, we split my leftover pasta for lunch the next day!) A few days later, we went back for happy hour and were just as impressed. Dan at the bar was pleased to share recommendations on local brews - just what we were after, being fresh  Arizona residents! Food is delivered from the kitchen piping hot... wonderful. This place is run like a tight ship. We had a quick chat with the manager, Demi, who stopped by to see how dinner was going. She was really cool and obviously very involved in ensuring guests enjoy every aspect of their meal, which we did. We've lived here just over a week and have already found our new local! Awesome."
