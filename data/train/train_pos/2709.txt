b"I wasn't expecting much.  My husband and I purchased a groupon before visiting Vegas last weekend.  I must say that the service was EXCELLENT.  Our waitress was attentive and knowledgable, she smiled often and check on us to make sure were were doing ok without being overly annoying.  We sat near the main bar and the music played loudly and the bartender was entertaining to watch.Overall, it was a good experience.  Our food was great, and you can't beat the price w/ the groupon.  We would consider returning if in the area."
