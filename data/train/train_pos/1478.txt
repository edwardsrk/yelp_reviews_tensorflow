b"This place is Krazy. It was unexpectedly very good. It could just be my expectations were low to begin with, so even average food exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it dozens of times but never considered trying it because of the name. That is until one day I was craving crab legs and searched Yelp for a decent seafood buffet. Krazy Buffet popped up and I figured for a fraction of the price of a casino buffet, I'd give it a try. I was nervous about eating here (I mean, what can you really expect from a place that misspelled crazy?) But I was surprised at how good it turned out to be.First I should mention they only have crab legs for dinner which starts at 4pm. If you paid for lunch and stay around for the crab they will charge you extra. At least that's what the sign says.Anyway, the crab legs were just ok. I don't know if they were frozen or pre-cooked, but the texture seemed a bit squishy to me. But hey, it was still worth it because it's crab! We ate so much crab I think they were happy to see us leave.The selection of other items was pretty good. It's what you would typically expect from a Chinese buffet. The items that stood out to me were the large steamed shrimp with shell on (a bit bland but very fresh), clams, meatballs, tiramisu, and strawberries.Service was great. Everyone was so friendly, they kept our drinks full and our table clear. Obviously a buffet is self serve but the employees here are much more pleasant than some expensive high end restaurants I've been to. I'd recommend it for a cheap meal."
