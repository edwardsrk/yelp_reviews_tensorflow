b'Cooked to perfection. I mean perfection. Red mashed potatoes were pur\xc3\xa9ed. Bacon wrapped shrimp were beyond flavorful. Peppercorn steak spot on. Request to sit on the patio and the fountain debuts every 15 or 30 minutes. The view is breathtaking. The wait staff is there for every need or accommodation. All high class professionals.'
