b'"This is the best club sandwich I\'ve ever had!" Says my bf. The food was very fresh and tasty. I had the California benedict: perfectly poached eggs, thick cut bacon crisp, and perfect hash browns. They did forget the avocado, but were very nice about checking the menu to be sure, and then bringing it on the side. What brought me from 5 stars to 4 was the service. The first server we had said hello, brought us drinks and then disappeared. Like, she never came back! The next server we got was friendly, cheerful, and attentive, but after eating, we waited for our check for what seemed an extra long time.'
