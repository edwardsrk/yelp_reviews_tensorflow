b"This is Indian food the way Chipotle is Mexican food. An approximation, an assembly line, if you're in the mood for quick food that tastes decent. The flavour is good. Tried some choolaah bowls (lamb bbq and veggie croquettes). The paneer was fresh. I'd definitely go here rather than a typical Indian restaurant in America (which usually serves dishes I can make better)."
