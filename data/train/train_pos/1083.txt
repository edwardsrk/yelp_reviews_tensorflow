b'Really tasty tacos, with a great selection of salsas. The place was more "fast food" of an atmosphere than I was expecting. The price seemed like a good value (5 tacos for$7), but the meal was not very filling which kind of ruined it for me. I felt like it should have come with chips or beans or something. The portion was my only complaint.'
