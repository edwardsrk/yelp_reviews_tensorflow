b"Because everyone has to come here once for their roast duck poutine pizza.Unfortunately, the pizza was just alright.  Sure we all love a thin crust pizza with cheese curds falling off, but the combination of everything comprising the topping was a little overwhelming.  I ended up eating the fries separately for the slices that I had, and I barely tasted the duck pieces because of how many other ingredients were on the pizza.  It's like one of those school projects where the idea is nice, execution could even be effortless, but final result, underwhelming.Miheer's Curried Lamb Shoulder- Didn't see the curry in the description and expected a chunk of lamb shoulder.. what a flavourful dish though!  It was a very creamy curry with a hint of spice, the lamb was well-cooked and I LOVED the garlic roti that the curry came with.  It was a bit oily but I loved how chewy the roti was and balanced the curry nicely.  Almost wished we didn't have the pizza to start so that I could enjoy more of this dish, definitely a fan.Service was good, decor is worth a look.. O&B does it well :)"
