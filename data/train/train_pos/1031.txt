b"Had some time to grab dinner before heading to the AURA evening light show at the Basilica Notre-Dame last Wednesday, so we walked around Old Montreal and found Tapas 24. It was a little before 6pm, so not crowded at all. We were seated immediately. Interior is very modern looking. Staff is bilingual, pleasant and the restaurant accepts credit cards.The four dishes we ordered we enough to fill two people up. Unfortunately, I can't remember the exact names of the dishes, so you'll have to enjoy the photos below, but the food was good! I would recommend if you are in Old Montreal."
