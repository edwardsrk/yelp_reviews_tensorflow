b"Great store. I'm here pretty often and I can get a lot of things here for a great price. I still head to GE for some things, but shopping for the basics is such a bargain. Canned goods, frozen veggies, almond milk, wheat pasta.. great finds at a great price. Its hard to taste a difference with things like that. Their ice cream isn't too bad.. actually many things here aren't too bad :)"
