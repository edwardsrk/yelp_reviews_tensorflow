b"Second Sunday we've ordered from here. After moving into the Waterford apartments we'd been trying to find good delivery and I think we find it! The delivery service is amazing. Can't get over how nice the delivery man was. Best service I've ever had. And the margarita pizza was beautiful just as he said. We're definitely making this our new Sunday pizza place! Thanks so much!!"
