b'Very nice staff who took the time to explain everything on the menu and offered us samples. This is actually a big chain in the U.S that just opened first store in Canada. There is Italian ice, milkshakes, frozen custard and more. We tried the gelati with the mango italian ice and vanilla frozen custard. It was sooooo refreshing and mango flavour was delicious as real fruits are used. The frozen custard is like a soft serve ice cream but with a more rich taste. Overall, good value for what we were getting!'
