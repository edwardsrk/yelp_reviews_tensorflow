b"For fast casual this place is amazing.  This is what I call My way, right away. Pick your sauce, pick your pasta, pick you meat. They are crazy croweded during the week but they have their system down pat to get you what you want fast. I've had several different pastas and everything is always cooked perfectly right in front of me. The only thing I dont like is carrying a tray. I feel like I am back in highschool and bound to drop it and my food all over the place."
