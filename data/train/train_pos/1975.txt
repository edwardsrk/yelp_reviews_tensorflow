b'Concur with prior reviews.   Pros -tasty bahn mi at a reasonable price, spacious and will likely return for a date with books. I do wish they have a more extensive selection for lunch currently 4 sandwiches: 2 porks, a chicken , tofu.   They do have a great boba collection.  Will likely be back and looking forward to more offerings.'
