b'My husband and I recently moved to the area and so far this is "our go to Thai Restaurant" even though it\'s a good 20 minutes away. It\'s location in Old Town sets the ambiance for a perfect date night.  We have our staples when it comes to Thai food which we always split. The Pad Thai for him with tons of protein and the Panang Curry for me with tons of Vegetables, both ordered spicy.  This is the second time we went and will be back again.    I was compelled to write this because it was THE BEST Chicken Panang curry I have ever tasted. It had a smooth tomato base that you could only taste a hint of the tomato it was absolutely creamy, divine, and flavorful. I was going to have to poke his hand if he kept taking it because I wanted it all for myself.  So good that I told the waitress that she had to tell the chef compliments. It opened up my husbands stuffy nose, but the spice was not so strong you couldn\'t taste the delicious flavors.  If you have ever been turned off by a yellow curry and said curry is not for me, Please give this dish a try. Again, the best I have ever eaten in 3 states that I have lived in.  Unfortunately we are not impressed with the Pad Thai.  The only way we can describe it is that somehow they Americanized it.  Not very flavorful and the noodles always are stuck together. If you put your fork in it, it will lift the whole plate almost.  We had to order bean sprouts which usually come with a pad Thai and felt like it was missing the peanuts or eggs or both. Next time, we are going to try the Drunken Noodles, and I can\'t wait to!  I give 2 thumbs up even though the pad Thai wasn\'t the best, overall the service was great, and so was the food.  Thank you Malee\'s for your existence and keep up the good work! Love, love, love!'
