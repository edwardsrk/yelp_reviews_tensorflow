b'The people were friendly and the place was quiet when we arrived (late morning on Monday). Prices are decent and the atmosphere is basic and "homey" - nothing avert or obnoxious. The menu was a good variety of basic breakfast foods and the portions were good sized. The food itself is decent - think a better version of Denny\'s - nothing too greasy or cheap, but nothing over the top "yummy" either (except the hot chocolate which was perfect!). Nice place to stop if you want some basic comfort food. I would have loved to try the baked pancakes, so if you have the extra time (takes 20 minutes), stop by - they sound amazing and is probably the best item on the menu if I have my guess.'
