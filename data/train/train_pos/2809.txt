b"For the longest time, I assumed this was a bar & grill like Ale House. Just yesterday I was craving hot dogs and this place came up in my search. This is actually a decent fast food restaurant. My husband and I went in here and the lady taking the order showed us how to order on the little personal order forms. I got a hot dog and my husband got a philly chicken sandwich. Both our sandwiches were delicious. The hot dogs are giant!While we waited, I noticed that they also make old school thick milkshakes, something I will try in the future. They're also known for their chargrilled burgers, which I'm looking forward to trying as well.Service was friendly and I really liked the lady at the counter. She was very polite and helpful."
