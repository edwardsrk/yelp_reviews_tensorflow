b'We\'ve been going to Pete\'s since I was a little girl... a long long time. I remember my mom saying "we\'re going to Pete\'s" and we would cheer, yaaay yummy, cheap, fast, the best in town, I just drove down there after work, 15 miles to pick up dinner, every one cheered yaaay when I walked in the door.'
