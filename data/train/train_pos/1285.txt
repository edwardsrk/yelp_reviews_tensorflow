b'Dinner with the wife. We sat in the lounge for the music and ASU game ( Yes They WON ) Our waiter was Andy,he did a pretty good job. Always checking with us and making sure we were happy. We started with the Tuna Ahi for an App. and it was very good.  I order the Bone in Filet and ordered it med Rare with solid pink through-out. About 1/3 of the way into it I discovered it was not Med Rare. The lights in the lounge are very low. It tasted good But would have been better I am sure if it was cook correctly. It had great taste but it didn\'t have that "melt in your mouth" feeling like I have had at Eddie V\'s or Flemmings.'
