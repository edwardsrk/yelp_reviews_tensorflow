b'Summer, Sunday on a hot blazing afternoon, what to do? Prep up with your culture and history, and explore this place, for this is the ghost of Vegas that you would want to know especially ESPECIALLY if you are a local.Some really cool tidbits that you can check out here:- a slab of a Wooly Mammoth fossilized bones with bite marks- old postcards and chips of long dead defunct  casinos- the Donner migration story- Area 51 exhibit- stuffed/taxidermed animals of the LV desert- the Pauite Indians - Elvis underwear (just kidding)This is one place where one can dehustle the bustle of the strip, yes I like the pool too, but this is knowledge one can swim without drowning. I am surprised that this is literally a ghost town when I was there; I fervently pray that kids are introduced to this museum as part of their education, and that funding continues for its  viability. Locals get a discount on admission, PLUS the pass entitles one to visit Springs Preserve. If shopping or souvenir is a motivation, I heard the gift shop is highly rated, let me know if that is true.'
