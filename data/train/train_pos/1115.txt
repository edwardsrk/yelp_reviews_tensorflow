b'I really enjoyed this authentic Thai restaurant.  I went with a colleague, who had travelled to Thailand over the winter, and she also said that the food was great.  Very reasonable prices for lunch, and the service was very good.  We did not wait long for our meals either, which is great when you are rushed for time.  We will definitely be back.'
