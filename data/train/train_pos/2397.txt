b'We visited last Friday and enjoyed it all! The house classic Rita was very good  We had three! The chips and salsas were fresh and tasty.  We had tacos and I must say the chef is creative.  Guess what? I went again on Saturday with my girlfriend and this time I had the Pescado (fish).  It was delish! We will be back!'
