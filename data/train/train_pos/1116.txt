b'We dined here this past Saturday night and had a wonderfuk meal.  We knew that new owners took over a little over a year ago adn wanted to see if it changed.  It did not.  The food was just as great and so were the drinks!!!  Started off with tableside guac and we each had a few drinks and entrees.  I had two tacos which were fabulous as always.  Our 5 year old son with with us as well and he had a great experience.We look forward to visiting again soon!!!'
