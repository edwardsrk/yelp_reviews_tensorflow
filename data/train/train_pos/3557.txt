b'First visit here and I can not find any faults.  The place is nicely decorated and in great shape.  I only say this because so many Chinese restaurants I go to look like they never repair or update their furnishungs.  The menu has all the popular items but is not overly huge.  We ordered egg drop and wonton soups and then  Mongolian beef and Curry chicken.  Everything was served in a timely manner, looked great and tasted even better.  Very happy we decided to drive a little farther for this experience.  I think too many times we settle for what is convenient instead searching for better'
