b"I am giving it 4 stars just because it's vegan, but it really only deserves 3 stars. The quality of the food is great, but the flavours are just a little off. We've been twice now, tried different dishes, and every time everyone at the table is slightly disappointed by the flavours. The dishes are so close to being delicious, yet so far. I will return on invite, but won't be suggesting it as a go to spot."
