b'Love the name of this place. If you are Cantonese you will understand. They really give you a large portion of the sashimi. If you order the large it is surprisingly filling. Decent amount of seating. Parking is available across the street. Service is fast and friendly. Just order at the counter and take your meal to a seat. The food is very fresh. Worth a try.'
