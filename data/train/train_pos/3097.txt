b"My wife and I went there last night to celebrate my birthday. It was our first time there so we were very excited to try another dining spot at the M resort. We arrived at our reservation time and the hostess was very nice and polite and showed us to our table which was in the back of the main dining room, which was perfect because it was away from all of the action and private.Our server Dave and his team were on point from the start. They got us everything that we ever could want and or needed. They were very friendly and amazing and made us feel like we were their only guests of the evening.The food was amazing and the portion sizes were impressive. When Dave said that most people order one vegetable and one starch for the table he didn't lie. The side dishes were impressive.StartersBeef Carpaccio - 4.5 Stars - Only complaint was too much Mache SaladLobster Bisque - 5 Stars - Nice Lobster Flavor - Not Fishy at allSeafood Louie Salad - 5 Stars - Seafood Cooked Perfectly, Perfectly SeasonedEntrees & SidesBone In Filet - 4.5 Stars - Needed more seasoning before hitting the grillAustralian Lobster Tail - 5 Stars - Cooked and Seasoned PerfectlyMac N Cheese - 4 Stars - Just Needed a Little more SeasoningCreamed Corn - 5 Stars - Best Creamed Corn EverTater Tots - 5 Stars - Crispy & Full of FlavorDessertsPeanut Butter Pie - 5 Stars - Perfect Way to End DinnerChocolate Souffle - 5 Stars - Light, Airy and Full of FlavorAt the end of the day  we had an amazing time and the restaurant exceeded all of our expectations.
