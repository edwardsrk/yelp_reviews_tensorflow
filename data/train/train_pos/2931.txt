b'I\'ve been to this restaurant 3 times recently with my boyfriend. I\'ve had the chicken pad thai each time; he\'s had the curry chicken and cashew chicken. We\'ve both enjoyed everything we\'ve had there. The restaurant has always been rather quiet, which makes it a pleasant place for conversation, and is pleasantly decorated. Not 5 stars because the service is a bit slow and the spiciness levels seem to vary drastically ("medium\' has meant both "just a hint of spiciness" and "so spicy it burns."Overall, a solid restaurant and one that I\'ll probably return to regularly.'
