b"Had been looking forward to going here for quite some time. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived at 8:20. Reservation was at 8:30. The interior is very very cramped. I thought the artwork would be more prevalent. Instead, I felt like I was in someone's old bedroom upstairs. However, the food is amazing! Very unique flavors. It's hard to find quality and unique Mexican food like this. I would definitely return!"
