b"What's not to love? We dined here for Valentines Day and it was lovely. Wonderful service, extensive wine list and stiff drinks as my husband put it. I had the Chilean sea bass and my husband the ribeye. What I love is they offer 4 ways to prepare your fish which gives you more options when choosing a lighter dish. We spilt the enormous sides and didn't have any room left for desert (next time). We'll definitely be back."
