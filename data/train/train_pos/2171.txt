b"This is a great place to eat vegetarian South Indian food! The dosas we ate were delicious- we had madras masala dosa and the special rava masala dosa. Sambar accompanying the dosa was especially great! This could be a good competition for the other existing South Indian restaurants in the area. Service is excellent- they were very accommodative to our requests for hot water, modifications to some of the food we wanted and extra plates. And unlike Gurulakshmi, I did not feel rushed to finish my meal. Only small note: Thalis are only available for lunch- the menu didn't mention that, which would have been nice to know in advance before we came for dinner. Menu should be updated to reflect when food is/ isn't available."
