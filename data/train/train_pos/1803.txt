b"First stop in Madison to grab a quick bite at the hotel and the view was totally worth it!  The restaurant itself was nothing to write home about, but overall it was a good experience. the staff was very friendly which I'm a big fan of. It was a gorgeous afternoon and perfect time to arrive and get a seat outside on the water (3pm-ish) to enjoy the end of the season's sun! Good variety of music, nothing nautical based, which I do love listening to when I'm eating and drinking outside on the water in the summer, but that's not for everyone..I got the Louis salad with fresh shrimp and crab meat. Light, refreshing, and perfect to hold me over..(for now). I also enjoyed a Leinenkugel's Octoberfest..trying to ease into the fall..Overall, it was a good first impression of Madison! Thank you!Lindsey"
