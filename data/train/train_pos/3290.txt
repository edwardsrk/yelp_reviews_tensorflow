b'This location is not only excellent in service, but the cuisine is expertly prepared and presented. The owners are friendly, and give their customers nothing less than phenomenal service. As a growing business, I recommend it to anyone who wants a quick bite to eat on lunch, but wants genuine BBQ, from grill to melting in your mouth. I thank the owners for this exceptional service and cuisine!'
