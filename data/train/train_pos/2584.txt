b'China Grill has amazing food. It is a fine dining experience. Expect small portions at a steep price. Feel free to dress up, or dress down. This place is a cozy little hot spot with beautiful decor, and waiters!The bathrooms are worth paying general admission to use. TVs and everything!!I felt like a movie star when I was there. The service is superb and the food top-notch. Recommendations:Appetizer- Lamb spare ribs Dinner: Drunken chicken'
