b'OMG. The best pasta everrrr ! I always make sure I stop by here on my travels to Charlotte. You choose what you want to put in it and they make the pasts right in front of you. They also have a pizza selection that they make in front of you too for the pizza lovers. The atmosphere is pleasant and very cute for dates !'
