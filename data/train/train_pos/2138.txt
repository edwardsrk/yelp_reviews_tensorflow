b'It really depends on what kind of food you want. I would grade this at the level of KFC, but a lot of people love KFC. The food quality is on par with fast food. If you don\'t mind that, you will like this place. Personally, there was nothing wrong with the food. It was "good". I just prefer higher quality food. But I\'m going to rate it for what it is. So it will get four stars because it does not advertise as fine dining. The green beans were clearly canned green beans (nothing wrong with that). The mac n cheese was like school cafeteria mac n cheese. The hush puppies were really good. The pork is fine. It\'s priced appropriately. Again, all good food. I ate all of it. It\'s your typical soul food. The staff was friendly. The clientele was friendly. There were families there and your typical regulars tucked away and hanging out at the bar.'
