b"This place sells walnut cakes and a few other dessert items.  I'm not partial to anything with red bean paste so I only had the mashed potato /walnut and mashed potato/almond ones.  They were great and I wish I had bought more than six.  They are only $2.25 for 6 cakes.  The cakes are really shaped like a walnut from the special molds they are made in.  I got them when they were fresh off the conveyer and I think I would want to do that again.  I went back a few days later and tried the pancakes stuffed with sugar which also really good.  Will be coming back here again soon."
