b"I'm super picky about my eyebrows and barely let anyone touch them. But I'm on a trip and my eyebrows needed desperate attention, so used trusty yelp to help me find a place that would be safe to go to. I also just needed a basic clean up, so I can't vouch for if they're good to go to if you need some shaping done/have waited an extra week or so between getting threading done. But I walked away without feeling like my eyebrows were butchered and they only charge $8, so I'm a happy camper."
