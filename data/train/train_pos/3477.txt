b'Small venue, big flavor. Homie vibe as you walk in there is a nice sense of ole Montreal in the brick veneer. The staff was friendly and there was an eclectic collection of seafood based fusion plates to try. That night I disregarded the house recommendation for seafood and went with the pork tenderloin... and let me tell you, I regret nothing. It was the best pork tenderloin I ever tried. Ever. The wine selection was great, and the cozy ambiance was just what the doctor ordered for my party of 4. They take reservations, and I do recommend that you call in advance on the weekends. When we left the place was packed. Great experience, be prepared to spend s lil $$$, 5 stars.'
