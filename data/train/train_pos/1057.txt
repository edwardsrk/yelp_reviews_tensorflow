b"Four stars for their food! I've been to Beijing Noodle 9 a handful of times and haven't been disappointed with their food. I've ordered appetizers to noodles and rice dishes to take out only and my food expectations were met each time.  One star for their service! I understand Chinese folks aren't the warmest and fuzziest..I'm Chinese myself and know that service is not something our culture strive on. However, being that this restaurant is part of Caesar Palace's restaurants, I had higher expectations that their wait staff and front end staff would provide a nicer dining experience. I was wrong. The hostess, a young Chinese gal appeared to hate her job. As the hostess, I would imagine someone who at the very least says hi or greets the customer in some fashion with maybe, just maybe a smile. No, not this one. She appeared upset and just not happy overall. People leaving would say good bye and she would look at them and look away without a response. So odd, so weird, so unhappy, so she should probably get another job outside of the hospitality industry.Waitstaff are rude and seems bothered when you ask for hot chili sauce, give you the side eye when you ask for a hot water refill for your teapot.It won't stop us from going back though because the food is good even though service sucks, it's tolerable."
