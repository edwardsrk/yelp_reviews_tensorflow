b"Midoco saves the day! Since starting school, I've been getting a lot of use out of my beloved Pentel Twist-Erase mechanical pencil. Because I am also a numbskull when it comes to math, I'm constantly erasing. When I went through the last eraser refill for my pencil, I panicked. Where could I find replacements? I went to four different office supply stores with no luck. I was just about to give up when Yelp led me to Midoco. They had plenty of the refill erasers, along with a smorgasbord of new writing utensil choices. Sadly, they don't have much by way of other Pentel pencils (boo), but they do have the Staedtler Fineliners that I love so much, in every color. They have other stuff, of course -- since Halloween is coming up, they have a bunch of wigs, makeup, and other goofy stuff. Also: Moleskines. Oh, yeah, and the have art supplies.: pastels, sketchbooks, paint brushes. It's not the largest selection, but... it's not bad. That said, Midoco is great to satisfy your pen/pencil lust -- a definite must-visit for stationery freaks."
