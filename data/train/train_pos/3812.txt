b"Wow! What a wonderful car buying experience, thanks to Adora, our stellar saleswoman. Adora doesn't judge you by what you wear or what you drive up in. She is kind, helpful and doesn't rush you as she gets you the best deal. After the purchase, she was an exceptionally patient teacher as she set up our seats, radio settings as well as syncing our phones to our new car. Her patience and her willingness to help us use and enjoy the luxury features of our new car as well as her genuine excitement in helping us buy our dream car made this a great experience. Call her!"
