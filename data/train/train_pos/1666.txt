b'One of my girl friends and I went here for a early birthday dinner on a Sunday. I definitely would recommend coming on a Sunday because they have all day half off appetizers and drinks! So it worked out great. The food was good! We ordered the salmon skin roll, the scallop roll, spicy tuna and I forgot the last one. But it was all tasty! Love hour hour.'
