b"D's has the best wings ever! Boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was loud and crowded as I'm sure it is a lot of the time. There was a bit of a wait (about 15 minutes) before we were seated at a table. We got the garlic butter wings, pub fries, and chose kielbasa for our hot dogs. We LOVED the garlic butter wings. I don't think I've ever had such great wings before. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and had so much flavor. We also really enjoyed the pub fries. The hot dogs, however, were just mediocre. It took them a long time to get our food to us, but they apologized and gave us two free hot dogs cards for next time. Although I can't honestly say that the hot dogs are that amazing here (even with the kielbasa), I'm sure we'll be back for the delicious wings and the fries.Taste | 4Atmosphere | 3Presentation | 3Service | 4OVERALL | 4"
