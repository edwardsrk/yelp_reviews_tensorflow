b"This restaurant is very aptly named because it is definitely full of spicy food. now of course there is food that is not spicy and it is pretty good, but what it shines in is the food is actually done pretty well. creativity wise i wouldn't expect anything that is exceptionally different then other korean bars/restaurant, they do korean fried chicken, as well as a variety of other hot plated snacks and food. Overall the food is done very fresh and fast, and the price is pretty reasonably priced for most of the items. I would say its a great place to hang out with friends and catch a bite, which is probably why when i came here on a friday night it was packed. there is also a lunch special for people who are more interested in just trying food and not in the bar environment. the only thing place loses stars on is service. the food is pretty quick and good, but the service is so so, they are chronically understaffed it seems, and also on off hours i believe they don't place the best staff, as some are very inattentive and takes forever to get orders or checks. overall i would still recommend this place as the food is pretty good. but if you hate spicy food you might find it harder to find food that you want"
