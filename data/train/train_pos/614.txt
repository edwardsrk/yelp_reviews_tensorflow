b'Any store at Crystals is a "when you hit the jackpot kind-of-store" unless...you married a jackpot-well, then shop till you drop. We were greeted warmly by Jorge and he went on to tell us all about the new bags and fashion items.  We weren\'t in the market to buy anything extravagant, we were just window shopping and can appreciate fine apparel that\'s well crafted with fabrics that feel like buttah! No "Pretty Woman" treatment here!  So if I do win the jackpot-I\'m coming back:)Fun store to come in and browse-and buy if your wallet is big enough!'
