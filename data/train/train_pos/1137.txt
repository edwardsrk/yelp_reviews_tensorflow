b"My SO is obsessed with this place and used to take me here once in a while. I wasn't particularly crazy about it until recently when a large group of us came in for a late dinner. The food was spectacular, everything tasted super delicious!! The atmosphere is great and the drinks are delicious! Literally everything on the menu is worth trying, regarding drinks do try the Japanese jelly drink, it comes in a small can and also try the sake bomb if you're with a large group of people."
