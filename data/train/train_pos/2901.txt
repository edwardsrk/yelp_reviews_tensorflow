b'We came in late after a show, but were seated promptly next to an informative couple who were happy to review their dishes for us. I had an excellently prepared steak frites, cooked to perfection with a savory-tangy butter sauce on top. Loved the steak, while fries were passable. Meal started with an escarole salad with lardon and egg on top. Tender and flavorful. For dessert we split a lemon tart. Excellent - tangy with a crunchy crust. While service was passable, the waiter was not inclined to elaborate on the menu. When asked about the Croque Madame, he replied "it\'s a ham and cheese sandwich." In a French bistro, the authentic preparation, including mornay sauce and homemade brioche, probably warrants more of a discussion. My friend\'s entree was a lackluster preparation of lamb. All in all, while in Las Vegas, I would consider this Thomas Keller restaurant if you never plan to visit the Napa location.'
