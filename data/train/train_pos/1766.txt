b'Great place for fresh produce and the occasional 2 kg pack of rice. They also have a great selection in dried goods like lentils and beans, halumi cheese, olives, oils...all a bit more exotic and less expensive then an ordinary grocery store.It is simply fun to shop there and get inspired to try something new.'
