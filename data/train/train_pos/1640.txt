b"Pho KC Vietnamese Restaurant recently opened. The restaurant is casual but also is new and modern. They offer most of your usual Vietnamese Favorites. We wanted to start out with the Potstickers but I hit them when they were all sold out of them so we just went to the entrees.I had the Stir Fried Lemongrass Chicken with Mixed Vegetables Rice Plate. The Chicken seemed like good quality chicken because the white meat was moist and tender and just melted in my mouth. The Asian flavored sauce was delicious and laced with lemongrass as promised. My plate came with a generous amount of fresh steamed rice and tender crisp vegetables such as baby bok choy, broccoli and carrots. It was a delicious plate there is no reason why anyone wouldn't like it. Some people might point out that fish sauce sauce should be served with this plate.  Other sauces are available on the table.My husband loves Oxtail so he ordered the Oxtail Pho. He said the clear broth was delicious. He thought it was really good and was spicy. As delicious as the broth was the dish wasn't perfect and not all of the three pieces of Oxtail were edible. He could only chew the meat off of the small piece the two bigger pieces weren't ready yet. But this is a newly opened restaurant and they are still finding their way.The woman who took care of us was very attentive and eager to make sure we were pleased.3.5 (because of some undercooked Oxtail but bumped up to 4 stars because they are new)Worth a Try!"
