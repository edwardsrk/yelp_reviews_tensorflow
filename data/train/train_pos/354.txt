b"Outstanding Italian food in the Venetian Mall! If you're lucky enough to be in Vegas and at the Venetian, don't skip this very popular spot in the Mall. The atmosphere on the patio has the urban street scene feel with all the mall customers walking by; lot's of hustle and bustle but it's not distracting like having a slot machine ringing in your ear. It was loud, boisterous... but nice! Very cool joint that I can't wait to visit again.WHEN YOU GO- Ask for Sergio and wait if you have to. The guy's worth it! DO NOT skip the Filet Mignon Meatballs. They're as good as they sound. Lobster Ravioli, Chicken Parm and lobster ravioli are winners as well.Very nice spot that is from now on in my regular Las Vegas resto rotation!"
