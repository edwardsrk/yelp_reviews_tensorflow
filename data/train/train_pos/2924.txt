b'This is a new restaurant at Seafood City.  The line is incredibly long and the seating is over crowded, but the food is good.  I really like the concept.  Being a new restaurant there are a lot of kinks they still need to work out.  The demand for the BBQ here is crazy.  Long lines, people complain about the long line, but you can only grill at a certain speed.  They could order three more grills and it would still be packed.   Give them some time and it hopefully they get it all dialed in.  We NEED a good Filipino BBQ joint in Las Vegas.  Please.'
