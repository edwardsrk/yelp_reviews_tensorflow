b"The jukebox is incredible.The Bloody Mary menu is fabulous, although not all of the bartenders know how to make all of the drinks listed - but that goes along nicely with the Beaver's je ne sa qua.  The Bloody Mary with wasabi in it is inspiring - even more so if the wasabi isn't mixed in well and (like me) you like to get every sip possible out of the bottom of your cup.Can get crowded, but there is room to mill outside."
