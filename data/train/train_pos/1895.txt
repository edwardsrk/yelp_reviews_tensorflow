b"Hey I came here for a dos equis on draft and was surprised by (a) the really nice vibe and excellent layout of the restaurant (the one on Warner Rd.), the great and respectful service, and the awesome chips (really, just great) and bean dip and salsa (excellent). I haven't had other than the beer-and-vibe-and-chips test so your mileage may vary!"
