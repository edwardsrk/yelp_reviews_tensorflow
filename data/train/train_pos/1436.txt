b"One of my two favorite restaurants in Las Vegas with a fun and creative menu!! I opted to sit at the chefs table since I was dining alone. Christopher, my fabulous waiter, had excellent food recommendations.I started with the Marinated tuna cones that were artfully presented in a stand. The cone included whipped pink peppercorn creme fresh which created a little spicy zing.I next had the Braised oxtail crostini. Toast dishes seem to be all the rage in Vegas right now and this dish did not disappoint. The oxtail was tensor and flavorful.The final dish I tried was the Salt roasted beets. Sounds boring but it was not!! The beets were roasted in oranges, pistachio oil and goat cheese that made for a creamy and dreamy sauce that made me want to lick the plate. It was probably the best best dish I've ever had!There were 5 sparking wines, white wines and red wines to choose from. My only complaint is that most were $19 a glass!!!The restaurant is very open space wise and not ideal for a romantic dinner. Given the small plate nature of the dishes it's perfect for groups so that you can try lots of different things.I'd highly recommend eating here and would definitely go back."
