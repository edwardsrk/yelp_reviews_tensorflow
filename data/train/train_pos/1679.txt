b"I just got my nails done here and I cannot say I'm not pleased! I was a little wary with how this whole experience was going to go - but I'm glad I just bit the bullet! I went with my friend because it is where he goes. I will tell you - it is expensive, but worth it in the end. I recommend this place and Tina! My nails are beautiful and already got compliments 10 minutes after!"
