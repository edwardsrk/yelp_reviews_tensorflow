b'I ordered sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, and egg rolls. My compatriot ordered Kung Pao chicken.  We just wanted some descent chinese food delivered to us.  We began with the egg rolls.  They were amazing. Not overly fried and soggy, where you can only taste the grease, like most places.  These were crisp and full of flavor.  My sweet and sour pork came delivered naked (sauce on the side).  Which was nice,  i hate it when the meat is soggy.  The rice was different than i expected.  It was light and a little less flavorful than I was hoping.  It was still good, but not compared to the amazing sweet and sour pork.  The sweet and sour sauce was thick and tangy.  Not just bland red syrup.  I put a little on the rice to liven in up a bit.  (Worked)My compatriots only complaint with his Kung Pao Chicken was that is was not spicy enough.  I think that they could probably make it spicier next time if requested.  Amazing food, prompt delivery,  will be eating here again.'
