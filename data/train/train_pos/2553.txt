b'I came here with no expectations, other than vaguely remembering reading about it on here. I was on vacation with my boyfriend and we were nothing but tourists wandering looking for somewhere that sounded decent. We looked at the menu and all I could think was "it seems like things I already like with a unique twist"So we came in, got seated outdoors on a nice day, even though the sun was in our eyes for a bit as it was sunset. I got the herb bannock tray and the turkey burger. The bannock and bread plate was phenomenal. It came with some sort of spread on the side that was also really good. I forget what the waitress said, but it was good nonetheless. The turkey burger was also very delicious. My only problem with my food was that I lost a few slices of tomato and some of the dill (I think) mayo fell out, in other words, no problems here.My biggest issue with the whole place (hence 4 instead of 5 of a rating) is that the service was fairly slow. I mean, getting the food was ok, but getting our drinks was pretty slow, and so was getting the check. We were sitting there for a while, and I\'m glad it wasn\'t a first date that went sour or this would\'ve been awkward. She was the only waitress we saw outside, but she was at least nice. So I would say 4.5, but that\'s not an option.All in all it was a really good experience, and I would expect to go back and try something else with this place\'s strange twists on good food.'
