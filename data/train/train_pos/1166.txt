b'The first thing that struck me about this restaurants that it was packed full of caucasian people. The food was tasty and menu was very typical with nothing really genuinely Chinese. The staff was very nice and fast however and the place is very clean. Go here if you want a tasty typical American-Chinese meal, but if you want something more genuine, better stick to China street.'
