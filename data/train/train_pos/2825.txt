b'The customer service was really good and so was the food. We got the shrimp tamale appetizer and it was decent and the the salmon and pork tenderloin entree. Both of the entrees were amazing, but the appetizer and sides were just alright. The margaritas are definitely good as well. The atmosphere is nice, but you kind of sit very close to other parties eating.'
