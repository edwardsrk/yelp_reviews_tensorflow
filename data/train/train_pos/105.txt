b"Came here for dinner with a friend. We lined up for ~20mins to get a seat for two. During the 20mins, none of the servers came to ask us how many people, we waited until a table left and that was when the server came over. I've passed this restaurant quite a few times, and it usually isn't that busy... But I guess we went on a Friday night and peak dinner time. I was very surprised that the food was better than I expected. I got the chicken teriyaki, which came with green salad, rice, two grilled chicken breasts. The chicken wasn't that great.. But oh wells the sauce was delicious. My friend got the crazy platter! That was AMAZONG !! It came with a pork and fish katsu, hamburger patty with fried egg on top, macaroni salad, coleslaw, cabbage salad! The portion was big, and filling! I'm giving it a four star because I think the staff should try to learn how to approach customers when there is a line up out their door. We were kinda confused."
