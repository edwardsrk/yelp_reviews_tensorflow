b'Wow. Difficult is not the word I would use to explain Turtlehead Peak. How about "extremelystrenuousandrewarding"6 hours round trip, 2 liters of water, holes in my shoe, change in headband, backpack tan, sunglass tan, burnt arms, sore legs, and dirt all over my body was the result of my trip at Turtlehead Peak.Making it to the top of Turtlehead Peak I was rewarded with a really nice cool breeze, an ammo box holding a signature book, and one of the best views I have ever seen in my life. Worth it? Yes. Would I do it again? Probably not. Would not recommend for something looking for a nice stroll in nature or a quick hike (less than 4 hours). What I learned from my experience and mistakes is that you should have the following items with you:1. Excess water (better to have more than less in this case)2. Sunblock3. Hiking shoes or comfortable shoes that you don\'t mind destroying.4. FOOD! ( I really lacked on this one, I ate prior to the hike, but all that uphill really took a toll on my energy. I appreciate the kindness of whoever left a Clifbar inside the ammo box holding the signature book. Don\'t think I would of made it down without one)5. A companion6. A map or GPS device.7. Focus8. PatienceP.S. Don\'t get off the trail like my group did within the first 15 minutes. There are trail markers for you that will make the trip a lot less strenuous and more enjoyable. P.S.S. The first part of going down can be dangerous and it is easy to slip, so be careful!'
