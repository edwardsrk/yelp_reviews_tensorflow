b'The design is very well thought of, there is a modern feel to it. The food was delicious. I ordered the veggie, goat cheese tart. The crust was perfect, the mix of veggies was on the point and the amount of goat cheese was just right. I am usually skeptical sometimes when it comes to goat cheese, it can take over the taste and ruin the flavour of the meal. The cocktails are pretty fabulous, and the service was great.'
