b"Today my boyfriend and I stopped by to buy some dog food. I usually just get a big bag of Pedigree at Walmart, but I decided to explore other options. As we were looking at the different bags, Wesley one of the employees, offered to help us. This guys has vast knowledge about all the dog food brands the store carries. I was really impressed, especially when he asked about my dogs in order to give the best recommendations on dogs food. Once we got our bag picked out, he also informed us about how to go through the process of changing out the dog food since Pedigree is all my dogs have ever eaten. When I asked how he learned so much about dog food he said he's been working at Wag N Wash for 5 years. To me this is a plus because you wouldn't go through the effort of learning so much for a job you don't enjoy. Also, this tell me he does like his job and he's willing to learn to help the customers."
