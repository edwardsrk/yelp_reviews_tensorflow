b"For people expecting a $35 hand car wash job here, you're at the wrong place. This car wash, even at their highest priced wash, will give you a bare bones, decent wash so your car doesn't look like crap rolling down the street. We have been bringing both our vehicles here for about 2 years now, having bought the unlimited wash passes for both. My husband has a flat black dip job on his truck and it looks filthy after 2 days of normal driving. The $15/month pass is perfect- we can drive through and get it decently clean within a few minutes. I don't mind vacuuming myself or wiping down my own interior. The cars don't get spotlessly clean like they do at a handwash, but good enough for the price. My only issue is with the electronic pass for your windshield. It literally works properly 1/5 times. We were told this was due to a faulty pass and given a new one. Then we were told it was due to the polarized windshield, and they gave us a signed pass to keep in the glove compartment. We have problems each time we use it and are told that we need the adhered windshield pass. It take a 10 minute explanation each time until the manager comes out and recognizes us as near daily patrons. Otherwise, I think this place is a good bang for the buck!"
