b'Today was my first time at firehouse! Never have been before and decided to check it out. Cool atmosphere, clean and I love the firehouse theme! The staff was very friendly and food was out super quick! I ordered the medium beef and cheddar brisket sub- delicious! Everything was very fresh! I drive  by here all the time but never stopped! I definitely will be back!'
