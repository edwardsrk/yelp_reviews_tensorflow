b"I stumbled in here while perusing its open-air counterpart and behold! This may look like yr average fancy-people grocery store, but those freckled and bespectacled hipsters lurking behind the counter are actually little sirens ready to lure you closer with free tastes of rice pudding, delicious wine, and a rainbow of beets, quinoa, and kale. OH, plentiful kale! Unable to stop myself, I embraced the magic and my own downfall, which arrived via paper plate and might have been a huge helping of rice pudding. I returned a second time for one extremely awesome sandwich and the extremely awesome dude who is apparently the master of veggie BBQ. I still hallucinate the smell of that sandwich when I get hungry. To sum up: you're doing alright in my book, Public Market. Especially for a fancy-people grocery store."
