b"I really would give this a 4.5. My wife and I both got fried chicken and with all the sides it comes with, it was a decent deal. We both got mashed potatoes, collard greens, and mac and cheese. All of them were delicious. The biscuits were the best part. I really wish we had room for desert afterward because there were a few options which I'm sure would be great. On top of it all, it's in a good location. A block from the action, it's along Church Street where I usually can find a parking spot. We will be back for breakfast for those biscuits."
