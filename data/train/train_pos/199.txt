b"This restaurant is fantastic, but nothing mind blowing. It has a menu comparable to legume in the sense that everything is made with the freshest seasonal ingredients.  However...I prefer legume. We started the dinner with 2 appetizers: - Spare ribs with BBQ sauce - Smoked tuna strawberry salad Both were delicious.  The spare ribs were meat falling off the bone tender and the sauce was bbq sauce but more refined.  The smoked tuna on the salad made the appetizer worth it. For my main course: - arctic char and scallops with couscous The arctic char was nothing special but the scallops were AMAZING, unquestionably FRESH. Best part of the meal hands down (too bad there were only 2 pieces).  A friend had the ribeye which was also very tasty. I definitely enjoyed my meal at avenue b, but with a meal that comes at a hefty price, I don't know if it's worth another trip =/ If I'm paying that much, the food BETTER be mind blowing."
