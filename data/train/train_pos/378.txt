b"Went for my birthday....we got a discounted rate ( but it's more then we usually pay). We got to our room....first all the curtains were closed...very very dark when you walk in...the room was nice, but then we had a balcony ( with a view...she said). There was nooooooo view....other then a view of a roof and a big wall. I wasn't happy with it and called down to the front desk and asked to be moved. They upgraded us to a bigger room that overlooked the pool for $ 10 more a night. The room was HUGE and a beautiful view. The hotel is just beautiful. I just love the fact that you don't have all the party type people from the Strip mentality here. It's really not that far from the Strip...if you go, but there is tons to do right near there. We will be coming back!"
