b"First time here and the food was good, we ordered pork in black bean sauce and shrimp in lobster sauce. Restaurant serves in family style. The one downside is they're Chang (stingy) with the bowl of rice. But I guess we could ask for another bowl. The food is good. I don't know what the others are complaining about. To me if the service people can't speak English, it's pretty authentic. Those other ppl who complain about the taste must be regulars at Panda Express, which everyone knows is the standard to compare all Chinese cuisine to (sarcasm intended). Get off your high horses ppl. Food is food. You don't like it, go to McDonald's across the street, maybe that's more to your liking."
