b"Went this past Sunday 5/10/15. It was a bit busy. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant decor is great! Modern, with good music and an attentive staff. We ordered the all you can eat $25 dinner. We also indulged in the 2 for 1 alcoholic beverages. That special runs all day everyday! Food was good, fast and fresh! Definitely way better than Yamaha sushi across the street. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to sign yourself in on a waiting list upon entering. There's no host there to control that list."
