b"Loved it! Sat at one of the 4 tables out in front of the store-front restaurant. We had a view of to parking lot but that didn't hinder our enjoyment of the crispy comp. plantains and dipping sauces. The wait staff was great and the menu is full of local Columbian favorites. There also was a lunch menu with 6 different entrees for $5.99 each. My husband ordered off the regular menu and I had the rotisserie chicken, rice, & beans from the special $5.99 menu. Large portion's and was delicious. The dress is casual and I noted they are open for breakfast too. We will try that for sure!"
