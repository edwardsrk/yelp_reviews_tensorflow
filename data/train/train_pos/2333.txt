b"My sister and I headed to V. Picasso for a sisters night out when I was home in Champaign this month. We really wanted to sit inside and enjoy the great interior decor (it's really clever and well done!) but the AC was on full blast and it was just too cold. Brrrrr! We sat outside instead and so lost some of the ambience.The service was terrific / our server was a young woman who knew her food service stuff well. We were impressed! I've lost the note with her name it she'd get kudos.Drinks were well made and food was yummy. Next time I'm bringing a sweater so I can give this place the five stars it deserves."
