b'Tonight I had an excellent meal at Bandera.The jalapeo queso dip appetizer was quite tasty.  My rotisserie chicken sandwich was the best chicken sandwich I\'ve ever eaten. The chicken was tender, the cheese was melted yet still flavorful and the bun complemented the flavors as opposed to just being filler.It was my first time visiting the restaurant and I was unaware that it was part of a chain. I think that speaks volumes about the establishment right there. I\'m rating Bandera four stars instead of five because the prices were rather high for the size of the portions. That being said, the portions were what I would call "a good size" compared to say, Claim Jumper which has portions that are too large. Further, I think that Bandera could use a larger selection of beers and mixed drinks. Bandera was packed, something that surprised me for a Thursday night, and while I was able to get a table for two almost immediately, the background din made it difficult to hold a conversation or even clearly hear the server. I enjoyed the darker candle and track-lighting lit atmosphere, but it might be a turn off for some.I\'m definitely going back to Bandera, but next time I\'ll be prepared and not wear a ball cap, as they aren\'t allowed in the dining room. ;-)'
