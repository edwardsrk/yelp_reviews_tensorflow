b'Been here several times. Brunch was unimpressive, lunch was solid, happy hour is  great and dinner was down right delicious. Also the cocktails are made with care, premium ingredients and creativity. I\'d highly recommend the "lawless" whiskey and tobacco bitters and served in a glass full of vanilla tobacco smoke. I would also highly recommend the risotto croquettes, short ribs and deviled eggs. A few reviews claim this place is expensive, if your worried about that, trot on over to the tilted quilt next door or chipotle across the street.'
