b"I went to City Smoke with a co-worker a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised with the service we received, the atmosphere and the bbq!I ordered one of their house salads with brisket, and although the brisket was not the best I've ever had, it was quite tasty and made for a delicious lunch. We had no problem getting a table and had a charming server who was funny, attentive, and got all of our menu modifications correct! I tried a taste of the mac-n-cheese from my co-worker's place and it was pretty phenomenal... I'll definitely order it the next time I'm there!I'd love to go back for happy hour sometime, the bar seemed really neat and they have an extensive bourbon selection, so I'll definitely be back! City Smoke has my vote as a solid, not too pricey, bbq restaurant in uptown! A great place for lunch!"
