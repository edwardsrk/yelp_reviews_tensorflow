b"Great food and service. Very fresh food even though I made a special request they didn't charge extra. I yelped vegetarian/vegan which this place has about 2-3 option only. Veggie wrap and added hummus was great and French fries perfect. I'd come back again if on this side of town. Open one in Peoria and I'll visit frequently. Looks like have happy hours, not sure of specials and live music. Maybe another salad    option or black bean/veggie burger option to substitute. Other than that check it out"
