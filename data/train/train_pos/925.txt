b'Vegan options in downtown Vegas!!! Pizza was super tasty and the service was pretty decent. Half way through baking my pie they remembered that I only wanted mushrooms on half, so they took it out of the oven and picked them off.  Kind of weird, but whatever.  Nice gesture, but paws off my pizza! Lol.'
