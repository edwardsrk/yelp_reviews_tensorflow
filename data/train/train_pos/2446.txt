b"Great fries with yummy seasoning. The ranch dressing is amazing! Burger had a great, charbroiled flavor and was cooked perfectly and served on a soft sesame seed bun. The pickles, shredded lettuce, and chopped onions were fresh and crisp. I did request the Thousand Island dressing on the side, but  it came on the burger, which made my bun a bit soggy. Also, I ordered a diet coke and got regular coke. Delivery took about 40 minutes, and I was estimated 75-90 minutes, so that was a pleasant surprise. Food was a bit cold on delivery, but the GrubHub driver got lost. He picked up my food at 2:07 and didn't arrive until 2:35. The restaurant is only a 10 minute drive from my office, so had he not been lost for 20 minutes, the food likely wouldn't have been cold. Maybe a bit more attention-to-detail would have earned them 5 stars! :)"
