b"Came here for lunch and ordered the pork tabletop combo. So it's basically a hot plate with pork slices, bean sprouts, and other small flavourings. The side dishes are the typical ones you get at your average korean restaurants. In addition, this place gave us a seaweed soup, which was nice and bland that balanced the heavier taste from the pork. Also, there was a nice lettuce salad that helped balance everything too.Our waiter cooked everything for us so all we needed to do was to eat. After we were done about about 60% of the dish, my friend ordered rice and the waiter added the rice into the remaining contents of the hot plate and made it into a korean fried rice dish. Overall, this may not be the most healthy meal, but it was definitely filling (mmm carbs...). It is also pretty good and cost friendly. Everything was $20 ish (lunch prices), which was shared by my friend and I. I would come here again and try their other items if I'm in the area."
