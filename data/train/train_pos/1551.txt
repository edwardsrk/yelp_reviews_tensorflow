b'I thought Cabo Fish Taco was excellent. It had a great atmosphere, the service was excellent- and above all the food was incredible. I got the fish tacos, which were very good. It came with huge chunks of fish, and all of the other ingredients were fresh and delicious. The corn salsa they put out for the table was great!  I had a couple of drinks. One was a specialty margarita, the other was a NoDa Jam session, which is some sort of local beer. Neither drink was very good, at least based on how the server described them. I would probably not drink here in the future, and leave that to one of the many local bars within walking distance. Definitely recommend if you want something a little different. We went with a large party and everyone seemed very satisfied. I will definitely be back!'
