b'Very nice staff. I got the traditional eggs Benedict. It was tasty. Not my favorite, but good. The Diablo hash browns are delicious. The waffles are nice and fluffy. They gave us a free app since it was my first time, which was a nice touch. Overall I would definitely go back and try other things'
