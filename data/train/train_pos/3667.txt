b"I'm from CA where we have many boba joints, but this one is my favorite. My 3rd time to this place and I've been to the Eastern location once. Since I discovered Brew Tea, I always pay a visit very time I'm in Vegas. Service: Fantastic. The staff here are very friendly and accommodating, even when they are busy. If something isn't right about your order, let them know and they'll fix it in a heartbeat, hassle free. They do it with a smile and apologize profusely. I appreciate businesses that own up to their mistakes, and make every effort to make it right. Drinks: The Brew Milk tea with grass jelly is what I normally get. Delicious! I have tried Jasmine milk tea, and that's great as well. My other half got the Jasmine Green tea and he liked it. Overall, great!Crepes: I've had both the classic and berry lovers with whipped cream and green tea. So tasty, I love it! Will I Return? Definitely Do I Recommend? Absolutely"
