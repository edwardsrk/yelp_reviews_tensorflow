b'I feel like Ticoz is an Oasis of sorts.  One of those places that is cool and trendy on the inside but from the outside it fits in with gas stations and car repair joints.  I like that vibe.  Thanks to Emily D for a super rec!You step inside and it is sheik, and you eat outside on the patio and it\'s fresh and nice and just what you want.  While I\'m not local, I imagine that\'s an awesome feature to be able to pop in and pull out of the "city."Our only mistake was not arriving for a Monday Happy Hour, $2 Mojitos?  Shut up!Great food, I had the boneless pork chop (thanks for taking care of that chef!) and some good drinks.  Slightly odd was the lychee martini had no lychee in it (like you know the spinney red fruit with the white eatable part inside).  I really just like vodka with a floating lychee, my explanation to the bartender/drink maker upper/server fellow didn\'t seem to efficiently communicate this.  A next drink of a drought Hoegarden was perfect though... so nice on the deck!'
