b'This Hotel Casino Resort is located off the strip a good 15 minutes or more away in Henderson.  Green Valley Ranch (GVR) was a 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond Hotel, I believe it has lost one of the AAA Diamonds over the years.  GVR is aging and it is starting to show throughout the hotel/resort.  GVR is a very nice quiet hotel with the Casino separate from the hotel by different wings.  The Pool(s) are located between the Hotel and the Casino with Adult themed, family, and children pools with a spectacular bridge that connects the outdoor bar and the main pool. The rooms are showing age but the beds are still incredible in offering comfort and room size is decent (standard).  Not advertised but they charge a "hotel resort fee" for the "amenities" aka wireless internet (T1 speed) even if you do not use it.  There is a good mix of people here with locals and young people to families and serious gamblers.  This is the same resort/casino featured in "American Casino" reality show (canceled) on cable/network.  There is an Arcade and movie theater downstairs, the buffet is quite under-rated, a food court with a Fat Burger, and an outdoor mall located directly across the street with good retailers.All in all I enjoy staying here when I want to get away from the busy Vegas Strip and am looking for some R&R especially for a conference.  The Staff here works hard to please but can be hard to find at times.  It is definitely in need of some updating and work but a nice quiet 4 star hotel none-the-less.'
