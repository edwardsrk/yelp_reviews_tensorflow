b'Loved the expansive collection of this museum. The Canadian artists, particularly the group of seven and James Wilson Morrice, were my favorite. The price was a bit over the top. For the generally collection (the two two floors were shut), and the two special collections about Ai Wei Wei and David Bowie, it was 40 per person.'
