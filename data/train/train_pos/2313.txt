b"Very popular spot in Charlotte, great desserts but the soups are to die for. I love going there grabbing myself some soup late at night to early morning and watching all the students studying. I'm not a student myself was past that age but to watch a person enjoy desserts and work their ass off a better future. There is good satisfaction in that environment when I'm there. I'm weird like that. Get the soups! Bomb.com"
