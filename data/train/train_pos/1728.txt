b"Soup base, wontons all yummy. Service friendly. Food comes out fast. I might skip the fish calls next time as they look and tasted like it was spooned out of the fish paste they sell at the grocery store. Next time going to go for pure wontons. Try the chili oil. It looks like they make own as they sell them by the jar at the counter. Almost bought one as the chili tasted really good. There's a different flavor in it that I can't quite put my finger on. Would recommend if u r in the area and looking for a cheap and quick eat. They have 2 locations."
