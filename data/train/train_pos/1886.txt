b"Hi, my name is Tigra, and I'm an Apple.I love Apple. I love this store. I love some of its staff. I make appointments online or via the Apple app on my phone. Sometimes they'll over book and you'll have to wait a while past your appointment time. I'm a pretty patient person, especially when I'm acknowledged, and this is usually this case. I've only had one guy who was rude, never acknowledged that I was waiting, and had the worse laissez-faire attitude. We do not take laissez-faire when it comes to our tech lifelines, mister! Luckily, he was only one amongst dozens. They've saved my (ancient) MacBook Pro from what I know is inevitable. They have no problems swapping out a faulty iPhone, as soon as they do their obligatory water test. They even replaced a charger that had stopped working on my DD's phone, and we didn't even have Apple Care for that particular phone. Large store with lots of test items and lots of accessories. Nice view of Scottsdale Rd outside the main window. A familiar view for all who've sat at the Genius bar awaiting the verdict on their products.  I may or may not have cried at that counter after finding out photos were lost during a botched software update attempt. They get extremely busy during weekends and in the evenings. I suggest making an appointment for any and everything; even if it's just a question. If you don't make an appointment online they accept walk-ins too, you'll just have to wait longer for them to squeeze you in.Well organized during the new product release. There was 1 line for those who pre-ordered and a separate line for those who did not pre-order."
