b"The breakfast menu is complete and the items are good. Lunch and dinner is over the top. All items from the sandwiches to the main entres are great. There is great care in creating these recipes and menu items. They make a new demiglaze every night. The Caprese Salad is great to share. The musels are served a couple diferent ways and both are great. The Pasta Giovani hits many different cravings. I usually have them provide the food for my birthday dinners. No matter how much food they cater, there never seem to be any left overs. Just as important as the food is the personal service. From the owners to the chefs to the servers, everyone here treats us like family. Lastly, if you like Bloody Marry's, they have a very complete Craft your own Bloody Marry Bar."
