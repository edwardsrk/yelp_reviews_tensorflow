b"Probably my fave brunch spot in the city. Literally everything on their menu looks good...and tastes better than you'd hope. They don't take reservations, so get there super early. And by that I mean, get ready to wait for upwards of an hour on a weekend. But the food is well worth the wait! Every single thing our party of four ordered was devoured with great gusto."
