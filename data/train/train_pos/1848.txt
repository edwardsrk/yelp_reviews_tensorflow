b"An update to my previous review:I called upon Prairie Flowers for some blooms I was unable to find wholesale for my DIY wedding flowers. Not only were they supercool about getting them for me, they didn't seem offended when I said I was doing my own flowers. They contacted me promptly when the flowers arrived and were chatty and fun when I picked them up."
