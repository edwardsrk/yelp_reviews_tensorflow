b"I came here for a weekend event with a big group of friends.  I've never stayed downtown so I was a bit skeptical at first.  They have remodeled the hotel and for the price (I think it was around $40) it was a very good bargain.  The room was nice and comfy and I had a nice view of the pool.The event room where we had our dances was very spacious and very accommodating for our group.  As a matter of fact my group is coming here for a week long event this year because everyone was so happy.  They don't have a lot of restaurants to choose from but you're right on the corner of Freemont street with ton of options.  They do have Hash a Go Go and I really enjoyed dining there!  The only negative that I can think of is that they don't have a jacuzzi.  The pool is really nice but they definitely need to add a jacuzzi.  It never even occurred to me that a Las Vegas casino wouldn't have one.  Come on guys...you spent all the money remodeling and didn't put in a jacuzzi! The casino was nice and clean.  But my luck wasn't any better here than at any of the casinos on the strip.  I'm looking forward to my stay here this year and exploring Freemont street even more."
