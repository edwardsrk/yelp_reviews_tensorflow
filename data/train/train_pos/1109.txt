b"Nice place to fulfill your craving for spicy fruity snacks. They also have a killer shrimp tostada that is like a tower of shrimp and it's fresh and satisfying. I had their chamoyada and it was sooo good. The tamarind slush was perfect with chamoy and fresh mango, Japanese style penuts and bits of tamarindo, my daughter had the mangoneada and she loved the fresh mango slush with fresh mango bits. She also had the strawberries and cream and said they were super good. We will definitely be back to try more of their treats."
