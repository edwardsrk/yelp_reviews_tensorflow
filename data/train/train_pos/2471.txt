b"I think I may have finally found my spot for sushi in this neighborhood. I got the sushi lunch special (6 nigiri plus a spicy tuna roll) for $12.95. All of the cuts of fish looked were aesthetically pleasing (nothing mangled), and were of a good size. Tuna roll was a tuna roll....pretty hard to screw that up, I enjoyed it. I'll be back, glad I tried it out today."
