b"Just had a wonderful experience at T & M Automotive today.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  I needed brake fluid today and would not hesitate to return to them for any unforeseen automotive problems when in Vegas.  I might also add the bathroom was very clean which I appreciated.  Being an out of Towner anywhere, it's always a scary feeling when something is wrong with your car. The numerous positive reviews encouraged me to go to T & M and I'm glad I did!"
