b'Great place for a Sushi fix.  I always get the 3 combination plate.  With this you can pick from several items.  My favorites are beef teriyaki, spicy tuna rolls, and tempura.With this plate you also get Mi so soup and a small salad.  A bowl of white rice is also included with the meal as well.  They also offer specialty sushi plates, but can get add up if you really want plates of sushi.Another great offer is the happy hour Sunday-Thursday, 11am to 7pm.  You can get a bucket of bud, Bud light, Kirin, or Kirin light for $10.  Its 5 beers so 2 bucks a pop is not bad.  Overall a great place to enjoy sushi and unwind with family and friends.'
