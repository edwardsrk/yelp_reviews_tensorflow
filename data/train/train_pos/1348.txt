b"I went back and fourth on four or five stars. I've been here about twenty times so I obviously truly enjoy the sushi here. The staff is super friendly in a pleasant odd way. The sushi is amazing and fresh, you can even watch them make it on a 26inch flat screen. The top sushi place in the area, definitely better than Lure. It got four stars because it used to be BYOB and now it isn't. Parking is not so Bueno (I parked in front of convenient store one time and guy came out yelling at me). But all things aside this is a hidden gem. Eat here."
