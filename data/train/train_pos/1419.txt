b'It is all-you-can-eat BBQ place for two hours at $29.99. It seems like two hours are short but it is not! They have all variety of seasoned pork belly(samkyusal) and beef selections. Remember that they charge you extra $13.99 per order of galbi. Also you can grill seafood(shrimp or squid). I enjoyed spicy chicken and beef brisket and corn cheese, yum! It is good to enjoy various side dishes(banchan) including kimchi.(grilling kimchi and pork belly(samkyusal) is always awesome) If you are a meat lover and want to enjoy different kind of meat at the same time, it is worthy it. Wish they could serve simple dessert at the end of the meal like other typical Korean BBQ places:)'
