b"Camden has exceeded our expectations. I had wrote a negative review out of frustration but since then I have been proven wrong about this place. Although its located RIGHT outside of the city (which means lots of places within walking distance) it has this small neighborhood feel. Its tucked into its own little street corner. The outside areas are always kept in great condition and they are constantly updating and adding to the buildings.There are a ton of awesome and highly rated restaurants within walking distance, too (we recommend Futo Buta).The staff here are really sweet and inviting. They seem to really care about the residents. The maintenance staff are on point, too. We have never had to wait more than a day to get something fixed and its an emergency they stay late or come back after their shift has ended to help out. I've enjoyed living here and I would recommend Camden South End to friends and family."
