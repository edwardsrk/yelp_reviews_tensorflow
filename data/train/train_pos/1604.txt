b'Great service and course was is in good shape.  I was very pleased with the level of service from Proshop to grounds crew to food and beverage. Tees and fairways were in fantastic shape, greens are good shape for this time of year ( ran a little slow maybe 8-9...would like to see closer to 10. Course would be good for kids....accomplished junior players only)'
