b"Great experience; 2nd time is always the best. Start with the crab cake, it's fantastic. If you're not feeling a cut of meat, go with the seared scallops and as a side, I highly recommend the Mac and cheese. Very awesome, almost like it is made with cream cheese! Great wine selection, get a bottle for sure. Dessert, cookies and cream pie. I went on a date night and we got out of there for $185. Pretty reasonable considering other similar joints in Charlotte can run you $220 easy. Another bonus is valet is friendly and accommodating. Highly suggested my friends!"
