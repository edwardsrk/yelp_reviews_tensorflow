b'The Hampton in Gilbert, AZ is a very nice, modern hotel.  We had a king suite which was a room with a king bed and pull out couch.  Our room was big and beautiful, but it was not two separate rooms as you might think a suite would be.  Still, it was really nice.  The breakfast was good with eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, oatmeal and more.  I would definitely stay there again.'
