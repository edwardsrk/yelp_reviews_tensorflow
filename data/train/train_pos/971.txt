b"Excellent little spot in Liberty Village. Biggest surprise: best miso soup I've ever had in Toronto. The sushi is pretty standard for a cheap sushi joint, and yes, like a previous reviewer, I was surprised to find my sashimi almost frozen. But to me, that's a small complaint. I plan to go back and make my way through their cooked menu, which so far I've enjoyed more."
