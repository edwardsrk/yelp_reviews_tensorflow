b"was told it was a lounge but it felt a little more clubby than that.  we went on a friday night and it was quite a lovely scene.  like everything else at the wynn it's pretty damn gorgeous.  the dj was working his ipod and the crowd was a good mix.  i'd def go back but i heard there's a $40 cover."
