b"I appreciate that you can make a reservation on Opentable, since it's a busy spot for game-day. We had food from the Oktoberfest menu and both of our dishes were great. The service is slow, but attentive. Overall, a great reliable spot for pregaming. A little pricey, but it's to be expected that close to the stadiums."
