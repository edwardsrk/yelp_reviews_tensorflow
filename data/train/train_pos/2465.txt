b'This place is great. I got a groupon and that is the only way i knew about it. The house is very cute decorated and the people in here are very friendly. They keep a chocolate bowl at the table which its not so good (lol) April is great at waxing! she has a great personality and wants to make you feel comfortable in each step of the process. I highly recommend this place :)'
