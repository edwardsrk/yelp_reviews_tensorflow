b"I ordered dinner using the Just Eat app, where they have free delivery for orders over $20. I ordered the Veggie spring rolls, honey garlic chicken, and pineapple chicken fried rice. It was decent - the honey garlic chicken was a bit sweeter than I was expecting and too much breading but still tasted okay. The rice was my favourite - lots of pineapple and fair amount of chicken. I'll probably order food here again, but not the honey garlic chicken. Delivery was quick and the food was hot and fresh when it arrived. The driver was very friendly and I tipped him on the Just Eat app when I paid on there. It made the transaction very simple - as soon as he arrived with my food, I didn't have to try and hold everything while paying on a mobile machine at the front door like when you order pizza."
