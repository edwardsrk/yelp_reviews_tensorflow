b'Flour & Barley is located on the LINQ Promenade.  This place has really good wood fire pizzas.  You can buy the pizza by the slice at the stand right next to the restaurant.  If you want to try their specialty pizzas, you will have to order from the restaurant. Each pizza is about 11 inches, and the crust is really thin.  I recommend people to get their own pizzas instead of sharing.  I got to try the mushroom pizza and it was one of my favorites.  There was a decent amount of mushrooms.  I also tried the Big Apple pizza, which is just spicy pepperoni.  This was also tasty.Overall, great place to get pizzas.  The staff is very nice and friendly to their customers.  I would definitely come back!'
