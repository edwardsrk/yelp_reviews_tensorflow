b'I needed ink for my printer and just took a chance and stopped at the local store on S. Eastern in Henderson, near the Target anchor store. Young lady helped me. She was great. Then I asked some questions about the purchase of a desk top computer and she gave me full attention and customer service. I will be back again.'
