b"The Open Table ~ Our reservation was a complete failure...even though it was confirmed in the App...for there & they didn't have our reservation The Door Greeter was really nice & she accommodated us in about 15 mins, while we sat at the bar & waited while enjoying one of the best pi\xc3\xb1a coladas Cheers Food ~ excellent options & very well flavoured taste!! The mashed sweet potato, all of the steaks & the salad ...MWAAA!!! The fried banana  an added plusEntertainment ~ WOW  felt like I was enjoying it on a tropical  vacation in a resortParking ~ Located in the Loblaws underground parking garage located almost directly across from the restaurant. Paid a flat rate of $4 (think the rate is available from 4pm-8am). Very accessible ~ If you decide to take public transportation, it's a few blocks away from Eglinton subway. Overall experience ~ Will definitely return & recommend others go. All of the staff including the door greeters, waiters & waitresses, bartenders, management were very pleasant, accommodating & full of exceptional customer service skills!!! Enjoyed our Winterlicious"
