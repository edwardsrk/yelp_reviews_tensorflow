b"Utterly fantastic!  This place is as much an art gallery as it is a patisserie. It's a delight just to walk in and gawk at the sheer artistry of it all.  The croissants here are the best in the city. I particularly like the pecan croissant, but they are all good. Sandwiches are awesome and arrive warm without ruining the texture of the breads.  Everything is pure art."
