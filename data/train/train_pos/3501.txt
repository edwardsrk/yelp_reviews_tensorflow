b"Excellent coffee shop and very conveniently located to pop in and go or sit for a bit with your coffee outside. All of the drinks are amazing, I have been 3 times, today will be 4 and each time I want to get another. All of the employees are so nice and they are quick to get you your drink. They also have waffles, I haven't personally tried one but I have seen a couple people order them and I always want it! Definitely give this place a shot, personal favorite is the iced vanilla latte which on the menu is probably named after a bird."
