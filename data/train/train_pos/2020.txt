b"The price has gone up a couple dollars but the food is still cheap as hell! Was $4.99 to $5.95 now.There's always a line up outside but the wait isn't so bad. Great place to go if you wanna have fun with a group of friends and or even a date. The music is pretty up there with all the throwbacks and such, so tip:  not the best place to have a full-blown out conversation ..although on the bright side, the food is preeeeetty good, can't even complain for what it's worth. The poutine is always filling enough to share with two people. Wings were a bit saucy but the size made up for it and the smokey bbq burger was a good, nothing crazy. I wouldn't really suggest getting drinks here though because they are a bit pricey around $7. A friend I went with asked for a double shot, it didn't taste like a double because it wasn't strong so keep an eye for the bartender haha... But overall, it's a decent spot to grab cheap food and catch up with friends."
