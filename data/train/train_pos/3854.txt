b"LOVE this place. The best sushi and one of the best meals I've ever had. Prix fixe menu. You can clearly feel the quality and emphasis on detail as soon as you walk through the door - the owner is meticulous and it shows.Expect to pay $50+ per person minimum. The menu is perfection and prix fixe changes daily. One of the best restaurants I've ever been to, and unbeatable for the price.Book your reservations today!"
