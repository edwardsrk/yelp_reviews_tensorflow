b"I have been a loyal customer of Little Dumpling for years, and I typically order take out. I love the Chicken Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon! Its well spiced with chili oil and generous with the meat. Delivery is fast, and has friendly drivers. My gf likes the Lemon Chicken with sauce on the side and eggroll for starter. It's our local Chinese go to, give it a try...you won't be disappointed!"
