b"I went here last night, and I loved it!First, the atmosphere is really good - I'm a sucker for bricks though so I generally like any restaurant that has brick walls.My friend and I started with the trio of cheese (I think it was around $18 for 3).  We asked the waiter's advice as to which cheeses to choose and his reco was excellent.  Each cheese comes with its own condiment so we had a baby mozzarella with a rhubarb compote, a paresan with strawberry and another cheese which I can't remember with marmelade - fantastic!For my main, I had the gnocchi which was really good and my friend had some kind of pasta with lemon and ricotta (she really liked it but it wasn't my thing).  Both were around $20We wanted a little something extra so we split a trio of sorbet - bergamot, rhubarb and mango - the rhubarb was my favouriteAll in all, a great night.  The service was excellent, the room was really nice and the food was awesome (and reasonably priced).  My only complaint was that our cocktails were really small and didn't appear to have much alcohol in them.  I'd stick to wine if I went again."
