b'This is an amazing restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  First of all, they start you off with fries instead of a bread basket...need I say more?  There were 3 different flavors (garlic, truffle, and old bay), each with its own sauce.  I had the bacon cream spinach which was so flavorful along with flatiron steak which was cooked perfectly.  The steak comes with one bite (literally) of cornbread that melts in your mouth, making you crave more.  For dessert we had the beignets and chocolate chip cookie.  I used to think beignets were just fancy donuts but stripsteak proved me wrong.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy but airy on the inside.  It came with a trio of sauces of which creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was my favorite.  The butterscotch was too bitter with an alcoholic after taste.  Definitely will come back next time i am in Vegas.  I only took off one star because our waiter was not very attentive and when we ordered more fries, it came out the same time as our dessert rather than during the meal.'
