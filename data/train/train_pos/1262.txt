b"Do not come in here expecting a feast or buffet, the food is simple and the menu is small. We actually ordered a meal that was not on the menu, but had a selection of different meats. The meat was absolutely perfect and tender, and better since we cooked it to our liking. There were three different kinds of meats. It said it came with vegetables. But only three small slices of veggies came, you might want to order a separate dish of vegetables. We also ordered the kimchi fried rice, which was very large. We did not finish it with two people. We left perfectly satisfied and not feeling disgustingly full. Which is probably why that person walked in and right back out. We found the staff very nice and helpful. The meat was spectacular, it is definitely the focus of this place. I've caught the older gentleman who works at Ichiza eating here before."
