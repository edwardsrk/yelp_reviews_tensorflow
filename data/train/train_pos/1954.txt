b'We have stayed here a few times to have a "staycation" and have been able to get the room for a very reasonable rate. The location is great and everyone that works there has always been very friendly. Had we paid full price for the room I would not have rated it so highly because the room is just ok and the beds are kind of hard. Worth it for the location if you get a good deal and are staying for one or two nights.'
