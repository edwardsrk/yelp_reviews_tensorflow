b"We opted to stop by for a sangria and glass of wine and I think we wished we ate here.  They have a beautiful street side patio (on a side street, so less traffic) and good service.The inside is pretty hip looking - dark walls/floors and red decor.  I can't rate the food, but we enjoyed our happy hour cocktail enough to consider giving this place a try next time we are in town."
