b"My sister in law ordered food catered from here for my moms 80th birthday.I was visiting from California and I love Thai food and Chinese food and eat lots and have had lots of different places.The Orange Chicken and Egg rolls were very good.Actually great.As was the fried rice and noodles.I have had better Satay, but this was good  and I judge for overall eating experience and this one was so good.There was so much good food and they delivered and really laid out the spread very nice.I don't eat Broccoli but the beef and broccoli looked very good.What made my day and I crave for all the time was the peppered beef and the best Pork that I have ever eaten in my life I really don't know the name but is was a breaded pork that was a little bit spicy and the BOMB!I mean the Bomb.I love Spicy..I can't wait till I go here in person and I will take some of that pork and put in freezer and take back to California with me.I will be coming here and eating this awesome food.I would recommend this food to be catered at a party to anyone .Your party will be a hit..Right on!Bring your awesome place to Cali..I love your food and could not get enough..EAT HERE WHEN IN LAS VEGAS.GREAT THAI AND CHINESE FOOD....."
