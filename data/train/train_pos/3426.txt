b'If you want REAL, AUTHENTIC asian food, this is the place you want to go. On the wall, you\'ll find their entire menu in chinese - I love the character it brings to their space! They offer an english paper menu as well - and more "americanized" asian dishes. We went for an early dinner and did not have to wait for a table. We ordered our entrees and they were brought to us very quickly. Great portion sizes and *amazing* taste. Additionally, the staff were very nice and attentive, and we were in and out in no time at all! This is one place that I would bring my asian grandparents to in a heartbeat. They offer tripe, duck, and a wide variety of other dishes that make many feel right at home!'
