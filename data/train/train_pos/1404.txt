b'We decided to try this place out because of a groupon. The staff was incredibly nice and attentive. Both salad & meals (Gnocchi Vodka & Chicken Florentine) were well cooked & seasoned. The Gnocchi was as close to NY Italian that I have found in AZ. The only thing that stopped a 5 star rating is that I felt the prices were a little high. All that said, we both said we would go back -without a Groupon!'
