b"Service was fast and effective. Not a huge menu but what you'd expect at a rib and BBQ place. You order when you walk in and the order is filled by the time you get to the register.We split a rack of ribs. These are St. Louis dry rub style. Excellent! We had coleslaw, mac & cheese and fries. The fries were a bit salty fir our tastes. The other sides were great. They have 6 or so beers on tap. Soft drinks and ice tea. Place was clean with decent music to match the ambience. We will return"
