b'Since I\'ve moved to the Charlotte area I\'ve been "a happy regular" at Roosters. I\'m not the type to blow massive amounts of money on a haircut, however I\'m not going to a $10 quick-cut huge-franchise chain either.In my opinion, the haircut is well worth the price. I\'ve gotten cuts by I think everyone in the shop and I\'ve never been disappointed. I\'ve done both appointments and walk-in, either one no problems. You get offered a drink every visit, nice big comfortable chair, and great wash (I personally hate hairs all over my face and ears when I leave the barber chair and they do a great job of not letting that happen!)'
