b'So happy to have found a little piece of France in Pittsburgh! As a francophile and food-lover, i was excited to try this place out. It exceeded my expectations. The little shop mirrored the boulangeries in France. I ate the sandwich La Campagnard, which was a simple turkey sandwich on a baguette. Its simplicity, freshness, and texture made for an amazing gastronomic experience. I also sampled the Pistachio macaron which was reasonably priced and very good as well. Of course, i had to get a Baguette Tradition, which had an intoxicating smell and had the perfect consistency of crunchy and fluffy on the inside. Will definitely go back soon, and i suggest anyone who is visiting Pittsburgh must go here. The only downside was that there were only a couple of tables, and with the line forming into the street, not everyone could sit. Luckily, there is a park across the street.'
