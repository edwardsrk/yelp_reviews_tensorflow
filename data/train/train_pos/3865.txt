b'sometimes its hard to get past the cash in this store.  you walk in and on your left are tomes filled with photographs and paintings, artists you know, artists youve never heard of, but they are all there welcome you in.  on your right like a cat thats just been in a room where a million other cats have just been hanging out, try as you might, you cannot move quicker help but stop every two seconds, every two inches to get a grip on the newest smell from the newest high quality page in the newest coolest magazine.  the mags are foreign, local, thick and filled with really great articles.this spot is top notch for an indie bookstore that has at least two great sections as listed above, and a whole book store filled with both new and obscure titles.'
