b"I can't say enough about Bill and his staff.  He was constantly checking in on me and making sure I understood the process and his strategy.  From day 1, I felt like Bill cared about me personally and how the results would impact me.  I only witnessed professionalism from Bill and his staff.  Every call was promptly returned and every one I worked with seemed to have my best interest at heart.  I was referred to Bill by a friend and I would absolutely refer him to my friends.  He is a well respected attorney in Charlotte and NC and I just experienced why...... thank you Bill and team for the WIN!!!!!"
