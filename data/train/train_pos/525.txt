b'This is a great place for a Friday night with the ladies or a romantic date night. Get the Pork Belly Watermelon tacos and your life will change as you know it. The Brussels Sprouts are good too. The rest of the food was ok. This place is tiny, so the wait will probably be long. We waited 2.5 hours on a Friday night, but we just hopped over to Peculiar Rabbit next door and had drinks at the bar while we waited. They had a DJ and it felt very metropolitan.'
