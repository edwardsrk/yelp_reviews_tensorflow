b'A modern and clever way to do all you can eat Korean barbeque. At Let\'s Meat Kbbq, there is a flat rate for you to eat all your heart desires but it is structured in a way that decreases the potential for unnecessary waste. So essentially, the idea is that you order from a menu for portions of things whether it be meat, vegetables, soups, etc and if you want more, you can always order more. Honestly, some people might not be excited about the "inconvenience" about ordering multiple times but I\'m happy with it because I\'ve oftentimes wondered and reflected about the waste! Also, the waiters/waitresses are so attentive that anytime you need anything, they\'re right there to take your order. Furthermore, they do all the cooking for you, so all you need to do is eat. The only thing that I wasn\'t crazy about was the fact that the price per person is already pretty steep. It seems a little ridiculous to have to pay an additional amount for some of the meats. I won\'t speak much to the authenticity. I didn\'t particularly think the meats were flavored well though the bean paste soup was exactly as how I remember my mother making it when I was a wee lass. Lastly, I was really glad that their kimchi was good- it\'s the first thing I look for when I go to a Korean restaurant.'
