b'Shockingly great service is possible at SMA. The nurse called me to the back office before I was finished checking in at the front desk. As soon as the nurse left my room, Dr. Mehta walked in. It was hard to believe I was in Vegas, at a medical clinic. Felt more like McDonalds, in a good way.Dr. Mehta is efficient. I love efficient people. Dr. Mehta had the misfortune of seeing me after I had already been seen twice at Quickcare, so I was fed up. One doctor said Strep throat, the other said viral infection and, in the meantime, I developed pink eye. A hot mess is what I heard some people mumbling as I walked away coughing and rubbing my eyes.Anyhow, he ordered three prescriptions, two blood tests and a chest Xray and told me I couldn\'t return to work for 3 days. He held up his fingers as he told me, "Three days. You don\'t want people seeing you like that anyway, do you? Three days."I appreciated his humor and the fact that he didn\'t chastise me too much for taking my friend\'s medicine. All I had to do was walk across the hall for the blood test and across the street for the Xray. Piece of cake. In and out.'
