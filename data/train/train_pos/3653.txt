b"I took my parents to this location to get their drivers license renewed. We were able to get a number quickly because my dad is handicapped. We got forms to fill out and they said our number would get called in 10 minutes. Within 2 minutes of sitting down our number was called but unfortunately my parents didn't have their forms filled out. However the lady was nice and said to just fill it out and she will call us after she is done with the next person. That next person took forever but then she called us back up about 15-20 min later. Her name is Agnes. She is from Austria and has a strong accent. She was very very nice and friendly, smiling and talking the entire time with us about other things while she was processing the renewals. She is probably the nicest person I have dealt with at a DMV. We were done within an hour which isn't bad at all."
