b"I love how cozy this spot was.  There is a such thing as being too big and BWB hit the nail on the head in terms of size.  It's so intimate. easy to talk to the person sitting next to you, if thats what you so desire.  Or you can immerse yourself in your own conversation.  The bar staff here was amazing for this event and worked so hard to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We loved the beer flights.  Even I am not a fan of IPA's but the IPA they served in the beer flight wasn't too bad, sure it had the bitterness at the end but a lot easier to drink than most IPA's.  My favorite had to be the Saison beer, it had just enough sweet notes to captivate me.  I do want to talk about my favorite thing though, which was our charcuterie board.  We had the brewer's reserve which I think was a perfect combination of meat and cheese.  The fig spread was amazing but I am also a sucker for fig anything  I do wish they had given a little more of the fig, as not all the beer:meat:fig ratios were balanced and thats kind of a huge pet peeve of mine.  Regrettably I didnt find where the pistachios or almonds fit in with that board but that is just my opinion.  Overall this would be a spot I would definitely come back to again.  I forgot to ask if they serve any kidn of wine but even if they dont, they have a couple beers that I, pickiest of all beer drinkers, enjoy."
