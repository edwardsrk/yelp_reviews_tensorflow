b"Nice variety of thai food.  Cheap prices and the taste was good.  Feigning for rice on this trip... I ordered the eggplant stirfry with rice.  It was yummy and they offered a Vegetarian menu.  I'm definitely coming here again if in the area of Las Vegas and craving thai food.  Yum.  Thanks, Thai Style Noodle House.  I think you were the food highlight of my trip compared to my other stops. :)And it was packed in and out while I was there.  That's usually a good sign. :)"
