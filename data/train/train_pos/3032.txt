b"I love Bouchon. It's still my favorite place to go hands down. They are extremly fresh and have excellent service. I ate at the bouchon in Beverly hills and didn't encounter a single difference in food quality in Vegas. The food has always been delicious and this one time I went we ordered practically everytihng. From the bakery basket in which the waiter chooses for us a selection of baked goods to the mussels to the hash. Everything was delicious. And you can't beat the price around 20-30 a person with small apps. Or aroudn 40-50 if your drinkin a little. Very reasonable for what your getting.Take a peek at my photos.Thanks Thomas Keller for a great meal again!"
