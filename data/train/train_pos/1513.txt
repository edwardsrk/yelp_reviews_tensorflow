b"I would post a picture of the food but it's too late! Visiting Cleveland for the night and decided to come here because they have a nice patio and allow pups!! It turned out that their food was delicious too! My fianc\xc3\xa9 ordered the classic old fashion and I got the French 65. Both were delicious and boozy! For food we got a bunch of snacks to share. Our favorites include the confit wings (they are amazing and way better than any other wings you have had!) and the Brussels sprouts were delicious! Would definitely come back!  The only negative I would have is that it is located in a fairly congested and touristy street. But well worth the visit!"
