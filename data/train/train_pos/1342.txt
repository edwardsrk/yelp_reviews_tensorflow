b'Love this store. Was referred to ScoopNYC by a stylish friend in the Bay Area who said that the clothes meet our criteria of being stylish, tasteful and affordable (for the most part) - not cheap quality, but attainable if you find something that is worth investing in.A lot of clothing in Vegas is either too high end, cheaply made and/or slutty. You can get a conventional look at places like Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom or Macy\'s but this store has a few edgy styles that are not so memorable that you can\'t wear them whenever you want without pausing to think, "when was the last time I wore this?"Affordable and stylish Rag and Bone and a few other pieces on sale rack - I went on a day before the Fourth of July holiday when a lot of the store was 30% off, and an additional 30% of sale rack items. Friendly, candid and helpful staff.'
