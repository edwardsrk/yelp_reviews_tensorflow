b"This is a scaled review. Obviously it can't stand with 4 starred places on the strip, but in terms of a Chinese buffet, its a great place.Some other reviews are knocking it for not having extensive salad choices, or a diverse menu, uhm, it's a local Chinese buffet, not a casino buffet.What it does have is regularly switched out food (freshness), a lot of choices (in comparison to other Chinese buffets), a Mongolian station, and on weekends crab legs.For the money, this is definitely a place you can go to get a lot of bang for your buck."
