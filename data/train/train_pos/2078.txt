b"Smellsssssss soooooooo nice. After bathing in cigarette smoke from other hotels and casinos, coming back to the hotel was like a breath of fresh air, except it smells expensive. When you first walk in, you'll feel like a bum walking in some fancy shmacy hotel, but every staff member is glad to see you and treats everyone ever so nice. From cleaning maids, doormen, and shuttle drivers. All very cool people.Some tips: *Free shuttle takes you to Wynn or Cesar's Palace, runs until midnight, and later on weekends.*You can checkout using your hotel tv.*Call the valet to have your car pulled out before you head downstairs, because it can take a while.You wont regret staying here."
