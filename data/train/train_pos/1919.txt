b"My first time at Asian Taste today, I ordered the #9: Fried Garlic Sauce Noodles. The noodles are wide (like pappardelle), but made with rice flour, which makes them wonderfully chewy. The fried garlic sauce is delicious -- slightly sweet, slightly sour, but overall salty and savory with a fragrant garlic taste and crushed red pepper flakes bringing the heat. The noodles are also sprinkled with scallions and slick with the delicious oil. Julienned cucumber is served on the side of the bowl, which adds a needed fresh note. The portion was generous, and I loved every bite. Service was fast. Prices are relatively low (noodles: $5.95, bottled water: $1).The restaurant is difficult to spot. It's tucked in from street view. The interior is small, with just a few booths, a couple of picnic tables, and some stools at a back counter. The place fills up fast at lunch, so get there early or expect to wait. The folks behind the counter don't speak much English, so if you do, order by the menu number. Expect to eat with chopsticks. Pro-tip: for the long, wide noodles, arrange a noodle into layers and stab through with the tips. I don't know if this is legit, but it worked for me!"
