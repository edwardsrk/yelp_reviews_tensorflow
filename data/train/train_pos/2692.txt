b"One of the hardest tables to book in Toronto and for a good reason. The menu is very limited but it's all about quality here. The rustic space is very welcoming and the service adds the cherry on top. I had a cocktail with Green Chartreuse and olive oil which was very unique and interesting at the same time. For appetizers, we shared the seared squid (with tarragon salsa verde) and the famous burrata dish which was creamy in texture. I did not really care for the roasted grapes and they did not enhance the overall experience whatsoever. For mains, we had the celeriac agnolotti which was amazing. They lost a star due to dessert (salted caramel budino with chocolate meringue) which was mediocre. Will definitely come back to try out their summer menu when it's out."
