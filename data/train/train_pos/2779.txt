b"There are few places in Madison where you can get a better for lunch for the price. For $12 you get a plate of delicious hanger steak, potatoes, and side house salad (which is crazy creative and I wish I would have thought of the recipe myself it's so good). Enjoy all of that in the cool restaurant atmosphere and you have yourself one great lunch!For those of you who, like me, can't get enough sushi, the sashimi plate and Muramoto roll are just the things to curb that never-ending sushi craving for the day. Then you'll probably want to comes back for another round the next day. It's a good idea to split these dishes between two people. The sashimi plate comes with a side of rice that has dried shiso leaf sprinkled on top. Never had this combo before, and it is so welcomed! The dried shiso adds a nice delicate, herbal flavor to the savory sticky rice. Yummmm. The variety of fish the sushi chef picked was all wonderful. I couldn't pick a favorite because it was all so good in its own way. The Muramoto roll is a party in itself. Egg paper--can't imaging how they make that!--enrobes rice, shrimp, shiso and some other delicious things and is topped with a mound of salmon roe. Hard to beat that!"
