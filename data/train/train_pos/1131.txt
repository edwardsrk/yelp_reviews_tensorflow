b'I had heard about Kaya since I first moved to Pittsburgh but it was only recently that I got a chance to try it out and I regret not having done it earlier! This is a nice place for both lunch and dinner, with good food, drinks and helpful service.  i ordered the cuban sandwich, which was delicious and the other two people in my party ordered the paella which also seemed amazing! I will be certainly going back when I am in the strip district or I can even make a trip just for Kaya.'
