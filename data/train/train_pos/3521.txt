b'I have had dinner here two times, and loved both times!  Personally, I think there is a lot of mediocre food in Vegas, but Mesa Grill is definitely not mediocre.  We had dinner before seeing Cirque\'s "O".  The bread basket, as everyone says, is excellent.  I had the Partida margarita, simply divine.  My salad was great, with a little spice.  The spice rub pork tenderloin is the best pork I have EVER had.  It was so good, we raved about it so much, that the couple at the next table both ordered the pork tenderloin as well, and thanked us profusely for the recommendation!  I was a bit disappointed in the pear upside down cake for dessert.  It would only get 3 stars.  But the total experience is still 5 stars.'
