b"Bobby Flay makes delicious food. I have been to Mesa Grill three times, twice for lunch, and it's one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. The space is huge, so even on a night you think a seat might take a while, they can typically accommodate you, so don't skip this place thinking it'll be too tough to get seated. Each time the service has been fantastic. For lunch both times I got the Green Chili Cheeseburger, which comes with some awesome spicy French fries. The sandwich has cheese, delicious green chili and picked onions. It's awesome and that's why I got it both times. For dinner, I got the pork, and there's was absolutely nothing left on the plate. The price is what you'd expect, but not outrageous. It's definitely worth the visit on your trip to Vegas.5 *****."
