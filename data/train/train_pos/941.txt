b"Number one reason to visit Kultura: the mushroom orechiette. Roger Mooking proves his genius as a celebrity chef with this addictive dish. It's simple really: tiny pasta in a mushroom sauce, mixed just before serving with a mild cheese that melts into ooey-gooey goodness.  On the night that I dined here,  Kultura must have been having an off night. It was mostly empty even though the DJ was playing music that just begged to be danced to. It seems to be a great place for drinks, dancing and lounging, but on this night the people were just not there. No matter to me, as long as the mushroom orechiette is on the menu, I'll keep coming back."
