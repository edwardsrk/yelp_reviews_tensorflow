b"I don't allow myself a pasta indulgence often, but when I do, I want Vapiano. I always get the same thing: Carbonara with onions, garlic, chili peppers and oven roasted tomatoes. So good! Pasta is fresh and cooked al dente. The chefs are happy to accommodate special requests. At $10 for lunch and for no service, it's not the cheapest lunch in uptown, but worth every penny."
