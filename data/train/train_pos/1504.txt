b'Man, I hadn\'t been to this King\'s in years. Friday night, we needed supplies from Wal Mart, so we stopped in for dinner. It\'s interesting how King\'s is Eat N Park\'s opposite number, it\'s Bizarro-world counterpart if you will.EnP has the Smiley cookie. King\'s answers it with the brilliant and rebellious (well, for a family chain anyway) Frownie. EnP has the Superburger. King\'s has the K-Boy.Yeah, I know. It sounds like the name of a rapper or club DJ. And it\'s exactly like the Superburger in almost every way. You get those moist, grey patties that taste better than their looks would have you think. They are both double-deckers. Each has its "special sauce" along with the shredded lettuce, the tomato, the diner-borne chutzpah.However can ya get a fried egg on your Superburger?"Ah-hahhh" says Hartley King, the company\'s larger-than-life founder and frontman. So we\'ll call it a 4 star draw. The Superburger and the K-Boy both go to the 1-hour time limit in their dream match. And don\'t forget  to try this amazing sundae on Memorial Day, which includes deep-fried (!) Frownies, to help support area veterans. It\'s still on the menu...http://kingsfamily.com/about/in-the-news.aspxP.S. Our waitress Alycia was whipsmart like Liz Phair and a joy to be served by.'
