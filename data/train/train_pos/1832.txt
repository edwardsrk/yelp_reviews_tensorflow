b"One day we were really bored and wanted to try a new gay bar for an afternoon drink.  This place was close to another favorite bar of ours, so we figured we'd give it a try.We walked in and Jakob, the bartender, was very friendly.  He instantly remembered our names.  He also makes the best margaritas.We have returned a few times since then, but Jakob only works weekends.  The crowd is friendly and the drinks are strong.Overall, this is a great neighborhood unpretentious bar."
