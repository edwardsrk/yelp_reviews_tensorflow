b"So many great things about this resort.   Loved staying offstrip for a quieter experience.   The good:. Staff are great (see exception below).   Most staff here were fabulous.  The check in was smooth, the valet staff are lovely, one of the cleaning staff even offered to wait for me to get my Starbucks when she saw me hesitating to leave the guest access only area because I forgot my card. The amenities here are awesome!  The pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.   The only thing I will say needs to change is the pool staff.   For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   Otherwise a fantastic stay.    I'd return here for sure."
