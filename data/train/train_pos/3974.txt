b"My girlfriend and I decided to try George's Brasserie last night before our pre-Christmas celebration and were really blown away.The food was excellent! We started off with a barbecue octopus appetizer special that was really flavorful and tender. Also, the complimentary baguette they give you is great - not a crusty baguette like I've had to endure many times at other restaurants. My girlfriend ordered the duck entree and I ordered the pork chop. Both were exceptional! Her duck was so tender and moist and was the best duck either of us had ever eaten (albeit both with limited experience). My pork was very good, and the polenta that came with is was awesome. Unfortunately we were stuffed even before dessert, but all the food we tried was very flavorful and cooked just right.The service was pretty outstanding as well. Multiple different waiters checked on us or took plates, etc. but it was not because our main waiter was inattentive. The owner visited our table a few times as well, and the entire staff was friendly. The ambience is exactly what you would expect in South Park as well, very elegant and classy without trying too hard. No complaints about any portion of our visit to George's!"
