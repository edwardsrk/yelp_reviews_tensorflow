b"So... As im sure you have all realized by this point... This is the DMV. With that being said, you should expect to wait. The good news is, waiting here is comfortable. I came two days in a row Friday at 4:15PM and Saturday at 8:30AM. My Friday Visit: I came to get information on registering my out of state vehicle and getting a NV license. I waited in like approx 15-20mins. I walked up to my attendant with a smile & she returned the courtesy. She gave me most of the info I needed & I was on my way. I was really impressed with how quickly I was in and out. My Saturday Visit: I needed a smog check (done directly across the street for $20, took less than 5mins) and an on site inspection (took 2mins) so i didn't actually get in line until about 8:30AM. The line was wrapped around the building. I was intimidated but it literally only took 30mins to get to the front. I approached the attendant with a smile and again she returned the courtesy. I told her what I was there for & confirmed that I had all the correct documents. The only difference in info was that she informed me that I would have to pay my former states late reg. fees, whereas the first attendant said I would not. That wasn't a big deal for me... So I gave her my cell number went to wait. What I really liked about this place is the fact that they have a 7/11 style snack bar! And they text you updates on where you are in line so you can leave and come back if you'd like. Another thing Im noticing, theres ample seating and no kids running around (either visit) and this AM the bathrooms were clean. The total process has taken about 1.5hours until this point and I should be out of here in 10-15more minutes. Very doable, especially for the DMV."
