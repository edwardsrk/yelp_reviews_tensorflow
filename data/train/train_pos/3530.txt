b'Very clean and the staff is friendly!! The specialty coffee is good when available (runs out fast on Sunday mornings).Today\'s choice for coffee is "Butter Rum".Yogurt Parfait is always good and a great morning starter.Lots of choices for omlettes, I would suggest the Palermo.Can get busy and crowded sunday mornings by 9 am so get here early if you can.'
