b'I really enjoyed their food (there way better then china kings dim sum). Way bigger selection of dumplings and everything looks cleaner. The place is super busy but the fungi area is big so there is not a long wait. The price is very responsible and 2 ppl can eat for under 30 at least during lunch time.'
