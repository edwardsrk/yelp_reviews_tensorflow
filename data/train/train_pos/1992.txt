b"I'm basing this review on the happy hour menu. We had a team outing here last night and decided to check this place out. We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate. Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain. Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless. Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu. 777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again. Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend. Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary. Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good. We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet. This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour. They accommodated our large party quite well and service was good until the end when it was time to order dessert and we couldn't find our waitress for a while."
