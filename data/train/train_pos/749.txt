b"As a Vietnamese person, I highly recommend this place for pho, bun, and/or ca phe sua da. The pho broth is the best in comparison to the other pho competitors within the vicinity. Their drinks are delicious, but seriously, get their Vietnamese iced coffee if you want to stay awake for the rest of the day. Such refreshing scents and tastes here. This is the best Vietnamese spot in East Chinatown that the GTA's got to offer."
