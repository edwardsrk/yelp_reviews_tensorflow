b"I have been going to the RWB in Mesa since it opened and the food is pretty darn good.  As a vegetarian I have tried every possible combination of food on the menu that is vegetarian, but I typically will just stick to the pizzas and salad. The eggplant Florentine is very good too, but the serving is enough to get you through 4 meals!  That is true with most of their food, the portions are large, so don't be turned off by the prices.   I would have to agree on the comments below on the service; it's nothing to write home about. The only thing I will say is that I know several people who are regulars at the brew and they are treated like gold... so maybe there's something us occasional patrons are missing.  If you are area, I would definitely recommend RWB."
