b"Everyday tastiness!  I've been to this country's finest Chinatowns...San Francisco, New York, etc...  And I have to honestly say that I was impressed with the service, d\xc3\xa9cor and food at Everyday Noodles.  Let me first say that the service can often be brutal in a lot Chinese restaurants...noncommittal stares from wait staff, lack of patience when asking about dishes,  etc.. you know the drill.  However, my daughter Muff and I recently went to Everyday Noodles on a busy Saturday and while the line was lengthy, it moved pretty quickly thanks to the drill sergeant hostess up front.Here's a further breakdown of the rest of the visit:D\xc3\xa9cor - Truly appreciated the lack of faux Chinese d\xc3\xa9cor.  Loved the lightness/airiness of the place.  Seating could be placed a little farther apart, but hey, it still beats 99% of the Chinese restaurants around. Food - Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Potstickers - Well done and you could actually taste each component, but nothing overpowered anything else. Yum!Rolled Onion Pancake w/ Sliced Beef - Never seen this dish here in Pittsburgh, but I have had it elsewhere and this one stacks up pretty well.  Double yum!Taiwanese Style Pork Belly Slider - Okay, braised pork belly with fragrant soy/ginger/garlic goodness?  Come on, man!  How can you go wrong!  Chinese Happy Family yum! Dan Dan Noodles Szechuan Style - Wonderful chew to the noodles and we added a little extra stink to it by adding some garlic-chili sauce.  Great!Overall, a great addition to the Pittsburgh food scene!  A round-the-world chopstick thumbs up!"
