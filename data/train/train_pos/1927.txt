b'brought mama for a belated birthday present. very good show. JLo mixed in a lot of her oldies with some new tracks and even threw in a little Lee Ann Womack\'s "i hope you dance". lots of costume changes and obviously, lots of amazing choreography. light show was not too gawdy and crowd was really dialed in. overall, worth the $$$.'
