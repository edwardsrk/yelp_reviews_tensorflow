b"As a noodle lover, had to try this place out. I've been to a similar concept noodle place and ordered the same soup base - pickled vegetable. I found the toppings to put into the noodles were right up my alley which made the experience more enjoyable. The soup came piping hot which is always nice. The best part is obviously the free refills of noodle which at this visit, I didn't really order an extra order as I usual do. However, I still enjoyed my meal. The service was quick, toppings had a good variety of items (meats and veggies) and soup base was tasty. I will be coming back here for a quick hotpot-like noodle fix!"
