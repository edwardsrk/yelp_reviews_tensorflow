b'Was not greeted by any of the three people inside. When the girl came out from the bathroom the only indication that she was ready to work was her standing behind the register, silent. Seemed irritated that we were the only customers and interrupting her "down" time.  Good thing the food was great.  I had the lamb kubideh and my wife had the chicken kabob. both were cooked appropriately. rice was tasty and the grilled tomato was a nice touch. I also really like the green relish/salsa like condiment.'
