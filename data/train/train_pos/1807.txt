b'i was SOOOO excited to see this little shop by the owner of Frances Vintage. I love love love the decor...the outside, the inside, the counter, the bags, the awnings....I was really hoping for C A N D Y and lots of it...I didnt get that..mostly expensive novelty items  that I was not in the market for..the candy I did see was mostly the kind I could pick up anywhere. They had some original birthday party favors like vintage pin the tail on the donkey game and custom made birthday hats. I really like the shop I could spend hours LOOKING around but Iam hoping for more candy please.....'
