b"It's actually not bad and delivers what it promises - great gelato. The place is small like any other ice cream place and the garbage gets pretty packed and grossly looking. But let's talk ice cream here. They are great. You can mix flavours for a single scoop and go nuts with your favourite flavour. Try pistachio, I dare you. You will never go back. Ever heard of that saying? Of course you do!It sits humbly squeezed in between places that are rather pretentious. The high heeled don't come here but the hip crowds do. If you want gelato, come and gain weight. It's addictive. I warned ya!"
