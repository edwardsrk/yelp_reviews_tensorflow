b"If you're in the mood for fondue in CU, you go to Bread Company. I've had their cheese, meat, and chocolate fondue and all are pretty good. There isn't an abundance of items to dip in the fondue, which is the only thing I'd change if I could. Still a great date spot if you're both into fondue. Dim lit with candles without trying to be pretentious so it sets a casual intimate mood."
