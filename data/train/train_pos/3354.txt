b'Love love love Kelly\'s!   I just discovered this spot while I was doing The Taste of Scottsdale tour.  We stopped there for dessert.  The restaurant gives you the feel of an elegant Irish pub.  They have a pool table, dart board, putting green and HUGE patio!  In the past, I always thought of Kelly\'s as a bar or late night hang out (which is not really my thing) but I was very wrong!  Their menu looked amazing!  They have an "award winning" four cut burger--which I will try next time!  Dessert was delish!  We had the doughnut holes and Kelly\'s twinkie.  Both were excellent! I was most impressed with the service!  We were greeted right away.  While we were eating our dessert both a manager and the chef stopped by to check on us.  I was most impressed that the chef and manager cared so much about our experience!  A+ service!  I\'m glad I found this new gem in Old Town Scottsdale!  I can\'t wait to go back to Kelly\'s!'
