b"The best part about Paramount is the extra bread & coffee. I love the garlic paste, hummus and Manakesh. Though, I feel the bread (khubus) is too thick. Recently, they have increased the prices of many items. Also, they have decreased the garlic container and the quantity..I would have given it 5 stars if the prices were good.Paramount is a good place for family and friends. They don't take long time to serve and have friendly and nice waiter's..The portion size for mixed grill, sandwiches: chicken, beef shawarma's and kofta sandwich (is large)...Rather two can eat in one sandwich, as it is quite filling!My best thing, would be just bread and garlic sauce! But, ALAS! the small portions of garlic sauce has really made me REALLY unhappy!"
