b"We ate here for a big team dinner this week. There were twelve of us and we sat outside on the patio which is delightful. It was a chilly evening, but they moved all kinds of heaters around our table to make everyone comfortable. First up....It's hard to find the door! Our Uber driver dropped us off at the address and we were like...where is it?? You have to walk up the large cement stairs and then you'll see the cool neon blue dog sign. Inside - it's gorgeous! COOOOOL bar area with these neat hanging lights. Great place for a date!! LOVE the vibe. The drinks are awesome! I tried the Hibiscus Belle Fleur drink and it came with a beautiful flower in the glass. So fun, and so tasty. Kind of sweet, but not overly so. Everyone at the table loved their cocktails. It seems like they are all worth trying. We shared almost every single appetizer so we could try different things. Everyone freaked out about the deviled eggs! They have bacon jam at the bottom. Wowza. My favorite two appetizers were the flatbread and the sunchokes. But everything was great. I think it would be fine to just have a bunch of apps for dinner - they are that good. Someone in my party was craving the hamburger from the website photo... Turned out they ran out at lunch time! So no burgers at dinner. I had the roasted chicken as my entree. I received two chicken pieces, still on the bone. Very juicy and well seasoned. There was a lot of quinoa on my plate. i was wishing there was more butternut puree or more veggies. It was a good meal. I recommend this place for sure. Good for groups and also good for dates. It's not a place for kids - very adult vibe. I would come back if I'm in Phoenix visiting again."
