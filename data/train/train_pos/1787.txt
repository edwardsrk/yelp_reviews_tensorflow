b"I had a rough experience immediately after eating here.. not because the food or service was bad, but because the servers are super generous with the Bottomless Mimosas/Bellineis/BloodyMarys. hahaFOOD:We came here for brunch and started right off with the Mimosas, Bellinis, and Bloody Mary's. The bartender and our server were very quick at refilling for us.. bottomless indeed!The Perch Burger was okay.. flavor was good, very simple, juicy patty, but could have used a fried egg in it.The Steak & Egg Tacos were delicious.. the avocado mouse gave it an interesting flavor. AMBIANCE:A fun, lively vibe during brunch. It's located in a cool spot at Container Park that matches the overall atmosphere of the area.SERVICE:Awesome staff! Everyone was welcoming and friendly. We didn't have a reservation and came in during a busy time.. the manager tried really hard to get us in as quickly as possible. Awesome!TIPS:Definitely include the bottomless drinks but be careful, you might end up running straight into the casino afterwards and winning money without knowing it! haha :)"
