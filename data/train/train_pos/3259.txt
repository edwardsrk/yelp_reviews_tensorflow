b"I was surprised with how they redid the OG rooms. Granite and marble countertops throughout, even in the shower, highly recommend the upgrade if you can. We had a view of the wheel. Right outside of the hotel is a strip that has awesome food and bars, a daiquiri place literally right outside. There is also a few liquor stores that surround the hotel if y'all want to save money and make your own drinks. I don't think we paid more than 30 for Uber there from the airport. And even though the lines look long at the counter desk to check in, they move fast. If you go to the pool, opened from 9-5 by the way, seats are very limited and the drinks start at 17 and 42 for a pitcher; it is cheaper to get the pitcher and splitting it with people."
