b"Oh yes - yes and yes. Come for the banana walnut muffin (even if you don't think you'd like that) and stay for probably anything else. Maybe a 4 egg omelette or scramble or somesuch? Really, just wading through the menu is almost enough entertainment by itself. It just boils down to the simple question: What do you want?!I almost got several other things, but took a little coaching from our very capable server and opted for the Crazy Chicken Omelette. There's guac and mushrooms and sliced chicken breast inside, with jack cheese on top. I went easy on the cheese, asked and got a side of jalape\xc3\xb1os, and was in heaven. Very satisfying and not too heavy. I asked for the sour cream on the side; no problem. And with many of the entrees, like this one, you're guaranteed to get the seasoned potatoes -- which may seem a little too perfectly symmetrical to fully trust, but dang, they're good. Not too spicy nor salty, but still with a pleasant kick.This location is plenty big, but doesn't feel like a barn. You may wait a minute or two for a table - but generally, it's looks like they're very accommodating and will make things work pretty quickly. The kids menu is crazy reasonable, and for the grown-ups, it's not bad, either. Lots to try, lots to enjoy (the pancakes look great; and the taste from one of our's Denver was outstanding). Really, I think you'd be cool with just about anything here. Even the coffee is above expectations -- it's fresh with a good simple flavor."
