b"All in all a solid burger joint and i can see why this place gets rave reviews.  I ordered the Guacamole Burger with Sweet Potato fries - both were extremely good.  The burger was cooked just right and had tons of flavor.  The Guacamole ranked right up there with the best I've had with a nice blend of advocados, shaved red onions, and corn salsa.  The sweet potato fries were really good but there are other places in Charlotte that have better.  I did like the fact that they are hand cut and still had the skin.I don't think this is the best burger joint in Charlotte but it definitely ranks up there.  If I were in the judging business - which I'm not - I would put Kickstand burgers a notch above Bang Bang.  Another edge Kickstand has over Bang Bang is the ambiance.  Bang Bang has more of a fast food feel while Kickstand is more of a sit and stay for a while restaurant."
