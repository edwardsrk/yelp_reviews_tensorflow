b"I do my best to assume positive intent.  I have been to Crave twice. The first experience was less than ideal. Had a 10:30 movie to get to, so I arrived early, 9:45 to order and eat. My friend and I order from a menu that was not complete. Granted the store was less than 14 days old. Ordered the PB&J and when I got it, 20 minutes later, it was the most delicious sandwich I ever had. The peanut butter was sweet as was the raspberry jelly. The powdered sugar was a bit much, but I ordered a sweet entree so that was I got. My friend's order was just as delicious. The fries I ordered were forgotten at the time of delivery. I went back and asked for them. They were ready very quickly.Here is where I now talk about the reconciliation the manager initiated. He asked about the experience and I dodged the question. I really liked the food but the service was not great. He recognized that fact and made no excuses for it. I told him it will get better because he is actively working on it.On the next visit, the service was great. The food was just as delicious and the entire order was correct. The manager and server made sure we were taken care of and had what we needed.Being a new business there are some things they are working on, but don't let those cloud your mind. Yes, the whole experience is critical, but give them a chance. I will be back with even more people."
