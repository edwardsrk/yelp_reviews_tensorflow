b"Stopped in here to try it out one day and loved it. You get to choose a breakfast item and customize it with a bagel of your choice. Orange juice it fresh. You can see the workers work and it's clean. I just didn't like the way my iced coffee was made, maybe because it explained it horribly. However, there is a coffee refill station, so I didn't waste anything there. Bonus is that they sell day old bagels by the dozen for really cheap!"
