b"Canes has been my favorite fast food restaurant since I've moved to Las Vegas. I used to go about 4 times a week; Breakfast( since they open at 930), lunch or dinner. I have slowed down and probably visit twice a week now. I have never written a review but it has always been good quality food and a good amount for a good price. I'm writing one today because the Cashier Kevin, I assume that's his name because it was on the receipt had great customer service from the minute I walked in to when I got food and when I left. The food was great as always. But I just wanted to give the cashier some recognition. Him and the manager on duty (don't know his name but tall guy) were great. Thank you guys keep up the good work!"
