b"I took my car here for it's very first servicing after driving up from Vancouver. The staff were friendly, they stuck by their quote time (around 2 hours) and the waiting area was spacious and comfortable! They even had a complimentary massage chair, which was amazing. I'd suggest booking a couple weeks in advance, since I couldn't get the weekend slot I wanted as they were pretty booked up - but now I can see why!"
