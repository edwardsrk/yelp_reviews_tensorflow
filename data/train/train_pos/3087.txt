b"Courtney is the best waxer I've ever had! I've been getting waxed for over a decade, and she's the only esthetician that I didn't have a reaction afterward. I think it has to do with her all-natural approach to her wax and products. She's gentle, super nice, and her salon is very clean. I'd highly recommend her!"
