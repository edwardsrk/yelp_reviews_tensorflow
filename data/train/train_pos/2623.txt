b'Yogis grill was pretty good overall and I was impressed by the variety of menu offerings.  I ordered two rolls and both were good size and fairly priced.  They have kids meals that provide large servings.  The udon soup looked good as well and was served in a large bowl with plenty of meat and noodles.  Seating was okay and the service was very fast.  I would definitely go back again.'
