b"I have to admit I am quite a fan of Nam's Noodles, so a part of me hopes to bump up their star-rating by writing this review. I know, I know, they serve up dishes from so many different parts of Asia, I wouldn't know how to classify Nam's other than Asian Fusion, and they really live up to that name. I have been a regular since a couple of years back, where a co-worker and I would go every week before our night meetings for dinner. We have tried every item on the chef's recommendation list. They used to offer complimentary soup and dessert with every meal, I wish they still have that now. I remember the soup made for a great appetizer and till this day I still miss some of the desserts they make. I don't think any of that are on the regular menu so that's sad.On that what's good currently! They started with Belly Program, you get 5 points per visit, so it's pretty easy to get enough for a free beer or bubble tea (remember to let them know to reduce sugar levels you are not a huge fan of sweet drinks) using Belly Points. Nam's is another wonderful place on campus for noodles and congee. If you are looking for pho downtown, you can go to Nam's. If you're looking for Korean food downtown, you can go to Nam's. Nam's is a good place to go if you and your dining company are looking for different asian varieties. As for me I love their congee. It's only $5.50 for a huge bowl. Avocado bubble tea is also one of my favs! They make it using real avocado!! For appetizers I especially love the lemon grass chicken wings. Plus I like the fact that I get to just walk down on a day I have 1.5 - 2 hours to spare for a leisurely long lunch =) Do note that they get busy during lunch hours, but you can always call ahead if you're just getting something to go."
