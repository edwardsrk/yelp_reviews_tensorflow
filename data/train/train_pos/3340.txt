b"I'm really pleased with this salon. For the past few years, I've been trying to find a salon that will actually provide me with what I ask for and what looks best on me. I tend to also look for inexpensive salons, which never really satisfy me, even if the prices were much more affordable in the end.  I went to Parlour for the first time last summer. I booked it online (which is super convenient!) and booked myself with Martha, as reviews stated she works really well with curly hair. I showed her pictures of what I wanted and she did a great job! She gave me a long bob that worked well with my wavy/curly hair. I returned back in November to do more layers and to cut my bangs, and Martha did a great job once again. Wanting to go blonde for the longest time, I booked an appointment with Aimee this past December. I showed Aimee what I wanted, which was a blonde balayage, and she was really receptive to this and provided good feedback on what would work best with my hair. My hair didn't turn out as blonde as I wanted because it would have been too damaging, but it did look good and very healthy! We agreed to return in a few months to add more blonde highlights to it. I returned today and she did a fantastic job. It's the perfect shade of blonde mixed in with other shades, just what I wanted. Based on my experiences, I've paid $60+ for my haircut and $175+ for my hair colour. This is more than I've paid for in the past, but it's also very reasonable and well worth it. The staff are not only talented but are incredibly nice and easy to talk to. I know that I will for sure be a long time customer at this salon."
