b"Maria is VERY good at what she does with great prices, too! I've always had a hard time finding someone to fix my jeans just right and she did it! I'm short with a small waist and a bit of a butt :) So that means every pair of jean I get have to be altered.  And Maria does a wonderful job with reasonable prices.  She's done more than10 pairs of jeans and a few shirts and only one needed fixing.  I even lost weight and had to get a pair redone, it was a bit of a challenge but she did a beautiful job."
