b"I come to Dolce pretty much every time I'm eating on the Danforth. There's lots of seating and it's usually clean. Plenty of flavors to choose from. My new favourite is their blueberry - so fresh! I always see the same guy working there. Gelato is pretty pricey these days and this place goes for average price. You can buy take home containers starting at $12 but you can't eat it there."
