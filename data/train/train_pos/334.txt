b'The flamingo is one of the older casinos but it is right on the strip the pool was nice the staff was friendly. The room was fine it showed s little wear and tear.What they need to improve Check in was a nightmare almost 2 hours of waiting in line that is not good customer service. The parking lot is a joke they share a building with hertz and valet so not much space left we parked on the roof #7 the elevator stops on #6 so u need lug your stuff down the stairs. But it is right in the middle of strip so the location is the major plus. We walked or rode the bus (8$all day)'
