b"I love the atmosphere of Amelie's. This location is very spacious with plenty of seating. The coffee selection of coffee, teas, desserts, food and wine. The staff with friendly and the service is fast. This is a great place to study, have a meeting, or meeting up with friends.I had the pecan tart and it was good. My friend had the peach tart, it was okay but it would've been better if it was warmed up.My friend devoured the peach tart lolThe Cafe Marcotter was delicious with the perfect amount of vanilla and caramel. It had a cute little spider web on top of the cup. I will definitely have to get it again."
