b"Mad greens is just a great, healthy alternative to the normal fast food fare.  It's fast but healthy.  I can only comment on the Ty Cobb salad because i love it so much, it's the only thing I ever order there.  My daughters like it as well and the only reason for 4-star in that they do not have ketchup.  Now, why would I want ketchup you may ask?   Simple, my younger daughter gets their grilled cheese and likes to dip it in ketchup.  I'd give a 4 1/2  if I could.  This location and the others are all good got service too.  I highly recommend them."
