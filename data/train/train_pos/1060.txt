b"Had a very good experience here. Next to great. A small quaint restaurant with maybe 12 tables. The food was outstanding and the young lady that served us was great.The only thing I would have liked mote was a bit more variety perhaps... and the only reason I could use more variety was because the food is so good I'd like to come back for more, but to eat something different. Most of the entrees on the menu contain familiars such as quesadilla, burrito, fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, and a few more classic Mexican entrees. All in all, great place, really good food and a very traditional feel.Would highly recommend it."
