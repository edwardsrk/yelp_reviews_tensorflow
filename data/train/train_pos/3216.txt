b"Outstanding food for a decent price.  You can get a good bottle of wine for $30 to $40.  Try doing that at Maestro's.   Lots of compliments from other Yelpers on the cornbread, but it's a little too heavy for my taste.  My favorite dishes are:  artichoke heart as an appetizer is unreal.  Best ribs I've ever had and I lived in Texas for 6 years.  Great filet.  Great prime rib dip sandwich."
