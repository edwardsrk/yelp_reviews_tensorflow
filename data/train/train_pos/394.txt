b"I am usually skeptical about public pools, but Cactus is always clean, well managed, and with a friendly staff! The front desk is especially great. The people working there were clearly trained well and are approachable enough for me to go with them for any question at all. The locker rooms have quite a bit of space, and the showers are relatively clean (as public showers go); in the summer time, there's no better place to be. Do recommend the pool, especially if you go for one of their fitness classes!"
