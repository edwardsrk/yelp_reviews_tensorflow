b"I had a durian mille crepe cake and the raindrop coffee. The coffee was delicious and the setup for the cotton candy was really cute! The durian crepe cake had a decent durian flavour but I would have liked it to have a stronger taste to it since I am a huge fan of durian anything. A little less cream would have been better as well.The store itself was pretty cute too! Service could have been faster since it was a slow night but it's ok if you're just catching up with some friends."
