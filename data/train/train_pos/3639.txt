b'My girlfriends and I came to visit Toronto and we were staying in Greek town. We decided to eat after a day of travel into town from Chicago and this place was among some of the best food we have ever eaten. We shared the spicy feta stuffed peppers which the lovely waitress recommended to eat with a drizzle of olive oil and it was divine. We had the gyro plate which was unlike American gyros with pita, but instead was served with a fresh Greek salad and lemon potatoes. We also got the lamb dinner special which literally fell off the bone because it was so tender. And we also got a sort of Greek lasagna with a rich white bechamel sauce. The service was super friendly and very attentive. We got to see the kitchen and saw everything that the chef prepared for the days specials which only made our mouths water more than they already were. Prices were very affordable as well. We left with an incredible impression and longing to take this incredible family owned business home with us.'
