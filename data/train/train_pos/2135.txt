b"We hosted a group meet here for 11 friends at a birthday celebration. The staff was accommodating and very attentive. All the different dishes we tried were all great. Of course I tried the famous Beef Tips and was impressed, not your average bar fare. This place is great, if you're ever in the South part of town, worth the stop."
