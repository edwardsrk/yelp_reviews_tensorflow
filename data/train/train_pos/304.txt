b'This was my third trip to GHT. I\'d put GHT in the category of "Very Good" restaurants.  I enjoy the food and beverages, but they\'re not mind blowing / life changing.  Even the more challenging dining options are just on the tip of being amazing, but it\'s just not quite there.  I\'m still very big on GHT. It\'s a place that must be visited. I\'m continually impressed by the smaller plates over the mains.  Things like the Brussels Sprouts, confit wings,  and  Animal Frites are really solid and flavorful. My favorite visit has included the rooftop bar, (on those few sunny Cleveland summer days), with drafts and some of the best fried chicken in Cleveland.'
