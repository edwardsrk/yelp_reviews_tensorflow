b"Great selection of Four Peaks brews along with guest ones.  The pumpkin porter was excellent. I'm not a great fan of beer, but this one I finished.  The quesadilla was crisp and not soggy.  Try it with chicken.  My dining partner had the salmon BLT and it was very good.  Huge place with friendly staff and a fine variety of beers."
