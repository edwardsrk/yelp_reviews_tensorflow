b"My favorite (sentimental) ice cream spot in all of Arizona! $4.95 for two big scoops of ice cream, chocolate sauce, malt crumbs, whipped cream, and a cherry? The Dusty Road Sundae is terrrrrific. The average sundae is $6.50, but that's a steal compared to other places.They have about 10 traditional-ish ice cream flavors, the prices are reasonable, the storefront is classic, the interior is huge with comfy booths, and there is a small-ish arcade in the back. Only a 10-minute walk from Scottsdale Stadium into Old Town Scottsdale.If you're reviewing this place based on the food, you're missing the entire point of the Sugar Bowl. It's a 1950s ice cream parlor, not a modern ice cream store with fancy new flavors."
