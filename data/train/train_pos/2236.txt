b"My second visit here WOWed me. I came here for Mothers Day - 5:30 pm - made reservations day before and they squeezed us in. Lady over the phone was accommodating. I don't know why but the second experience here was soooo much better. The sashimi is still fresh and good. So are the handrolls. I super love their california hand rolls and I don't usually get hand rolls.Their hot items are all great. Except the garlic sirloin, this time it was chewy and slightly over cooked. But wow, item after item, (we ordered about 1/2 of the items on the grill / hot items list) and it was consistently deliciousness after  deliciousness! Service is fast at the beginning and slow near the end. Go figure. This is typical though so order more in your first round! Don't forget the assortment of dessert! Get one of each! You can do it! I also found out their AYCE is a couple bucks cheaper than some competitors in the area. That works for me! I'm a new fan. (minus salmon Belly and all... :)"
