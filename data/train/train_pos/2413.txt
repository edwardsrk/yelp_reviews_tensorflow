b"Had my first meal at Under the Table last night and it most certainly won't be my last.  I had a fish combo - salmon, shrimp and halibut (I think).  It came in a delicious dill sauce with garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus and carmelized onion.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the dill sauce was so delicious I had to scoop up every bit.  My friends ordered funnel cake for dessert and I had chocolate brownie with ice cream and caramel sauce.  Wow - the brownie was so good and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  My friends couldn't manage all the funnel cake so gave me a bit (never had it before).  I will be having that next time.Bottom line, the owners are lovely and very friendly.  The atmosphere feels like your home with a group of friends and the food is really delicious.  The prices are very fair and I can't wait to go back and try the oxtail!"
