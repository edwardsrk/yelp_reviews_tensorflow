b"When I'm missing that island  feel and having cravings.  Aloha kitchen opened up a few months ago a few blocks from my house.  When I'm craving a musubi I go for the Aloha plate!  It comes with not just one! But two!  YES!! Two!!! 1 and 2!!! Musubi's!  And if that's not enough rice for you it also comes with a scoop of rice, Mac salad, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef.  I think the teriyaki sauce is a bit much so I order it on the side.  I don't like my meat swimming in teriyaki sauce.  I enjoy dining because they play the best island music."
