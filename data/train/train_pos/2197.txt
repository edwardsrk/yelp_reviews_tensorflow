b"Ever have one of those nights where you walk into a place that looks like it's either closed or no good and be totally surprised? That was my experience at Rocco's.  This place really looks like a hole in a strip mall. The busy dining space is hard to see when you walk in. You will slowly take in all this place has to offer (a freezer filled with gelatio, ice cream, sauces, desserts; stacks of pasta and canned Italian goods; an amazing menu of pizza, pasta and more. I got their calzone-like item. It was filled with broccoli and very yummy with their Marinara; though I wanted more cheese and garlic in it!  Can't wait to try more here!"
