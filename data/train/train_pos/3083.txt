b"My dog nips at men so I was terrified of having a man groom.  But she sheds a lot so my fianc\xc3\xa9 made the appointment and I'm glad he did.  First off, the prices are a steal.  Secondly, the man who groomed her was amazing he was super nice and my dog was calm with him.  My chihuahua/terrier usually has a lot of anxiety around people and she was nervous at first but didn't bite and by the time I came back she was really calm.  We came in to get her trimmed so she wouldn't shed so much over the summer and he did a really good job.  I will definitely be back!"
