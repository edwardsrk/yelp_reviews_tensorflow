b'Take two on my review, as apparently the first disappeared.  We stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon. No one was there.  They had an all day happy hour, and great lunch specials.  Mexican bento is the greatest idea I have seen in awhile. The food was fresh and fast.  Open air concept does attract the flies, with all the sweet liquor bottles and fragrant foods.  We enjoyed a nice lunch, few drinks and moved on to the local shops nearby.  Great location. I can see why Salty Senorita is so popular. This could definitely be a place I would like to hang out if we lived in AZ again.  Waitress brought my husband a birthday dessert with a candle.'
