b"First I know lots of people do pools around Vegas but we search all around town for a pool builder we met with about 6 different builders. Keep in mind we went to California Pools first waited a year and realized that Danny was our guy from the moment we met him it was top costumer service first and that's what brought us back everyone else just wanted our Money. At California pool there are no pushy sales talk Danny just wanted to make sure that we are happy with our choose. My neighbors are putting in a pool and started 7 weeks before us and we are already done. So not only quality pool but it was fast. Only took 7 weeks from when they broke ground. Keith was our on site manager and he was awesome very communicative on what's going on what's coming up next. I would recommend CALIFORNIA POOLS do t go anywhere else they are professional at what they do. Don't fall for a company who does Landscapping and think they can do pools we almost did that and thank god we didn't. Thank you to all the California Pool people and Danny and Keith for all you help!"
