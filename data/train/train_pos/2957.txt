b'Almost every time I come to Vegas I stay here because its perfect for what I\'m looking for in my Vegas adventure. I come here to get outside and enjoy myself or go gambling until 9am without having to sell a kidney and I get all of that here. Now let me also say, I\'m a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I\'m not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of "you get what you pay for" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH. I\'m not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol. Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don\'t care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let\'s hope not!)The room itself was very comfortable and didn\'t make me feel cheap. Now I understand this place isn\'t flashy like other hotels but I don\'t spend most of my time in my room, that\'s not why you come to Vegas! But when I am done with my daily adventure or need to rejuvenate I want to feel that I\'m lying on clean sheets, the room is comfortable and I can relax. Each and every time it I was completely satisfied. Soooooo, try it out! It\'s very inexpensive and there are all kinds of ways to get deals on this place. Hotwire, Hotels.com, sign up on their email list and immediately get 30% off, sign up on their mobile line and get another deal. I\'ve even seen offers on Hotel Tonight. DEALS, DEALS, DEALS....I like that too. Happy Vegas Adventures!'
