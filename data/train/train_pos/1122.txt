b"If you know anyone that speaks Spanish, invite them to come with you. The staff maybe spoke a few words of conversational English..I'm certainly not complaining, just want to give others fair warning. Despite the language barrier, I would definitely return. The prices are incredibly reasonable, especially the lunch specials. The food is authentic, and comes out pretty quickly."
