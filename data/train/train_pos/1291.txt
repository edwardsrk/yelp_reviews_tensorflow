b'This place just recently open in my neighbourhood. The inside of the restaurant had a nice sitting area, small but clean. I had as take out. I got my family 2 chicken dinner and pork dinner and a chicken on pita. The chicken is so flavourful! The rice was well season as well. Overall it taste really good, I would def come back if I was craving for this.'
