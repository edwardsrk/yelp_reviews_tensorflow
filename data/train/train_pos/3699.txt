b"Delicious. Found out about it from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It is none of those, but it was fantastic! On the trip through Cleveland we decided to stop here. Unfortunately, it didn't open until 5pm, so we waited four hours for dinner. It was well worth the wait. We sat outside on the large patio, it was a beautiful day in Cleveland (yes, it happens). The service was very good and helpful with what to order and how large the portions are. The machaca, coffee and ancho braised beef was amazing!!! Also, enjoyed the goat cheese guac and chips. The camerones (shrimp in a garlic wine sauce) was delicious. Dessert was fried ice cream. It was fantastic. More than enough for two people and very satisfying. The machaca and fried ice cream are must orders when in Cleveland."
