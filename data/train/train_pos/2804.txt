b"Since we stayed at Aria we wanted to try restaurants the hotel had to offer. Being from Chicago we know about good pizza. The first time there we ordered a meat ball sandwich and wings. I was a little disappointed they didn't have bbq wings and there beer selection was pretty weak. The wings were ok the meatball sandwich was good. The second time there we ordered pizza. The pizza was really good and server Sheryl was great! We left that place with a smile. For good pizza check this place out."
