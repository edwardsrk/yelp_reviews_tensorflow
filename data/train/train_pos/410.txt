b"I love the sandwiches at Which Wich and the ingredients really taste like they use some of the best.  Milkshakes are also a step above and always delicious.  The thing that gets me about this location is that they close fairly early.  I know this isn't NYC or anything, but it seems any restaurant around here should regularly be open until at least 9PM."
