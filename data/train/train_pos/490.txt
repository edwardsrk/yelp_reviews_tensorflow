b'With so may good places to eat in Vegas our dinners were booked, so to sneak in Bouchon we went there for brunch. I ordered the Croque Madame, toasted ham and cheese on brioche topped with a fried egg and mornay sauce.  The sandwich was just as you\'d imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  The mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  The egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.It also came with pommes frites, or in english, "french fries", and a whole mound of them!  So much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   They were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  After all who makes French fries better than the French?  Well maybe McDonnalds... Wait, did i just compare Bouchon to McDonnalds?  Anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.We also ordered french beignets.  I was expecting something like the beignets in New Orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  These were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  Although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut I\'ve ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  I would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, "your doughnuts."  Let\'s get one thing straight here, I\'d gladly pay $8 for 3 french beignets, but NOT for 3 doughnuts!  Pros:  Great bakery items especially the Croissant, Tons of delicious french fries, delicious meals with great sauces. Cons: Beignets are okay but not the type you find in New Orleans, definitely not worth $8 for 3 the size of "Hostess Donettes".   Advice:  There is a embosser next to the entrance with some pieces of thick card stock.  you can emboss the bouchon name in it for a keep sake.  not sure if you\'re supposed to do it or what it\'s for but i did, and now use it as my bookmark.'
