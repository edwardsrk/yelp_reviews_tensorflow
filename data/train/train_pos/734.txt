b'I ordered 2 xl pizzas, the Mama Mia and the grilled garlic chicken. They were incredible. I ordered them earlier in the morning to be ready at 11:30 for lunch. When I walked in a few minutes before 11:30 they were just coming out of the oven. They were hot and fresh. Great service. Everyone on my crew loved the pizza. I will definitely be back'
