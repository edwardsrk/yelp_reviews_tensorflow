b"The service was outstanding! The lady that helped us was absolutely wonderful, patient and so helpful. The inside is pretty cool too, I like the giant map on the side wall. Hooray they have Eegee's--this will be awesome during the summer. The poutine was good but not my favorite. The portions they offer are huge, so be prepared for leftovers (although leftover poutine might be a little soggy). All in all my first visit was a positive one! I'll have to come back and try a bold flavor next time!"
