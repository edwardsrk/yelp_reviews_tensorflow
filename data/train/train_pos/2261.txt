b"I have visited Metro a few times now, and I will undoubtedly keep going! No matter come for a Sunday brunch or a dinner night, this is always one of my top choices in old town. The food was never disappointed, and service was great!We like to seat in the patio, enjoy the delicious food while enjoy the sunshine and/or the live music. I have tried many dishes here, my favorite is the Steak Frites (steak and fries), the steak is cut to strips, juicy and tender,the portion of the fries is huge and really good!!! The escargots are just okay, they are baked in a plate that are mixed with mushrooms, beans, celery roots and ham, not like the other ones I had were baked individually into a plate with small holes (or whatever that called...) And for dessert, the Beignet is AMAZING! They are little doughnuts come with three kinds dipping sauce, vanilla bean, nutella, and raspberry. This is definitely a must-try dessert for anyone! Can't wait for my next visit!"
