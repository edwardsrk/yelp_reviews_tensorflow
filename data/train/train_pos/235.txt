b"Love shake shack.  Came here the first day they opened and have been coming back since. To reviewers complaining about having to wait....you're lucky it's only an hour. Some locations are way more.  Also those complaining about costs, you're getting SOMETHING BETTER THAN MCDONALDS. Seriously.  Get the shack burger.   Skip the new bacon shackburger.  Any of the shakes are great.  Strawberry is my fave."
