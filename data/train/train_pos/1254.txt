b"There was a 45 minute wait time on a Friday evening, but we got our table as promised. The menu was an interesting mix of authentic Mexican food and Mexican burgers. We went for the usuals, tacos, Fajitas and the burger. Our waitress was extremely friendly and provided us a great hospitality. There are hardly few waitresses who would care for your well being, she was one of them. Forgot to get her name. The chips and salsa were not the best but medium sized and okay. The food came in without much delay. I got the El Diablo burger and it was a killer! Double patty and super spicy! I tried but couldn't complete the whole burger in one sitting. Overall we had a good experience. And for an upscale restaurant that looked really fashionable it wasn't that expensive. 30 to 40$ for food and drinks for two! Great deal I would say. If you wouldn't mind the wait time, I say check it out!"
