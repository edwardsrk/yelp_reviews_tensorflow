b"Huge fan of this place! Surprised at the meager Yelp rating.I come here for weekday lunches on a regular basis...I've had the rare beef pho, the grilled beef on vermicelli noodles with a spring roll, the sweet and sour chicken and the chicken satay....and all are super-duper tasty! The space itself is clean and airy, the service is friendly, and the food typically comes out quick.Well done, Phomono! I'll be back pho sho."
