b"Ahhhhhhh this place is sushi heaven!!!!!!! Sadly If I could review sushi alone, this place would be 5 stars but I'm keeping one star because service was ridiculous. I came in with a good friend and my FH. The place was pretty packed with about two tables open. We were told it would be a wait and a party that came after us was seated before us. I think they stepped out and we're waiting as well. There was still one table available but the wait staff were quite busy and sat us almost 25 minutes later at the open table that was available the entire time. \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf It took a few minutes to get water and menus and all three of us were going for AYCE sushi. I'd say every roll we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. They were out of salmon kama and oysters which was a bummer. My favorite was the little tease roll, it had spicy tuna and cucumber inside and was topped with Cajun tuna, deep fried onion and jalape\xc3\xb1o with spicy mayo, garlic ponzu and eel sauce. So effing delicious! My boyfriend had almost every nigiri on the menu and he was impressed with the rice to fish ratio, big portion of fish to rice! Nice! All the rolls were not stuffed with rice and we really did some damage and were not stuffed quickly as they give good portion of rice to fish in all their rolls. Service was lacking. We had to ask many times for water and had to fall down our waiters to order more rolls. Even though service was pretty bad I would still come back because the sushi was that amazing.We definitely didn't browse the menu as much as we should have and next time I will be ordering the things is skipped out on my first visit here because I will definitely be back!!!"
