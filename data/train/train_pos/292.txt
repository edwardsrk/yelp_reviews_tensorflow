b'This place really does it right. They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic: burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides. But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding. I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street (also a great burger). Highly recommended!'
