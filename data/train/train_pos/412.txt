b'Great spot off the beaten path. Cool decor-great bathrooms if thats important to you to. The draft beer selection is 12 deep-but decent cause you can mix a few of em together. Bottle selection is average-could really step dat shit up. But overall a solid damn spot. The mixed drink menu-forget what its called but #1 is amazing. I wanna drink it till i black out and wake up in a gutter...its that good. The mint and fruit hide the bourbon and you just consume...and consume...and.....anyway support your local joint and give it a shot!'
