b"Wow, what a great place to grab a light lunch! Jacob and Troy prepared an asparagus appetizer for my sister and I while we waited for our food, and served with homemade ranch! Very small bistro, unexpectedly located in Monogram's salon, but very well kept and clean. The asparagus was impeccable and delicious.I ordered the Caesar sandwich. Chicken was tender and juicy and sandwich had the perfect cheese to chicken ratio. Homemade pesto was a great addition to the meal. Everything was made fresh and Jacob really knows his stuff!"
