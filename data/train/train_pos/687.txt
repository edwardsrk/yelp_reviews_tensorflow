b"Visiting from CA & arrived at the hotel on a sunday night (yesterday). I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich & jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers for delivery. The food took a while & when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost & went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back & the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt & I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious."
