b"I stayed here for four nights on business and it's definitely one of the nicer hotels I've visited.  The staff, especially the concierge, Nick, were fantastic: always willing to help, offering free shuttles, knowledge of the area and things to do after work.  The room bore a pleasant ambiance, not killing you with fluorescent lighting, and contained ample outlets for whatever I needed to charge at night.  There's not much more you can ask from a hotel."
