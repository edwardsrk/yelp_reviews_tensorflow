b"I'm sooo surprised to read all this negative comments and star rating of this place.  A couple of my friends and I were around the area and wanted to grab a quick bite before we went to explore hard rock!Our first impressions when we walked in was that the place was really  clean, they had jukeboxes and it was playing 50's music.I ordered their regular hamburger as well as an Oreo shake, which was recommended by our server.Our food arrived in about five minutes and wow, this is not your average hamburger!!!!!It was delicious! The shake was thick and well worth the money. I only wished the hamburgers would come with fries as they were all separate but considering how yummy everything tasted it doesn't matter! The manager was in fact the person who served our food, she was very nice and had a Russian accent. She was nice enough to even split our checks 3 ways after we got the receipt and told her we forgot to mention separate receipts.If I am ever around the area I would def come back."
