b"This is by far one of the most amazing places for fried chicken and waffles. They offer the fried chicken in 2 varieties: original and hot. I chose the original and it was tasty and not oily at all. The waffles were fresh and soft. I also ordered birthday cake super shake and it was nice but nothing extraordinary though it had colour sprinkles. The place is tiny and have an outdoor patio as well. I went on a Friday evening around 7 and waited about 15-18 mins to get a place for 2 since I didn't want to sit on the patio. There were only 2 servers and they were friendly and didn't bother us constantly unlike someplace where they want you to eat and leave. Even though all the tables were taken, they didn't mind us sitting after we were done our meals. This could be due the fact the kitchen had closed and were getting ready to close. Overall, I enjoyed my time at this place and will visit again in summer to enjoy the patio."
