b"Tried this place for the first time yesterday.  I was thoroughly impressed! The BBQ is delicious and the food to price ratio is a hungry persons dream.  The $37 platter for two (3 meats, 3 sides) was delicious and beyond filling.  Highlights were the brisket and cornbread.  Weakest link were the ribs.A lot of people say the music is too loud.  It is loud, but I found it to be on par with other bars.  I guess I wouldn't recommend this place as somewhere to go have a meaningful conversation.  Maybe it's restaurant loud, but it's not bar loud.The cocktail menu is also impressive and has some really unique (ie smoked) options.  Sure, they're a bit pricy ($10-$12), but they're 2oz and the relatively low price of the food offsets it."
