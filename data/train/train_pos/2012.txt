b"Its been a while since I've been to this store, but I do love the stuff they carry. A dollar buys you a lifetime pass. Like the other reviews, parking...park on the same side as the store or else you'll be dodging cars. This place isn't cheap, they charge quite a bit for their merchandise. I think I bought a top and it cost me $40? (it was too cute to pass up!)If you're bored and have a few hours to kill and like retro/nostalgia feel, browse here for a bit.oh yeah, don't forget to bring a lot of quarters for the parking meters too!"
