b'I went to their pizza "rodizio" yesterday, which is happening every Thursday of this month. For those who still don\'t know what a rodizio is, I\'m saving you a Google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you\'re full or you explode, whatever happens first.I was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn\'t try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all.The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The "Portuguese" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.Please, go ahead and make your reservation. You won\'t be sorry.'
