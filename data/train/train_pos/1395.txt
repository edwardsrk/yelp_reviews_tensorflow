b"This is a store for girls who love glam! I discovered this store a couple of years ago after their storefront attracted me with manikins dolled up in pretty dresses and shiny scarves. The store looked really fancy from the outside so I thought perhaps the prices would be high until I noticed the tags on the manikins clothes saying, $29.99; so I walked in!This store is small, narrow, cramped but really pretty looking- black walls, slightly dimmed lights and chandeliers. The people working there are extremely kind and helpful and give you all the time in the world to browse. The guy working there told me that their merchandise is flown in from Paris. The best part? Everything in the store is $29.99 with the exception of shoes and jewellery! They have beautiful tunics, shirts, dresses, jackets, jeggings, purses, shoes, jewellery, wallets, scarves, sweaters, skirts and so much more. The clothing is super girly, comfortable and beautiful looking. I own a lot of clothes from this store and I receive many compliments! Also, the quality is great; none of my clothes have ripped or worn out looking even after a couple of years.The only downfall about this store is that they don't always have plenty of different sizes, and it's cramped in the store, which makes it a tad bit uncomfortable if more people are in the store."
