b'I actually like Pittsburgh Rare. I went with a couple of friends one evening for a good dinner before we left for our summer break/internships our junior year. The restaurant is really big and is located in the Sheraton. When you first order, they bring over a plate of raw meat and describe each piece on it and tell you what you\'re looking at and how they cook it. It\'s actually really cool. I ended up getting a nice 20 oz porterhouse with a side of sauteed spinach. Another got the pork chops while the other 2 got the New York strip.For appetizers, I got the French Onion Soup. Oh. This restaurant has a special way to cook the meat if you want to try something new. It\'s called Pittsburgh Rare where the meat is "flash seared and charred on the outside and blood red on the inside." It\'s actually not very hot in the middle. Since the restaurant is named Pittsburgh Rare, I figured, why not, give it a shot. It was suprisingly not bad at all. The french onion soup was delicious. The way a french onion soup should  be tasted and the creamed spinach was very good. The total tab was about $100 / person because we also got desert and 2 bottles of wine.'
