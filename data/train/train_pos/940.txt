b"Overall very good.   I've been a few times now (2 drive through,  1 dined in)  and the food has been tasty.   I've only gone with the salads and I've enjoyed them all.   Get them with the side of bread as all their breads are very good.   The baked goods and desserts are amazing. My main selling point: it has a drive through.   My Greek Corner was my go to place for to go food that wasn't fast food.   This place is a good replacement.   Now that they have been open a few weeks,  the service has smoothed out and the lines are shorter.   I will admit that the Xmas trees in early October is just weird."
