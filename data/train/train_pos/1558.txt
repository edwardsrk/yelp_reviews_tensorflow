b'One of the best restaurants in town. We came here for our anniversary & every member of management came to our table to express the congrats. Beautiful atmosphere. Great wine & beer list. Food: very good. We had the calamari appetizer which was pretty good. My husband had a salad which was so big that he shared it with me (fresh spring lettuce with Gorgonzola). He had the blackened Ribeye and loved it (and is super picky). I had the sashimi tuna. It was ok; had better in other places. We had the chocolate mousse cake (really good!) & the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e (was good, not great). Valet parking was the way to go! We will return! Awesome place. Top brass in pleasing their customers!'
