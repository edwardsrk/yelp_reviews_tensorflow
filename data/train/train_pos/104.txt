b'Montreal bagels were well worth the experience even in the pouring rain. There were bagel samples galore in this tiny space. I scored a caraway (cumin) and sesame bagel. I heard that the sesame bagels came out hot which was the closest thing to toasted they offered. Anyway, I really enjoyed their flavor and texture. I would agree they are superior to our Denver bagels.'
