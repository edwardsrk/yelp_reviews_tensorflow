b"4.5 stars because of the great service and the rolls/sushi made with minimal rice. Each piece of roll was not that big so it makes it easier to try more variety of rolls. We had a large party of 10 + 2 kids and they gave us the room to the front that was walled off to the side. That accommodated us perfectly! It was Friday night too at 7pm and we were seated pretty much right away! The waitress- Raynee?- was very sweet and attentive to us. She even offered to split the check into two separate ones to make it easier for us. They also didn't make a big deal about several people in the party not getting the AYCE but only getting a teriyaki plate. There were so many rolls to choose from. Yeah, the sushi was not the freshest I've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and I like the small cuts so it's not too filling. The skewers were really small and I think it was limited to one piece per. There were also a few other items on the menu which are limited to one per person. Next time I'm visiting Vegas, I'd return with several people again so we can try a more variety of rolls!"
