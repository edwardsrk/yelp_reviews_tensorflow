b'All reviews are based on price point....Needed a long walk in the early evening to brush off the long, hard days in the office.  Ended up here because we have been eating large, expensive dinners and this place was a lunch choice on another visit and we enjoyed our food.A bowl of well made potatoe soup and a plate of pasta, shrimp, lemon, and spinach was the choices.  The soup was very good, hot, and pureed vs lumpy, sometime cheesy, potatoe soup. The pasta fish was very well made.  I was clear to the preparer that less dressing is nearly always better and she deftly made the sauce just to the right proportion.I am not sure if you can beat the prices in the downtown, make that uptown, area.Kinda Italian semi fast food that is well prepared.  A good combination!'
