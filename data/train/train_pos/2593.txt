b'Trufusion is great... The instructors are great, the staff is great, but membership rates seem to keep elevating. I really hope they are raising prices to invest in a new studio for us here in Henderson because that is my only complaint: the rates and of course the inevitable: which is the amount of people and how packed some classes get. The workouts are very intense but you can still go at your own pace. I love this place but I would love it even more if rates would stop raising and if somehow classes were to be limited to a smaller amount of people or the owners open a new location. (Close to impossible.) I know this is asking for a lot but those are the only two recommendations I have. Other than that, this place is great.'
