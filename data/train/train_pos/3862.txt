b'Dry-Aged New York Steak & Roasted Rack of Lamb (9/10)After hearing the rumors and reviews of being one of the top steak houses, i came out to try this aged steak. It was beautifully refrigerated on display outside the stop. Just by looking at it, I started to salivate. I must say the steak lived up to my expectation, the picture cannot do it justice. The tenderness of the meat was perfect with being too overcooked. Getting medium-rare sab f meat had its own unique taste which complimented the seasoning really well. Each bit was like getting a massage on my palate by the juice that sprayed out. It was quite MOOving if I may say. The lamb rack was less spectacular as it was just average with a bit of tenderness in the middle but the outsides were a bit hard, probably because it was ordered as medium (who even does that). Definitely would recommend this place as a stop after making some money from the casino.'
