b"Beautiful views of the lake, sat outside it was nice and relaxing the service was very slow. Ordered the chicken and waffles which were the highlight it was so awesome!!! The eggs Benedict on the other hand needs help. The salmon was extremely salty!!! But I was starving and I wasn't going to wait for another dish. Overall I would go again and try other things on the menu."
