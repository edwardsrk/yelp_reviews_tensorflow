b'Stopped by here to grab lunch with some colleagues and it was awesome! The patio area outdoors is just delightful and cozy and it was a perfect day to eat outside. I ordered the Reuben Feffer (I think) which was an organic brown rice bowl with lettuce, black beans, cheese, and steak. It was delicious... I loved it. I would definitely come back and have it again. Great spot for lunch!'
