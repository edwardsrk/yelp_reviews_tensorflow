b'would be 5 stars but am limited on when I can go as the lines are always out the door, and sadly I am handicapped and standing in the line I can not do as they have no seating while waiting :( . The fact though that there is always a line there speaks volumes of how good their food is. I am not a big Hotdog fan myself but their  Hamburgers are excellent cooked over a mesquite wood grill YUM. If there is no line I will stop and grab a Onion Ring they are soooo good its a rare treat because as I said so busy normally, Just had some last week as I went by right as they opened and pulled in so fast I left rubber on the street. If you are looking for great Hotdogs, Hamburgers, Fries (get them with cheese) and Onion rings this is the place to stop long wait but so worth it.If you are handicapped and can not stand to long go when they open it is worth it.'
