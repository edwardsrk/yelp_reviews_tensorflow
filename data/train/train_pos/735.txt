b'I scheduled my 2008 Malibu in for a recall notice I had received back in December 2012. The letter said schedule an appointment after january, so I waited for June.Henderson Chevrolet had just gone through a major facelift and took about a minute to get use to. So I found Larry and Ray, both service advisors I have had an opportunity to trust in years past. I left my car and visited Tom the service manager and then I strolled through the showroom and said hello the Greg in passing as I made my way to the parts counter. I decided to purchase new wiper blades for my Malibu since they only last two months in Las Vegas heat. I asked Larry to toss them in the backseat so I wouldn\'t have to call them around with me. By 9:30 am , the technician "jasperson", was parking my car in the pick up area. I picked up my receipt and keys and went to my car, and the wiper blades were already installed on my car and the windshield was cleaned. A very nice touch for a warranty ticket. Good service overall.'
