b"We didn't really come here by choice, but by necessity. Two hungry and cranky toddlers needed to be fed and we had just arrived from the airport and checked into the hotel. But what a great forced decision it turned out to be. The meal itself was rather expensive, but the food was absolutely delicious. We went family style and ordered the pear and blue cheese salad, crispy calamari, steamed mussels, spaghetti bolgonese, baked lasagna, wild mushroom tortellini, capellini, and one of the specials of the day: salmon with linguine. All ingredients tasted fresh, each pasta was extremely good and noodles were all well cooked. I was especially a fan of my pick of the mushroom tortellini. You could smell the truffle oil and the mushroom sauce was delicious. Service was also top notch. Our server was on top of things, constantly clearing plates, refilling our waters, and bringing new plates or utensils when necessary. I'm now officially a fan of two restaurants inside the M Resort."
