b"Vegan, intimate, delicious, would definitely go back.First time visit yesterday for some take-out dinner. Let me just say, props to the three sweet women who do EVERYTHING at this great little vegan place. They waitress, cook, clean, and smile on top of it all! Understandably it's a great little place to sit down and take a breather or peruse their small selection of sale items while waiting for take out.I ordered a tempeh chickenless salad sandwich, artichoke dip, and chai chocolate drink. My vegan experience has been limited, but I LOVED the sandwich, the dip was good, and the drink was SPOT-ON for a humid day. They had a lot of great looking deserts, a small but diverse menu, and a lot of drink options.The service was as quick as could be expected, those sitting down seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I was patiently tolerated as I tried to figure out what to get.Definitely would go back and would recommend for a friend."
