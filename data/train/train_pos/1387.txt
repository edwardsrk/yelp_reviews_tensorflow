b"Original came here for a drink after a long day. I got the matcha mango fruit punch which was pretty good. My friend got the lychee martini and it was delicious. We decided to get something light, we asked the bartender what would suggest. We got these short ribs and hamachi tacos. Holy motherless goat, those hamachi tacos were the best snack tacos every. The shell is made from deep frying a gyoza wrap and it had guac, jalapeno and diced tomatoes. You need to get this as an appetizer. The short ribs were tender, good sauce but it's no fall off the bone kind rib. I'd come back here once in awhile because just ordering these the bill came out to $130. Those were some expensive tacos. Still great food none the less."
