b"Love love love this place! Been here twice and enjoyed the atmosphere, cocktails, and food immensely! The vibe is super cool and mysterious. The food is amazing. My favorite is the one with octopus, but a little overpriced. The chorizo taco, duck taco, and shishito peppers taco are all great too. The street corn is awesome when they have fresh corn on the cob. It's not as good when corn on the cob is not in season, and they use can corn served in a bowl."
