b'I live close by and just placed my first order this evening - hibachi chicken.  I was very pleased with my meal...lots of nice white chicken with lots of veggies!  It came with an abundant amount of rice as well as two dipping sauces and soup.  I am so happy to have this place so close.  It is definitely my new "go to" place!!!  I think the less fanatic reviews were probably from when they first opened and had a learning curve.  Definitely worth trying!!!'
