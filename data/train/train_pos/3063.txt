b"I have been going to Timeless for just shy of two years. Amanda is my tattoo artist. I have about 10 hours of work done so far with her. Every time she has impressed me with her ideas. I come in with an idea, she makes it freakin awesome. From american traditional to Harry Potter she knows wassup. Clean shop, friendly atmosphere and you want a place that has experience and won't BS you, than Timeless is def a the choice you want to make."
