b"WVRST is everything it promises to be: a genuine sausage party in European tradition. Decorated like a very upmarket eastern european beer hall or pivovar by way of hipster west coast design, the large open room is filled with long simple wooden tables and stools. Shared seating is the order of the day. Walk to the back of the room, pick from a variety of sausage types and treatments (either in a bun or a la currywurst as is vogue in Germany) and a drink from their incredibly well outfitted tap list, pay the nice lady and grab a number. Your meal will be ferried to you as you sit and chat.The sausage is high quality, bursting with flavour, and the toppings and dipping sauces are obviously made on site and with good care. Spicy is spicy, sweet isn't cloying, and the frites are done in classic Belgian style: crispy on the outside, warm through the middle. The beer was a little cold, but that just gave me some more time to contemplate life.I wouldn't take a first date here, but this will obviously be a great spot for a casual lunch or post-work drink and nosh with friends. Lots of friends, and when it's crowded (I was told that dinner is busier than lunch) I suspect you may end up making some new friends while there."
