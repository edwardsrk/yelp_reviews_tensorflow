b"My dad & I walked from downtown Pittsburgh because we heard Deluca's had the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. When we got there, the line was out the door. After 20 minutes, we got a table. It was a small little diner, but the food was very good. I got French toast & bacon. My dad got a ham & cheese omelet. We were both pleased with our meals & left full. We will definitely be going back when we return to Pittsburgh."
