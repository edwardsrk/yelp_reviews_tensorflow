b"Got on the guestlist via a promoter. Went to another club before coming here. Getting in took awhile since we got there at around 12 AM or so. They made us (4 girls) wait in line for about 40 minutes and almost made us pay (saying that guest lits had closed), but I made a fuss about having to wait so they let us in comped.The place is pretty. That night was DJ Aoki, very good. The place indoors has benches and stuff but also extends to and outside patio as well (with heat lamps!).The drinks were not very strong but pricey (Not that I had to pay for them, so it's all fine in my boat). It was my first time drinking Fiji water too! Crowd is a bit older. Overall had a fun time at this small lounge/club."
