b"I took my family out for dinner and wanted to try something new. This was an important dinner so it had to be somewhere good. The glowing reviews brought us here. We had to wait for a few minutes for a table which was bearable thanks to all their flat screen TV's with the OKC game on.Pork Belly Buns:Braised pork belly with sauce, peanuts and cilantro. This was tasty and fatty. 4/5Soft Shell Crab:Big pieces of deep-fried soft shell crab with a dipping sauce. 4/5Lobster Pho:Here's a dish you won't see at most Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. The broth was quite tasty. They serve the whole lobster with head, claws and tail - the body and claws have been de-shelled so all you have to do is eat and enjoy. Market price for when I went was $32. 4.5/5Mi Sate:A big bowl of egg noodles and beef in peanut sauce. It tastes like Filipino kare-kare but much watery and with noodles. 3.5/5District One Rice Combo Platter:Short ribs (or you can get pork chop), kimchi, fried egg, Chinese sausage, and rice. A big plate that will not leave you hungry. The short ribs were flavorful and grilled. 4/5The place seems like a good place to hang out at. The bar looks promising and I was watching the bartender interact with people at the bar during commercials - the people at the bar seemed pleased. They do serve alcohol, Vietnamese coffee, soda, etc. Our server, Tien was alright. He forgot to check on our drinks though. A different server gave us our check and asked if we wanted refills - too late! Tien came back to offer is refills - again, too late! Service could definitely be improved."
