b"First time I came here, it was pretty empty. Not that it's a bad thing, the food actually came out better. Then today, I came again. Except it was busier. The food- (BBQ Beef) came out oily and kind of gross. They also mixed up my father's order and gave it to someone else. If you come when the restraint is empty, you get better food and service."
