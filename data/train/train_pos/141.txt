b'Yes, hot tip you have to ask for the full menu. Second hot tip, learn to say "hello" in Mandarin (pronounced nee-how) and likely you won\'t HAVE to ask for the full menu. We\'ve dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I\'m still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it\'s pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I\'m guessing by the waitress\' excitement when I ordered, that it\'s a dish they\'re pretty proud of. It was fabulous.Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness. In the past I\'ve really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I\'ve had anywhere. Next time I\'m planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.Service is pretty barebones, so don\'t expect to be sucked-up to. It\'s perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can\'t complain about that one bit.'
