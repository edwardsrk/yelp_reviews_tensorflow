b"My kids' allergies were really kicking up, so I started looking for someone to clean our air ducts.  I called a highly rated air conditioning business to ask their opinion and they told me their customers were extremely happy with All Ducts.  I called Brian (owner/manager/employee) and he got me an appointment exactly when I needed it.  He gave me an estimate for both cost (very affordable, in my opinion) and time and both were spot on. He has all of the right equipment--he is not a carpet cleaner that is trying to moonlight as a duct cleaner. He is thorough and professional.  I had him clean my dryer vent as well, which was a tricky job, as the builder vented the dryer from the first floor to the roof. However, Brian had the proper equipment and was able to do the job easily. I highly recommend All Ducts."
