b"This place is my go-to pizza delivery joint. Ordering via GrubHub, my delivery is consistently on time, accurate, and hot. In the many times I've ordered from Little Nippers I have never had a bad order.Their pizza is pretty tasty for Pittsburgh standards. Hoagies are on point!Their prices are really reasonable--they're a great go-to when ordering out!"
