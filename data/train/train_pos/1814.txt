b"Great sandwiches! Comparable to the chain across the street, but better and cheaper. The deliver is always fast. I go with the max'd out sandwich most of the time, with thinly shredded lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar, and mayo. So much yes! If you want a good, fresh sandwich come here. The meat isn't sliced til you order!"
