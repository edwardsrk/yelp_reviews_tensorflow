b"This. Place. Is. Solid. We came here during the middle of the downtown lunch rush hour with a party of 13 and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. Given the amount of people in our party, the waiters did an excellent job. The servers were polite, prompt and knowledgable of the menu. It is nice coming to place where your menu questions are answered without an eye roll and with confidence.We started with the Pretzel Bun and Fried Shrimp with Jalape\xc3\xb1o appetizers. These were amazing. The breading on the fried stuff was seasoned nicely and the Pretzel Buns coupled by the cheese sauce were simply irresistible.I ordered the Cubano sammich and of course it was delicious. The amount of smokiness in the pork was a punch to the mouth but in a good way. Normally I don't like going back to work in a borderline food-comatose state, but this place was too good to not channel my inner fatty."
