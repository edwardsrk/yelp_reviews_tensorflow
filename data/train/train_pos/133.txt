b"I've seen SO MANY negative reviews of this location it's insane. So I was prepared for the worst. But I'm currently sitting in the waiting area (which is really spread out and not cramped at all) and the environment is so nice!! The girls in reception have been smiling and laughing with all the people that have walked in. I tried to go to several locations yesterday and each one was miserable. At this one the wait is very long but they seem to be filing through people as quickly as possible. So give them a try if you are in the area!"
