b"A real cozy spot to grab some Greek. It's tiny, warm, and feels almost divey, but Crazy Jim's is not a bad place to grab a gyro. I'm not going to say it tastes the most 'authentic', but it is unquestionably satisfying.It starts with the bread, because if you're not ordering a gyro on your first visit, you're doing it wrong. The pita is T H I C K. Flavorful. Heavy. It serves as a great foundation. The meat is tasty, the toppings are good and have plenty of customizable options. I had warm feta to top mine off, and it was great despite almost being too rich. They are very generous portions.You can get pizza, beer, and a variety of other dishes at an affordable price, so you've got nothing to lose by giving it a try! Just be warned that parking is a bit of a pain."
