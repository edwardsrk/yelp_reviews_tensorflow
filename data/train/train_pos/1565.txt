b"This Place is  Great. On the second day I bought my car I was in an accident.  My friend referred me to Thomas Auto  and in a couple of days I had my car back looking as if I driven off the lot...It looked brand new and drove just as good as I bought it...I recommend anyone to go to Thomas...You won't be disappointed .."
