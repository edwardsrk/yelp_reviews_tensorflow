b"J. Lo was phenomenal!! Such a great show! She sang all the hits, looked amazing, and had great dancers to keep the energy high. The crowd on the other hand sucked! I was sitting on the second level. They sat down like it was a musical and angrily harassed (yelling, shining flashlights) anyone who tried to get up and dance! They were barely even singing along. If you're looking to dance, get pit seats."
