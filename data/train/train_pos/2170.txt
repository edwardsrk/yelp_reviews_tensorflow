b"We enjoyed an impromptu breakfast at Cacao 70 when Ma'Tine was unexpectedly closed.We sat outside on the deck under the soft, magenta bulbs strung over the street. It was a warm, but pleasant summer morning.The menu of Cacao 70 was extensive. There was a regular menu, a dessert menu, and a hot chocolate menu! M was deviant and ordered something that had nothing chocolate: coffee and a Europa crepe. She didn't like it. She thought that there was too much ham on the crepe. Even the server asked if there was something wrong with the food and if M would prefer something else.I made up for that. I got two different kinds of hot chocolate: the darkest called the Equator and the lightest the French Cream. I also got the Illegal Chocolate Waffle and a side of bacon. Everything was on pointe. M kept eating and drinking all of my food and beverages also!The Equator and the French Cream were huge contrasts to one another. One was mature, rich, and seductive. The French Cream was indulgently sweet and creamy.My Illegal Chocolate Waffle was served with caramelized bananas, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. I love caramelized bananas. It was a well put-together dish. I am thankful that I had some crispy bacon to cut through some of the sugar though."
