b"Went in today just looking to get an oil change and a quick wash. Ended up getting an oil change and a full interior and exterior detail with a windshield crack fix up. Everyone was extremely kind and up front with pricing right away, no hidden fees or tricks. I was told the whole thing would be around 1.5 hours and it ended up being 2.5, that was the only downside. But who puts a time on making your car brand new??? 2.5 hours later and my car literally looks like I just drove it off the dealership lot. Highly recommend all of the services at this location, I've been coming here for years."
