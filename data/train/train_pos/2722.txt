b"This place was delicious except for the 2 inch breading on the fried chicken. We ordered the fried chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and collard greens. For appetizers we ordered chicken skins, shaved cat fish and biscuits with apple butter. The appetizers were great, the shaved catfish dish was small catfish pieces served over a bed of fries with a relish on top and paired with hot sauce and hot sauce aioli. The chicken skins were nice and crispy served with a honey butter sauce that added a nice sweet aftertaste. For the entree we ordered a 3 piece fried chicken dinner. The chicken was moist and cooked perfect but as I stated earlier the breading was a bit much. It's definitely doubled battered before frying because the breading was so thick but the seasoning and taste was on point. The best part of the whole meal was the dessert, we ordered the can donut with salted caramel sauce. This was So delicious I wanted to order a take home box of it. The caramel sauce paired perfect with the dough and it was still crispy covered with the sauce. I will definitely be back and will recommend this place to anyone!"
