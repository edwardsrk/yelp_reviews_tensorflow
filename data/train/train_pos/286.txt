b"I was so excited for this to open and was hesitant after reading some reviews but I finally went and loved it!  I think there are some issues because it is new, it is popular, and it gets crazy on Fridays and Saturdays. I went on Sunday and still had to wait in a line but it went quickly and wasn't and issue. I think in time it will get more efficient on busy days. Service was great, our food was surprisingly good, beer was tasty, and the place is just fun!  Definitely feels like Oktoberfest with the great German band they had playing. I look forward to coming back in the summer when the outside area is all open.  If you can, check out the Hermit Club portion of the complex. A very cool historic building that fits perfectly with the Hofbrauhaus!"
