b"Had their pizza, that was awesome.  It was one loaded up with stuff that I can't remember, but it was fab.Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares.  These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price. The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again.  Seattle's ruined me.  If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's.  I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!"
