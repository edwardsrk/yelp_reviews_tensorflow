b"This place is not on my favorite to eat spot because of my detest of seafood but our waiter Caleb definitely made it into one of my top 10! He was such a great server and a nice guy! I'll come back for the service (and brownie) alone! Thanks so much! Look at the super cute brownie picture I posted :)"
