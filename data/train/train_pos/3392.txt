b"I was a box dye type of girl for years, so much that my dark brown hair was turning my hair black. I was told by many salons I would have to pay so much money to lighten my hair. I had found Heidi on yelp and really liked her work. I schedule an appt, she was affortable and really talented. Although getting your hair from dark to red was a process. She really cares about taking great care of your hair. It has been over 2 years I've been coming to Heidi and she always makes my hair look and feel fabulous.  I love coming to the Hive, to see Heidi and Alli you are always greeted with a warm welcome back, and great coversation. Thanks ladies."
