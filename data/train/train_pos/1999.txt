b"I'm a New Yorker through and through.  Of course I love diners, real 24 hour diners which have that older, shaggy feel:) and the menu has 'disco fries'.  Yes, I can order it that way, but seeing that on a menu makes it.Black Bear Diner is a great diner for this side of the country:)  Unfortunately, it's not Open 24 hours- COME ON!  At least consider the newest location on LV Blvd not far from Blue Diamond to eventually be open 24 hours.  Think about it, once that stadium opens... ;)The staff at all he Black Bear locations never, ever disappoint.  They are bubbly, you can feel the warmth of their personalities and are they speedy!  I mainly frequent the Sahara/Durango location now. That outdoor waiting are with the bears does have appeal!  However, Mindy the waitress is superb. Last time I finished dining, we hugged.  Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar/yellow American cheese please;)Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!Eat well!"
