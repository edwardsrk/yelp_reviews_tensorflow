b"This place is very small and cozy, but what I love most is that you really get such great food for the price! Also, its a family-owned place, and we always make a point to come out and support the owners who we've gotten to know, every time we're in Kensington :). Best breakfast place in town, hands-down, if you are looking for a simple, down-home breakfast!"
