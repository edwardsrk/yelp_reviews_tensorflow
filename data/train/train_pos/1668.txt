b"This place has an amazing selection of products that, up until now, I was buying at Whole Foods...no more of that nonsense! This is going to be my staple grocery store from now on. Great selection of flours, gluten free breads, alternative milks, and non-toxic soaps. I haven't take a look at their supplements section yet but I did see lots of resources for sprouting your own foods so when I'm ready to start that, this will be my first stop. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was that the fresh produce section was a little sparse (but that could have been the time of day). Overall, wonderful place!!"
