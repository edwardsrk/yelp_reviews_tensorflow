b"Was craving sushi after my dentist office and found this. It's a small menu of sushi so pls check it out before you drive/call in. It's not s typical sushi place. The decor inside was outdated but it didn't stop the food from tasting pretty good. Not the best I've had but pretty good! They have the basic rolls that made me happy. I got a salmon roll and rainbow roll for $16."
