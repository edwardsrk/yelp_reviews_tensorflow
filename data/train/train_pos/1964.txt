b'Stopped in yesterday to get some sushi to go.  We decided on the deluxe sample platter for $24.95. This included 6 California Rolls and a good selection of Nigiri which included:  3 pieces of tuna (Maguro);  3 pieces of salmon (Sake); 3 pieces of snapper (Tai); and 3 pieces of eel (Unagi).  The employees were cheerful and friendly. The hostess offered us tea and/or water while we waited even though we were just getting take-out.  I liked the decor and overall feel of the place. When we got home and dug into the sushi, I was impressed. Sushi rice had good texture, the fish was fresh and tasted good w/just a small smear of wasabi between the rice and the fish.  Of course, the sushi was packaged alongside the standard additional dollop of wasabi and a nice pile of pickled ginger on the side.   The pricing is in line with other area sushi places. Overall, I was pleased with the sushi and definitley will go back.'
