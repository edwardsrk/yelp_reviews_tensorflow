b"Did the bang for your buck deal I found on Groupon. Pricey but so worth it! We were in town for the weekend, and called ahead to make a reservation on a Sunday. Very friendly and hassle free process over the phone, and they even offered a ride to and from our hotel. The day of the reservation the driver was a little late, but they called to let us know, which was much appreciated. He only was 10 minutes behind due to traffic on the strip, which is understandable. When we arrived we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. The girl at the counter was super helpful and helped us decide which guns we wanted to try. Surprisingly, the sten ended up being my favorite for the day. Brandon walked us through the entire process, he was a great instructor, and very patient with us newbs. This is a bit embarrassing, but I somehow scratched my delicate hand while handling a gun, I'm usually a big baby, but Brandon was such a gentleman and even gave me a bandaid. Overall this is experience was amazing and to be honest I'd come regularly if I lived nearby. Definitely will come back when ever I'm in Vegas!"
