b"I came here for a birthday dinner and man is this a cool place with It's a lively yet intimate setting. The loud Japanese greeting as you're seated helps build the setting of the place. They had Ultraman playing in the background, I mean for people who know what it is how cool is that?The service came quick and the food started coming fast. I strongly recommend the following items:Hamachi Carpaccio: A well balanced fish dish, with a hint of citrus flavour. It delivered an amazing Japanese and south american fusion flavour that you need to try!Beef tongue on hot stone: the thinly sliced tongue is cooked on a hot stone. The thin meat just melts in your mouth flavour with a citrus punch. Watching it cook on the stone was entertaining to watch as well!If you haven't gone here yet, book your reservation and go!"
