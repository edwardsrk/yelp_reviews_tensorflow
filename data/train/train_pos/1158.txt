b"The staff is friendly, they stop serving at 8:30 PM so make sure you arrive timely. No fashionably late arrivals. There is indoor and outdoor seating. the staff is not only friendly but helpful. Very polite. Portions are decent and they will not leave you feeling hungry. Due to Vegas temps, if dining outdoors any beverage with ice will quickly melt please keep that in mind. Menu is large enough to give you options yet small enough not to overwhelm and theres a good amount of detail about each item. Desserts are delicious and you'll want more than one. I won't have or take one of those to go said no one ever! This was somewhat hipster, somewhat trendy, somewhat casual, its hard to put a definite label on it other than it was a good first experience and a good first impression. If you're looking for something other than the strip, this is a nice change of pace and very relaxing. It affords the opportunity to have good food and good conversation."
