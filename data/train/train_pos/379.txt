b"So glad this place is close to home! Been here a few times and I'm happy to say their food is always consistent. You can't go wrong with their pho (I like the combination pho) and the rice dishes are good choices too. When I'm feeling extra hungry, I'll order the fried egg rolls which always hit the spot. Service has been great the multiple times I've been. They also do a great job of keeping the restaurant clean."
