b'I loved the original restaurant and love this new incarnation. This is much different: much more casual and much friendlier to the wallet. The food is still delicious. As a sidebar, I had a Weight Watchers friendly meal here: chicken kabob with eggplant and zucchini over beans with harissa sauce. Fantastic!! The woman told us the harissa was very spicy but I thought it was just right. We plan to eat here regularly.'
