b"Seriously an amazing experience. The staff was polite and took care of my every need. It has the perfect location, just steps from the Freemont experience. Easy walk to all downtown locations.  The rooms are super clean. Beds are huge and comfy. The bathroom is the perfect size for a hotel. Love the modern decor as well, feels like a strip hotel in the room. Nice food options as well. Easy to grab a quick bite at subway and McDonald's. Oscars was a meal to be remembered, looking onto Freemont from the dome. Try the filet and the Martinis. Great old time bartenders and staff."
