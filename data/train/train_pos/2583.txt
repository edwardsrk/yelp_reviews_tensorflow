b"Great setting, fun energy, prices weren't overly outlandish, good service, food was good. We ordered jelly filled beignets which were very tasty. Pecan sticky bun was edible but not my favorite (a little dry)I had croque Madame which was my favorite dish of the meal. Not too heavy surprisingly and very flavorful. Friends got chicken and waffles which I thought wasn't that great, and another guy got smoked salmon plate which was pretty basic. I'd definitely come back if I wanted a non-buffet Vegas brunch."
