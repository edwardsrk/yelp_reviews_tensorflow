b'This place is owned by the Clarendon Hotel folks.  I love that north central Phoenix is becoming a place to come eat, drink and dance, because I break out in hives when I go to Scottsdale.  We went to lunch here.  The acoustics are far better than at The Clarendon, so you can hear your companion speak.  The waiters also seem far happier to be there than those at GB.We had chips and guacamole which was good and fresh.  Split a quinoa salad which was really good and colorful, had great dressing and freshness.  We each had a couple of tacos.  I had carne asada and al pastor; my companion the fish.  Everything was good.  The only thing that I thought notable was they told me the menu was really different from Gallo Blanco....but I found it to be very similar.  But good job!  Great location!'
