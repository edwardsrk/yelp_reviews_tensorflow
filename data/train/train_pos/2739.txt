b"I have to say, this may be my favorite wood fired pizza in central Phoenix. I'll have to try Spasso's pizza a few more times to confirm that my infatuation was not the result of a long week, my chemical composition on that particular day, or the peace of a cold beer, but if future experiences are anything like my first, I am a fan! The house made mozzarella appetizer is ok. The steak (that my boyfriend ate) was fine. The real star here is the pizza, which had a perfectly chewy crust and the meat combination completed a perfect blend of cheesy saltiness. The owner was a little overly chatty, but at the same time, how can I blame him when clearly this restaurant is his pet project. The service was GREAT...I don't think our water glasses were ever empty. I have to admit, a small part of my enthusiasm is probably because this restaurant is in Town & Country Mall, which is a terribly under appreciated piece of real estate...I'd love to see this good, family-owned restaurant survive."
