b"The servers here are very nice. They treat me good everytime I come in!As far as the food goes, it is hit and miss. In the past I have ordered fried fish, pasta and wings and they were disgusting. More recently, I have ordered the appetizer burger sliders, artichoke and spinach dip, and kale and quinoa salad. They were DELICIOUS! They're menu is so large that you sometimes don't know what to order! May the odds ever be in your favor.Cheesecakes are great! My favorite slices are oreo cheesecake and red velvet. YUM!"
