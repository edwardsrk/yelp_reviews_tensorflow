b"3.5 stars Kind of hard to access their parking lot if you're not familiar. Came during lunch on a Friday, it seemed busy but not too busy. There's indoor and outdoor seating available. You order up front and your food is brought to your table. The line to order moved fairly quickly and we got our food in less than 10 minutes. We ordered two lamb/beef gyro combos (side & drink) with feta fries ($.50 extra) for about $25. The gyros had lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki sauce, and feta cheese... A LOT of feta cheese. The gyro meat was moist and had good flavor. It was also sliced thicker than I'm used to. The gyros also came with a couple of small pepperoncini peppers.The feta fries were tasty; battered fries covered in feta and another white cheese (mozzarella?). They were pretty garlicky as well. I wasn't even able to put a dent in the pile of fries as the gyro had me stuffed. The food was solid, but nothing absolutely amazing. That being said, I would come back if I was in the area or if a companion wanted to go."
