b"As the name suggests, Jamboree is a great spot to get your bagel fix. They have a variety of fresh-made rings (boiled for the NY taste!) and house-made schmears, which always make a great breakfast. I enjoyed the Super Egg (egg + everything seasoning) with scallion. I did not notice a lox sandwich on the menu, which is my usual go-to.   They offer lunch and dinner service, as well as a case of pastries (didn't see black and whites) and various daily breakfast plate specials. Several reviews compare this spot to Bagel Cafe, and I can see how this is a smaller alternative to consider if you live in the area. I can recommend this location but it's a bit out of my way to come regularly myself.TIP: Grab your bagel and schmear to go, then pop by Aware Coffee en route to the freeway!"
