b'Was looking for a neighborhood local eatery. Was in the mood for Greek food. Found this place. It was exactly what I was looking for. Relaxed, quaint, traditional family owned spot. Great food. Started with a Greek beer,  ordered the Greek meat sauce pasta and added chicken as was recommended by George. George was great. He basically guided me through my dinning experience.  Salad was crisp and dressed well. Pita bread is awesome!! Entree was great, very solid. Again, George  recommended the baklava cheesecake, wow. Can go toe to toe with the butter cake at drinkwaters... That is saying a lot. Over all very very solid. This is a great family owned authentic Greek restaurant!!'
