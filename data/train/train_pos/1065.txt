b"Came here as a double date after a Jay's game. Our good friend had made a reservation as he knew we loved our meat. We were greeted and sat right away by the window which was nice. I have to start by saying our service all night was exceptional, our waiter explained everything on the menu to us, our drinks were never empty  and our server was extremely attentive. We started off with the charcuterie board, it was really nice, a good selection of meat and some killer mustard. We decided to share some apps, the burrata with asparagus and ramp pesto, the grilled octopus and the crispy pigs ears. The ears weren't my deal but the burrata was killer, so creamy and the pesto was delishhhh. Now for the main event...the bestellen burger.... I have dreams about this burger. Dear lawd it is killllerrrrr. One of the best burger I've ever had in my life, yup I said it and it's true. The sharp raclette cheese, the sweet caramelized onions on a freshly made (like 3 hours earlier according to the server) brioche bun. I can't even tell you what my husband or friends had because I was too busy eating. If you go to bestellen get the burger. We finished off with the panna cotta and something with chocolate. They both rocked. On the way out we were lucky enough to run into owner rob rossi (although I didn't know he was a famous food network star!). He was very nice and ensured we had a great time. Overall great meal! Price could be an issue for some but for a special occasion bestellen measures up."
