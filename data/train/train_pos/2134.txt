b"Nice stadium.  But definitely review the stadium policies for bringing in food and water.  The price for water, yes a half liter, .10 cent retail bottle of water is $4.75 in the venue.  Seriously?The workers almost seemed embarrassed.I understand mark-up, but selling water for about half the price of beer?For each attendee, you are allowed to bring in two bottles of H2O.  It's serious worth the effort."
