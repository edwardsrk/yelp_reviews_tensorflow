b"If you're ever in Phoenix for whatever reason, this is a must try.  I am a huge fan of pork so of course I got the pork belly ramen bowl and it was amazing!  However, my first choice would have been the duck curry bowl, but my stomach was at odds with me that evening. I must add everyone at our table felt the same way with their choices on the menu.  Didn't have a problem getting seated on a Saturday evening and we even sat outside with the heat but that was even a pleasant experience with the misters outside and no we didn't get doused with water;-)"
