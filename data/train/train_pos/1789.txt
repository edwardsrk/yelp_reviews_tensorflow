b"Their yogurt is some of the best in town! They offer a variety of awesome flavors, all of which taste great. The yogurt has a really good creamy texture too. Yum.Unlike some other yogurt places, they don't limit the number of those cute little sample cups, which is awesome. I know its a minor detail, but it really does matter!!! After sampling a few, I went with the Irish Mint. It was so good!My only complaint, and I can see past this, is their topping setup was a little messy. Some of the bins I wanted to use were empty. Usually froyo places are on top of this. Anyway, this place is bomb!"
