b'I only have one complaint about nami. If you order brunch togo, they have no system to handle it and you can end up waiting in line for your pick up for about 10 minutes. Other than that, everything is phenomenal. Their pastries, great. Their coffee bar, great. The soy-namis, are a vegan blizzard alternative that are way better imo. If you are vegan or vegetarian this is a must, and soon to be your regular spot. Please come up with a system to continually call out for your to go people though, thanks!'
