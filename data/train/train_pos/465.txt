b"Dined here with the family during our last visit to Vegas. Food is great! The waitstaff is extremely attentive and knowledgeable. A must restaurant to go to while visiting Las Vegas.I've always been a Bobby Flay fan and wanted to go here. The waiter was on point with his recommendations. He turned us on to the best margarita I have ever had. It's a Partida blanco margarita. It had fresh lime juice and agave for sweetener. It was amazing. So much in fact that I looked high and low to find that tequila upon my return to Jersey. Luckily I found it.We had a few minor temperature issues with the steak but they fixed it and even took it off the bill without me even mentioning it. That in itself will make me return there when I return. Now I'm hungry..."
