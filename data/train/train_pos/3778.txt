b'Where do you go for some off strip sushi to die for? "I Love Sushi" of course. I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we\'re we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention "special chef sauce", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here\'s a list of rolls we had:(Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page.
