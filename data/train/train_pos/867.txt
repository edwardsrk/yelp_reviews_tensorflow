b"Dropped in to check it out while on this side of town and we were not disappointed.  Nice AZ brews and in house BBQ. Pulled pork, brisket and great ribs. The St. Louis style ribs best I've had in a long time. Sides I included hand cut fries and potato salad. Both fantastic ask for the fries crispy. Overall we really enjoyed this place. Definitely recommend checking it out."
