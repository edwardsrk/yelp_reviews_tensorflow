b'Got seated immediately. The cart rolled on over to us right away. We were starved and ready to get our dim sum cravings satisfied. The food was nice and hot. Taste was just right. The workers who push the carts were nice but can be too pushy on what you want to get sometimes. We went pretty early and it got busy fast! On the bill, it did charge for "2 people"? I don\'t know why...? Weird. Overall, great place to eat!'
