b'Beautiful location, in the heart of the distillery district. Wonderful decor.Favourite items on the menu include their frappucinos, and chai lattes. In terms of desserts, the ginger cookie is my ultimate favourite. Desserts are not made in house, but are still fairly good for a cafe that specializes more in coffee. Traffic in the cafe gets pretty crazy during the weekends, expect lineups out the door. Make sure to plan around that and come either later or earlier in the day, to avoid the crowds, as it is sometimes hard to find seating. Apart from that, a pretty great place!'
