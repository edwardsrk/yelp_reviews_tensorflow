b'The next time your in need of a eye exam and/or any eyewear I would strongly suggest that you give "ALL THINGS EYES" a try. Their front staff members are exceptional as is Dr. Wong.Everyone bends over backwards to make sure you get just what you want, great selection of eyewear. You won\'t be dissatisfied. I\'m so glad that they decided to make the move into the South West area of Las Vegas.I definitely will be going back there the next time I need an eye exam & any new eyewear.'
