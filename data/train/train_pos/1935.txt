b'Nothing can top the feeling of walking into a bar after a long day and hearing a guitarist play Billy Joel\'s "She\'s Always a Woman." I nearly melted in my seat. Well, that was shortly before my friend needed to pop over to the bar on the other side of SLS to get a hot toddy. Then we returned to Monkey Bar.There are a few seats at the bar, plenty of tables and couches to lounge around. It\'s a lovely place to relax within SLS station. I\'m not sure how often they have musicians, but the guitarist made me so happy. The bartenders are friendly (some of them are kinda cute) and the drinks are on point. I had both the Monkey Fuzz Gimlet and the White Peach Margarita. Just enough to get me buzzed before retiring to my room after a long two-day meeting. I was a little taken aback when the bartenders didn\'t ask me if I wanted a second drink after I finished my first one (unusual) but it was easy to flag them down and ask.As far as hotel bars go, this one is great. The prices are reasonable, the selection is plentiful, and the atmosphere is classy but laid-back. There\'s many great things about SLS Station, and I\'m glad Monkey Bar turned out to be one of them.'
