b'I was real worried about eating here due to reviews saying the food was bland. It was anything but. We had the blue corn pancake with duck WOW. For entrees we had the pork tenderloin sandwich and green chile burger. The pork was incredible, the burger had a lot of flavor but not green chile, this was probably the most tender burger I have ever had.We ate here for lunch because of my concern. It was definitely worth going for dinner, we will be back.'
