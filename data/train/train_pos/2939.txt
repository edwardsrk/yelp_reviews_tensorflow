b'NOTE: HEIST STOPPED DOING UNLIMITED/BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS DURING BRUNCH! :( I was super bummed yesterday when we brought our friend visiting from India for brunch. They only now serve single mimosa glasses for $5 or pitchers for $12. Sunday brunch includes: buffet, an a la carte entree, and sides. I have been here a couple of times for brunch and we love the buffet food and waffles, the entree can be a hit or miss depending on how crowded it is. I usually stick with the chicken and the egg entree, the shrimp and grits are good too but, the gravy has pork in it. Yes, it is a little pricey, but its worth it. My favorite buffet item: mussels with white wine butter sauce! The sausage gravy and flatbreads are also very good. The servers are always very attentive and nice. This is definitely a try at least once despite the price. Spencer, the GM, is great and very accommodating. He will make sure that you have a wonderful experience at Heist. We will be back on occasion but, still bummed about the bottomless mimosas. This is not the place for you if you are dieting. Make reservations! The wait is always at least 30 minutes.'
