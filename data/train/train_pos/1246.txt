b"It's been awhile since my last update and I will have to move Yupha's up on the list of thai places in the valley.  Every time I have gone since my last review I have liked the food even more and more.  I mainly eat the noodle dishes and they are vastly different than all the other thai restaurants.  At first I wasn't sure it was a good thing, but they have really grown on me.  They all tend to be saucier than other versions, but I have really grown to like it.  I'm not sure which way they are supposed to be as I have never been to Thailand so I will say they are good and different.  The staff is here has actually been consistently nice and helpfully.  Today I went for lunch and they were packed ( I actually had left another thai restaurant that had forgotten they had sat me ) but I was seated promptly and my food came out incredibly fast.  I will definitely keep coming here for lunch.Try:- Iced Thai Coffee- Pad Thai- Pad See Ew- Drunkin Noodles"
