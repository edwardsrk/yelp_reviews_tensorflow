b"When here yesterday with the Hubby for our date night dinner and a movie. Hostess was nice and greeted us. Our server was fabulous as we (wish I could remember his name). My husband and I order the crab dip which was amazing!! A must get. We also ordered the wedge also good, I got the Just for the halibut, fish was great, potato cake that comes with it not so much. My Husband got the seafood and grits with a tomato sauce, it was ok a little under season. Also Tim, the owner sent a carrot cake to the table after speaking to my hubby and it was divine!!! So great since I am a carrot cake expert. Overall the food was delicious, the wait staff can't be beat and the atmosphere was great as well. I would definitely be back and recommend to a friend."
