b"There are many choices in Old Montreal but this restaurant is truly a gem.  The menu provides a wide selection for anyone's palate from light fare (salads), casual (poutine), to formal (steaks, chops & seafood).  It was perfect for my wife and I.  She wanted a salad and a burger and I was craving something more formal a Porterhouse Steak, which was cooked perfectly.The decor is quite beautiful, giving you the essence of Old Montreal with an updated modern flare.  The wait staff was gracious and fluent in several languages.The full service bar was excellent with a complete array of house specialties and a comprehensive wine list by the bottle or glass.  Finally the price was quite reasonable adding up to a wonderful experience.  This restaurant is a must visit if you are in Old Montreal."
