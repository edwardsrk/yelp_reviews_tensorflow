b"Very cozy environment. The staff is friendly and not pushy. I can sit on their demo furniture for 20 minutes without been interrupted. However, their FREE Starbuck coffee taste like water. Well. It's FREE. I went there for the painting and rugs. Unfortunately, their products seem to be over-priced comparing to other wholesale furniture warehouse. Since I came all the way from Gilbert, they said that I will have to pay for extra shipping cost? Or I have to pick it up by myself? I wonder if the sales rep is new or simply telling me the wrong story? I did not buy the painting there, because you can find identical one online from other warehouse at lower price. I guess that's one of the reason they don't even offer Free WiFi. I will still give them 4 stars for their friendly and cozy environment."
