b"They're coffee is fantastic and their bacon is the finest tastiest cut I've had the pleasure of bitting into! Seriouslyn its thick cut and so delicious! And its not fake thick cut where it would only be considered thick next to a piece of paper, nah, they're a nice hunk to eat!Katie was my server and was a ray of sunshine! I had the belgum waffle with eggs and bacon with some coffee. Lone Spur cafe is also a fantastic pokestop given there are three pokespots within the diners range!"
