b'Stopped in here for a late lunch one afternoon.Ordered a Reuben sandwich and a bottle of water. Sandwich was made fresh and hot to order.The sandwich was huge! I could only eat half of it and took the other half to go. Sandwich was tasty!The guy running the place was nice.The only thing I will ding the place on is the parking situation. There was no available parking on the street - meaning every available spot was already occupied. I had driven over from my hotel and being from out-of-town had no idea I would not be able to find a place to park. So I ended up paying to park in a pay lot next to the building the Deli is located within.Also note - West 3rd Deli does not deliver - BUT - they have two delivery services they are partnered with - so if you do want to order and have it delivered- you can do so!'
