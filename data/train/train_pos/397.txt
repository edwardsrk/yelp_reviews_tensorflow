b'Good flavorable chicken at Mr Pollo!  The lunch special includes a bowl of soup, the sides are small. Two plantains and side salad, the bleu cheese is good, it blended well with a spicy sauce they brought to the table.  The grilled beef steak is tasty but a tad chewy.  Chicken is the way to go.  The drinks are 2$, refills at the station, the order is taken at the counter and a friendly staff member brings your order to the table with a smile.  Small, clean spot in the plaza.'
