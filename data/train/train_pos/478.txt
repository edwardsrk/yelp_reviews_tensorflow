b"I was in Urbana, IL for a few days on business. I dined at two restaurants and this was one of them.The place was rather empty, but that's because it was Halloween evening.With that being said, the interior design is pretty cool but feels a bit cold. I had a couple of things on the menu. I had the halibut as my main dish and the california roll just for fun. I was very stuffed by the end of the evening. I liked both dishes.I think Ko Fusion needs to focus on one cuisine. It's trying to be everything to everyone. But what I had was tasty. The outside signage says 'Steak Pizza Sushi Seafood.' What the hell kinda combination is that? I'd go back if I was in town. :)"
