b'I been here couples of times when I was in Vegas with friends. When I got here I didn\'t think this place was a Vietnamese place since it looked more Americanize. There was no line or waiting when we got here and was seated right away, When I looked at menu there was so many choices to pick. I noticed that people were ordering the ox tail pho or lobster pho. I ordered Bun Bo hue since it my favorite noodle. I also ordered Vietnamese coffee since I was tired from the long drive to Vegas. The coffee was good that it help me stay wide awake the whole day lol. While the girls all ordered their District famous ox tail pho,  I had to be the "Unique" out of the group lol.  The portions of the bun bo hue and pho was big. It was very good. I got to taste of some of pho since my friend shared with me. I was impress with their pho so next time I will order the Ox tail Pho or maybe the lobster pho. The servers were very attentive and checked on us often . They refills our water often. I will definitely will be back when I\'m in the Chinatown Vegas.'
