b'After reading favorable reviews, decided to reserve a table so that we could dine after taking a stroll through Old Scottsdale on "Artwalk Thursday".Pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had a dresscode, which is fairly uncommon nowadays. Only issue was finding parking due to the nearby SF Giants game, but eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks of our destination.Walking into Bandera immediately reminded us of the old Houston\'s on Park Avenue South in NYC. Same subdued lighting and dark wood booths surrounding a vibrant bar scene. Soon learned that the Hillstone Restaurant Group which runs the Bandera chain also manages Houston\'s, thus the many similarities.Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters. Terrific wine and beer and specialty cocktail list.For a chain restaurant, service, food and value were uniformly excellent across the board. Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters.'
