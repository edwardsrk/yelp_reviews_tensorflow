b"First thought, it isn't easy to find the first time... it is to the left, in a business park behind the post office. Second thought, damn good pizza and worth finding!I tried the lamb and rosemary pizza, with roasted peppers etc, it was awesome. It was also a tough choice, all of them looked good. I loved the garlic infused olive oil for dipping the crust. It is what that crap that comes with delivery pizzas tries to be.It is a huge open space inside, kind of odd decor, but the people working were helpful and friendly. They are only open in the evenings. Sure it costs a little more than delivery, but they do make a great pie!"
