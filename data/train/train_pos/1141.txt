b"Candy heaven. This is the best way to describe Candy Addict. Situated right off the busy streets of Mill Ave, this candy shop is perfectly placed because it's embedded right in the middle of all the action. The candy gets a little pricey but they have a nice selection and unique brands. It's definitely worth every sugar filled penny!"
