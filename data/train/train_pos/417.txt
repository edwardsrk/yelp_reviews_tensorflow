b'I have wanted to eat here since moving to Vegas, but it hasn\'t worked out. After "checking in" I found the timing was wrong given my new wardrobe addition of a foot and leg cast, very awkward foot boot, a walker and terrible parking with a long walk to sit down for dinner. After a couple of circles around the place we decided to give up this time around and try again when the cast is gone and there is less of a crowd. Guess this is the long way of "checking out."  Four stars because that many people with four and five stars can\'t all be wrong.'
