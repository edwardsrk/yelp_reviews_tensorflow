b"after incurring intense lower back pain, I searched for a good chiropractor and discovered Dr Warkentin at the rateMDs website (under the Top 10 Chiropractors in the World) - what astounded me was that he had about 350 reviews (412 as of today), absolutely dwarfing the number of reviews for all other listed chiropractors - I also found out, to my surprise, that his clinic (actually a full-scale wellness center) was only about 15 minutes away - I made an appointment and was able to see him the same day - I had a full set of X-rays done - Dr Warkentin showed me the pertinent X-ray and provided an unrushed and thorough explanation of what was causing the pain in my back - he also pointed out areas that could lead to problems down the road - I was then put on a roller table, received electrical stimulation, had some adjustments done, and concluded the visit with cold laser therapy - subsequent visits added use of a spinal decompression machine - I also received instruction from his associate Dr Wolsey (who has a master's degree in Exercise Science) about how to strengthen my core muscles to provide support for my spine - after about 2 weeks worth of visits, about 90 to 95 percent of the pain was relieved // I've seen other chiropractors in the past - how Dr Warkentin conducts his practice blows them out of the water - it's evident his goal is excellence in terms of the quality of care he seeks to provide and the physical environment in which it's done (e.g. the patient restrooms resemble that of a luxury hotel; also, there is meticulous attention paid to upkeep, which explains why his large facility still looks new after 8 years) - in addition to being very personable and super sharp, Dr Warkentin is extraordinarily skilled at diagnosing conditions, going well beyond what the normal chiropractor is capable of doing (he's caught life-threatening problems that patients' physicians have missed, even though they're not in his official realm of expertise) - he attends surgeries weekly with some of the most skilled doctors in the Valley (neuro, spine, cardiovascular, etc.) to enhance his diagnostic capabilities - Dr Warkentin also has a desire to give back - e.g. he goes out of his way to provide affordable care to fire dept and military personnel - another example:  he took a week off earlier this year to provide his expertise on a medical missions trip to Africa // Dr Warkentin sets an example and standard of what quality medical care should be like - he doesn't market - he obtains all his business by word-of-mouth - and having experienced first hand how he treats his patients, I now understand why his marketing budget is non-existent - some of his patients fly to his clinic to be treated by him, rather than visit a nearby local chiropractor - you can add me to the list of his fans - almost forgot, one last item to mention: on the day of my initial visit, Dr Warkentin gave me a call later in the evening to see how I was doing  - it was completely unexpected - how many doctors bother to do that? - a most well deserved 5 stars!"
