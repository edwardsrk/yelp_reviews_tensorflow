b'We really enjoy coming here for breakfast on the weekends! The food is always delicious and the staff is very friendly and courteous. HOWEVER, during our last visit, we noticed a gentleman standing around, near the hostess stand, performing the duties of the hostess. He had such an unfriendly personality, never smiled and was not courteous at all. This was so uncharacteristic of First Watch! When we inquired about him, we learned his name was Tim and he was the regional manager. We were so surprised! We expected a manager to visit with the customers, not stand around and get in the way! We were quite disappointed in his behaviour and demeanor.'
