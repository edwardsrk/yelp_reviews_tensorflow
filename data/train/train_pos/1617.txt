b"Overall I have to give Hakkasan a four star. The service was amazing. The hostess, waitress and bartender were all super friendly and helpful. Also how can you top a hot towel after dinner?However, the food I have to give about a 3.5/5. It was good but not great. For the price I guess I was expecting something excellent and mind blowing. My boyfriend and I shared the scallops, ribeye and Hakka noodles. The portion sizes were large and my favorite part was the scallops but once again nothing super special. One more reason why I gave this review a 4, the atmosphere. I loved the set up of this place and it's mysterious yet sophisticated feel. Great ambitious for a birthday or anniversary just to make the night feel extra special."
