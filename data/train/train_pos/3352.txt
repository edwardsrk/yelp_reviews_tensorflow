b"After multiple return visits, and money spread about (3) three different tire and custom wheel shops..... none could take care of the tire shaking problem. There fancy rode force balance and inexperienced discount staff drove me crazy. We have all been to similar shops. I was all about to give up when this week while having work done by Aloha Automotive, I mentioned my frustration and expense $200+ to remedy very bad rear tire shake at 60-65mph.  Aloha Body shop manager mention HubCap Annie fixed his daughters bent wheel and re-balanced for a very reasonable price. He said that's where I would go, they are a honest shop. Since a whole heartedly trust Jason the owner of Aloha for my auto repairs, I welcomed the referral from his staff. This morning, I was greeted by Terry at HC Annie's who listened to my concerns and offered to take a look at the problem. Terry personally removed both rear tires and quickly identified one tire was indeed off balanced. Terry fixed the issues and sent me down the road. The car rode smoothly down the road at all speeds without issue after 2 months of frustration.  HubCap Annie's fixed what 2 national box store tire shops and 1custom wheel & tire could not do...... Balance a tire properly. Mind you while completing my balance Terry was interrupted by a man looking for a used tire. Without skipping a beat, Terry continued my install while addressing the gentle men's question and showed real compassion for the mans plight. Unfortunately, we just don't see that anymore in business, you all know that's it's sadly becoming a rare occurrence. Whomever hired Terry, you have a great employee who understands the true meaning of helping people while helping your business. Terry has earned my trust, therefore so has HubCap Annie's. Thank you for making my day."
