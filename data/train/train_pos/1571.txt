b"Sushi ichiban is yet another excellent stop for hungry college kids. After tasting the delicious menu in ko fusion, I had pretty high standard but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 3 roll combo for 10.99, I got the salmon roll, spicy tuna and fancy roll. All three were superb. The fish tasted fresh and the taste was authentic, not to mention it was an incredible deal for that price. I didn't get the chance to try their non sushi dishes though. I'll definitely be back for more."
