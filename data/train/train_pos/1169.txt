b"I love love love this place for a massage. This is the best massage I have ever received and I have had a lot. With that said - I like deep tissue really hard massages and I feel like I never get enough pressure. I did not have that issue both times that I have been here. The pressure was perfect and consistent from beginning til end. Rochell is amazing as is her partner. I will keep coming back. CON - the one and only con is the location.  The room is in a strip mall type location with other businesses next door (literally) and you can hear everything going on inside, outside, and through the entire building. If you plan on relaxing or sleeping then this isn't the best location. If you are looking for a damn good massage by people who know what they are doing. This is your place."
