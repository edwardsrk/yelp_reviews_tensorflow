b'A great place for lunch between classes.  Service is prompt and the food is delicious.  Everyone around our table loved what they ordered and alot of food envy happened.  Friend swears by the charred salmon sandwich, which looked great and everyone seemed to like.  I had the seafood pasta which was amazing, perfectly creamy and delicious.  Great portions and reasonable price.  Would definitely go back again and recommend to friends.'
