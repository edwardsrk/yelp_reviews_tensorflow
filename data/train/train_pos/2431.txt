b'I am Updating my review because Ashley the owner contacted me. She did offer to correct the situation. She apologized for the "less then warm" reception and assured me that is not a usual occurrence. I stand by my original opinion that extractions should be included in a facial. She did state they usually are but that does not mitigate the fact I already paid $20 for that "extra" service. I added an additional star to my review because I admire Ashley\'s professionalism and commitment to customers. I think she genuinely cares about her business and keeping clients happy. I don\'t live in the Phoenix area any more but I might give them another shot if I visit in the future.'
