b"Let's have some MO... Momo Sushi. An appropriate name for this place, Momo (more more) Sushi. What an awesome sushi place for lunch or dinner on this side of Henderson. The location is kind of odd as you don't really see it from Stephanie. The whole strip mall is not even facing the main road, it's awkwardly sideways. Just pull into the driveway past Marie Calendars and it will be on your left side.So yes, the food here is awesome especially the Agadashi tofu. I've had this dish numerous times and I really do appreciate the presentation at Momo. The tofu is cut up in nice bite size pieces and sitting inside a bowl of broth. At other places the tofu is cut larger. When it's served larger so many awkward things can happen. 1) you cut it with your chopsticks and the crispy glaze breaks off. 2) you bite into it and you look like a Neanderthal with food dropping out of your mouth. 3) other embarrassing moments that should be left alone. The pieces at Momo were perfect!!The rolls were so good. If you like tuna try the ultimate tuna roll. Spicy tuna with tuna on top, sitting in a spicy garlic type sauce/ oil. So good and the sauce keeps it moist! So yes, whenever I get my nails done at Euphora I'm high tailing to Momo for lunch... For MOre sushi and Agadashi tofu.Oh don't forget to check in on Yelp! We received free green tea ice cream! YAY!"
