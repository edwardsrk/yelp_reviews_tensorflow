b"3 stars for food, 5 Stars for service and value. Ordered the Szechuan Chicken entree. Good portion size for a single diner, but very bland and not spicy at all -- which is unfortunate because that's why I ordered it. Egg roll also very underwhelming filling-wise. Also the food was lukewarm. Was a takeout order, ready when I arrived. Dropped my chopsticks walking to the door and the staff woman ran me another pair. She also made sure I was carrying the bag so it was upright.Good service, underwhelming food."
