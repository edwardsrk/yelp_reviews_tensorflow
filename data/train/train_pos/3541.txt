b"I just wish this places wasn't so packed all of the time, but with food as good as this, what do you expect. I have only tried a few sauces (Carolina and Georgia Peach) and they are awesome. I get the wings every time I come here. I have tried the pulled pork, catfish sandwich and even a burger. The food is always great. I just really wish I could sit down and enjoy lunch here without a ridiculously long wait."
