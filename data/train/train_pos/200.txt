b'Definitely a spot to check out when looking for a quality sandwich at a reasonable price.The shop staff are very friendly and more than willing to accommodate any request. Do yourself a favor and get one of the steak sandwiches off of the menu. They are amazing. The ultra is my favorite.Also the Cancun fries are awesome. 1 order is for sue big enough to serve 2 people maybe even 3! This is one of the Peppis that takes credit cards as well. Not all do FYI'
