b"The patio is perfection. The chopped salad was very very very good. The steamed buns are 100% worth it. We only tried one I suggest all 3 in fact i would try all 3 and pass on the dumplings unless you have a huge appetite in which case do both but if you have to pick I'd do buns over dumplings. The ramen is very popular. It's not my cup of tea so I can't say it was to die for but the pork belly one is their most popular so we got it and it was fine but again not something I'm that in to so it tasted good but I wish we would have gotten the pad Thai with shrimp personally. Another thing I didn't get to try and wish I would have is the kimchi fried rice. Definitely will do that next time. And then their dessert menu only has 2 items there is a butter cake which wasn't worth it and then beignets which I didn't have but would try next time as well."
