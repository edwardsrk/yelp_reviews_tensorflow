b'Came to Phoenix from San Francisco specifically for a show at the Crescent Ballroom - and what an awesome venue. Love the outdoor seating and the drinks were great. They poured hefty servings of Glenlivet 12 and their Crescent Crush house cocktail - their take on a Greyhound - and served in a pint glass was dangerously delicious. The ballroom was perfect - small and loud. Definitely coming back.'
