b"I have returned to Clever Koi several times since my initial visit and they have really stepped up their game....they no longer have 5$ ramen, but, in exchange, they have tastier food. Their calamari, hummus, and tuna chips are all awesome! Their hh burger is tasty too. They also have a number of good and reasonably priced drinks. I've been converted into a fan!"
