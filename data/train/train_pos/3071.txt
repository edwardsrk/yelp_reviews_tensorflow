b"Five stars all the way for this property! I stay here at least a couple of times a year, and for one of Marriott's limited service brands, the staff here really go out of their way. For example, when I changed reservations in the middle of our stay, they got me a better room and actually moved our luggage to the new room while we were out for the day. They also address me by name when I come and go. In particular, the woman at the front desk on weekday mornings is delightful, as are the two guys who work overnight.  I had even provided some constructive feedback the last time I stayed, and one of them remembered me and still treated me very kindly.  Even at the breakfast, the woman comes over, clears my plate, and asks if she can get me anything else. I have never had anybody speak to me at a limited service hotel morning breakfast buffet before!I also observe whenever I am in the lobby. This level of service is not just provided to me because I am gold elite.  Everyone is greeted with a smile, a kind word and a willingness to help."
