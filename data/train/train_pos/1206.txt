b'This was my third time visiting this restaurant. As before the food was delicious, particularly the apps. Tip: try the spinach dip!!This is a great place for a large group and it is vegitarian friendly with a nice ambience.  My only complaint is the slow service. This place due to its popularity is often very busy and as such food orders (especially when you have larger groups) can take a very long time. Also each time I have visited I had a hard time stopping the wait staff. Bottom line: if you have time this is a great place.'
