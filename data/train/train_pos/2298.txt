b'Our original plans had to be changed due to the holiday, so we asked at the front desk of our hotel for a relaxing place with affordable drinks and good food.  He mentioned Else\'s and gave us the history of the place and it sounded up our alley.I noticed someone mentioned "coffee shop" in their review and it almost feels like a coffee shop where people realized the coffee just wasn\'t doing it for them anymore and they just evolved into drinking alcohol.  Atmosphere is great and has a bit of a pub feel.  Totally non-pretentious.  The servers were delightful and tolerated our massacring of the French language.  Drinking beer in Quebec is a treat.  You don\'t need to know all of the breweries... just pick a style of beer you like and try it.  I\'ve never been disappointed (and I\'m a bit of a beer snob).  We tried the Fried Spinach & Mushroom Pierogis (the server recommended them fried) and they were fabulous!  We were sharing so we did Fish & Chips as well, which was plenty good, but I was craving more Pierogis!All in all, it was a nice evening.  Service was great and the drinks and food were delicious.  The bill wasn\'t too damaging (this is Montreal, after all) and we left happy.  If we were locals, I could see us frequenting this place quite a bit.'
