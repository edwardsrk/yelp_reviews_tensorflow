b"I absolutely love nami! they offer so many so many vegan options which is great if you're like me and you can't eat dairy ;) I especially love their vegan donuts, and they always have new flavors to try. be warned though: they're not like krispy kremes or other regular donuts, because they are vegan, they are much more dense, and coupled with the fact that they are pretty large to begin with, you fill up rather quickly. so you don't need to buy more than one... or maybe two ;) the only downside to this place is that it's very laid back so there's really no sense of urgency in the employees, making time an issue. for example, it took 20 minutes for them to toast a bagel.. that being said this place is still the vegetarian cat's pajamas."
