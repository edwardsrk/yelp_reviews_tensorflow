b"Ambiance: Excellent, the colors and paintings of the restaurant is spectacular. The design isn't too flashy but it's very eye catching. The color coordination blends so smoothly making you look up after every bite Food: Amazing, Everything is so fresh and tasteful. You can taste fresh in each of the items they have. In my opinion that says a lot about a restaurant. Staff: Phenomenal, everyone is so friendly and helpful starting from the manager to host to kitchen staff. You guys are awesome. I recommend this place to anyone that has seen them. You must try it. Don't miss out"
