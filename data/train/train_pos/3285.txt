b'We have been going off and on for over 10 years with my inlaws who are members.  Pastor Dave is a very kind and approachable Pastor.  He married my husband and I in 2004 and baptised my daughter and two nephews.  Just recently we renewed our wedding vows with Pastor Dave in a very intimate, religious ceremony which was important to us.  The church is very traditional and we like attending with my inlaws for all the holidays.  I love the music ministry and my daughter has been attending a summer camp for three years.  I highly recommend this church.'
