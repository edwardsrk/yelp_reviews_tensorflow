b"My boyfriend and I were so excited for this restaurant to open because it's so close to his house! We have been here three different times and were happy each time. I suggest going on Wednesdays for wing night! Their wings are great! We also enjoyed the pizza, the crust is awesome. The meatballs and Cuban sandwich were just okay...which is why I chose 4 stars rather than 5. They also have a great beer selection!"
