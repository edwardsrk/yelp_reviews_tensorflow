b"100th Bomb Group located on Brookpark Road stands out like a sore thumb.  After the relocation of a runway at Hopkins they forced the closure of the old location.  The old version was a real gem.  I will never forget how they had headsets at each table that you could listen to Hopkins ATC while eating.  Very Cool!  The new location(Which has been here for several years now) is breathtaking.  They spent some serious money to make this place memorable.  The inside has awesome features and big widows to give you a nice vantage point of the airfield.  (Perfect to watch the 3 regional jets that depart every hour).  As a fellow Yelper has posted, the bar has some free munchies during happy hour which is a nice touch.  My problem with the Bomb Group is it is a bit stuffy for my liking.  If i want to watch planes, I don't want it to be a white tablecloth event.  The entrees are good, however you will be paying about 20 dollars per plate.  The food could have better taste for what you are paying.The outdoor deck and patio are beautiful, and during the summer they have great drink specials.  Hope this helps!"
