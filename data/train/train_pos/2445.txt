b"One Spanish Word: Michelada.Not many Mexican places around town do the Michelada justice (or even know it really), which is pretty funny considering our neighbors to the south are all about it. And with good reason. A Michelada is Mexican beer and lime juice, with or without tomato juice or clamato, and a salted rim. It's delicious, and Otro's includes the awesome touch of red pepper infused salt on the rim for that extra kick. Normally I wouldn't lead a review with a drink, but that just tells you how excited I was about it.Now, the food. I like meaty Mexican food, so I've stuck to the tortas and burritos here, both of which are really tasty. I recommend the carne torta and the al Pastor burrito or torta. Portion sizes are OK, not insultingly small, and not too big either. A burrito is about a foot long and you can wrap one hand around it, and a torta is served on a standard size torta roll. I like to eat, but I have never been known to have a gigantic capacity, and I have always finished everything on my plate but not left hungry.As others have said, the guacamole is legit. Plenty of citrus flavor that makes it pop. I would also recommend the queso fundido if you like cheese and don't care about calories."
