b"Simple and short - cant beat a place that brews its own beer.  The Scottsdale location is great, usually really quiet with good service, and they have pretty good food for a bar.  Fish and chips are surprisingly really good, so are the chicken fingers (I'm sorry I like late night finger food)Their beers are great with a great selecion, from chocolates to very hoppy to wheaty to heffs to the oh so yummy AZ peach.  Also, you can take home big jugs with fresh tap beer if you want for a pretty good price, always good if you're lookin to continue your good time at home"
