b"This place rocks!Highlights:-The buns. Oooooh the buns. Freshly baked goodness.-The gelato: WOW! What a standout. I didn't come here looking to try the Gelato, but the owner gave me a free sample (he said he really wants to get the word out about their in-house made gelato), and wow, was I ever glad I tried it!  For me, the Gelato outshined the burger I had. I tried the salted caramel (heaven. mmmmmmm mmmm), and the Straciatella (also yummy.) Easily some of the best Gelato I have ever had the extreme pleasure of consuming. They also have a Yelp check-in offer to upsize your Gelato for free! Score!-The service. SOOO super friendly and helpful.-The awesome board you can draw on while waiting for your yummy food.-The fact that you can call ahead for your order if you're in a rushMy chicken burger was flavourful and juicy, though a bit too greasy for my liking. Minus a few points for that.All in all, I will definitely be back to try the beef burgers, as well some more of the deliciously amazing Gelato!"
