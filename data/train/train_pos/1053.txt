b"Bought a slice of rhubarb pie and a nanaimo bar...DEELISH!I also tried a bit of my friend's chocolate pecan shortbread and man...that was good too.  Their pastries are very well worth their price and sometimes you can even find end of the day daily specials!  Unlike a lot of bakeries that make sweet baked goods, they add just the right amount of sugar - not too sweet but not bland either. I will definitely stop by this bakery every time I am in the Kensington Market area!"
