b'Super cute spot! The deck outside has a really cool view of the lake, and you can choose your desired wine for your meal from the wine shop on the inside. It has a nice selection too! We had the escargot, beef tartare, fish of the day, the lobster croissant, and the lava cake with a great bottle of Chablis. The service was a little slow that day, but I think we were a little too tipsy to notice. Its a really great place for a date and I would love to come back again.'
