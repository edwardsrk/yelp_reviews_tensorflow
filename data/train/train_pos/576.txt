b"We had a two bedroom suite which was really nice and awesome. It felt like living in a fancy apartment with your friends for a few days. Huge projector to watch movies and tv on and I loooved the shades which allow the room to be completely dark while you sleep in and recover from your hangover. I was a little disappoint that in a nice hotel like this the pillows and blankets weren't down. And the lobby was a really simple and plain compared to all the other Vegas hotels and casinos. Visited Koi the first night for a good time, cheap open bar for goods was a great deal and visited the Pussycat Dolls lounge for a fun time. Got in for free. Nice bouncers, got to dance onstage, and had a blast. Great music too. The pool also seemed really nice, only this was I went in February so we didn't get a chance to swim. I would def stay here again though. Having a mall right under you was great too!"
