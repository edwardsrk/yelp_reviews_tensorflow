b'This might be the best pizza I have ever eaten. New York style thin crust with high quality ingredients on top. They have thick crust selections as well. New York theme and decor. Very friendly and good service. The place is packed in the evening even on weekdays. Superb price/value on food and drinks. Located across 215 about 20 minutes from the strip in the suburbs of Las Vegas. If you go by cab be prepared to wait a long time for one to pick you up.  There are not many destinations for cab drivers in this part of Vegas so they do not like driving one way without a fare to pick you up.'
