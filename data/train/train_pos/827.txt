b"First off I did not pay the bill for my dinner here and I read some complaints that they are overpriced.  I find it hard to believe but I am sure it is not cheap - no place in a high end casino in Vegas is...  Anyway, that said I enjoyed a solid meal here.  I had the Kobe beef tacos that were a little spicy but great (did not appreciate any noticeable difference in the beef quality though).  The rock shrimp tempura was really good and maybe my favorite thing.  The tuna sushi was very fresh tasting.  I could have passed on the sea urchin - but it's not really my thing.  However, one of my companions who likes this/sea urchin said it was some of the best he has had.  All in all everything was fine, actually fine +.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was classy.  We took some customers here and they were happy.  The location is excellent if you are in Mandalay Bay or on that South end of the strip.  I would go back if I was in the area."
