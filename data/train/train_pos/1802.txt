b"I found this on Yelp, and love the food here so much that even though it's off the beaten track for me, I often try to bail off the 401 while on roadtrips just to go eat here.I'm vegetarian, and their veggie wrap, for the money, is one of the best.  There is also a pretty fabulous potato bread (bolani), which, although you have to call ahead if you want it to arrive while you are eating the rest of your food, is wonderful.They also do a good job of managing rushes by pre-prepping trays etc., but because a lot  of the food is prepped when you order it, expect a bit of a wait."
