b"We had driven by here so often and it's always crowded. The street appeal was not so good however, we decided that if so many people were inside, there had to be something going on. There was! The breakfast huevos rancheros is amazing! The coffee is excellent (finally a place that knows how to make coffee!), the carrot cake is delish and so much more. We've been there several times now and it will always be a cozy, funky place to go and eat.What a great find for Bowness!"
