b"Delicious drinks and some of them come with a bit of a show (liquid nitrogen and hand-chiseled ice cubes, etc)! I wouldn't recommend coming here for beer. Stick to the cocktails and you will be very happy. The space is a bit awkward for seating, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings when Gib's gets very busy. I think this is a good spot for a drink before or after dinner in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make it a destination for the night. For one, you may not find anywhere to park yourself and hang out for the evening if Gib's is busy. Second, the drinks are pricey, so you're looking at an expensive evening if you come for more than a drink or two. They do have a happy hour, but it only applies to a few of their cocktails. Try the curry popcorn, you won't be disappointed.The bartenders are very friendly and even give you samples if you ask nicely!"
