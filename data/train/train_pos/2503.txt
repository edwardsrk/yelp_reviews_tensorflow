b'Stopped in with my hubby at lunch time to check this place out. He had steak quesadilla and it was large and delicious. I had a 2 taco plate, 1 calamari & 1 crispy fish (you can mix & match!). Everything was brought out fresh and hot, quickly and with a smile. Our server paid us just the right amount of attention to make it a great experience. We will definitely be back to support this local gem :-)'
