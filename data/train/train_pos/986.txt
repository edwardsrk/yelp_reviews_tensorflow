b"This rating is based on the bar scene only- the d\xc3\xa9cor is sexy and vibrant. They have a great happy hour here where you can indulge in high end liquor and unique cocktails. The staff is very friendly, in true French Canadian fashion, and was eager to create us cocktails, give us information on the hot spots in the city and converse with us about restaurants nearby. Our bartender created me an off the menu cocktail which was absolutely wonderful; the attention to detail was unmatchable. The DJ had a great mix of music and the place wasn't insanely packed so you could easily get a drink. We actually were able to sit at the bar on both Friday and Saturday. Price points are a bit high for cocktails, but they are high end, so what do you expect?When I return to Montreal, this is the first place I will post up for a nice drink and break from the endless amounts of walking throughout the old city."
