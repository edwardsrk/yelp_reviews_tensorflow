b"We've been taking our Porsche Cayenne there for service since we purchased it in 2011. Dan Sheridan is our Service Advisor and has been the best Service Advisor we've ever had. He's always so helpful and goes above and beyond. Recently our car was hit from behind and had to have the bumper replaced and the lift gait re painted. The body/paint department did a good job but after taking it home I realized there was clear coat overspray all over the back window. When I took it back, Dan and I noticed it was all over the car. They had my car for another 3 days. When I picked it up, there was still clear coat overspray on the drivers side mirror. Dan made sure it was taken care of right away and apologized profusely (not that it was his fault at all). I spoke with the Supervisor for body work and he couldn't even believe it got through quality control the way it was, twice. He offered me a free detail which were taking them up on. I probably wouldn't use their body shop again but will always go to Dan for service. He's the best and shows you how much he cares about you as a customer and a person. When it comes time to buy a new car, we will definitely buy from there."
