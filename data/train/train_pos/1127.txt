b"I really enjoyed myself here at MWC.  I came with 3 girlfriends as a 'girls night out.'  We were immediately greeted and taken to a table.  The ambiance, vibe of the wine bar was exactly what I picture in my head when I think wine bar.  I was dark, but not too dark.  Amber lighting and candlelit tables.  This is a great spot for a date as well.  My girlfriends and I shared 3 appetizers. We ordered the spicy crab dip, French fries and the rosemary salted sweet potato fries that were on as a special.  Both fries were perfectly salted and flavored.  They even came in these cute little wire baskets that look like mini deep fry baskets.  The service was on point as well.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the wine and great with the descriptions.  They have a large selection of wine that is reasonably priced.  I will definitely return and recommend!"
