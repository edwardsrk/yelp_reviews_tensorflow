b"The wonderful thing about Las Vegas is the access to shops that you might not find in your hometown.  The last time I was in a Tod's was in Paris and you can't help but wander in to look at the M&M colorful assortment of loafers.  I want one in every color but they're around $600 a pair! Nonetheless, it's fun to come in and look anyway. Located inside the Forum Shops at Cesar's Palace"
