b'I love Lola\'s on Central. Great location that\'s not too far away from the Biltmore. Unless it\'s super packed at Hula\'s for some reason, you should always be able to find a space to park. There\'s plenty of spaces to sit and work with their free Wi-Fi. I particularly liike working at the "bar" that overlooks Central. Their music is kind of hipster-y, which is appreciated in a coffee shop, especially if you\'ve spent too many days at Starbucks like I have. However, the music is a little loud in case you want a quieter place to work out of. There\'s also cute seating outside for a perfect weekend date coffee shop. The blanco is my favorite - sort of a white mocha concoction which I\'m sure is over anyone\'s caloric intake for the morning, but a great drink nonetheless. They\'ve got a ton of pastries, but unfortunately gluten free goodies every now and then. If Lola\'s would offer that - it would be totally perfect!'
