b'Ordered the gluten free pesto party pizza. It was so delicious I ate the whole pizza save for one slice I gave to a co-worker. They lose a star because I felt nickel and dimed for everything. I ordered my pizza carry out and got charged for one ranch and hot peppers, and I almost got charged for a water cup because I wanted one with a lid but the guy behind the register was nice enough to just give it to me.  So after the gluten free crust (which I expect to pay extra for) and the little condiments, and tip I spent $18 on a personal pizza. A little on the pricey side for lunch.'
