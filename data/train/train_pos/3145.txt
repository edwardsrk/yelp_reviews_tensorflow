b"A cafe with a very chill and relaxed ambience. The menu has a good variety, and out of the six drinks we tried, we weren't disappointed. We tried a mango smoothie, banana frozen latti, matcha latti, caramel latti, and from their signature teas: Emerald and Scarlett. We also tried the raindrop dessert and it's unique and something to definitely try, but maybe only once. The prices are very reasonable and I'm excited to try more! Oh, and the staff is very nice!"
