b"Came here with a bunch of people to watch the Panthers slaughter the Cardinals (which we did).  I mean the place is okay but geez you need to upgrade your outdoor seating space; there's plastic instead of windows, there was only one heater in 30-degree weather, and the speakers out there were dated and didn't give the feeling of being at a football.But it's a bar.  Just drink some more and it'll start looking better."
