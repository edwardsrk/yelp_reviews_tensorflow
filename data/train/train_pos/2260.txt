b'We were trying to get into Primanti Bros for a sub but were over taken by 2 bus fulls of high school students. Instead we hit Bella Notte as I was craving a spicey sausage sub.....OH BOY....this bread it came on was off the hook. Crunchy, chewy, and never got soggy with all the sauce. The sausage was perfect too will all the peppers and onions. YUMMY! My buddy got the Italian Satallion......that sandwich was total money!!! He said I shouldnt try Primanti Bros after this or I might be unimpressed. I am sticking to Bella Notte!!'
