b'We were feeling lazy tonight so I got on Yelp and seen that this place delivers to us, even though we live pretty far from it.  We ordered a noodle dish, combo fried rice, sweet and sour Thai chicken, Thai Tea, and crab rangoons.   Pretty safe bets for a first time try at a new Asian place.  Next time we plan to be more adventurous because the food was very good.  Large portions, a lot of added proteins to the entrees, not greasy and very well packaged.  The noodle dish was a little bland, but it was still very good.  My fave was the crab Rangoon.   They were a little cold when they reached us, but you could tell they were handmade with tons of filling.  The delivery took a little over an hour on a Friday night, and was only $3.  They put a menu in our bag, so it will definitely go in our keep pile.  :)'
