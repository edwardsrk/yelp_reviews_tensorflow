b"Stopped by because we saw that the patio had a good amount of people so we wanted to see what was causing the crowd. We we're visiting from California and wanted to try out some AZ brews. Happy to report that we were satisfied with our choices the night we came in. We also ordered the brussels and bacon pizza. Definitely not your tradition pizza toppings but it was delicious. Will be back again when we're back in town."
