b"Oh boy! I love veggie restaurants! Especially Asian influenced.  I usually try the General Tzo Chick'N when I try out a place for the first time. Even not so good that is stomach-able ^_^. Soo delicious, lunches are priced right!  My only ding would be the soup was pretty salty. I'm a fan and will come back. They have a veggie meat ball that I'm curious about. I have a sunflower at home that has a delicious ball that tastes of cinnamon and cumin. Hard to find how to make so if soy and shiitake mushrooms are the real ingredients to what I have back home, then oh boy!!!Ok the bathrooms are single and clean for the populated traffic. Staff was pleasant and checked up on us.  Can't wait to see them again :)"
