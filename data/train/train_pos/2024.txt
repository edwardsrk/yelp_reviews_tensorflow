b"I parked somewhere I shouldn't have parked, and got towed. Ugh, my bad. But the experience actually was way better than I expected. Howard and his apprentice offered to pick me up and take me to their shop, since they were in the neighborhood, which saved me quite a hassle. He was professional and friendly (we had some time to kill as we went thru rush hour traffic) and I couldn't ask for anything more."
