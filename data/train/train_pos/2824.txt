b"We absolutely LOVE Giant Rustic Pizza! We live about 20 minutes away and we'll make the drive for their yummy pizza. Their slices are ooey gooey cheesy slices of heaven! They have a cool lunch special - 2 slices and a drink for about $6. They used to have a specialty slice of the day written on a board behind the register, but on my last visit the board was gone. I'm assuming they no longer offer specialty slices. Either way, its good stuff! Giant Rustic is nestled in between a waxing studio and a nail boutique. Friendly workers and plenty of parking."
