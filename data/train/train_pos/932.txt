b"I'm from out of town and stopped in on my way through. Initially I was very impressed with the bartender Kristin. She was having such a good time with everyone at the bar and had a substantial conversation with me. I was nervous about sitting by myself since I was alone and she made me feel like I was home. The food was sub par. I left full and it was a decent price but i guess that's all that really matters."
