b'I visited Cenacolo again. It has been a while since I was there. I was happily impressed by the food the service and now they offer wine but you can also bring your own bottle. The have added many tables and they seem to be a happening place. Kudos to them! I would like them to have a little back ground music, to me this always helps when you have tables so close to each other.  They have set some lower ceiling to the area with higher ceilings,  which was loud before. This has improved much the noise. Last time I was not able to hear well our own conversation. Overall I would recommend the place for their food originality and good service.'
