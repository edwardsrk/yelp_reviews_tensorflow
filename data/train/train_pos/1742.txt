b"This place is perfect for a morning outing with your toddler. They have a nice patio area with a splash pad for the little ones. The patio is partially shaded by trees which makes it bearable with our intense hot weather. We had a yogurt parfait and an oatmeal which were good. I'm a serious latte drinker and it was okay. I gave it four stars for ambiance (especially a place for my kiddo to enjoy) and food. Wish this place was closer to my house!"
