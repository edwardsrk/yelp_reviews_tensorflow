b"I've only been here once, but it was a good experience. There are several dog parks in one large park area, including one with a water area for some doggie swimming. The space in the fenced in areas seemed ample. The only thing I did not like was that you had to leave the fenced area in which you were to access the water fountain for your dog to get a drink. There should have been a water fountain placed in each of the park areas. This place is kind of far and I was only down there because of an errand, so I may return on another occasion when I'm not too busy."
