b'for me it is local drinking spot (4-5 stars) ... neighborhood, local bar. the food is average (3 stars) but I have always received great service (4-5 stars). I frequent the place once or twice a month over several years. Typically I get beer and taco. as I read the other reviews on negative service, not sure that I can relate ... maybe a one off experience. again, I have had very few bad service experiences over the years and those bad occasions have happened during a taco Tuesday experience when they are understaffed. thus I stopped going on Tuesdays ...'
