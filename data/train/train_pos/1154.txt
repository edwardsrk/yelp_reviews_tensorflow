b"Came here for a little afternoon treat with my friend. We arrived when the place just opened and was greeted by the owner himself. He seem to be the only person running the place. He directed us to the menu that was placed across from the cash register. Note: you order first then seat yourself. There's a water station if you get thirsty and also a bin where you would place your dirty dishes in after you're done.Always enjoyed creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and I was super excited to try one of his many creations. He offer a variety of interesting flavours that all sound so yummy. I chose the Vietnamese coffee paired with a scoop of earl gray ice cream. The creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was tasty, coffee flavour was strong, it was drizzled with condense milk and I enjoyed watching it being torched infront of me. I felt that the earl gray ice cream was definitely needed or some kind of ice cream because it helps to balance out the sweetness and rich flavour of the Vietnamese flavour creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. The ice cream was made perfect in my opinion as earl gray taste was present, it was creamy and not overly sweet. The owner actually recommended to have the ice cream first then my creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e after in my particular pairing. Moreover, the atmosphere of this place was pleasing and comfortable. You can study or hang out with your group of friends. He definitely made use of every square footage of this place. Also the selection of desserts from ice cream to creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and waffles. I will definitely come back to try the waffles because the pictures I've seen on yelp look so yummy."
