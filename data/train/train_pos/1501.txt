b'We were visiting Toronto from Upstate NY - had never been there before. When visiting a new city my wife and I do our best to "live like a local"... and we had a difficult time choosing where to eat as it seems Toronto has just about anything you can think of. But we decided upon Bannock because they were listed as Canadian Cuisine - which is something I\'m unfamiliar with. We were not disappointed, whatsoever. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was intimate, and kinda trendy. The service was wonderful. The price was very reasonable... we spent $100 for two dinners, desserts, and drinks. Try the Bannock Bannock - the smoked salmon was perfect.'
