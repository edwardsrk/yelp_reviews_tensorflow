b"Clevelander is a great place to stop in before a Tribe game. A few of us were looking for a place to grab a quick bite and a couple drinks before went to the game and started paying an arm and a leg for beers. The patio was pretty busy so we ducked inside and were pleased to discover there were plenty of open spaces. Service took a little while, but I think they were either under staffed or just busy. The beer was cheap enough, the food was alright, and we got to the game with time to spare. I haven't been outside of game nights, but I think that's what this place was built for."
