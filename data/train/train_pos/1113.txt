b"Love coming here to Fiddler's. it is a small small place, and it is pretty difficult to find. It is part of a compound or something. I am not sure what the whole property is, but it is odd.Anyways it is a small acoustics only venue where open mic nights are impressive, and other nights with the talent coming in are chill.Always has a cover, but that isn't that bad since that cover goes into running the place (i am pretty sure). the usuals here are amazing musicians and you would be lucky to hear them.I love it when the old guys play they are amazing guitarists"
