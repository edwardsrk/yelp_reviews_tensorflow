b'Great food, friendly service, lovely atmosphere. Not "too cool for school" or intimidating, just warm and welcoming (literally, warm: they have a fireplace)! It\'s a pub but it\'s a little bit fancier and  has fewer blaring TVs. The only reason I didn\'t give it 5 stars is that I found the beers and wines a little pricey and I have only tried the Nachos (which were TO DIE FOR).'
