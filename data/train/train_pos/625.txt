b"The outside seems a little sketchy, but when you walk in the dim lighting and modern look is a great setting. My f and I decided to give the place a try since we lived down the street and seen the great reviews. The lady that took our order was very sweet and tentative. The food was good we ordered the General Tso's chicken and Pork fried rice. I will definitely be back in for another bite."
