b'We ate breakfast at Avenue Diner twice during a visit to Calgary.  Enjoyed it both times.  Service was good even though it was busy.  The carrot cake waffels were delicious.  My kids did great there as well.  They enjoyed the food and loved the hot chocolate with whipped cream that our waitress fixed for them.  I will be back for breakfast next trip to Calgary!'
