b"Solid place for seafood just like your Hot n juicy and Boiling crab I think the flavor here is the closest you will get to boiling crab the only difference is the sauce isn't as thick it's more of a watery sauce and still taste good. I will say this don't order fried rice here they haven't mastered it yet and I think it's because they're not cooking it in a wok. It's very mushy and lacks flavor. The seafood though is fire and I love the packages they offer I think if they can work on these things like their side dishes they will be a force to be reckon with. Oh btw they have a lobster claw game for $2 a play and I think this makes it pretty fun to come here. Don't pass this place up I think they have great potential."
