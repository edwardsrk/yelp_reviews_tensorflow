b"After grabbing some wonton noodles at JCK, I stumbled upon this place...without reading any reviews.I'm alright with Chinese buns, both sweet/savoury, and I do have my favourites.  However, for the most part, I just try not to eat them that much 'cause they're soo abundant and I get sick of them.  Plus, they're not conducive to staying trim!Anyway, I was surprised about the prices.  Has it been this long since I've actually purchased Chinese buns?  Was I in some kinda time-warp?  As per my photo, Dan Tats (Chinese egg tarts) were $0.60/$0.70.  That's pretty cheap, considering the Portuguese version is like at least $1!  Other buns were ~$0.70/0.80 which is also quite good.So far, I just tried the Coconut Tart and it was very good.  Fresh, moist, and not dry and overly sweet like a lot of places!The key though in the buns is that they're eaten FRESH.  So don't be a hog and buy a bunch of them when you're not gonna eat it right away!"
