b"GREAT restaurant for families. My wife and I go with our 2 kids (age 4 and 2) and have gone with other families multiple times.The service has been excellent and gets us in and out quickly (always important with kids) and is very understanding.Food-wise, I recommend the carnitas and my wife likes their enchiladas. Their homemade guacamole is phenomenal and they make it right by your table.  recently had the shrimp quesadilla which was only ok.they also make great margaritas that are quite strong (again helping with the kids!)It's not the cheapest Mexican place but worth it service-wise."
