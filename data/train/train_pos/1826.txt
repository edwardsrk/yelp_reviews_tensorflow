b"This pizza was very flavorful!  We got an all meat one and we were not disappointed.  We got back to our room at Excalibur at around 11:45 after seeing Britney Spears.  We were starving and decided to call this place.  It was delivered in 45 minutes.  Not bad.  It tasted home-made, and the delivery man was a nice man.  I lived everything about our experience, except for the fact that the woman on the phone who took my order was short in her words, giving me a bit of attitude.  That's the only reason I am not giving a 5-star rating."
