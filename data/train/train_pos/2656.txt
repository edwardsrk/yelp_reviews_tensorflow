b'Okay, let me make this review as simple as possible: Flower Child is like the trendy (and expensive) love child of Panera. You walk up and order, then seat yourself and they bring food out. So many healthy options, many vegan or vegetarian, and the wine is organic. This location is sort of loud, but great for people watching. Be prepared for you meal to be in the $15ish range.'
