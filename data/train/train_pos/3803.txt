b"Upgraded version of Roberto's. Same menu, taste and price but better service and quality. Roberto's has recently changed their size for shrimp cocktail from 32oz to 22oz (med drink size) which is a lot less than satisfying especially for shrimp cocktail lovers. I'd prefer Frausto's over Roberto's. The service again is a lot more pleasant."
