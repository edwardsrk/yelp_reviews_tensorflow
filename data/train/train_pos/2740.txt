b"Don't let the outside fool you folks! The food here is delicious. Ok do for the breakdown....Decore: meh.. (most Asian restaurants though fall into this category) I go for the food, not ambiance Service: Excellent Food: tasty! I actually have not had the pho. Every time I come I always end up with the Bun bo hue soup. The spicy ness of the soup is perfect, so flavorful and the amount of protein seems endless! I have also had the spring rolls, good and the veggies are fresh. Someday I will move past the Bun bo hue and try the pho, which I assume will be equally as tasty. Give this place a go!"
