b"Hunting around on Yelp this evening at 5:50pm on a Friday for a place to eat that wasn't booked and found this little gem. Moon is super. And I genuinely mean this. I Love this guy. So genuine.We had edamame and tempura to start which was tasty, but the real winner was the hot rock bibimbap and ginger honey tea. Throughly enjoyed both the food, and the dining experience."
