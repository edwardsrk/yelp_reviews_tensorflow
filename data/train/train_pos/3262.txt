b"Chef Joel Robuchon's restaurant is my siren song...love, love, love it!  A gorgeous little jewel box, stars removed from the casino.  The decor, bar, cuisine, wine list, staff and service, all so perfect, I could rhapsodize about the myriad joys I've experienced here forever.  The many, many times I've enjoyed the 16 course tasting menu, so truly scrumptious and amazing offerings, executed so perfectly and plated so exquisitely it's almost a crime to eat them!  Executive Chef Claude Le Tohic is a true gem and helms the venue like the marvel it truly is!  My favorite restaurant in the country!"
