b'Stopped here for lunch.  Chips had a good texture with just enough salt.  Three different salsas were offered and all three were quite tasty.  The portions could have been a little bigger.  I ordered the breaded fish tacos and they were very fresh and flavorful.  Could have used more lemon though.  The decor was eclectic and colorful.  The waitress friendly and attentive.My only quibble is that the meal cost me $15 for the meal and a soda.  A little high, but no regrets.Tom'
