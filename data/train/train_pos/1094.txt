b"So this is Bobby Flay's restaurant so I expected high prices and good food and I got both. Everything I ate was delicious, from the array of rolls/breads to potent spirits. A couple of people ordered the shrimp appetizer. Delicious would be an understatment. For the meal a couple of us had the pork, one person got the steak and I had the Halibut. I tasted all of the meals and they were awesome. Worth the price. You are in Vegas, so you have to splurge a bit!"
