b"I live in Austin, TX and have an old 1992 Porsche 968.  When I need parts for my car I call these guys directly. They find or get what I need for my car, and at a great price. Lots of Porsche dealerships and parts departments don't even know what a 968 is till they punch it up on there computer. Next time I'm in Las Vegas I'm gonna go see the people at Gaudin! Maybe they'll let me test drive a GT3 RS!!"
