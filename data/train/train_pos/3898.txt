b'The food was delicious and the service was great. I got the $2.99 deuces wild (2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes) it was perfect, the over medium eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly. My husband got the prime rib sandwich with fries for $7.99. The prime rib was cut thick and piled high and served with au jus. I would 100% recommend.'
