b"We stumbled upon Shishalicious by chance and thought to give it a try. I can definitely say this was a pleasant surprise. The owner (Theva) was friendly and checked in on us periodically to make sure everything was to our taste. I would highly recommend the baklava and the fresh mint lemonade while you're enjoying their patio on a sunny day, with or without shisha :)"
