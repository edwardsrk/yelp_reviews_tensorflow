b"Nicholas Coffee is an awesome location right near market square downtown which draws quite a crowd! I walked in and was overwhelmed by the entire wall featuring different coffee and tea flavors. I ordered a skinny vanilla latte and my friend tried one of the tea options to which she said was the best tea she's ever had! I enjoyed my latte, but I was disappointed that there was no where to sit down inside. So, keep in mind that this is a to-go kind of place, but a perfect one for a quick stop on your commute to work downtown."
