b"I thought this casino was great. They have a plethora of slots including my favorite...CLUE! We didn't play tables because they were rather crowded. We went after an Indian's game so it was PACKED. They offer a parking deal where if you gamble for 30 minutes and spend approximately $75 parking is free. You must be a member of the players club. There was a line to join so I recommend doing it before the game. I thought it was fabulous that they are a smoke free casino. Love it!!! The employees were all very friendly and they kept it classy. We will be back!"
