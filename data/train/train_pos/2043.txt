b"If you've seen one Starbucks, you've basically seen them all. But this newly opened location inside the Venetian is the largest on the strip, and it's one of the few in Vegas with cold brew nitro on tap. They just opened last week and the staff still seems to be in training, so they're a little slow, but my pumpkin spice frap w chocolate drizzle was worth the wait.  It's located on the casino level where Venetian and Palazzo meet right at the entrance to Sands Expo, so this place will be a total cluster during big shows. But thanks to way too subtle signage and beautiful metal screen walls that make it look like an asian restaurant, it was empty even at the start of a Vegas weekend.Positives - they don't seem to have jacked up the prices further because it's in a casino, it's pretty, has lots of seating and outlets.  Negatives - not much retail, can't use the mobile order option with the app, and you can't redeem your rewards freebies here."
