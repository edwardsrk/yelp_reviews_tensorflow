b"Very professional and was an amazing bang for the buck!  Unlike the cheap DIY looking photo walls that you usually see at parties nowadays, this is an ACTUAL photobooth; but not the type you and your best friend would squeeze into at the strip malls.  This was large enough to fit our entire family of 6 adults in a frame with no issues - masks, hats, wigs, and tiaras and all! Best part of an actual booth vs a photo wall was the ability to have your photos show outside the booth for others to enjoy but you have the privacy to prep your poses for each shot without staring at the rest of the guests waiting in line or having those eating putting a damper on your diva shot! Two's company photbooth were very good with the kids; they were patient and were very professional and efficient in managing the booths.  They provided a couple bins of props, signs and costumes and the pictures came out beautifully with our personal touches and messages personalized on the photos.  We were given multiple options when deciding the size of the photos and we were asked how they can customize the template to reflect and match the occasion right down to the message. The photobooth was a blast and we received a lot of compliments on the booth as being one of the highlights of the evening.Highly recommended!!!"
