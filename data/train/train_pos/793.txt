b'I have been coming here for my regular dental maintenance for 3 years.  Receptionists are friendly and office is clean and bright.  Once your contact is in their system, you will receive a call or an email to remind you of your next dental check up, and even reminder for your scheduled appointment.  So far I have received professional service from their nurses and dentists.I recommend this location especially if you have insurance coverage.  It is also because of its convenient location ( under the PATH system at Bay and Adelaide), and the consistent professional service.'
