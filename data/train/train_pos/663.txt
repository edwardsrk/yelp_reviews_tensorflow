b"This was my first trip to this restaurant. We went for breakfast and I must say we were very pleased. The portions are huge and the food is really good. I got the banana pecan caramel pancakes and he got this Mexican style eggs Benedict that was amazing.  I will tell you that I felt that our waiter was kind of snooty with us however that would not stop me from going back. I believe in giving everybody the benefit of the doubt and if in the future he's there and continues to have the attitude I'll just ask for a different waitress. I definitely won't let a snooty waiter keep me from enjoying amazing food. They are doing a remodel as of yesterday so it'll be interesting to see what the restaurant looks like once the remodel is done."
