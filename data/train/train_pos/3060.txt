b"Lawry's is everything a good restaurant should be. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and Lawry's made our night unforgettable.Their service was impeccable- from the sweet hostess who was unfazed when we arrived 30 minutes late to our reservation, to the warm friendly bartender who chatted us up like we were old friends, to the waiter who was not condescending in the least bit, to the busboys who guided me back to my table when I drunkenly stumbled into the kitchen.The food was solid. The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.All in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!) Major points up for this, we were an intoxicated mess that night and he should've just shooed us out the door. I left with a huge smile on my face and a slightly renewed faith that there are still nice people in the world."
