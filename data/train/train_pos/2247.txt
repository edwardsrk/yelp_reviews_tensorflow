b"Drive across town to check this place out only because of a picture on yelp that showed pork buns. Well.. they no longer make them lol. Got the pho with rare beef and beef ball, and egg rolls. Pho was great and the egg rolls were ehh ok. I guess if I'm ever in the area and crave some pho I would stop by again."
