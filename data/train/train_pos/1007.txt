b"Got a social media deal so had to try this place. Started with half a dozen oysters. They were so good!  The horseradish had good kick and it came with a sauce that was just so tasty. I hadn't had oysters for so long I indulged in another half dozen. Mmmm.  The waiter said the owner takes particular care in ensuring the oysters are fresh shipping them in temperature controlled containers. Daughter got the crispy calamari and contrary to what I thought, the calamari is tender and served hot.  No hard chewy calamari here. The sauce is refreshing also, light and lemony.  I ate too much.Moving on to the salad. The ceasar is served with a Parmesan cracker. Good but nothing to write home about. Wife had the wedge salad, she said the dressing was a tad too watery.Main dish was a bit disappointing. My daughter had the clams and pasta dish. Clams were really salty...voodoo clams. The pasta was better. I had the Spaghetti and Halibut. That dish was rather plain.  The wife had lobster ravioli. She enjoyed it so that was the best dish of the three. Gnocchi side was good, slightly mushy but tasty.Dessert was creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and chocolate lava type cake. Both were very good. The deal included a lemonchello. Man that lemonchello was strong. Yowzaa!  So next time I'm coming here and eating oysters, calamari and dessert!"
