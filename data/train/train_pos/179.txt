b"A quick lunch Noticed BBQ with good ratings nearby so felt the need...haven't had decent BBQ in awhile. Service was great Small dining area (or felt small during lunch lol)Had the 2 meat meal. Brisket was delicious with good flavorTurkey was moist with good flavor (seldom can I find decent smoked turkey, a real treat)Mac n cheese was very good Beans were quite bland in my opinion. The little cornbread things (mini muffins) were dry but good flavor Nothing needed sauce.. to me that's a good sign. (Sauce is available )Big disappointment was the side cups and soda cups..styrofoam! Better options out there."
