b'This place is a collector\'s candy store.Wifey likes to collect vintage hats and I like to search for all types of food collectibles, and cool vintage toys. This place has it all.The place is clean, and the workers are very helpful. You can even still bargain with them to get a sweet deal on an item you may have your eye on.Clothes, bikes, jewelry, toys, etc. Some guy even bought a huge Michael Jordan Statue!Its always cool to check out these kinds of places. It\'ll not only take you down memory lane, but you may find something that has sentimental value and you\'ll be happy you stopped in!...ALOHA!!!YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(335/365) " Retro Vintage Junk!?!?"'
