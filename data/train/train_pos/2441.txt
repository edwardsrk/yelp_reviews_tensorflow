b"We arrived for our reservation at 7:15pm.  They seated us right on time.  The resturant was fairly loud at first but once the family dinner croed cleared out at 7:30pm it quieted down.  The food and service was outstanding, and at a very reasonable price.  I highly recommend Mimi's very a late dinner."
