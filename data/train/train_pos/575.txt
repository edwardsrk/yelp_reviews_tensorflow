b'The manager Liz called to apologize for the bad service.  I love it when the managers follow up and make an effort to correct the problem.  Liz gets extra credit for the fast response.  My next visit I checked in at the front desk and the young lady hand me a membership card and explained the check in process.  Great job on following up with the front desk staff, service was greatly improved.'
