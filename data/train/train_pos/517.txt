b"Hotel exceded our expectations. Beds were VERY COMFORTABLE. Room was clean. Missed with TV channels but that was snafu with Time Warner Cable digital conversion. Smoking rooms need to be all on ONE FLOOR FORTHWITH! Owner take notice. We as non-smokers don't want to smell those carcinogens for one instance! Front desk staff lead by Aaron and Kati were a joy to converse with. Deana (Dean-ah) was a tremendous host at breakfast. She was a good conversationalist and assisted in anything we asked. Overall we would recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
