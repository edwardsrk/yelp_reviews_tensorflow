b'Great tasting Diablitos!!! I always come here for a Diablito because they make it exactly how I like it. I recommend coming in the morning/afternoon and when it\'s not so busy because that is when they make it absolutely perfect. The only thing I don\'t like is that they are a bit rude. I know little Spanish and the little Spanish I do know I try to use and explain what I want. The cashier just looked at me ugly and told me "que?" Not even bothering to help me out or speak even one word in English for me. Other than that the food and drinks are great'
