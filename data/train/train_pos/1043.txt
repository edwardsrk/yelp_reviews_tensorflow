b'Love Black Bear diner! Big portions of rib sticking food. This particular location has some service issues with their older servers. Forgetful of many things like coffee, coffee creamers, extra water, sides etc, on more than a few visits day/night. Some have  a bit of that Midwest "Flo" diner waitress (for way too long) attitude. Food-wise, the hash browns have been undercooked on more than one occasion and the gravy tends to be a bit cold. Music is a little loud for the space as well. I\'ll still be a regular however!'
