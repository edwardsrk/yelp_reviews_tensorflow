b"One of the big perks that we found about Vegas, is that we got into clubs for free (sorry guys) and other things, like getting free drinks all night (although that was a lie) and they were expensive but at least generous with the alcohol measurements! We got persuaded to go to Rok on our way to ride the roller coaster on top of NYNY, and it turned out that it was pretty cool. The music was good, the people inside were amusing (there was a parody of a dance-off), it kept us amused all night and the videos that were shown alongside the music was pretty cool. At least you can watch something when you're dancing too. The floor was kept clean from any spilt drinks or broken glass and the staff were nice. It did weird me out a bit to see girls dancing, as it's something I'm not used to seeing in London, but compared to Tao, it was hardly smutty. Definitely go here for a night out, the dance floor might be small, but it's worth it to see a dance-off."
