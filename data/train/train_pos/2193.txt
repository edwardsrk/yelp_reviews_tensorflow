b"When I'm in Vegas, I don't typically leave the strip, but we did last time. We came mid-afternoon so there was no wait. I'd say this lives up to the hype! Everything we ordered was really good, and the portions were generous! We had 3 people, and we ordered ordered one of the Korean BBQ sets for two plus two extra meat orders, thinking the set for 2 wouldn't be enough. It would have been enough. :)"
