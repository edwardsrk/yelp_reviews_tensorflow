b'I went to Paris 66 with my husband and friend for Sunday brunch around 10:30 a.m. We were immediately greeted by a chef who looked up from making a crepe to say, "Bon jour!" We were advised by the hostess that we could be seated immediately but because one chef was out for the day, our wait for food would be a little longer. I appreciated being told this before we were seated so that we could decide before getting settled whether we wanted to stay and wait. We decided to go for it since we weren\'t in a rush. We ended up ordering (homemade) croissants and (homemade) jams as an "appetizer" to tide us over while waiting for the food. Since those things were pre-made on site, we were served them immediately. They were DELICIOUS!Aside from the slow-to-come out food, the service otherwise also was a bit slow (ie, the waitress). She could have been more attentive given that we were being so patient and there for such a long time. As for the food when it did come out: Two of us got savory crepes and one got a sweet crepe. We were all extremely pleased with the quality and tastiness of the food. We each cleaned our plates and noted that we\'d be back. The French ambiance is really well done, too.It seems that Paris 66 was not prepared for its own popularity and is experiencing some growing pains as it gets the pacing of its service correct. I hope they will learn from the foibles of their first few weeks. We will definitely be back!!'
