b"An honest mechanic shop.My 99 Jeep Cherokee wouldn't start the mechanic originally diagnosed it as needing a new computer. We were looking at $1,025 parts and labor. After we discussed it with the mechanic we were resolved to our fate. However, the mechanic went the extra mile after we left and looked more into it, on top of the 3 hours he had already spent. He found it was a bad crank sensor replaced and the computer worked.  They could have gone ahead with the expensive repair and replaced the $20 sensor unbeknownst to me but they didn't. They spent at least 4 hours diagnosing my jeep for a $232 repair. This is not my 1st time taking my jeep to this shop and they have had the opportunity time and time again to charge me for an expensive repair when it was something cheap. They are an honest shop."
