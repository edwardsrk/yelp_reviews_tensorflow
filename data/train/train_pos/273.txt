b"Staff/family are soooooo nice and pleasant every time I've been here.Donuts actually only get 3 Stars.....while they are awesomely fresh, there's not a lot of variety with the donut itself or the icing. I'm also comparing this to Jack Frost donuts which sets the bar really high. Pricing is fair and place is clean.My favorite donut is the cinnamon & sugar."
