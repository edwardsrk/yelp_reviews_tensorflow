b"In a world of big box stores and impersonal chains, Safrans' is a glimmer of hope for those of us who want to make grocery shopping personal again. The store is not overwhelming and people are always glad to help. It is a family run business and the owners are very big community supporters and this shows in every aspect of their business. I think they have the best fresh meat selection in Pittsburgh and its all available at very reasonable prices. If you have not stopped into Safran's before make sure you make it in, you will not be disappointed!"
