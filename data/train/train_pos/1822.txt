b"We walked in off the streets on a September night to find some of the nicest and most accommodating people in the world!I've only been able to slurp Gerber banana custard for days and they have me an experience of a lifetime.They suggested lobster Mac and cheese and Saliva was dripping down my chin onto my friend's lap... Then it came... The cheesiest and most delicious lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had! I couldn't eat the salad because of my surgery and they were happy to accommodate me and bring mash potatoes and gravy.Highly recommend to all."
