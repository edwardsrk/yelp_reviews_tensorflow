b'I can only review their delivery service, which has been a godsend on some rather god-forsaken nights. The food has arrived fresh, and of fantastic quality. I can highly recommend their salmon, as the Lemon Beurre Blanc was fantastic. My favorite, though, has to be the Norman Rockwell burger. It is a perfectly medium rare burger (can be cooked more if requested, but doing so would be a travesty), topped with bacon, american cheese, and a sunny side up egg.While their prices are somewhat high, the quality of the food is above reproach, earning them 4 stars in my opinion.'
