b'The existing reviews pretty much tell all...this is a beautiful, quiet space for any meal, but especially sweet outside on a sunny Spring day with fragrant flowers in the garden in bloom.  We had a pricey, but deliicious breakfast.  As far as "value" in Vegas goes (remember, you\'re in over-the-top Vegas), Bouchon makes my list.'
