b"First time here, and a decent experience. Probably will want to come and try it again to see if quality is consistent...Chicken is grilled nicely, with just enough seasoning and a bit of that grilled taste, not too salty or dry. Potato wedges were tasty and the coleslaw was fresh, crunchy and sweet. Service was good, and the waitress they have working there is very efficient and hardworking. We got the variety pack combo ($30+tax) and it was quite filling for two people. It's a bit on the pricey side though. We tipped since we dined in."
