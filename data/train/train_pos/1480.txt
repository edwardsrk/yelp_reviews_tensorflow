b"This place has patio seating and great view, I am not just talking about the pool and decor, the pool view here is like if you are visiting Hugh Hefners pool. Swarmed with hot people!This is why they get 4 stars instead of 3.I would normally give this place 3-4 stars on food quality. But all the food is fine! I expect a lot from the quality of rice and beans.I used to come here often, because I was so lucky to live 2 mins away. They  have OK drinks, that is why they don't get 5 stars. I had a bloody mary here, and although I enjoyed it, it could have been way better! Advice: stronger and less diluted please! (But maybe I feel this way because everytime I am here I am looking for a bit more than just a buzz, jk)"
