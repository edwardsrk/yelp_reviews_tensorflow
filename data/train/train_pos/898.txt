b"My fiance and I are Las Vegas locals, and often frequent the restaurants in the Henderson/Green Valley area.  As folks who work in the service and hospitality industries ourselves, we are often on the look out for restaurants that offer both good service and great food!  King's Fish House is one of the better seafood restaurants in Las Vegas, and has a good reputation.  We have been to this place before, and almost always have a great time.  The menu is huge, with many items to choose from (not just seafood); in fact, on my most recent visit here, I ordered a Southwestern Salad with blackened chicken.  Our server was a great guy with a lot of information on the menu  items.  He offered some suggestions to help us decide which items we would choose for lunch, and he was courteous and personable.  A win-win!King's Fish House has definitely taken a more hand's-on approach to making sure that the service is great and that the food comes out fresh and in a timely manner.  Always a bonus when you visit a restaurant with a good reputation and it holds up over time.  I highly recommend this place for lunch, dinner or their awesome desserts"
