b"My wife and I have been here quite a few times and I don't know if I'm really qualified to review this place but here goes:  I really appreciate that someone would rub my feet for that long while I get to fall asleep on a really comfortable chair.  Before they get to your feet they work on your head and shoulders which always feels good.  Then they turn you over and work on your back.  My wife thinks it's hit or miss unless you get a guy named David who always does a great job.  I'm just happy to go and relax and can't really tell the difference. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick walk in massage for cheap!"
