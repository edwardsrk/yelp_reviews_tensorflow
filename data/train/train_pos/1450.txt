b"Craving something sweet and refreshing? Do what I do: take yourself on a date with Rita!A regular ice topped with custard will set you back a cool $4.10, including tax, and you'll have your pick of about eight ice flavors and four custards. My pick, when it's in stock, is root beer float ice- cool like the soda, with a slight cream flavor, topped with thick vanilla custard. Vegas heat doesn't get much more bearable than with one of these in your hand."
