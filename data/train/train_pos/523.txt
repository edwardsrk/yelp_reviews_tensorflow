b'I\'ve been here twice now and the first time I came I had too much booz too fully apperciate their "Captain Hashbrown" breakfast burrito.. Well, I came again, sober this time, before catching a flick at the Rave theater.The Captain Hashbrown comes with hash browns, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, green bell pepper, and egg. Sounds typical except for the onion and green bell pepper (which gives it a little depth and taste much better, as for typical breakfast burritos). But there are 2 key things that make me a fan1. The egg was cooked like a scrambled egg pancake But  the yolk wasn\'t cooked through (not runny yolk). This little detail was Brilliant!!2. I don\'t know if its the oil or seasoning of the hashbrowns, onions, green peppers but it has a certain goodness to it.. Again, that something brings it another step away from the norm.. Yum!The "Captain Hashbrown" to the Rescue!! This thing has my vote for sure!'
