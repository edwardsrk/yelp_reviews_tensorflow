b"Location: located in the Albertson next to a vapor store. Plenty of parking space. Decor: nothing special. But clean and their service is great. If you do not like your drinks, you can exchange it with no question asked. That's great customer service especially if you pay $6 for a drink. Drinks: their specialty is Fresh Brewed Tea. However, they also have smoothies and coffee too. Their smoothies are not from fresh fruit so do 't expect healthy fruit drinks. The coffe is OK, not strong enough for me. My favorite drink here is the Jasmine Latte. I love how you can customize the sweetness, or add any toppings. Price is expensive for tea drinks. But you get what you pay for: freshness, great taste tea and service. Will be back and for that I give this place 4 stars!"
