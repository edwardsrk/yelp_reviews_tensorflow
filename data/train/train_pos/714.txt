b"I came here on a Saturday night with a friend. I ordered a Mexican Bulldog which came in a mason jar (very cute) but the flavour was lacking. It tasted watered down. Started with the nachos and guacamole which was just okay I would say. The reason I think it's okay is because avocado is delicious and it's always going to be good no matter how you make it lol and to be honest,  the guacamole that I make at home is way better. Our server wasn't the best in the world she would barely come by and we were often looking for her and trying to wave her down but she was never available. The tacos were amazing. I got the chorizo tacos and my friend got the shrimp tacos and they were both to die for. I will definitely come back for those tacos and I would like to try other appetizers. The atmosphere was great, they had a salsa band playing which contributed to a great Saturday night. I would definitely come again."
