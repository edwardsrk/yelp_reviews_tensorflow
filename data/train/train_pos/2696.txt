b"This is one of our go-to spots for a night out with the kids. The food and service are always dependable. This is the best Max and Erma's I've been to in PIttsburgh. Good quality American food, and free cookies on wednesday nights. Oh, and it's almost never too busy on the weekend. Great place for kids."
