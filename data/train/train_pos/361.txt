b"So many choices running up and down the street.  How do you choose?Actually this place has been on my list for about 2 years. So even though I had to steer my husband here, and we kept looking up the road a bit, we ended up back here.For starters the inside is nice, BUT, it kinda looks like a blacksmith vomited in there.  Someone needs to put the reigns on this tangled mess of metalwork.  There was some decorative painting along the stairs to the downstairs bathroom...kinda nice, and a soothing relaxing blue and cream palette that was quiite nice.  The noise level was loud and festive.The appetizer dip plate Kria Polikiliea is an array of Taramosalata--a caviar and potato spread that was new to me, eggplant based dip, houmos, and Tztziki.  The serving was generous, but we had to ask for another pita.The Quail appetizerwas delicious as my meal.  My husband had the Lamb boneless I'm not a fan of the texture of the rice, but it seems pretty consistent through all of the Greek places I go, so I suppose it's me, not them."
