b'First things first - I like Bobby Flay.  I like his television shows.  I like his personality.  And I like his style of cooking.  So I ought to like Mesa Grill.  And in some ways, I do.  But there are also some issues.The ambiance is bright and colorful, with high ceilings, lots of windows, and an impressive bar.  But the tables were packed in pretty tight.  Hey, I understand why.  The place was full on a Tuesday night!  If you can cram that many people into a space, and they still want to come, then it\'s just smart business.  But it isn\'t my taste.My wife and I decided to try as many dishes as we could, so we shared a menu made up of appetizers and side dishes.  Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.Some dishes were what you might call "just fine":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than "just fine."  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.So, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.  But when we go to a high end, pricey restaurant we really want nothing less than five stars, and Mesa doesn\'t quite get there.  Lots of Vegas restaurants do get there.  So we won\'t be back at Mesa for a while.  Sorry, Bobby.  We\'ll catch you at Bar Americain next time we\'re in New York.'
