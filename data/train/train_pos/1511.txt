b"Had a great time at this Asian fusion restaurant in cenpho with friends last night! The patio was perfect for a March evening, and wasn't loud like I thought it would be for being on a busy street. We all started with cocktails and I ordered the sloe burn (I love bourbon/whiskey) - it was really good. Very complex flavors and a little spice at the end. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of anything in the whiskey category.We each ordered a steamed bun and I had the Peking duck - the bun is a little more taco-esque than your typical steam bun, but the meat was tender and the sauce that came with it is awesome. My husband had the catfish and it was my favorite. The pineapple tartar sauce on it is awesome. We all ended up getting noodles for our main dishes. I got the pork ramen. I am a novice ramen connoisseur but do enjoy a good bowl of ramen - it was very good. The kicker is that it's topped with the sexiest slow poached egg I've ever seen in my life, just oozy and silky perfect with the broth and the pork. The kale in the ramen didn't really work for me, it had an acidic taste to it that I wasn't in to, but the noodles were cooked well and the pork/bacon was delicious. The broth was nice, not super heavy. I tried the curry that my husband got and it was awesome - great spicy flavor with coconut and peppers. Those udon noodles were on point. All in all, we had a good time. I would go back for happy hour, they have good drink specials and appetizers!"
