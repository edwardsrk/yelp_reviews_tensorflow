b'We happened upon Wild Fusion because we were in the area for a soccer game and needed to work dinner into the evening. The positive Yelp reviews brought us here.Let me start by saying that this place puts other Chinese takeout spots to shame on so many levels. I\'ll try to name them all:1. It is nice, bright, and super clean.2. It has a real wooden table with real wooden chairs AND a nice little sushi bar for those who choose to eat in. Those who have attempted to "eat in" at your typical Chinese carryout place will know why this is mentioned.3. Staff is friendly.4. Non-canned vegetables are used in their dishes.5. The chicken was much more high-quality than the norm at such places.We shared 2 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer and the garlic chicken. Food was well prepared and came out fairly quickly. Everything was very good, with the sushi being a pleasant surprise.If we\'re in the area, we\'d definitely eat here again.'
