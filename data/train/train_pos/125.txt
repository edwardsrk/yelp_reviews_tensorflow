b"One of my favorite places in Phoenix. I like how their menu changes slightly over time, so there's something new to try. Everything I've tried is good so far, and I've almost tried everything on the menu. I don't like the pig face dumpling as much, actually prefer the other dumplings. I love the stream buns, especially the chicken waffle and the pork belly steam buns. Their ramen and seafood hot pot is excellent, but wasn't impressed by their duck dishes."
