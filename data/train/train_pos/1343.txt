b"Just moved in, so far so good. It's a beautiful complex and will be even better once the rest, including the dog park, is finished. I wish that the entire complex was non smoking, but it's not. The security walks on some nights, that's nice. It is a little loud some of the early mornings with the gardening staff, but they keep it beautiful. I have a few email requests that I am going to submit, so I will update this review with their responsiveness in mind."
