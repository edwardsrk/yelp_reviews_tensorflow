b'I finally got around to trying this place after several people had suggseted it to me. I\'ve come to the conclusion that ALOT of these type Buffets are basically serving the same dishes and what stands out is the things that they offer that the others dont.I arrived late for lunch around 3pm and even at that late hr the place was active with people -a good sign. The place was well lit and I was offered a nice comfortable booth where I could spread out my paper and read. I even lucked out and was sitting across from a crying baby!! lol As I said, they are basically serving the same thing as other places with the difference here being Sweet Potato French Fries, fresh breaded shrimp & Fish with cocktail & tartar sauce available. They also had peeled shrimp on ice as well as whole fried shrimp and grilled shark. Also "coconut chicken" was offered but the chicken was more breading than substinance but the sauce was very good, they even have a fresh sushi station with several types of rolls available.The desert station was pretty pedestrian with no standouts at all other than the small coconut cake squares they were offering were dry and stale which is nbd as I really wasnt there for desert.I also got to see them putting out the dinner items such as the snow crab legs and while thin, they looked good. Overall I\'d have to say try this place because you cant go wrong. Of the 3 places on Sahara I still rate Buffet @ Asia #1, followed by this place and Pacific Buffet at #3.'
