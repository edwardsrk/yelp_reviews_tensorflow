b"Delicious! Great location! Awesome patio! Visited for the first time, after stumbling upon it as we were walking through cityscape and made the best choice by picking Chico Malo! We started with the Guacamole with the Pomegranate in it and it was AMAZING! It was very difficult to chose a drink off the menu because they all sounded great but I chose the Paraiso Tropical and it was to die for! The service was just ok. It wasn't terribly busy or anything either but what they lacked in service, they made up for in quality of food and great atmosphere! Definitely will be back!"
