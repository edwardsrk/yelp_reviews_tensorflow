b"I would post a picture, but my sandwich is already gone... Pros: Healthy, fresh, delicious, good variety, SOURDOUGH BREAD Cons: Gets busy for lunch (which can also be seen as a good thing!) with a bit of a wait (prevent this by calling your order in) and it's small.But for the food they put out, you'd never guess it. I ordered the Alaskan (smoked salmon, cream cheese, cucumber, red onion, fresh dill, lemon juice, arugula, vinaigrette and salt and pepper on sourdough) and it was a delight. The arugula and fresh dill added a light herbaceous note that I didn't expect from a sandwich, let alone one with cream cheese. So good. Also, their sourdough is phenomenal. I just want to buy a loaf and eat it all day. Great addition to the lunch scene for St. Clair/Superior and Asia Town."
