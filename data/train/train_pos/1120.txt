b"Yes I'm a FAN of this place....And I will definitely be back at least once a Year, since this is in LV and I live in LA.  The Environment was perfect, I felt like I was in a Cruise Ship or something like that...during a fancy dinner even though my friends and I had Brunch there.  The setup was Nautical like.. and the Service at the Bar where we sat, were great.  We got there maybe an hour before closing and they still attended to us like we had a few more hours.The food was Good and Tasty...  We had the Corn beef hash and Chicken/waffles."
