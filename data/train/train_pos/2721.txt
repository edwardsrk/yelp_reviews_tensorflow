b"Came here on a recommendation that the food was awesome here. The beer on tap was just a plus. I got a burger and a beer here. Food was good. Beer was okay. But the thing that had got me was the service. Maybe it was the time that I came in and don't get me wrong, the people working were definitely friendly but just not around when we needed something.  It was fairly busy around the bar but empty in the table area and people gradually left when eventually no one was in the bar. But  no one really came around to fill up our water or get another beer and whenever I tried waving someone down they would be to busy rushing back and forth between an area. Probably just a fluke but I do give it 4 stars and  I do recommend trying it."
