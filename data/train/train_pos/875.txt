b'On the 10 freeway heading for Tucson, hungry, pulled into an "in and out burger" no room at the inn! standing room only, so we bailed and a block away passed Jason\'s Deli Wow,it was great, fast and delicious. I have eaten at Cantors deli in West Hollywood and several famous Jewish delis Jasons was an equal.'
