b'Oh how I love Paradise Bakery...it is one of my favorite staples in the Valley of the Sun!  I stopped into this location last Sunday for a quick breakfast - OJ and an everything bagel.  The bagel was so fresh and tasty.  The staff was great and the outdoor space is great to enjoy a nice, desert morning!'
