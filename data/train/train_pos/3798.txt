b'Someone broke into our truck on a Saturday night. We contacted several places to get it replaced on Sunday with no luck. Some told us it would be Wednesday or Thursday before they could get to us. I remembered using Vegas Glass several years ago, so I made the call. Not only did they get us in within the hour, they were $30 less than the lowest quote. They did a great job. In spite of this being a specialty truck, they had the exact window and installed it in a couple of hours. This is now the only glass installer in my contacts.'
