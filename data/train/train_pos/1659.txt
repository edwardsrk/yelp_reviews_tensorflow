b"Very impressed! We did take-out for our first time. I couldn't find a menu online so I called and the person who answered the phone could not have been more kind and personable if she had tried and let me know that the menu is in photos in their Facebook page and sure enough it was there. We ordered the corned beef sandwich, the loaded cheese sandwich, and the BLT and the loaded baked potato soup. All come with fries and I asked if I could substitute onion straws for one of the fries and just upcharge me. She said they do not upcharge and I absolutely could. It was the same person who answered the phone the first time and yep, she was still wonderful!All 3 sandwiches were hot and delicious . We were not crazy about the soup as it had the consistency of a slightly watered down potato with toppings in a cup ... no moisture at all except from the sour cream but the portions were generous enough to do the job for 2 grown guys and myself. We all swapped and tried each others stuff so we could decide if we liked the place enough to go again and you can be sure we'll be back! Next time we are having wings.  Thanks for the great service and food and for doing this neighborhood proud!"
