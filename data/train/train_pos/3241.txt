b"This town needs an enema!!Well, here it is ya jerk!!Artistic Armory combines everything you like about an underground music club with elements of an actual, organic independent art scene. It is the opposite of First Friday, a refreshing alternative to seeing bands in filthy bars, and the antithesis of hanging out at the mall.I used the bathroom... once...The bar tenders are great!! There's a tall dude with strong hands and a pretty girl who likes to talk about different ways to cook chicken (women love chicken).Check out their Facebook page for a listing of upcoming events.The website is maintained by some dude named Gus (I guess he is an employee and/or web designer), and contains about as much useful information as one of those hooker trading cards you get on the strip. The Artistic Armory a roof, which is great and really compliments the floor, which I once cleaned up baby carrots off of. My only complaint is that some drunk with tattoos and a beard kept banging into me and spilling my drink. I attempted to complain to management, but a tattooed guy with a beard said that my vague description was not going to help him narrow down the assailant. Overall, your experience will be based on what you make of your time at The Artistic Armory. Just don't talk to anyone in a black t-shit with a band name printed on it and you should be fine.
