b"Wow.... good food here.  This place doesn't look like much, I have to say.  And it was a bit hot inside, I can imagine as the summer warms up, so will this place.   The food did take a little while to come, and I didn't quite understand what our options were.  When we were seated, the waitstaff asked us if we wanted a menu or if we wanted the daily specials we should speak to the chef.  We didn't know what we wanted so we opted for the menu.  Those more familiar with the place seemed to understand and ordered specials which came out much faster then our cooked to order requests.  Lesson learned.  I had the chicken souvlaki dinner which was HUGE.  It came with an amazing greek salad to start and then I substituted cooked veggies for the potatoes.  For $14 it was an amazing amount of food that you could easily have shared between two people.Loved it.  Loved my leftovers.  Would definitely return."
