b"I think there is a lot of mediocre food in Vegas.  Even the big name places-- dull.  Bouchon is very good but not quite outstanding.  I have also been to the Napa Bouchon, and would say the same.  Well, except for that side of butternut squash.  The best butternut squash I have ever had.  The pumpkin soup was great, the scallops very good but not great.  Our service was excellent.  We needed to catch an early dinner before the Garth Brooks show, and I was definitely pleased with our choice.  We'll be back!"
