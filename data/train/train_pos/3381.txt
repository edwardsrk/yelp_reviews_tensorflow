b"Best breakfast in the Phoenix area. I normally get the Irishman omelette, it is an omelette packed with corned beef. It comes with potatoes and a side of toast. The service is always fast and the food generally congress pretty quick. It is almost always packed on the weekends but if you're solo out with your significant other, ask to sit at the bar."
