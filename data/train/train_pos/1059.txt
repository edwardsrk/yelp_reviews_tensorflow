b"Gorgeous hotel! Make sure you get a suit with either a strip view or pool view- totally worth it. The pool is nice but get there earlier to reserve you space. The food options aren't that good but you're on the Vegas Strip and you're surrounded by food places. The casino is big and yes it smells like smoke. Many amenities in the hotel. Great location very close to Bellagio, Caesar's Palace, and Paris."
