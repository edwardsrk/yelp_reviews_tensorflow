b"Stopped in for late lunch, and my son & I agree, this was freshest tasting pizza we've had in a long while!  The girls working here are extremely nice, waited on us, refilled drinks, and cleaned up our table when we were done, and kept smiles on their faces the whole time.  Place is kept very clean too.  I'd definitely recommend!"
