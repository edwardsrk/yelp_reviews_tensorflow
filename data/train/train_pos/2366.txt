b"We've been going to Lone Spur since it opened. The service is always 5 star (IMO, Amy is the best) but, sometimes, the kitchen needs help. You can't run a good restaurant without competent kitchen staff. The Lone Spur needs a great chief and some good Indians. Breakfast was very good this week and we're going to keep coming."
