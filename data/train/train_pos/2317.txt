b'If the $5.99 lunch special proves to be as awesome as my first sampling of the jerk chicken combo this will be my go to place in North York for Jamaican food.Food is outstanding and for a small platter you get a lot!  I had three flavorful pieces dark meat chicken, two cups of rice and kidney beans, and coleslaw served on a huge oval platter.  The meat was tender and the rice was moist and cooked proper.They are located right beside San Francesco Pizza.'
