b"Chop Chop Wok is as good as it gets for me as far as Chinese food is concerned. I feel it is more of a 4 1/2 star place, but I had to round up because they are just so pleasant here & when you are waiting on an order, they will actually walk it out to your car. Now that is like Nordstrom/Nob Hill type service right there! Btw, Nob Hill is an upscale grocery store in NorCal & I know all my NorCal peeps will get that reference ;)So...the food is really tasty here & the ingredients are nice & fresh. The beef broccoli is some of the best I have had. The beef is really quite good. Not at all like that weird tasting & texturally displeasing mystery meat usually found in this dish. And the broccoli is nice & crunchy & has a nice fresh, bright green look to it. I also LOVE the Lo Mein! Lol, which is actually Chow Mein, at least where I'm from. Either way, it is on point. They also have really good lunch specials & you definitely cannot beat the prices here.I am SUPER picky when it comes to Chinese food & I will not just go anywhere. There has to be some sort of buzz or word of mouth about a place before I will try it. So, I would like to thank all of my fellow Yelpers that helped me decide on trying Chop Chop Wok. And to the staff, I think you all are great & you treat people with great warmth & friendliness. Not as customers, but as friends or an extended hungry family member ;)"
