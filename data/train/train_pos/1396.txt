b'Just a quicky today!Easily got a window seat at 13:00 then perused the expansive menu which has everything from $17 burger to sashimi. We selected the bento box and the crab claws. Bento was great value with well executed dishes and a cracker miso. The crab claws were fresh and juicy but the sauce was just overpowering. The service was efficient and friendly.Food 7.5/10 service 7.5/10 decor 8/10'
