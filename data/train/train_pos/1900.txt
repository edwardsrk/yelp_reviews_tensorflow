b"We love this store! It's clean, there's a really kind group of people working there and I feel like they're pretty fair with what they take and how much they offer in store credit. I do wish they had a cash option, but we've turned in a lot of our children's clothes that are too small and basically just exchanged them for bigger sizes with the credit we have. Everything is reasonably priced. Shoes can be pretty grungy, but they're cheap. Great place overall!"
