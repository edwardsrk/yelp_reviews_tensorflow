b"Good ambiance.... my friend said he first started coming here in 2004, when they were just starting out and before the owner bought out the sushi place next door.  He said it's come a long way since then. This place has a great, relaxed atmosphere... there are karaoke rooms for fobby gatherings.  I would come here again if given the chance.  The peach soju = :)"
