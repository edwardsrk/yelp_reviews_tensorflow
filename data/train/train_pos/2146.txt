b"Decent izakaya in North York. Came with friends after they changed name on weekday night. Was very spacious and not packed like on the weekends. The food was pretty standard. I was not blown away. Had my usual takoyaki, delicious. Some sort of salmon tataki, it was okay. Grilled pork belly was good and fatty. Chicken karage was still pretty good, love the mayo. Yaki udon, the usual.Tried the baked oyster for the first time and it was pretty good! The sauce was creamy and there was lots of goodies in there, not just some random veggies. And I love the Kinoko bibimbap, there's just something about hot melted cheese!  In terms of desserts I think that almond tofu and sesame soy milk pudding was just not worth the price. For the same price elsewhere you can get a whole bucket full and it's really nothing special. But I did love the green tea cheesecake, the execution was great, it was creamy and well combined, not powdery, not too sweet, worth the money. The service was okay, seats were hard. And as usual super loud, don't bring your kids."
