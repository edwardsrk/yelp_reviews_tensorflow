b"I had to share, this is the best nail salon I've been to in the Vegas area! Ive had gel twice with Kim and she's great. The entire salon is staffed by the friendliest people and I think the reviews speak volumes. My first gel manicure lasted 3 weeks which is unusual for me, I can maybe get 2. Clean, friendly, and a lasting manicure!"
