b"A group of 8 us went there for my brother-in-law's birthday. I've frequented an Asian buffet in Scarborough (I think it's Buffet King) and I thought the Mandarin would have been more 'Canadianized' than I thought. My one and only reason for going to any of these buffets are for the crab legs. (my family with exception of my boyfriend and bro in law are Chinese) Let's be real - these places have to cater to 'lo fan' tastes (that's white people :) ) I thought this place was very good! It does not have many 'authentic' Chinese dishes, but I already knew that before I went. The crab legs were AWESOME. (the pre-cracked thing is amazing for a seafood pig like me!) They don't make any profit from someone like me who has 3 plates of crab legs and a bit of veg - no starches - leaving as much room as possible for the crab :) The place was nice and clean, service was very friendly (unlike 'authentic' Chinese restos... lol - my Asian sis's and bro's know what I mean) honestly, other dishes were ok/good, but that's the way at ANY buffet. (the little steak at the flat top station was pretty damn good) My lo-fan boyfriend's only disappointment was lack of ss pork. I am not a dessert person, but OMG - do not miss the cr\xc3\xa8me brule! Don't be fooled that is in a little foil cup. It was better than other a high end steak house that I paid $15 for alone.  We're going to the Woodbine location this weekend, I am hoping it's as good as this one... and pray they have the cr\xc3\xa8me brule!"
