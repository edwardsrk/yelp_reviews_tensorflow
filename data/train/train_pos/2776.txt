b"I had the opportunity to try Stripsteak this past weekend, and the food held up to my expectations. We shared the porterhouse, along with the souffled spinach and mushrooms. The porterhouse was the perfect cut for us to share, and it was juicy, tender, and well-seasoned. The star of the night was the souffled spinach, which was so unique. It walked a fine line between savory and sweet, because I expected every bite to taste sweet (I'm thinking it's a souffle!) but it tasted like spinach. I would highly recommend it! The mushrooms were good too, but definitely get the spinach.My friend had the Stripsteak which had really good flavor but was a tad on the chewy side. And did I mention they served complimentary fries? I was happy with the meal, and would return to try some of the other cuts."
