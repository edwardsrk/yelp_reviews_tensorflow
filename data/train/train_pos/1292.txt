b"Cool coffee shop - good espresso machine - nice folks - Cartel Coffee beans - what's not to love?  (Normally a rhetorical question, but, in this case, the parking - if you can't find a spot there, you can park across the way at the drug store - they pay for overflow parking there).Good place to come in, get some java and relax.  Check them out!"
