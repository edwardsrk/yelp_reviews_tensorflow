b"This guy seems too good to be true the first time!Putting our name on Chris's list to get in FREE and FAST?  I was definitely a skeptic.  I scoured through his Yelp reviews, read every comment on his Facebook page and search the internet for days looking for a catch or false advertising claim...and I couldn't find anything.I was bringing a group of 11 girls to Vegas for my sister's bachelorette weekend and we wanted to get into the clubs without having to wait in line or pay a cover...and Chris's Free Vegas Club Passes helped us do it.The first night, we went to Moon and Playboy at the Palms.  He texted me around 5pm and told us when to get there.  We just walked right up, said we were on Chris Hornack's list and they checked us in.  No cover, no waiting...awesome.The second night, we headed to Tryst at the Wynn and had the same good experience.  It was a little harder to flag down the guy with the clipboard (with so many people trying to palm him money to skip the line).  Once we got his attention, we said we were on the list and he let the whole group in...even our one dude didn't have to pay!Having never been to Vegas clubs before, I didn't know what to expect.  I heard rumors of long waits and high covers, so signing up with Chris seemed like the smart thing to do.  I really can't understand why all those other people standing in line didn't do the same....Thanks Chris!"
