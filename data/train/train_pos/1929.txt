b"This is not anywhere close to authentic Italian gelato by any means, but for the price and the flavor of the gelato offered here, over the summer we pretty much made this place a regular stop after dinner. Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size. We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually."
