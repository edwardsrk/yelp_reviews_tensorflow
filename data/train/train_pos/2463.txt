b"This place actually rules. When I moved to Pittsburgh in August, locals were very eager to throw their suggestions at me as far as what I needed to experience. Burgatory was a recurring theme that I was quick to investigate. Yes, you're going to wait half a day to get in, but set aside some time and check it out. The atmosphere is great for going out with friends or family and getting chatty. The waitstaff is incredibly competent, and always willing to offer input and suggestions. The drinks are pricey, so I usually pass.Now to the good stuff. The food is awesome. Every appetizer I've had the pleasure of trying has been flavorful and well put together, the fries are consistently excellent, and the milkshakes are the bomb.com. But, of course, it is the succulent little beauties composed of beef and heaven that keep me going back. Each Burgatory burger is made with love, and topped with the finest ingredients known to man. I love them. So much. My suggestion is a Waygu beef patty on Brioche with egg, Cheddar cheese and mushrooms."
