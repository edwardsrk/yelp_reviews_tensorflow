b"We just tried Kami for the first time today. The food was awesome. My husband got a Bento Box and I had the House Special Mei Fun. I would say my Mei Fun was some of the best I've ever eaten!  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly. Nice to know we have a good Chinese Thai Sushi restaurant right in our backyard!!"
