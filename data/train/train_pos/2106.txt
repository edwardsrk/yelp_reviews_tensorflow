b'Best Dim Sum in Charlotte. I love the no frills, strip mall appearance of the restaurant. Staff was very friendly, food came out quickly and was delicious! I have been here on Sundays when they push the carts around - I like that so you can "see" what you are ordering. I did Dim Sum last night and went off of the pictures on the menu (see picture). Price was OK, not too expensive or cheap. I will go back. More fun with a larger group of people so you can share!'
