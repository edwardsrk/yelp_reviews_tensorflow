b"This is why I am giving this place 5 stars. Let me start from the beginning. I was invited to a wedding for November 26. I planned my whole trip from Denver, Colorado the whole month. I bought an expensive dress and made sure I had everything I needed for that special day. On November 25th I don't know what the heck happened but my neck Popped! Yeah my next popped and I could not move my neck! I swear I cried all day because I was in pain. I stayed home thinking by the next day I would feel better. Nope. I was worse. So I looked up for a chiropractor. Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. I find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. I go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. Guess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1! SO happy to have been able to go here and have two people take care of me and make me better. Thank you so much. Plus it was not pricey and did not cost me an arm and a leg!Thank you so much!"
