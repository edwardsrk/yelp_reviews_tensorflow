b"Simplicity at its best. G&B offers a nice touch of good ol' bar food in a clean, warm, and inviting feel atmosphere. Nice bar with plenty of TVs to catch any of the games on. Nice selection of beer as well.I'm a out of towner and my cousin brought me here for their awesome cheese curds and they did not disappoint. Extremely light but well seasoned batter encasing bite sized little curds of heaven with their home made dipping sauce was well executed. The fried smelt was a pleasant treat. Again with the light batter but full of flavor with moist tender meat on the inside, paired with their homemade tartar sauce, it was one of my favorite things I ate on my trip. Their burger was simple yet bursting with tons of flavors that elevated the humble american staple. The service was good and I'd say it was a pleasant experience dining here. Simple food done right with subtle changes that elevate it is what makes any restaurant stand out. G&B do just that and do not disappoint. Stay fat mother suckers"
