b"Here's how I justify my four-star rating:The sound system is good, better than many places in the Kensington Market area, what with the common problem of clubs limiting the low-end because neighbors live cheek-to-jowl. Add to this the fact that the cover at this club is usually moderately low and nearby clubs often cost twice as much for the same beer and comparable musical selection. Friendly staff and the intimate size of the space make this an enjoyable place to see a show with a group of friends. It's around average space-wise. Personally speaking, the rare-groove soul and funk selections regularly on offer make this place a stand-out. Btw: I had no idea they had West African food, this can only be a plus."
