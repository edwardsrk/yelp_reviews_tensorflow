b'New favorite brunch spot in Pitts! Notorious for a wait but great coffee nearby at Espresso a Mano and shops to explore while you wait. Ordered the Eggplant Benedict. Never seen this on a menu before and did not fail to impress. Crispy fried eggplant, poached egg with a pesto hollandaise sauce and roasted tomatoes. Extremely delicious and was worth the wait!'
