b'Went to this place last night for Cleveland beer week. They had a taste of Chicago featuring 3 floyds, revolution, 5 rabbits. I am huge 3 floyds fan but they only had one and surprisingly I liked the revolution the best. Anyway craft beers were a nice 5 a piece and the sampler was a very reasonable 10. I dont have a problem spending $ on good eats or drinks but I appreciate a fair if not affordable price. This place is huge for the price. I would pay double and give it 4 stars. (management please dont read this)As we were about 20 minutes from home and beers were flowing we decided to try the menu. We started with the black bean and chorizo soup. Obviously home made love went into this as it was creamy and spicy with great flavor. Could have used some cilantro to brighten it or a dab of sour cream to lighten it. Otherwise wonderful. Next we tried the broccoli tempura. What the heck right? Now we all have had tempura that was over coated with gobs of uncooked batter everywhere...this was far from that. The guy in the back knew how to prepare this. The broccoli heads were essentially cut in half and left whole then battered and flash fried. They had to have blanched them and peeled the stalks because the florets all the way to the stalks were perfectly done. So you ask why am I spending this much time on a tempura dish? Well they give you not one, two but three sauces! These were awesome and were a sweet/sour chilli that layered the bottom, A siracha mayo on the side and a plum sauce to boot. This dish is for two or more to share. We split a walleye sandwich that was gone as soon as it got to the table. The filet was fresh and had a wonderful tartar sauce. Service was outstanding and barmaid was working her butt off as the place got very crowded by 630. Will try again soon and if same then this place may get the 5th star.'
