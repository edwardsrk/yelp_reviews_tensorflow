b'ALOHA!  I found myself in Las Vegas and in need of a massage.  Because I run a very successful mobile business on Yelp in another state, I thought to follow my instincts and turn to YELP for a mobile provider.  I called two places.  The first one did not get back to me in a timely manner.  The second one, Body Restoration, picked up on the first call!  Barbara was a joy to work with and we enjoyed a laugh as I was having a moment being the one on the other end of the transaction when I am so used to being the provider!She dispatched Becca to my room within an hour!  Wow!  Amazing follow through.  Becca showed up on time with all her equipment and ready to work!  I enjoyed my massage very much, it was needed and I love that I did not have to leave my MGM Grand Room to receive it.  Here is a tip, and not meant to be anything but a helpful tip....if you are a massage therapist, or in need of an advanced skill set, please tell Barbara this so she can send the right therapist.  In my booking haze, I did not mention that I needed a certain something and I did not get that with Becca.  However, Becca is a wonderful therapist with great healing energy.  If you need deep tissue or skilled work, ask for someone else.  I would most definitely use Body Restoration again.  Thank you!'
