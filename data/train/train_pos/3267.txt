b"I've always loved Parlour, as noted from my previous review. Luckily, my stylist, Sam now works here. He's my guy for my cut and colour. Whatever I'm after, he'll get it done. Whether it's trying a different shade of red to chopping off all my length or even just a quick blow dry. The salon is always hustling and bustling with coifs of sleek styles to more drastic changes. They can really do it all.Although the prices are up there, they do have junior stylists, regular stylists, senior stylists and educator stylist tiers to suit all price ranges and expertise. Definitely one of the best salons in the city. Hands down!"
