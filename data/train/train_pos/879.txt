b"My wife and I came here for our anniversary and loved the food.  We started off with the deep fried deviled eggs which were incredible. My wife ordered the short ribs and I ordered the Pork Oso Buco.  This ended up killing the conversation and we were both enthralled in eating our food and savoring each bite.  The only knock I have was on the desert which left us underwhelmed.  We ordered the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores which, after the great meal we had, didn't quite have the same impact as the apps and entrees.  The wait staff seemed to be slightly occupied but for the most part we felt taken care of.It is definitely worth going to - but maybe try a different dessert."
