b"The 3030 has quickly become my go to destination in the Junction (Serious hat tip to Hole in the Wall, that place is excellent too). The first thing you will notice when you enter the 3030 is that there is SPACE. This isn't your typical sardine-packed Dundas bar and you are not going to have to grind through a sea of people to get a drink. Sorry annonymous gropers, it's back to Red Light for you. You may have to wait to get a table but there is ample room in the back, and a second bar, so you don't need to lurk over peoples tables while they eat. Better still, pump some quarters in to the pinball machines while you wait. They few shows I have seen the acoustics have been OK. It's a large concrete box so you have to work with what you got, and they do a decent job. You will see the sound guy moving about the room checking levels. Gotta appreciate the effort. Pretty well rounded beer selection and the few small dishes I have ordered were pretty tasty, arrived promptly to the correct table (WHAAAAT), and were well priced. Most notable were the double w/ pork belly & Blue Mac & Cheese. I've read alot of complaints about the service, and personally can't speak to that. My experiences have always been pleasant. Sadly, It's not your servers fault it's January outside. If the menu doesn't tickle your fancy there's a pizzeria down the road called Little Caesers that does a pretzel crust pizza. :-oThe future is NOW."
