b"Came here for a birthday with some 3 friends. I had the osso bucco and we shared the giant meat ball and crespelles. Was a lot of food (good portion sizes) The osso bucco was pretty good, and the foccacia for soaking up all the sauces was amazing, but the highlight we all agreed upon were the crespelles. Soft pillowy texture surrounding silky cheese. It is really loud on account of the high ceilings (This used to be a bank of Nova Scotia, but it closed after getting robbed too many times) but not so bad that I couldn't hear other people at the table. Great atmosphere with cool artwork and dim lighting. Service was attentive and on point."
