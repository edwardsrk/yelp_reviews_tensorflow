b"So far one of the best customer service I have had in a while. Everyone is pretty friendly and helpful, they make sure you are comfortable. The food is pretty good different compared to other places. Highly recommended especially if you like seafood.    Everything you eat will be flavorful its like a party in your mouth. The place is big so it is good for big parties. Some of my favorites are the Oyster Pork belly bun Steak and eggs Oxtail pho Slow braised pork belly in coconut juiceCoconut mojito ( verry good!) must try Best of all the big bone soup this a must as well The price is also decent considering how good the food is. Typically don't write reviews  unless the service is really bad or if I had a really good experience. With all that said Kudos to the staff for such wonderful customer service please do keep it up because for sure my friends and I will be a regular. :) I love that they are open till 4 am on the weekends."
