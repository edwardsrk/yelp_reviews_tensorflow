b"Great place and great happy hour.    Padre magarita for $4.00 on Tuesdays comes with Sauza Gold and you don't have to be in the bar area for this one.Food ordered:  Cuban Pork Sandwich, it was very tender, so very flavorful, a lot of food, but we wished there was more even after we were full. We also shared the Obama Burrito with green and red sauce, it was fantastic, screaming full of flavors. Shreaded pork, peppers, cheese, tons of balanced spice.I wish the chips and salsa were complimentary. Just something you tend to get used to in places now a days.  $2.00 isn't too bad though."
