b"I had the pleasure of dining at Bouchon last week for the first time.  Will I go back?  Certainly.  My beet salad was wonderfully refreshing, the moules frites excellent, and creme brulee great (can you really f-up creme brulee?  I hope not).My husband had the french onion soup and blood sausage.  Both were exceptional. The service is top-notch and we will certainly be back again next year.  I didn't quite have same the earth-shattering experience that Tony Bourdain had over the frites- they were good, but got a little soggy as the meal wore on...  However, I was quite pleased that I finally found a restaurant on the strip that could make a gin fizz.  Bouchon is worth the stinky walk through Venetian for a great meal."
