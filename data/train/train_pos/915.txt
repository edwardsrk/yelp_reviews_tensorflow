b"I was referred to this spa by a friend and booked a shoulder and back waxing appointment. I was able to book a 'waxing' on the same day I needed it, and was very happy with the service and the price. Everyone here was friendly and the room I had the waxing done in was very clean and smelled great.For the guys out there who need 'manscaping' I would highly recommend this place and I am surprised it  does not have a higher rating. I literally paid twice as much at my old place in Mississauga and the service levels were about the same.Aroma, I will be back here again :)"
