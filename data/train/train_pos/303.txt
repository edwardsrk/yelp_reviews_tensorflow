b"My review is of a particular line of products carried by Home Depot, rather than of this great monstrosity of a store itself. I am in love with Eco Mist products -- I interviewed the founder of this company for an article I was writing -- and then rushed over to HD to try the products for myself. They are scent free, all natural, non-toxic cleaning solutions that leave your countertops shiny clean without any chemicals! I'm in the process of switching over all my cleaning products to environmentally-friendly alternatives and I'm planning to stock up on Eco Mist!"
