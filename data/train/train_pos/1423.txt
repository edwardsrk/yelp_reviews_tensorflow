b'Really excellent shawarma and service, too!  Casual place.  Typically a line-up, but it goes fast.  They are so good with kids!  I saw them customize a meal for a picky eater.  They are also good at recognizing regulars and remembering their order.Have had the shwarma (fav), souvlaki, lentil soup and a number of the appetizers and all have been great.'
