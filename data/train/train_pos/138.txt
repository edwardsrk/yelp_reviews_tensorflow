b"Went to El Hefe with some friends and really loved the atmosphere and the food! We sat at a booth w the old school taps (still cold/can't use) and had great service! I ordered the Queso Fundido and Chicken nachos for the table and everything was delicious! Had great drinks, great food, great service. When in Scottsdale hit this place up! Was awesome at 4pm and apparently gets crazy fun later in the evening!"
