b"I love this place. The kids Mac and cheese is the best! I wasn't a fan of the truffle Mac and cheese though. The impossible burger was so yummy! The only reason I'm not giving a 5 Star is because of the truffle Mac and cheese and the buffalo cauliflower. It was basically just boiled cauliflower with hot sauce. Would highly recommend this place though! Can't wait to go back."
