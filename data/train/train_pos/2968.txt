b"Here a few times for boardgames (duh)It's a very casual place. They want you to order one drink min but I haven't seen them checking up on ppl. Nonetheless I like their drink and food menu. The coffee is pretty good. They also come up with occasional twists to it like lavender or Nutella flavoured latte. They also make good panini The boardgame selections are not as huge as other places but it's enough. They also have an escape room but we never tried it. Will definitely come with friends over and over again."
