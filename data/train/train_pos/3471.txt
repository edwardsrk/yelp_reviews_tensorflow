b"This place is simply amazing! They have a marvelous selection of tequilas and make some of the best drinks I've ever had with it. We had their chips and salsa, as well as most of their happy hour items - which shouldn't be skipped! Our server Joe was on top of everything with helpful suggestions.Some of their dishes take 15 hours to prepare. You won't find the cheapest fare here, but quality costs. I promise, they will wow you."
