b"Talk about nostalgia. Stopping in at Smeeks was like going back in time to all those awkward childhood days. Minus the awkwardness. This shop is adorable and their selection is even cuter. Charleston Chews, Pez dispensers, Salt Water Taffy, etc. All classics from back in the day. They also have a wall of old toys...the silly trinkets that you'd be willing to spend your whole allowance on as a kid. $5 for a miniature rotary phone? Of course! A mini Etch-A-Sketch to hang from your key chain? Hell yeah! Smeeks is bringing back the good old days.Anyway, this place is great. Silly toys, tasty candy, and super cute gifts for anyone. I will totally be back."
