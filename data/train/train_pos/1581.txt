b"Man, I wish this place had a view of the Cuyahoga River...if it did, it would be perfect. I wish this place was at the other end of the Powerhouse, where an ever-revolving stream of restaurants find their home...and unfortunately, that's the side with the killer view. Everything else is top notch-the beer is mind-blowing and the food is hearty. It's worth coming here just for the beer, in my opinion! I gotta start taking a Growler home when I leave--they are very reasonably priced, all things considered. Other than the view, the only thing that stinks is the parking--if you don't wanna pay for the lot on weekends, you gotta hunt and peck for a spot on the street, which can be hard to find at times...but anyway, if you're looking to grab a bite to eat before the show at the Plain Dealer Pavilion or whatever it's called these days, you won't go wrong at the Rock Bottom."
