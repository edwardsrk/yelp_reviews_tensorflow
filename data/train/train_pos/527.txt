b'I have found my new spot! I really wanted to give this place 5 stars I really did! Our server was terrible :(OK, so let me start... We ordered a Margarita that was made for 2 people to share. Yes I got drunk off it and yes I had a designated driver. It cost $25 for it but let me tell you it was strong and 48 ounces of heaven. It lasted my whole meal and that was with my man drinking off it too. The downside was as we watched the server at the bar making it she put a toothpick in her mouth that she then put cherries on and then put in our drink. GROSS! I\'m totally getting that drink again it was too good. It was called "The Romance".We started with tacos. If you show your local ID after 6 pm Mon-Fri you get up to 4 tacos at 50 cents each. YES just 50 cents each! They were by far the best part of the meal. You can pick between chicken, beef or carnitas.I had the "Enchiladas Suizas" which was very good. It had Chicken, Tamatillo Sauce, Sour Cream, and Salsa. It also came with rice and beans that were full of flavor. I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together. I finally said that I get them that way everywhere else and that is how I would like them. You will see by the picture I posted that they held up just fine :)  This dish cost $15.My man had the "Beef Fajitas" and he ate every bit of it. He didn\'t like that it had corn grilled in with the veggies but he will know for next time to tell them to leave that off. This dish cost $19.My mans Dad had the "Chili Relleno"  and this cost $16. He really enjoyed it.I totally recommend this place to anyone who loves margaritas and great Mexican food!!!!!'
