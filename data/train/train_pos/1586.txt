b"A go-to spot for me whenever I'm feeling frugal and need a solid meal.I'd give it five stars but one star gets deducted because it does take a while to get seated and food takes quite a long time.Other than that, great atmosphere, good music (most of the time..), and food is quite the bang for your buck."
