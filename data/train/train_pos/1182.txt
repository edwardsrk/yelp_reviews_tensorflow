b"Somehow this one has the best food.Staff: friendly as usual. This is one of the few that the staff upsold to me on pies and I appreciate them taking their job seriously.Food: it is the same food but it seems like they put more care into it so they seem to have the right amount of ingredients in every sandwich. I will say they seem to only have apple pies and no other options (other places have at least 2 flavours in my experience)Overall one of the best locations I've been to"
