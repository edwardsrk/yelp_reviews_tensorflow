b"So pretty inside and well organized! I called for an appointment before my wedding for me and 3 others and was told they wouldn't be able to help me on that day because they were going to be too busy. :( So we went somewhere else. I had a gift card for here so I went here for my fill, and they did a great job, but a bit overpriced! I brought my daughters in so all 3 of us could get pedicures and had a great experience! Overall a great place!"
