b"Awesome location, beautiful room, and jets in the tub! The staff is very friendly. Free Wi-Fi. The only con was that when I stayed there was a LOT of construction in the neighborhood. I really can't add too much to the other reviews here - I highly recommend it for a romantic getaway to Montreal!"
