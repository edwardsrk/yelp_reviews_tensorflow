b"I am really impressed with the shortness of the lines here. Otherwise this is a pretty standard Wal-Mart, but i've been here maybe 5 times and I don't think I've waited longer than 2 or 3 minutes to get in the self checkout, at least compared to the Wal-Mart's in LA that is really good wait time."
