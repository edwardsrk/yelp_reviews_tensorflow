b"Great find right in the Lakes area. Much smaller than anticipated, but that didn't affect our visit. The place is physically split in half; one side is the bar, the other is the dining room. For the happy hour specials, you'll need to be in the dining room. We went on a Saturday around 6 and it was pretty busy in the dining room. The bar not so much. Service was prompt and friendly, food order was taken quickly and food delivered on point. Wife had the prime rib - very good, plenty of food for 14.99! I had the prime rib dip sandwich, tasty as well. Definitely will be back, especially for breakfast."
