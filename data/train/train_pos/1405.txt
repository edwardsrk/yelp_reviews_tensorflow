b"I didn't know what to make of this place when walking in, there was very limited seated and not much in the way of decor . BUTTTT the food was excellent ! I went for brunch and will definitely be going back . you can actually see them cooking in a regular home style kitchen. I had their version of eggs Benedict and it definitely hit the spot ! fresh breakfast dishes all made to order and friendly welcoming staff you can't go wrong . BUT try and get there early or you may end up waiting a while for a table"
