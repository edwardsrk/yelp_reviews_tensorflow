b"Tip: Don't forget to get a punch card for a free wash!My dogs nails seem to grow an inch a day and he will fight to not have them trimmed. I have taken him multiple places but haven't had the success I have here. They let me in the room while they trim his nails so I can hold and comfort him, plus they do all their grooming behind a window so you always know what is going on. I drive twenty minutes out of my way to come here because we consistently have a fantastic experience. I prefer to wash my dog myself (so I don't have any experience with the additional grooming services they offer). The facility is always clean, easy to use and the employees are super helpful (and seem to really enjoy their jobs). They have everything you could need to groom, including toothbrushes, brushes, and towels/dryers. I always go with the basic wash and have been very happy with it (about $15). Their pricing is the same no matter the size/breed. My dog is about 45 pounds so for me it's worth it but might not be if you have a tiny dog. The food/treats are great too. Super healthy brands that I can feel good about feeding my dog. They sell toys/leashes/collars as well. We always end our trip with one of their bakery items, which my dog gobbles up.They have a super sweet resident cat that doesn't seem to be bothered by much which we always say hi to on our way out. Can't recommend this place more!"
