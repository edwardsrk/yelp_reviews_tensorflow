b"Me and my Girlfriend decided to take a walk down to the AGO from a place we rented out while on vacation here. While looking for food she spotted Chippy's from across the street and both of us being fish and deep fried food people, we thought we should give them a try.Honestly, I think we were both impressed with the food. Nice portions, tasty sauces (I had the pepper mayo, she had the garlic mayo) and the fish was fresh and the fries were awesome. She went with the Trout, the fish itself wasn't super flavourful, but the batter they cooked it in added quite a buttery compliments that we eaten together (as you should) really brought the fish alive. As for me, I went for the Scallops. Honestly, I have to say, I really, really enjoyed them. The batter was nice and crispy, but not to the point of hurting your gums, the seafood was soft and very flavourful. Adding the dipping sauces, you really get the full effect. Pepper mayo + Scallops = happy taste buds.The staff here (The one guy who was working at the time) was super friendly, really chilled out vibe, interesting music selection as well.I really recommend checking this place out if you go to the Trinity Bellwoods Park."
