b"This place serves the best chicken biryani I have ever had.. hands down! When I was pregnant with my daughter, I craved their biryani that I ended up having it several times (yes im guilty of overloading on carbs!) love love love! I would suggest that the restaurant needs an upgrade tho... it doesn't look very professional inside and when I came here while I was pregnant, the chairs were not very comfortable at all but the biryani is ON POINT!"
