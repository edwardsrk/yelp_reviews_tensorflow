b"This review is for the downtown (St Catherine) location.They've now (summer 2016) expanded into two wings: A Japanese cosmetics side (to the right) and the usual Korean cosmetics a few steps away. Whenever I buy products from here they are always fresh and of a high quality. I strongly recommend the Japanese sunscreens, if you can afford them!"
