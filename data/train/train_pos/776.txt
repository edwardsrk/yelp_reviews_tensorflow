b"i'm mostly judging brocach on its ambience since i've only eaten there once and hardly touched my meal (just wasn't too hungry that night). but this is definitely a place i love to come and meet up with friends. the booths are upstairs are big enough to sit 8, and when the rest of the group joins, there's plenty of room to grab a bigger table or just stand up and mingle. i love the dark wood, the noise level (loud from voices, but the music is at the right volume), the beers. definitely my idea of a good bar."
