b'I love a good hot dog and we were excited to try this place out after hearing great things. We drove by one night with family and it turned out to be just a small inside counter with only about 2 seats. They do have a picnic table outside for nice weather days. We decided to come back a few weeks later and planned for take out this time.  I ordered the regular hot dog and they have a wide variety of free toppings including ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles that I went for.  My fianc\xc3\xa9 ordered 2 of the specialty dogs, one with mac and cheese with bacon the other with spicy peppers and sauce.  We loved them all and the dogs are served on large fresh buns and they split the dog lenghtwise to get the toppings inside-yum.   For $2.50 extra you can get an order of fries and drink.  I ordered 2 sides instead and got the mac and cheese which was amazing and I highly recommend. I also got the potato salad which was not so great-basically frozen hash browns in mayonnaise.  Regardless it is still worth stopping by when in the area.'
