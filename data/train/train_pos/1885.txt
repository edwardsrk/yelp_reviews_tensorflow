b'Last dinner for summerlicious for 2017.Enjoyed the atmosphere for the restaurant. Service was great.Got a plate of mussels, steak & lobster, and a chocolate tartufo for dessert.Nice big plate of mussels, in a wonderful sauce.Steak was a bit chewy. Excellent mashed potato.Tartufo was tasty. A great way to end the meal.Would definitely come back to try items on their regular menu.'
