b"The gelato was outstanding. I have to deduct a star because it was overpriced....sorry. If they knocked a dollar off each size, I would give 5 stars. I had the caramel cappuccino....so yummy. This is a great place to walk to  after a nice dinner. I didn't feel so guilty eating all of those calories while I was walking around eating pure sin in a cup."
