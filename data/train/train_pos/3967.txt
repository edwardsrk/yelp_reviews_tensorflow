b"We've eaten years 3 times: the first shortly after opening was great, then not-so-good last fall, and recently last week. Our latest visit was EXCELLENT!!!.  We ate at Delmonico and Gordon Ramsey last week and both were lacking compared to Beso.  Our steaks at Beso were the tenderest and best flavored by far.  The service and ambiance were outstanding! Thanks again Beso!"
