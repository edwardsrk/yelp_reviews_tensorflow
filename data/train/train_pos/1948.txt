b'I quite like this unique place with bright yellow sign and old school Chinese restaurant name.  Love it.  The indoor decor however looks a little too grand for my taste.  There are a lot of crystal chandeliers, with golden colour everywhere.  I think the servers should wear matching colours too to make the golden decoration complete, but their uniforms looks quite normal,  lol!  I arrived around 1pm which is the regular price period, and the dim sums are quite pricey.  All the food are quite good, but I still think it is a little over price.  The highlight for me is the steamed beef tendons with konnyaku as it was soft enough to eat but not mushy with some wonderful aromatic to heighten the taste.The service was reasonable, but not great.  i do like the fact that they are playing the food documentary on the screen where I learned something about traditional food preparation method of some new year Chinese food.'
