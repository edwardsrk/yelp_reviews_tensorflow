b'I own a catering company, so we have several vehicles that constantly seem to need service for one thing or another. Add to that 2 personal vehicles for my wife and I and car repairs can get quite expensive. Bell Union Auto is as honest as they come! Great service, reasonable prices and honest repairs.  I highly recommend them!'
