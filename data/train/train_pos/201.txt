b"This location mirrors the Tucson location! Same food, set up, and relish cart area. The grilled green onion bulbs are so soft and yummy! The variety of the salsas are great! The Sonoran dogs are authentic. No need to drive to rocky Point for my dogs anymore. I'm not a huge fan of their beans tho. The parking lot is small."
