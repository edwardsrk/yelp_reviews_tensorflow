b"Expect this place to be packed on a Saturday. It was so packed, it was a tad frustrating when trying to navigate the aisles. I don't think I could solely shop at this store if there was one in my area but I do like that they have a lot of unique food items. Since I knew I wouldn't be back to Trader Joe's for a while, because it's so far from where I live, I made sure to really look at everything they had to offer. My favorite part of the store was the frozen foods section. There were hundreds of frozen foods I'd never seen before. So, here's what I bought: cookie butter, a trio of flavored olive oils, cinnamon coffee cake, frozen lobster ravlioli, frozen orange chicken, frozen orange juice (as recommended by a friend), creamy gorgonzola, frozen naan, frozen mac & cheese bites, a smoked ghost chili grinder, and a few clif bars in flavors I've never seen before. Total bill was $40. My favorite item so far is the cookie butter. I could literally eat it with a spoon. Actually, I did. Anyway, the lobster ravioli is delicious but you don't get much in a package. Enough for 2 people. The coffee cake was tasty. The gorgonzola, well, I guess you have to like stinky, moldy cheese, I don't. Not sure what I was thinking there but it was awful. Haven't tried any of the other items yet. The lady who rang up my groceries (Tora) was very nice and talked to me a lot and seemed to really like her job. Overall, a pleasant experience, I just wish the store was a little less busy. Maybe I'll go again on a week day."
