b'Came here on a Saturday with my boyfriend to satisfy a dim sum craving we both had. I made a reservation for 1 p.m., and when we arrived, the place was packed. It also appeared to be really understaffed, as the hostess was running around the front dealing with reservations, seating charts, and serving. Because of the lack of staff, it took us a bit of time before we could ask someone for a pen to start ordering, and before we we could order drinks. As a side note, please be advised that they charge for tea here. My boyfriend and I don\'t drink tea, but the group next to us were really peeved about this when they received their bills.Ordering is very simple, just check off the items on the brochure that you want. We were happy to find lots of options, most at prices ranging from $3-6, which we found to be incredible value. We ended up ordering the following:- har gow- chicken siu mai- shrimp spring rolls- BBQ pork buns (x2)- pork pan-fried potstickers- beef ribs- yeung chow fried riceWe enjoyed every single thing we ordered (the dumplings and fried rice were my personal favourites), and our bill came out to under $60 with tax (tip not included). We even were able to bring home some leftovers, which my guy was really happy about, because he had been craving the pork buns for a while.One star off for the wait (even with a reservation) and for the curt service of the woman who brought us food but would not respond to requests for sauces, utensils, or drinks because she was "not the waitress". We will come back, but may re-think it if service does not improve on the second go.'
