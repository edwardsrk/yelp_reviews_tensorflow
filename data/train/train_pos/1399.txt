b'This is easily the best place to get a gyro in this part of Henderson.  I work near Russell and the 95, and there are 4 Greek places near me that have gyros.  This blows them all away.  Great size on the sandwich, and the sauce is very flavorful.  Also, the fries are much better than average for a place of this type.  Highly recommended.'
