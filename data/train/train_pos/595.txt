b'Went here last minute to get a quick trim. I typically check in online however this time I did not. I sat down because every was busy. Nobody put my name on the list but once Shelly was done with her 2 customers she took me back. She was amazing!!! Took her time making sure she got my hair right but still was time efficient. Great price of $13 for a haircut. I will be back! Thanks Shelly!!'
