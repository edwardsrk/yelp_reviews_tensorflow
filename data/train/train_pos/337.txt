b"There's always a line at the warehouse whenever I walk by Queen West. Now I understand why! All food items were only $5! Drinks were yummy too. Came here after work on a Friday night but luckily my coworker had her cousins already lining up so the wait wasn't too bad. The decor inside was very hipster and the DJ was playing some throwback hits. I ordered the works burger with yam fries and the mini donuts! The yam fries were delicious, but the mini donuts stole the spotlight. Hot and fresh with some cinnamon sugar and butterscotch dip? Perfection. I'll be back for lunch when there's less of a line!"
