b'It\'s tough to measure Mexican food. But being it my first time in the west coast, all my friends emphasized that I must try the Mexican food. I was in Phoenix and we drove around for a Mexican restaurant that didn\'t have all the Yelp banter associated with it. So we found El Ranchero, which was previously "The Original...". We gave it a try. We ordered Carne Asada, chicken tacos and had some sweet rice milk drink that was out of this world. With the rice, beans, cheese, salad, the hot sauces and the flour tortillas, and for the $9 that I paid, I couldn\'t have picked a better authentic spot. P.S. Their jalapenos were OD spicy. Save your tongue for the food.'
