b"I've been coming here on and off since 2009. I've had great professors overall. 3 of them I didn't care too much for. I never had a problem with financial aid staff, just advisement. I have waited an hour for advisement even if there's 2 students in front of me. One of the advisors in Buckeye talked to me for a minute and then got up to help other students and ignored me for the rest of the time even though I wasn't done asking questions."
