b"I'm just going to say what needs to be said- Soul is the best restaurant in Charlotte. They made a mean dirty martini and the pork belly tacos are ridiculously addictive. I think the fact that I'm willing to wait well over an hour  to be seated (which is usually WAY beyond my waiting threshold), says something about how amazing this place is. Go and you won't be disappointed!"
