b'This place reminds me of my grandmas cooking when I go visit her in Mexico. Cheep prices for great food. There is little shops around so you can go shopping around once your done with your meal. Restrooms are kept clean, tables and chairs are always clean. The employees are amazing and sweet to all. This place is the place to go if you want real Mexican food in chandler!!'
