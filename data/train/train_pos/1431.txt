b"We stopped in here after discovering HR had microbrews, it was a nice little find. We sat at the bar and were tended to almost immediately. With drinks already in mind, the wife ordered a bloody mary and I opted for their seasonal which was a winter style ale. I prefer stouts but this ale was easy to drink and had good flavor. The bartender was very generous with the pour for the mary, which was nice. When you pay big hotel prices for drinks we are grateful of generous pours. Bar staff were friendly and checked on us often, so no issues there. But we did notice a few of the dining room wait staff obviously slacking off. We only stayed for 1 drink before lunch so we left shortly after our only round. No reason we wouldn't go back again for another round and maybe play some shuffleboard too. The only issue we ran into was access to the parking, its a bit confusing and difficult to get in and out of the property depending on which way you are coming and going from."
