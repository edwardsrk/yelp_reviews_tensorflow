b"We love Big Surf and get tickets on Groupon to visit once or twice per summer. It's never over crowded on weekdays and my kids (aged 3-12) never get bored here. Would give five stars if the water in the wave pool was cleaner, the rafts were cheaper to rent, and they had more access to drinking water out there (have seen multiple people throw up - likely due to dehydration)."
