b"Cash only! I have been enjoying Lee's for probably a decade and am still a fan. The meat quality is not the very highest but their fresh made croissants and baguettes will have you coming back for more. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, not the quickest but can get you in and out for lunch. Great pastry options for purchase and their Thai iced coffee will keep you going all day. A sandwich, chips, and soda will land you around $11, not bad!"
