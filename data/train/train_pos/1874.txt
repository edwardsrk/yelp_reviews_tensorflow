b"i got takeout, tried the Salmon and Shrimp Kabobs, a side of Humus and the Fried Cauliflower app.Had my order rather quickly, about 10 min maybe, the people taking care of me were very friendly and accommodating. Everything I needed was in the Takeout bag. The Shrimp and Salmon Entree which came with Basmati Rice and a Salad was excellent  and so was the Humus, Wasn't real impressed withe the Cauliflower, not bad but not memorable either. Will return and probably eat in, looked like a nice place."
