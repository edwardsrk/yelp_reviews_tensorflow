b"Probably our favorite restaurant in the area. Great food great prices and always a fun environment. We've never had anything we didn't like and you can't beat the beautiful patio views of LKN any time of the year. When our family comes to visit from NYC this is always their first choice for dinner, sometimes even twice in one week!"
