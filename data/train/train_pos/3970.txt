b"I recently had my first Reiki session with Annette, and I can't wait for my next one. I decided in the New Year that I have some issues to work out, and I very strongly felt that Reiki needed to be part of my healing. I was right. I went in not really knowing what to expect, but Annette immediately put me at ease. She has such a beautiful, calming energy, and she is very skilled at what she does. I felt a tremendous release and movement in my body and mind during and after my session, and I know that I am on the right track by adding Reiki and Annette to my life. Annette and Project Refined Life are amazing."
