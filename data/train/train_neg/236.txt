b'It was a truly unfortunate situation, I was visitng with my sister (she resides in beachwood)  and my 2  children- ages 22 mo and 4. We were literally thrown out of the store because the kids were touching the toy cars in the plastic bins.. It was UNBELIEVABLE ! They threatened to call security. We were flabberghasted, AS adults, we were simply standing there, toys in hand waiting to purchase our items. Prior to this, the "salespeople" were following others in the store while :"rearranging afte each customer had moved an item. even slightly. It was CRAZY, totally inappropropriate and RUDE especially in a TOY store. This place will be out of business within a year. NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE. In this economy, I wonder how they will survive, as nobody (the day after thanksgiving) was buying anything). TERRIBLE STORE CUSTOMER SERVICE- DONT SHOP HERE!!!'
