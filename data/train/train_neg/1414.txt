b"Ordered to go through grub hub. It came extremely fast but the order was messed up. Ordered buffalo chips, got plain chips with a side of blue cheese. Nothing even remotely Buffalo. Paid for extra ranch, got no ranch at all. Buffalo wrap was soggy with hot, bitter tasting lettuce on it. Won't be eating here again."
