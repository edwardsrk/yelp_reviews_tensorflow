b"Horrible horrible horrible service. I chose the restaurant for my birthday dinner. The food and restaurant itself were lovely, but I really can't stress enough how rude our waiter was. Lots of blank stares and disinterested looks, taking our order seemed to be a waste of his time. We also waited with our empty plates in front of us for 20 minutes while he gave the tables around us what we overheard to be very friendly service. I'm assuming this is because my boyfriend and I are in our mid 20's and the nearby tables were older couples. I realize Yorkville is known to be a snobby part of town, but I have frequented other restaurants in the area and have never had a service issue. Apparently if you are under 30 you aren't allowed to eat at this restaurant and receive good service. I would recommend going in with your Chanel bag and Gucci loafers or you'll be waiting quite a while to be checked up on by your waiter."
