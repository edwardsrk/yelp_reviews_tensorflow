b"I was extremely let down by our trip to David's. We make an appointment and didnt get called back for 20 minutes after my scheduled time. All the while the lady at the desk said it was to finish the bride the stylist was working with from before. Well apparently she wasnt done. So instead of having all attention on me we split her time. Which would have been ok if it was even. There was a point I searched out the seamstress to take off the dress that I had been in for 20 minutes to use the bathroom. In the time we were there the other bride was in 10 dresses in the time I was in 2. After my appointment where the seamstress took over because my whole group was starting to be irritated we went to my bridesmaids. The stylist came back The dress that we picked didnt come in the right color so I picked out 4 different ones. 2 of the dresses brought over weren't even the correct ones. Insulted one of my bridesmaids who is a 4 or a 6 with bringing her a 14 saying she will get the idea anyway... After I said the last dress wasnt the correct one the lady said well you have basically seen everything so you will prlly need to look somewhere else for your bridesmaids. I had no limit to my dress budget left buying my dress which is why I gave up an extra star because it was beautiful. My daughter is in my wedding and when I stated she would like to have something similar to me, she stated they were on the other that I could look myself if I wanted to... Shes 7 and left crying because I had no clue what I was doing. very very disappointed in a day that should have been nothing more then smiles and happiness!"
