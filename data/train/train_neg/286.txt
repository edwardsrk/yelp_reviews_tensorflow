b"AWFUL AND RUDE!!! April is a miserable person and god forbid if the phone rings or she has to actually have to work. I have an 11 year old little girl who is very self conscious about her hair and April kept rolling her eyes and made my daughter mortified and embarrassed because her hair was knotty. She even asked me to brush my own daughters hair because it would take too long for her to do it. Here is a little advice April, get her wet and spray some detangler in it and it comes out. Needless my daughter was hysterical and I promised her we would NEVER go back there. I  disgusted this woman has no compassion and clearly is lazy and doesn't want to work hard. If it was possible I would give NEGATIVE stars, please my fellow Vistancia people go to the lake pleasant one!!"
