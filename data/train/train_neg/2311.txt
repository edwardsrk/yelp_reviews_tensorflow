b"Pretty disappointing. I met a girlfriend here at 11:45 hoping to grab an early lunch. By 12:25 our orders - a salad and the fish, both off the specials menu - still hadn't arrived. No server came back to refill our waters, either. Ultimately, after 45 minutes of waiting, we suspected our orders had been missed. She finally came back and explained that the kitchen was backed up with two large groups and that's why we were still waiting. Since we had meetings at 1pm to get to, we asked to have the lunches wrapped up. Cue the broken debit machine - another 10 minute wait to be able to pay for a lunch. I'm finally having my salad, which is good, but I feel like we really earned it. I doubt that we will go back."
