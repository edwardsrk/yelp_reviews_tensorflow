b"I have been a Barro's consumer since 1990 in high school and have visited and become loyal to many locations throughout the valley since then.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this location, its management and staff.  I have ordered from here 4-5 times since they have opened.  Every time I request verbally over the phone for parmesan cheese and red peppers and guess what never arrives or I have to ask for again at in store pickup, yep cheese and peppers.  I understand that this is a small complaint as the food is always good but it is the small stuff that even when confronted to a manager they shrug off and say we will add to your account and blame the staff, this is not acceptable.  Again I can raddle off about 7 locations off the top of my head I eat or have eaten at for years and this is the only location that I can guarantee 100% before we order and request verbally we will never receive. There comes a point that where I either go back to make sure I go to a location I can get on the way home or drive back to or cut my ties in general.  I prefer none of the above and hope this location reads this, learns from it, and moves forward to make sure this does not continue to happen."
