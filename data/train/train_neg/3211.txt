b'Drove past this place the other night and made a note to stop by and check it out. Well tonight\'s the night. I must say that it\'s a modest, nicely laid out location with a small but good selection. That\'s about where the fun ends though. It hasn\'t been often that I\'ve walked into a cigar shop (almost anywhere for that matter) where I haven\'t felt welcomed, but I have to say, this is one of those shops. I\'m not sure if it\'s because of the great time I just had at Majerle\'s or if I was interrupting the game (which I came in to watch) but I simply "wasn\'t feeling the love."I smoked an Arturo Fuente Hemmingway which was perfectly moist and relaxed with my iPad for most of my visit. The clerk (proprieter?) literally said three words to me the whole time "cigar?," "$9.99" and "Thanks."  No offers of joining the rest of the guys, where you from?, what do you like to smoke?, not even "Do you want to smoke here? Need matches, etc" Although the guy after me at least got the last question. All in all, a pretty disappointing visit. Selection was ok, but I can find that anywhere along with a bit of camaraderie. Therefore I\'ll take my business and friends elsewhere next time. If you decide to check it out, I hope you have a more enjoyable time.'
