b"We are totally grossed out after eating at Zinburger today. First of all, while we waited outside for a table, a man stood right next to their fencing between Zinburger and Pomo and blew his cigarette smoke onto all the customers that were eating outside. Not a single employee at either restaurant said anything to him. After we were seated and ordered our food, another customer was seated alone outside. As soon as the hostess walked away, her male friend went into the patio area with a large dog. The dog jumped up onto the upholstered bench and then the girl's lap. The dog proceeded to sit at the table as customers inside watched and commented on how gross that was. As we waited for our lunch, we noted that every employee that walked passed this couple stopped to chat for quite some time. We're assuming the dog owner is also an employee because everyone seemed very friendly with her. Most of the employees also stopped to pet the dog, bring it water, feed it fries, etc. and then they would immediately serve food or fill water of other customers. One waitress (with her blonde hair in a knot, large black earrings, and a black and white headband) petted the dog on several occasions then brought food to customers, picked up a water pitcher and rubbed one hand all over the spout as she carried it, etc.  Next time I eat at Zinburger, I think I'll bring my pet ferret to run around the table and between customers' legs."
