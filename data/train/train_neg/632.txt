b'This location used to be good - knowledgeable people worked there etc. All the knowledgeable people are gone - not trustworthy - I traded a system - left the CD in by accident - it was a hard to find CD - of course they can\'t find it. They made no effort to contact me etc. Untrustworthy staff - will never go here again. At the time manager "Jessica" told me should would get the item back to me - of course she made no effort, I contacted numerous times, I hope she\'s not still there - dishonest employees are the worst. Edit: I\'d just like to add that in 3 years I haven\'t been back to this location and I buy games all the time. I just wanted you to know how much business you\'ve lost in being dishonest people, I hope it was worth it. You still owe me a fire emblem radiant dawn cd = lousy gamestop.'
