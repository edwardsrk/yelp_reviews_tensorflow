b"We've been here several times over the past 10 years and have always enjoyed perfection. So we were surprised to be disappointed on our last visit. We were in a hurry to catch a Cher show at the Park, so sat at the bar, ordered a bottle of champagne and ordered our meal. My salad came lacking the cheese the bartender had said would be on it. I mentioned it to him and he expressed surprise but didn't offer to get some for me. No big deal.  Then the medium rare filet arrived medium well, and it was stringy, dry and tasteless.  We didn't have time to request a new one so I ate it. Next day, I wished I'd sent it back, but with the champagne and everything, I didn't want to kill the evening. So very very disappointed."
