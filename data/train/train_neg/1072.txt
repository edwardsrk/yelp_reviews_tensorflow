b"So, mother always said if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. When I finally reached someone at Ladlow's after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in September they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench wasn't on order. They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn't find an order from Ladlow's for the item. I was glad they sent the refund check so quickly. That's as nice as I can be."
