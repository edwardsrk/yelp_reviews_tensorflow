b'This is the first one star I have ever given on yelp, mainly because there are usually redeeming qualities to any establishment or business. NOT this one, avoid it like the plague. The Older Indian lady there is by far one of the most defensive and rude individuals I have ever encountered. Walk inCharged 3 dollars for using email to download a file Black and white machine broke down so forced to print in color with no discounts.Stays on the phone out of site for 3 minutes while I wait to pay the outrageous charge of 3 color pages for 5 dollars Proceeds to ignore me in sight while still on the phone not coming to work the cashierWhen I called her out for poor customer service became unintelligibly defensive and rudeAgain avoid like the plague I plead to you all U of T students!!! I would give negative stars if I could I hope the business goes bankrupt to be honest.'
