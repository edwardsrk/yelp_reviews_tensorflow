b'i went there last week...2nd week open they will need some time...the crew has not been fully trained...the cashier has no idea how the chicken is made..hand dipped, buttermilk, double dipped etc...thats a management problemi love the biscuits but they are way too small, the coleslaw was good but my special order was 1 breast 1 leg and shades of kfc the chicken has 4 breasts with ribs and spine attached...ugh that being exactly why i no longer eat at kfc...add to that cooking A breast that has been cut in half changes the cooking time for the rib spine section which means the meat is so dry and overcooked u will choke on it even with your drink. hopefully this manager will take the time to have staff properly trained and get full breasts and not cheap it out will give them a second chance in about a month'
