b"The concept of this place is good (fresh and organic produce and goods) however the prices at this place are outrageous.Having stepped foot inside a number of times, I always leave empty-handed. Who can afford to shop here???I find this place quite pretentious. Sure I care about what I'm putting into my body, but there are plenty of other (and better) places in town where I can get chemical-free/gluten-free/sugar-free etc etc. goods without having to break the bank.I'm done with this place. We've officially broken up."
