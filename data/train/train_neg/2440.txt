b'There is a nice selection of original items for babies, plenty of maternity wear and nursing bras- though very pricey.The snacks such as banana bread and carrot bread were fine but nothing special. The ingredients are not written on the packaging -  so not great for those with allergies. The play areas for babies and toddlers looked as though they had not been cleaned in a while which was probably the biggest turn off. Overall it seems as though there is potential but it is not a place I would return to anytime soon, nor would I recommend it just yet.'
