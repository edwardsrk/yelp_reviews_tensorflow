b'Despite me having given them all of the information requested from me, North Scottsdale Women\'s Health did not (and still has not) submit all the correct forms to my insurance agency, which is the provider\'s responsibility. Michele then put my account in collections without notifying me. I only found out because months later I tried to book an appointment to get a prescription refill and was told I couldn\'t due to my account status. Because of that, my credit score has gone from "very dependable" to "very risky" in a matter of months. The billing manager did not apologize or express any regard for me as a customer. She was impolite on the phone and stated haughtily there was nothing she could do. As a previously loyal customer, I\'m highly disappointed in my experience, particularly due to the billing manager\'s service and NSWH\'s supposed inability to pay the $200 it owes to the insurance company.'
