b'Update: Alright. So even though Sakana has its days when it\'s super amazing. Sometime I shake my head and wonder wth is going on. Today I have officially been eating here consistently for over a year. I just met the third owner of Sakana and am wondering how is it that she co-owns this place and was puzzled when I asked for half rolls... the manager was in a panic the entire time and somehow we got someone else\'s roll, and jacob didn\'t get half of this order. Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn\'t been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back. -------I rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. $23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. As far as the quality of the sushi, it\'s not fantastic but pretty good. The only downside I would have to say is, don\'t experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, "the shit" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.You may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items'
