b'This place is totally crap. Used the self-serve wash bays. Spent 30 minutes and $10 between three bays. None of the selectors sprayed anything but plain water. No soap, no tire cleaner, no wax, no nothing. Tried switching to a different bay, twice with no luck. Asked the service attendant for assistance "you turn the switch like this." Brilliant. You had one job to do. Total fail. Clean and nice setup, if only the little spray gun was capable of firing off something other than plain water.'
