b"I remember very well now, why I always avoided this particular joint.  For a place that seem to operate within the Fashion district-  and I assume they make big $$. I strongly suggest to the owners to invest 20$ in the hygiene and look of the place. Feels like you're eating in a 3rd world country cheap noisy cafeteria.Yes they might have good coffee but if you decide to eat there....they  will trick you into taking a plate and will slide in side orders. They will not be shy to charge extra ....so be careful. Portions are small but taste is ok. If you want something,  you'll have to chase for the waiters -  they will never make the effort to ask if you need anything else.Other than that- its good place to keep up with the industry gossips or the annoying sounds of the sport tv's."
