b"Very disappointing... And here is why...1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!)3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight. Not a great tone to set for patrons. 4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer. What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer. 5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet. Lame. 6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife. A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask. 7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke. Ended up costing $16+$31+7 (tip for pizza guy)= $53 for two mediocre cocktails. Won't be back."
