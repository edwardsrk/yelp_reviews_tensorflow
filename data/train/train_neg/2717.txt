b"The food is great. The service is.. bad.. very bad.Upon arrival we were told just go find a seat anywhere there was only 1 booth open and 2 with tons of dishes on them. We went to the open booth because we have a baby and it's easier to block her into the inside of a booth. We go to the booth and it was super dirty the server came by and cleaned it for us after a few minutes. She came back and took our drink orders at which point we also ordered the street fry appetizer. They were delicious but they took 15 minutes to get out which in my opinion is a long time for fries. While we were waiting for the appetizer we ordered our main course. We were 1 of 2 tables left at this point. After finishing the appetizer it was another 20 minutes for the main course in which time our server never returned to our table to refill our glasses which were all empty at this point or to even ask how we were doing. FINALLY our food shows up on their station with the heat lamps where it sat , while our server chatted with the bartender, for another 10 minutes. She finally decided to bring us our food and says oh I'll be back to refill your drinks which didn't happen for ANOTHER 10 minutes. She finally returned and 1 of my party of 4 sent their wings back. They were burnt to a crisp and cold simultaneously..weird.. she offered to bring him a slice of pizza, which she did, after yet another 15 minutes. At this point nobody was hungry anymore everyone's food was cold so we sat, another 15 minutes. Before finally I got up and asked the server who again was chatting with the bar tender for our boxes and our bill. She brings our bill fairly quickly at that point.. the only thing she did quickly. Honestly.. if it wasn't for the amazing pizza here it would be a 1 star review, but, the food really is very good. Just order it to go.. you don't want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth from the untrained service who couldn't care less about you or your experience."
