b'This review is on the lack of customer service at this studio. I purchased a groupon for 10 classes and was not able to use it because no one would call me back to schedule my appointments (I had questions regarding the individual classes and wanted to talk to the person.) I left messages and even went by the studio during "open" hours but the doors were locked. So I wasted $30 and countless minutes of my life due to there unprofessionalism. Double thumbs down for this studio!!!'
