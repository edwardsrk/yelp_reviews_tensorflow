b"My husband really likes this place.  They provide all you need to wash your dog at a reasonable price.  In addition, the wash for the dog is about counter height which makes it easy to wash your dog without the back pain.  Here's for my bad part of the review.  The last visit, the employees were offering dog wash cards to the customers.  However, it wasn't offered to us.  Sadly, we couldn't help but think about some type of prejudice against us.  Did my husband look like a thug that day because he was wearing a beanie in the cold weather?  Or are they prejudice against the breed of our dog, an American Bully.  Whatever the reason, we were paying customers and didn't feel like we were treated fairly by simply not being offered a dog wash card."
