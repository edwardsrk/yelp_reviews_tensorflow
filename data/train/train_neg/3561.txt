b"With so many far better Mexican options within walking distance, and with a history so rich, Hussong's need to step up its game.The food just wasn't great.  Barely good.  Passable, more or less.  The margarita was good but not great.  The chips tasted stale and store bought.It was a wasted Vegas food opportunity for us.Hussong's, get better!"
