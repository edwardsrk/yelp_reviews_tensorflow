b"We had a work dinner yesterday at Moxie's, we had a reservation for 12 people. The waitress seemed confused but did bring our food and drinks correctly. We had appetizers, main dishes drinks and coffee and right after coffee (I was still drinking my tea) the waitress came back with the bill a message to leave as they had the table taken. We were there around 2 hours beginning to end (which is normal for a dinner but we were still thinking about having at least one drink at least).This is incredibly rude, they have lost our business. I already forgot if the food was good or not, the only thing that I remember now is the terrible service. I have to add that the place wasn't packed... there many free tables. Such a shame..."
