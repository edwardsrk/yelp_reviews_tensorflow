b'I was a 1-2x per week regular for almost 3 years. Until today. I called my order in like any other day. I\'m told 20-25 minutes and my order will be done. Cool. I arrive exactly 20 mins later and pay. I\'m told 10 more minutes, due to there only being 2 sushi chefs on staff tonight. Meh, ok fine. 15 mins go by and nothing. I ask the ETA and am told "a couple more minutes." After 5 minutes i see my order getting bagged up...but no...one of the rolls is missing. 10 minutes later i stand up and go to the counter. "Mom" as the staff calls her goes to the chefs to inquire about my missing roll. 5 minutes later it still isnt out. I ask for a discount on the order due to the time. Short staffed? Ok, but don\'t tell me my order will be done in 20-25 minutes and almost an hour later it still isn\'t done. Three tables worth of people walked in, sat doen and got their food. I ordered my food to go 20 minutes before I even got there and this happened? Mind you, i come to this place so often that the veteran staff knows my order just by my voice. "Mom" gave me $4 for the inconvenience, but I am so disappointed. Food is good. Prices are ok and the wait staff is hit and miss. If you go and get CeCe as your waitress, tip her well. She bends over backwards for her customers. Anyone else is a box of rocks. And apparently being a regular doesnt mean much.'
