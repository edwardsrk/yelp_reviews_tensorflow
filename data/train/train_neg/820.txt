b"Never stay here, this place charges $170.00 a night and doesn't give a free continental breakfast for there guests which is inexcusable for a hotel that supposedly prides themselves on being a top notch hotel.  I've never been treated like this by a hotel ever, this is unacceptable.  We will never stay at another Courtyard by Marriott, they have lost a customer."
