b"Just got back from dinner at Johnny's.  Used to like this place but what Italian restaurant has no pasta on menu for New Years Eve.  When I called for reservation they said they would have some regular items on menu but they just had a pre fixed menu for the night.  Filet was undercooked (raw) had to send back.  Food was  not up to par and  very overpriced for what you got.  They should have stuck to their original menu.  Used to be my go to while in Cleveland but not any more."
