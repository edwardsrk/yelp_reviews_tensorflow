b"This was my second visit over the past year.  I confess to enjoying it more the first time although I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered.  I came for lunch again, but this time ordered a steak sandwich.  It was dull.  I guess I had it in my mind it would be something like a cheesesteak sandwich, but it was basically a thin slice of steak under-seasoned open faced on bread.  Meh.  Not sure this is worth a repeat visit."
