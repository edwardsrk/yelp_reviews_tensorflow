b"The good food is not worth the hassle of dealing with the lady at the window she treats the customers like dirt. On one visit I asked for my change and was told no you don't get change and had the window shut on me, the second time I paid for and didn't receive my side of sour cream and when I asked her for my side she demanded I dump my bag of food out at the window and show her there was no sour cream. I plan on never returning to this location as she is always working when I drive through."
