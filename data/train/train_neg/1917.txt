b'I went here for the second time, with two friends during lunch hour on a Saturday. I ordered the Greek Lamb Burger, it was the worst burger I\'ve eaten in a while, because it was overcooked and burned. And not just my burger, my friends burger was burned as well. When we asked the waitress how long it would take for the food because my friend was in a rush, she hastily said "I don\'t know" and walked away. Not coming again.'
