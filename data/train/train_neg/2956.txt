b"First time eating here, the atmosphere is nice, the waitress was friendly but never around, and the service was sooooooo sloowww!!!! and it was not busy. The chips and salsa were good to start, but the beef fajitas were the worst fajitas i have ever had the meat tasted like it was marinated in A-1 sauce, and that's gross on a fajita. Wife's flautas also were not very good, though and my dad had a chicken dinner that he like but said it was too salty, and my mom was not happy with her salad either. (if only twin creeks was open on Mondays)"
