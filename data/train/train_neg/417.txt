b'Ordered fried noodles. NOT GOOD AT ALL. All I tasted was the OIL. There wasn\'t much but there wasn\'t any salt, soy, garlic, I MEAN NOTHING. That\'s why I was able to taste the OIL on the noodles. There wasn\'t even a soy sauce package in my bag. You want REAL, TASTY, HAWAIIN FOOD, CHECK OUT ISLAND FLAVOR off Durango. THE BEST.ok - Why did I call and spoke w/Judith (acting supervisor) and 2 THUMBS DOWN really now.  I told her that my chicken looked and tasted like it was from yesterday. And she totally didn\'t hear what I was telling her. She kept repeating that they use "fresh" chicken everyday. Please your a supervisor OF COURSE your gona say that BUT if the customer is telling you that the chicken is NOT FRESH ummm get a clue. Then she tells me that I have to bring the food back. OK WAIT LET ME THROW IT UP N BRING IT BACK. Hello this was my lunch time. I don\'t have time to take it back after work either. And she tells me that in order for me to get a refund OR another dish..I have to bring it back...wwhhaatt!!! OMG. Please hire a SMART, PROFESSIONAL supervisor that knows how to HANDLE these types of situations. I tell her that as a customer when someone calls and says there food is BAD it should be an AUTOMATIC thing to offer the customer a refund OR come back ANY DAY WITHOUT THE LEFT OVERS and pick something else. She mentioned to me that the reason why they ask customers to bring food back is because they HAVE ALOT OF PEOPLE CALLING IN and say THERE FOOD WASN\'T GOOD...UGH HUGE CLUE, RED FLAG...Im not the only one..Get a clue Aloha Kitchen..IF YOUR GETTING ALOT OF PHONE CALLS, I would highly take it seriously on why your location is getting a lot of phone calls on how BAD YOUR FOOD IS...'
