b"Never again.  The apple french toast (~$12) and the sampler (includes a little of the chicken dumpling, sugar crusted ham, and meatloaf - ~$14) and both were huge disappointments.  The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).  Other important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service."
