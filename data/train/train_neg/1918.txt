b'Would give this place Zero stars if it would let me...I have been taking my car here for a while now and for the most part have been satisfied. I have a monthly pass continually for several months now HOWEVER, on my most recent visit I had a HUGE issue! I have a 2016 Honda Civic and have had no problems with the car whatsoever until this day. After they were done cleaning my car they called me over and I went to start my car and somehow my car wouldn\'t start and the battery was dead! When I finally got someone back to my car to tell them the issue there was already someone trying to lift my hood to jump my car and it was magically jumped within second and then the guy tells me to take the car over to their oil and lube area and they would run a battery test which they "supposedly did" and the guy told me the test is reading I have a bad battery and I need a new one...funny so I scheduled an appointment at the Honda dealership and see the printout below of what Honda\'s battery test said! Will never take my car here again and I will be cancelling my pass ASAP and I will be coming back in to speak with a manager about this crap because it\'s completely UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISHONEST!!'
