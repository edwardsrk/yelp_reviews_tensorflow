b"Still hosting our Notre Dame watch parties. Love the venue, also good food, but the service continues to be an issue. Last night was awful! Server disappears forever, can't get drinks .... got the wrong checks .... some servers are so GOOD while others are absent. Such a shame, and so frustrating. I got up 4 times and went looking for our server for a drink, and then to order dinner, and again to get the wrong check, and again to get the right check. Come on guys! You can do better than this."
