b"I don't know what to say, I love the food but as everyone says the service is terrible.Part of the reason is that the owners steal all of the tips from the waitresses. They make minimum wage, and all the tips go to the owners. I am torn. It is without question my favorite food, but the owners steal from the servers. So I don't think I should eat here.... Really disappointing...  What does one do in this case?.... The other Indian restaurants around here are terrible. So I can drive to Tempe to support better practices for servers, or I can eat here and support thieves with delicious food."
