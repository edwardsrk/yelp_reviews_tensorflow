b"My gf and I moved to Bridgeland last week and yesterday we tried Main Dish. We wanted to pick something up to bring home because it was a busy night. We got coleslaw, 3 quarter chickens, mashed potatoes, and rice. The chicken was dry and one of the portions had very little meat on it. Also at $7.50 each they were overpriced IMO. The rice/squash combo was very bland and also dry. The coleslaw was too vinegary. The mashed potatoes were good except charging $5 for a little portion like that is unreasonable.  It's disappointing they advertise their meals as tasting 'home cooked' because that is not the case. It was about at par with the delis at Safeway, Co-op, etc. but more expensive.  The only plus was the service. The staff were friendly and courteous."
