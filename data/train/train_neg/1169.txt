b"This restaurant has terrible service.  The waitresses are extremely unhappy and rude. When we got our table, we had to wait to get our menu. Food is not very tastey either. Then, when the bill came, I didn't finish my food and had asked for a takeout box. The waitress said very rudely that I had to pay 25cents for a takeout box. I have never once had to pay for a takeout box in my entire life of eating in restaurants. This restaurant is extremely cheap. I will not be coming to this restaurant ever again."
