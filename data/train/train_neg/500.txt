b'Be careful when consigning with other mothers! My first time consigning was NOT a good experience.  I brought in about 50 very gently used (some never worn)items. They were only used for my grandkids when they spent the night occasionally. I was told they were behind, call in 24 hours. I called back and found out they were only interested in paying me $1.26, two items. When asked they said they weren\'t interested because of fashion or condition . I later thought about it and realized I was donating summer clothes in October.  Slightly offended, I told them I disagreed but I would definitely be in to get my clothes to sell somewhere else. A few days later I come to retrieve my belongings only to find out that they have donated my clothes and tossed my storage bin. Now, I will admit I failed to read the fine print, but I do believe a simple verbal "reminder" when I reject the amount and let them know I will be in does not seem unreasonable. 24 hours from that conversation, I was told they put the clothes on their porch for a discounted rate to go to charity. I believe that it benefits them more to have clothes in front of their store to draw in customers than it does to have the people come back and pick up their belongings. It benefits them to not give you a friendly reminder. I was upset and surprised. The manager promised that the owner, Nick would be giving me a call to discuss my concerns. It\'s been a week and I have not heard from him. I will obviously not be consigning or shopping with other mothers again.'
