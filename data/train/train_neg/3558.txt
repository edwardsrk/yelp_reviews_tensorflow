b'I got a 30 minutes reflexology, the massage itself was okay. I did like the fact that the place was clean. When paying I noticed a list on the wall, it says a tip of $5 means you\'re "sad". Wow, for a $20 massage $5 tip is pretty good! But they expect $15 and up! Maybe their workers are not paid well and count on making a living with a significant portion of their income being from tips. But that\'s not right! The owner should pay them what they are entitled to.'
