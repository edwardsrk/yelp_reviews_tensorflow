b'There are literally over 60 TVs in this place so wherever you sit youre going to be able to aee all four channels theyre playing. Sat down and it took longer than usual for our waitress to get to us. We ordered sodas and they were twice the size of a normal soda and we didnt need refills which was nice because our waitress never came to check on us. I ordered the ribeye and my friend ordered steak fajitas. Im not picky about fat on my steak (though 50% of the steak was fat) but what I am picky about is if there is a big fat VEIN in my steak. That is NOT normal. I stopped eating once I found it. I also ordered a caeser salad with it. I took one bite and pushed it to the side. It tasted old and the croutons had gross Italian seasining on them. My friends fajitas were good except when she ate the steak by itself, there was zero seasoning on the meat. The guacamole was just pureed avocado and was straight out of a container. Me and my friend had to convince each other to say something about the food because it was really that bad. The hostess came by and saw the look on our faces and told us shed go fetch our waitress. She came and said shed get the manager, Andre. He came and we explained everything. He was a little defensive about the food but overall he gave me a new cut of steak to go with more onion rings and he reduced our $50 dollar bill to a $20 bill. Overall our experience wasnt that great but I gave it 2 stars because of Andre. and how he did his best to fix everything. We wont be back.'
