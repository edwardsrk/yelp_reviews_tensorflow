b'I wish I could give a -10 on this review. The front staff were so unprofessional which should have been a give away that I should of just walked out. I saw the doctor here who did not address my needs and told me to see an eye doctor. I followed his advice and saw an eye doctor. While I was getting my eyes checked that doctor saw a HUGE mass on my right side and with great concern called the Brain and Spine Center so he could talk with the doctor I had just seen who did nothing for me. After COUNTLESS failed attempts I was sent to the Emergency room by my eye doctor and told I would be be admitted but he still wanted to continue trying to contact the Brain and Spine Center as this is a brain matter. I was admitted immediately and had 3 MRIs and CAT scans and other procedures done to find out what the mass was. It turned out I had a tumor! How could a brain doctor fail to realize that?! The eye doctor kept following up with me while I was in the hospital and even got a new Neurologist involved. He said as his patient he needed a doctor he could consult with and I needed someone for this time in my life. That eye doctor made all kinds of calls for me and I now have 3 amazing specialists. I wish my story ended there, I got a large bill in the mail from the Brain and Spine Center after paying my co-pays from my insurance.'
