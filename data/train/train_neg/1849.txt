b"My wedding is coming up, so where better to go check out suits/tuxes? Man, was I wrong. I was only there maybe five minutes and felt like I was not wanted. I walk in the door and I'm asked how many groomsmen and they give me a price instantly like I couldn't afford to be there or something. Before i even saw one tux or suit. No big deal though, so they tell me the girl in the back will help me even though they already started. Ok, I get it the girl in the back does the rentals.  She points at 6 suits on the wall and says those are my choices and asks me if she should measure me. I thought, um yes you will need my measurements for a suit or tux. She measures my chest only and tells me if I dont want something not on the wall I need to go back and talk to the other people. Then acts upset while she says if I want to try anything on from the wall she has to take it off the mannequin. What!? Im here to rent a suit or tux. Why do I need to see another person. Why can't I try something on after being measured? I was so confused by the incompetence and awful customer service.  Go to Nick's or Celebrity Tix and Tails instead!"
