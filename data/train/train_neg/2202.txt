b"I'm a big lover of dim sum and have been since I was a very young child back when no one even knew what dim sum was.  I've eaten dim sum around the world.  Kwan's food is good but after having gone there a dozen times and repeatedly having the same bad experience in terms of customer service, I'm so turned off.  While there is an abundance of wait staff, it is impossible to get anyone's attention once seated, to even put in your order or ask for anything else.  No one has clearly ever stressed to the staff the importance of being attentive, welcoming and polite, either.  And while their prices are not through the roof, they aren't exactly a bargain either.  $18 for Chinese broccoli with ginger??!!  Given that they price some dishes so ridiculously high, one would think they would bring them pronto so that the diner doesn't have enough time to brood over or process just how expensive the dish actually is.There are other options for high end dim sums, Lai Wah Heen being one and Crown Princess on Bay being another.  The latter is fancier, has a more extensive and exotic menu and is more affordable than Kwan.  More importantly, their staff is phenomenal.  I'd make the trek there rather than to Kwan's.  The extra travel time is less than the amount of time I've waited at Kwan's for impolite service."
