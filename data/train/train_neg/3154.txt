b"Fast-food in a Fine Dining RestaurantI made our reservations well in advance and was excited to be celebrating my wife's birthday at Beauty & Essex. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, I am highly disappointed by my dining experience and can't recommend this restaurant. The food was tasty and perfectly satisfying, as was the ambiance, I think. \xc2\xa0The problem is we were so rushed through our meal by our server that I barely had time to enjoy any of it. Only moments after placing our order the food arrived, quicker than some fast-food restaurants I've been to. We were never even asked if we would like a second cocktail, the plates were promptly cleared, and then the bill arrived. \xc2\xa0The message was clear, the restaurant values turning tables, not customers."
