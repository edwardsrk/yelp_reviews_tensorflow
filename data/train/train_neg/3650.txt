b"Asked them to turn on the baseball playoff game and was told that the owner took the remote control to his home.I then asked them for the password to the WiFi and was told that the owner doesn't want anybody using it but himself ...To the owner:  Please enjoy the $10 that I spent at your restaurant as it will be the last money that I will ever spend at your business.  You need to get with the program as it is very common for patrons to ask for the TV channel to be changed (especially when it is playoff season) and so you know any business that doesn't offer WiFi to its customers is definitely the exception to the current way of operating a business.  Anyways, good luck to you and your outdated way to conduct business in the year 2015"
