b"Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. This was at noon. Wasn't very happy. Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon"
