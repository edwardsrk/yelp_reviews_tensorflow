b'I\'ve worked at Oliver & bonocinis. I know what is expected of a visit to any of the O&B restaurants. Honestly .. if this place keeps up with the terrible service that I experienced tonight, in such a prime location, Oliver and bonocinis will eventually lose their good reputation. My friends and I waited for over ten minutes - no menus. No water. No server. No SERVICE. and it\'s really not that busy. The server in the section looked absolutely miserable and didn\'t acknowledge us once until after the manager came over (35 mins after already sitting there and ordering drinks off a bus boy - who forgot and I ended up just ordering from the bar) The manager then forgot our second round of drinks - remembering once we waved him down. The food ... not up to O&B standard .. calamari tasted like frozen calamari .. the tacos were (in lack of better terms) slop. And the wings and crab cakes .. they were "alright".  This review is slightly harsh however I expected much more from this restaurant and was slightly embarrassed as I told my friends from out of town how great it was.'
