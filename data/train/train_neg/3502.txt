b"Really disappointed by the Pad Thai here, the standard non Thai style red sauced Pad Thai with absolutely no tamarind flavour. Just red sauce and chilli. I don't understand why they would label it Authentic Pad Thai on their menu, this is just insulting... The mushroom tom kha soup was ok, but mostly broth and only a few mushrooms. The avocado peanut stir fry was the best thing I ordered. I probably won't reorder."
