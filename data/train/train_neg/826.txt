b'I would not eat here again if the food was free.  I am by no means a picky eater but i ate in with 1 other person and no other customers.  My friend got their food 10 minutes before me and they forgot about the soup until after the food came.  I got the sesame chicken and have never had the sauce gloopy and a burnt red color it was gross.  The other persons pork was nothing but fat chunks and inedible.  One thing going for them is the prices are cheap and the portions are big but with most of the food not being edible it is not really worth it anyways.'
