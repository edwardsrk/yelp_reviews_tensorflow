b'I read some of the reviewsin groupon and a lot of people gave this restaurant 4 stars so I wad expecting really good food and service. The service was bad, the server saw we had a groupon and just asked how would we like our steaks and what kind of wine we wanted, we asked her questions about wine and she said "idk, I don\'t drink wine" . We asked for water and had to wait 20 min for it, and she never came back to refill it. Portions were very small the steak was very dry and rubbery. We also ordered guacamole and chips, the guacamole had no flavor at all we had to put some salt and pepper to make it a little better. The cheescake was very good, this was the only thing we like really like.'
