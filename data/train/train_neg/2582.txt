b"All reviews are based on price point...Getting tired so a bullet point review:-- renovations don't bother me-- not having hot water one morning was unacceptable-- telling the front staff and being dismissed...unacceptable-- no coffee pot in rooms...I enjoy coffee in the morning and tea in evening-- beds are very soft...tough on the back-- for towels the first day, two thereafter...one towel needed to soak up the shower water that splashes out of the glass enclosure--  there are better places to stay"
