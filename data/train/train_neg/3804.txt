b"Their food is ok, but I'm used to having more authentic Vietnamese food coming from San Diego. The reason for such a low score is their service. Our waitress actually stopped mid service and went outside to talk on the phone and have a cigarette. No one picked up her tables and no one helped at all. Unfortunately we've been twice and it wasn't any better the second time. I did wait to see if perhaps it was only one instance, but they just aren't interested in good service I guess. My daughter liked their boba however, so not all was lost."
