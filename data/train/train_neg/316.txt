b"My wife and I have lived in Madison for 6 years now and we are certified foodies...eating out in Madison-area restaurants 4,5...even 6 times a week...rarely have we both experienced worse food than what we did here...one snowy afternoon.We started with Tom Yum soup, which was pretty good, actually. But that's it!I had the curry squash with chicken which everyone seems to love and my wife had the ginger chicken....the taste of the sauce was at best worth 3 stars...but the chicken was probably a week or so old..and I have no idea what they did to it when they cooked it...but after one bite, neither of us touched it again...my wife actually had to to spit it out on a napkin coz she would have had 2 puke otherwise. The ginger chicken had enough ginger in it to make the Gingerbread man feel repulsed!We barely ate half of what was given to us...mostly the sauce and veges and politely declined boxes for the rest."
