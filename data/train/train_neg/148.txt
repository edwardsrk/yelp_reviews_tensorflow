b"horrible.   Never again.  I booked this through the airline  (Allegiant). waiting no less than 50 minutes so far and no hope of the shuttle in sight.  I've seen a one driver go by twice, we still wait.  I came to Vegas for some much needed R&R.  So far I can't get away from the airport.  Call Uber, probably about the same pride.  Never again for this outfit."
