b"This is one of the sadder bars in Pittsburgh. It's mostly populated by people who work at other bars in the area, and there's a rather desperate cliquishness to it. Some of the wait staff are super friendly, but the main barman is roided up, snappish, and generally deeply unpleasant to interact with. You'll get the real measure of this place by reading the pathetically sexist, misogynist menu - this is the kind of bar that thinks that 1950s-era sexist jokes make the menu sound edgy and modern. Utterly and irredeemably classless, the kind of place that wouldn't survive a month anywhere in the northeast other than Pittsburgh."
