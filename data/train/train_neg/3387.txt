b"Very Slow.The first time I visited, I went through the drive thru. There were a couple of cars ahead of me, and it took a while before I got to the speaker to order.  Then a while longer before I got to the window.  Then longer still before I got my food.  Over 20 minutes but the food was pretty good.The second time, I decided to go inside and get my order to go.  This was a mistake.  The line was not moving very fast to take the orders, but the worst part was waiting for the food.  Someone would put an item in a tray on the counter and then go work on some other order.  After a while, someone would put something else in the tray, and so on.  The result was over 30 minutes from the time I placed my order until I received it, and most of it was soggy and falling apart and cold.  Luke warm would be a generous description.  To be fair, the beans were hot.The food is basically the same as the 'bertos around town, but I won't be back due to the wait."
