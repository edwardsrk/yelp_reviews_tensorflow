b"This one star is not for the Massage therapist.   The massage therapist I go to monthly Josie is amazing.  That is why I travel almost an hour to go to this location.   The one star is for the clerical staff.    If you sign up monthly for massages and have specific terms of when funds should be debuted from your account then why does the company just debit from your account when they choose too?   Each month between my massage and fees from my bank my massages is really expensive . This is a chain business.  The owner of this location definitely needs to look to the corporate office for some training tools for his or her staffing or get more involved.  I have seen others with the same issue as I when I'mAt this location"
