b"Just can't believe these people. Needed an item that their website said was in limited supply in this store and I should call ahead to ascertain it would be in stock. On a Friday, during their business hours, called for 2 hour straight, every 5 minutes. Continuous message that the line was busy. They have ONE line and they apparently keep it off the hook?  The item I wanted is fairly pricey and I will now buy it elsewhere. This is not the way to make customers happy or bring people into the store. Very frustrating experience, especially since I have patronized this store more than once in the past."
