b"This restaurant deserves more than 2 stars because the food is great like it should be at any tk restaurant. However, the service we received while dining at the bar was so mediocre that the excellence of food couldn't even save the experience. The bartender helping us seemed like he had no use of his own brain. One mistake after another, and in place of recovery we received a couple of insults. This won't stop us from dining at other tk locations. Writing this review and hoping that management will read it and do something about it."
