b"Horrible place to watch the NFL playoffs!! With about 25 tv's they only have 5 tv's with the game on. Thought this is supposed to be. Sports bar!! Not coming here again to watch any NFL games. Even asked the younger owner and he wouldn't change the tv's or put the sound on to at least here the game."
