b"Omg!! Service was reaaaally slow. It's a serve-yourself fast food place, but it took them 25 minutes to make a kebab combo! The food was alright but very oily. The salad was just lettuce with a gross amount of Cole slaw dressing that got all over the meat and the rice, and quite frankly made half of the dish inedible. I'm so disappointed. It's been a week of bad food for me :("
