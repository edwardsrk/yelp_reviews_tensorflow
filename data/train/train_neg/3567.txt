b"I would have given more stars, because the patio is really cool and the fact that it definitely kid friendly make it awesome.  My problems with this place lie in the fact that they do not have servers at the table and charge $14 for a burger and $10 for a salad.  I don't mind whatsoever paying that price but I would appreciate service."
