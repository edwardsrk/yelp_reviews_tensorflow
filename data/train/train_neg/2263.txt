b"Growing up, I used to go here every Sunday, however stopped for 5 years and I finally made back couple of weeks ago. So, what's my thought?I'm truly disappointed. Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not. I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum. I'm definitely will not be plan on going back for any reason. I think I'll stick with my random trips to Atlanta and get dim sum there."
