b'How is In the Company of Thieves?  It depends on what you\'re looking for.If you\'re looking for a place to get consistently delicious fair trade coffee?  You\'ve found it!If you\'re looking for a place to get consistent costumer service?Not so much.I live right around the corner from Thieves, so I want to love it so bad.  It\'s the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.Here\'s my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I\'d heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I\'d do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, "What can I get you?"   No "Have you been waiting long?" or "Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!" or another plausible explanation.  I ordered my coffee, it was delicious.And this has been the kind of experience I have come to expect from Thieves.'
