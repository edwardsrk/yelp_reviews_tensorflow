b"So I was waiting  to check out and the lady who took me was very rude she needs to be trained to do her job right if she does nt.  like her job than leave.  She  was a lady maybe in her 50s she had black hair . I was asking her how much was each items I had a budget and I didn't want to go over and she said well that's why there a machine on the register to tell you how rude of her to say that to me . I felt like it was a bother of her having me there there fore I will never come back unless you want to have bad customer service"
