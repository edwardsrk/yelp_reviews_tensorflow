b'I have been here several times. One time, they got me mixed up with another patient (don\'t know how because my name is so unique) so they treated me according to the other patient\'s condition and did not discharge me for an extra 3 hours because they had to get everything straightened out. I was told that my description of symptoms was "wrong and not possible" by a woman who never introduced herself, so I am not sure if she was a doctor or if she even worked there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They also gave me a handout for high blood pressure because according to them, 110/70 is too high. Completely incompetent people working here and I will not return even if I am dying because I will never put my life in their hands again.'
