b'I come to Vegas once or twice a year, though I had never stayed at Paris hotel.  After this visit, not again.  The spa at Paris, is the worst place I have ever seen.  It is unkept, dirty, scummy and smells like dirty feet.  The facilities are horrible.  The attendant frankly lazy and rude. Do not waste a penny.  I have seen high school gyms more appealing.'
