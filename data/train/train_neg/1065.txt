b"I really don't even want to give it one star, but it looks like I have no choice. First of all, there service was okay when we walked in. The kid was nice to me, but just decided to stare down my shirt as I leaned over the counter, so freaking rude. So after that we waited about 10 minutes to get our food, and even though it's fast food I really don't mind waiting for good food, but when we asked for ranch for my wings they said it was 42 cents... I said nevermind. And when I got my wings I opened the box and they where small, and no sauce on them. I started to eat them and they where really soggy. Like they had been sitting out at least for 3-6 hours and then they put them in a microwave. GROSS!! And then I looked on the receipt and it said you only get one ounce of sauce! Cheap!! So my boyfriend decided to get 2 for $6 burger and a chicken sandwich. And he just says they where nasty. He did tell me that the little cheese bites that where in the burger and chicken sandwich... he says they tasted like fake cheese and they where a bit rubbery! Cooking 101... a microwave it's used for cooking!! This place needs to be shut down! There fries where okay, but I would have rather gone somewhere else. Now I have a stomachache and I am not happy at all. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I am never going back."
