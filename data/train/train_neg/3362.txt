b'This place has the worst cafe food that I\'ve ever eaten... worse than hospital food, which is pretty bad. Even the salad selection is horrible.Avoid anything with seafood. It\'s overcooked and dry. Avoid rice as well for the same reason.In fact, avoid this place altogether.The only reason why it gets a second star is because they bring in outside restaurants in the "Cultural Exchange" section, which has good food from places such as JohnnyBurrito.'
