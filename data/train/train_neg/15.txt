b'The absolute WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. Moved here from out of state. Hoped to find a decently priced apartment until I got myself settled in. Wow this place has been trash. Landlord is only here half the time, so those of you with a full time job, forget ever trying to communicate with her! Doesn\'t answer the phone or call back. Place can\'t even get with the 21st century and splurge on email communication. Rent past due? Noise complaint on an animal? Anything, Don\'t worry, you\'ll be singled out with a cheap ass piece of paper taped to your door for the whole complex to see. As far as CAM Properties as a whole, also trash! They also refuse to give callbacks. After hours "emergency?" ha, yeah right! Scottsdale PD had to be called when I had troubles after hours because CAM\'s "emergency after hours hotline" didn\'t answer the phone! I will never ever recommend anyone live here. The bugs invade the units like crazy - cockroaches, spiders, lizards, you name it. They say they spray before you move in, but do not perform any follow up procedures. They tell you if there\'s bugs in you apartment, that\'s all YOUR fault. Ha! I cannot get out of this place fast enough. The only upside is the utilities are included, however the price is still absurd for the less than average amenities and the horrible customer service.'
