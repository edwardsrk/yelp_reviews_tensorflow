b"I had said I wasn't going to go back here but someone gave me a gift certificate for a mani pedi. I loved my pedi even though I know it won't last long from past experiences. For my mani I decided to upgrade to their SNS, which is supposed to be healthier alternative to acrylic. It has potential to be good but the lady did such a rush job and was so distracted the whole time. She glued my finger to my nail, filed down the top of my finger, ripped up one of my cuticles, didn't even clean up most of my cuticles, didn't clean up the nails after and didn't even give me a hand massage. I still tipped her because I'm not an animal! But for reals if someone is paying for an expensive service I expect the person to give me VIP treatment, instead I felt like she couldn't get me out of there fast enough."
