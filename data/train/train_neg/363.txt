b"Beware they surprise you with a 15% gratuity without letting you know.I should have read yelp reviews before I came here.. Service: The service we received was NOT good. Our waiters were rushy and rude. My sister ordered a soda and those Chinese donuts (cold) for her soup but it didn't come until halfway through our meal. Food: Yes they have a large selection to pick from but majority of what we ordered wasn't even good. I would never ever come here again."
