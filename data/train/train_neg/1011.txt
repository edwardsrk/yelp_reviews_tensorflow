b'Really bad service at this location very bad attitude from Bernice and the manager Lettica.We went through the the drive thru and order 5 meals when we got home we were missing one of the order, we called the store to tell them we were missing a order, the manager Christine told us that they would replace the missing order, just come back next time and mention her name and that she would leave our name on a board for us.When we went to order our replacement order we talked with Bernice at the counter and asked to speak with Christine and that she had promised to replace the one order that we paid for on our last visit.Bernice told us that there was no information that she could not find for us and that she could not replace the missing burger, I did ask to speak to the manager, which Bernice told us that the manager was busy, I did then ask her for a district manager name and number. Which she refused and walked away from us.The manager Lettica did finally came out to explain to us that they have homeless people trying to get free food from them, I was not looking for a free meal, I was looking to pay for 4 meals and see if I could get the meal I paid for on the last visit.After being compared to a homeless I then took my business elsewhere.I still would like to hear from a district manager to let them know how disappointed I am with this store.I know going through the drive thru this does happen, but going inside to recieve this kind of service is not acceptable.
