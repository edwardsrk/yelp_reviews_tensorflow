b'Being a mix-raced Transgender couple minding our own business shopping we noticed we were being followed. My partner decided to sample one chicken nugget. They stopped us after we purchased some items and then stopped my partner and said he had stolen nuggets and contaminated the rest of the nugget bin because he was gay. They dragged my partner to unknown room and would not tell me what was going on. They told my partner that he had stolen and contaminated the rest of the bin but they did not remove the rest of the chicken nuggets so they are selling contaminated nuggets to everyone. So if you like chicken nuggets beware they will be probably be contaminated by homosexuality.'
