b"If I could I would give this place zero stars. I have had the worst experience with this dentist. After making what could've been a one-day procedure last three months they still haven't finished my route canal.so now with a temporary filling I am being forced to find another dentist.PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And I would like to add the office staff was very rude multiple times. And the dentist seemed insincere distant and really not there.               BE CAREFUL!!!!!"
