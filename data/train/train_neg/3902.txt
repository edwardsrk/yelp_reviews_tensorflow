b'The rooms are clean and modern and overall the staff is very helpful.  The problems are the carpets in the hall way are old and dirty. They are tapped together.  Bugsy would be very disappointed. The elevators are brown vs brass on the inside.  There are 8 -10 elevators up to the rooms. Each one make its own set of weird noises. Some beep, some light up, some are bumpy. In all of them you just hope you  get to your floor.'
