b"Pitts-burger is a frozen beef patty with fries and coleslaw.  I originally asked for the burger well done.  I was told they can't do that since the patties are ready made and just heated up.  That should have been hint enough for me to change my choice. It has a weird old meat taste and the texture doesn't even resemble burger meat. I ate two bites, took out the meat and ate the bread and coleslaw. Unsure of how the menu claims its the #2 seller. Service was friendly but skip the burger and opt for a regular sandwich."
