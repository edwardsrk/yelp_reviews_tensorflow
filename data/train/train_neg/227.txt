b"If your Open sign is on, it's twenty minutes until your posted closing time, and all the lights are on, don't look at me like I'm an idiot for wanting to place an order. (The floors were already wet and they'd been in the process of closing for awhile judging by the bleach smell.) Seriously, I wonder if the manager knows about shutting down a full half hour before closing."
