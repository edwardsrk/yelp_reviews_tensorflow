b"I ordered that Pomodoro and honestly I cant tell you it was pretty horrible the meatballs were very overcooked and dry, the sauce was incredibly bland and the portion size was like 2 bites. The only half way decent thing was the actual past itself which was average. For just under $11 definitely not worth it I wouldn't have paid $5 for this."
