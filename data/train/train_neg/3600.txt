b"This diner has some promise. I think you experience here may depend on the dishes you get. We got the chicken pot pie, the Greek salad, chicken fingers and meatloaf. The Greek salad was disappointing. It was pretty much a pile of iceberg lettuce with a dusting of feta cheese, three cherry tomatoes, boxed croutons and not much else. The chicken pot pie was way too salty. The chicken fingers were cold. The meatloaf was the best of what we had but nothing special. I know they are really popular but with all the great options in Vegas, I'd skip this place."
