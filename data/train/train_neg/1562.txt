b"Beware. DO NOT PICK THIS HOTEL!. The staff is very rude. We got a room that was not cleaned at all. The toilet wasn't cleaned, floors were sticky and dirty towels everywhere. A friend booked a room and they told him room wasn't available because of maintenance and every manager was in a meeting at that time and couldn't be bothered. Please pick a different hotel."
