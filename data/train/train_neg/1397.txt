b'This Freshii location is new and their employees seem very confused and incompetent. We ordered a Buddha Satay with extra sauce with steak and it was very dry practically with no sauce. We also ordered a kale salad and added avocado which we did not receive. Definitely do not recommend this Freshii location.'
