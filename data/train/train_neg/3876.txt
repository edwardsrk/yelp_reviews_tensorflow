b"Mediocre food. Nothing great. I've had better. Ordered take out 2 times and both times didn't come with cutlery. Didn't know we had to eat wonton soup without a spoon. The noodles were soggy in the centre of the bowl but the edges were still raw. Clearly were not fried noodles. Don't think I'll return"
