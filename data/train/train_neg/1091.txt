b"Wow. Came here based on Yelp & friend reviews and what a mistake. There were five in our party for breakfast. We were the only customers for the first half hour or so and the service was horrible. Waited for quite a while before having our order taken, only received drinks and coffee once with no refills at all. I ordered eggs over hard... not that difficult. They came out runny and gooey. I asked to have them cooked again and when the returned they still weren't done! No apologizes and no quick fix. Dirty dishes, floors & walls. The rest rooms were worse than a a college bar during spring break. Horrible experience. We will never return."
