b"Bad 1st experience! Charged for something I didn't ask for or receive. The young lady at the drive thru was rude and incompetent, it's just coffee and a danish. How do you screw that up? Will never visit this store again especially if she's on the window. Bottom line, put friendly people on the window who can place an order and swipe a card."
