b"How in the world does this place have a good rating on yelp? My failed attempt to find delicious Thai fried rice on the west side has started with TREMENDOUS room for improvement.  I ordered the Thai fried rice with vegetables and added chicken with a spicy request of 4 on their scale of 1 to 5.  This was the oiliest, blandest fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was so oily that I feel like my skin is oozing oil now, and I didn't touch my food with anything besides a fork and knife.  They must have misunderstood how spicy I wanted it because it had absolutely zero spice to it.  Stay away from their fried rice.  Maybe other dishes are better, but I will never know.  I need to go wash my face from feeling greasy now.  Blah.  What a waste of carb-calories, time and money."
