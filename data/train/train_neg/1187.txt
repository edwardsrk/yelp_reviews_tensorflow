b"Extremely poor attitude-problem from the seamstress, short and straight black hair, at this Lululemon.  I do not understand what her issue was or if she was just mad she was working during the after-holiday-rush, but she gave me a huge attitude during my time there to get my boyfriend's pants hemmed.  If I acted like that at my job I would be fired.  You're in the service industry so don't be a b-tch.  I did let the manager know how I was treated but she seemed to not take my complaint very seriously.  I don't feel like she listened or apologized for what happened even though she said she would speak with her.  I'm a small shareholder of this company so I am especially mad."
