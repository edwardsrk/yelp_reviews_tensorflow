b"I would give zero stars. I came here with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night only to be told that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table to be cleared. By this time we had already been waiting 15 minutes. I'm sorry but it does not take 15 minutes to clear a table. I should have offered to help clear it! There were no other people waiting for tables, but the server's excuse was that they had to clear other tables. This isn't the first time I have experienced bad customer service at this location. We left and will never come back here again."
