b"Well first the rooms are great and can't go wrong with the view on either side. I was a bit worried about the service aspect of this place based on a lot of below posts and they turned out to be true.Housekeeping is a complete disaster was there for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom suite and we only got fresh towels once. Called down numerous times the first 2 days and then we just went to the pool and stole some towels from there.The projector TV didn't work called down numerous times about that....no one ever came up.Ordered room service for breakfast one mourning after 90 minutes we called down again and they didn't have our order.Long story short....Rooms greatView greatLocation greatService absolutely terrible."
