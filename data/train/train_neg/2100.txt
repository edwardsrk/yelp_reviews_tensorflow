b'Island must be a Malaysian word for bland. We had the mango shrimp which tasted like water boiled bland shrimp with a green mango shredded and drowned in sweet and sour sauce. Chicken fried rice was bland and the mango sticky rice tasted like house brand rice flooded in sugar water with a half ripe mango. If you like food, this isnt the place to go. Maybe just a bad day for them, but no excuses'
