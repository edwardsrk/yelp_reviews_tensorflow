b'This was my first time visiting this salon and my experience was great!! Mr. Martin was amazing! I sat down in the chair in less than 15 mins and i did not even have to tell him how to shape my nails. The service I received was SNS on my natural nails. I will definitely be going back to visit this Updating my review as of 1/21/18I visited this salon today around 11:40a before they opened at 12pm, when i walked in i was the first client (so I thought) after a lady who was getting a pedicure and a manicure by two nail techs. I signed in and requested Martin who had done my nails before. Around 12pm when the salon officially opened for business other women started to come in and sign in. No other workers were there to service us even after the salon opened. At 12:15p, in walks another nail tech who sits by the check-in counter; she ask who is next and it was me however because I requested someone I allowed another lady to go in front of me. After still waiting on the person I requested to finish up, i am told at 12:30 that he has an appointment at 12:30 so I will have to wait longer. There are still only 3 nail techs to 5 women in the salon waiting to be serviced. Another nail tech walks in and takes me, because I am getting SNS i have to take off the precious color so they begin wrapping my nails. After he wraps my nails, he is told to start a pedicure on someone who came in way after me. Now i have been in the salon a hour and have YET to be serviced. I waited a hour and 15 mins to only leave with not getting serviced. The lady at the check-in counter was very rude and did not once apologize for how long I had to wait and did not even try to accommodate me. For this, I am updating my review and giving them 2 stars for the service I received today.'
