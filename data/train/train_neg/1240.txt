b"Ive gone to this nail shop 4 times in the past 2 years. Service gets worst everytime I go. The 1st time I went there an older man did my nails. The very next day my nails began to lift! I was in complete shock to see acrylic lift after 1 day. So I immediately went back to the shop and Tony fixed my nails free of charge. While doing so he told me that he was sick of the man that messed up my nails and that he had been trying to get the owner/his ex to fire him.  Tony is funny and ok doing nails yet very unprofessional. He said so many inappropriate things about his ex and women period.My 3rd visit there was because the nail shop I normally go to was crowded... Tonys ex/The owner did my nails and she seemed like she was in the worst mood ever, her son kept crying and was running around the place. But she did a better job than the older man and Tony. My issue was her poor attitude and her child running around. I normally go to the nail shop to be pampered, relax, get away from my kids. My 4th and final visit I got a pedi and a fill. Tonys ex (sorry I dont know her name) did my pedi and a younger Asian girl did my nails. Once again they both had horrible attitudes. The younger one was sooo rough and she ruined my pedi experience by doing my nails while I was getting a pedi. Instead of her moving to do each hand she had me cross my arm over the other so my right arm was numb by the end of the fill. She also damaged my cuticles and made me bleed. She gave me the most painful fill I've ever gotten.  Also the little boy was there again and he was running around and whining because he was hungry.  Also they charge an extra $5 to apply matte top coat even if you bring your own matte polish. She said they charge extra due to the extra labor! What extra labor? There is no difference between applying a shiny top coat and a matte top coat. Needless to say I will never go back to this nail shop."
