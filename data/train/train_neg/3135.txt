b"Due to the location this restaurant is a common corporate meal option. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and the best way to describe it is as putting in the absolute minimum amount of effort to milk the location. Drinks are extremely overpriced ($8 for a 16oz pour or $16 for a cocktail) and food is just ok although slightly more reasonable price wise. The restaurant itself feels somewhat poorly maintained if you pay attention to the details, things like properly working faucets in the restrooms.I would not recommend this restaurant, with so many options downtown your money would be much better spent elsewhere."
