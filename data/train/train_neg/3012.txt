b'Good food, horrible service.  Went in tonight with my son and was seated promptly. Chips were brought to the table immediately.  After that, nothing! Staff passed by our table without ever greeting us or taking drink order. Waited 15 minutes before getting up and leaving. I have been coming here for years but the service has declined greatly.  I will not be back.'
