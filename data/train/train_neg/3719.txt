b'This is NOT the place to come if you\'re looking for a spot to throw. During my last trip out to sin city, some friends and I were looking for a chill lil dive bar to grab a drink and throw some steel tip darts. This was one of the spots that came up in conversation w a local bar hopper as well as on a Yelp search. We thought we\'d give this spot a chance. Hmm, this place was very UNDERwhelming.The waitresses here aren\'t the most helpful. They don\'t seem too knowledgeable when it comes to knowing whether or not they have certain brews on draught or if they have ginger beer, etc. They also take too long to ask if you need help. Poor service!!!There also seemed to be some odd "rules" here about where they could and couldn\'t serve alcoholic beverages. They said it had something to do with their liquor license but it sounded like some BS to us. Having been the DD, I decided to order a soda. Yuck!!!! The syrup was not only gone but it tasted old and spoiled almost. That was disgusting. I sent that back and just had water. We threw a few games of cricket and called it quits. The score boards weren\'t at all in good shape. The boards were super beat up too. The bull line was real worn out. I knew this spot was dicey but this was pretty bad. I doubt I\'ll be back.'
