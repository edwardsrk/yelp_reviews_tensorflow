b'Great food and smoothies but horrible customer service. Everyone working still speaks as if they are in high school and being forced to talk to you when taking our order. They used to be 24 hour drive thru but recently changed it to close at 2am. Tonight me and another car in front of me arrived at the same time, 1:30, after the car in front of me sat there for five minutes he pulled off it was then my turn. No one ever greeted me through the intercom I repeatedly said hello? Hello? Only to never be answered and follow he car in front of me by leaving. As I left I knocked on the window and still no one came it was only as I slowly drove off in he parking lot could I see someone emerge from the back where they were hiding. Very disappointing that they have employees like that. Wanted a good healthy meal at 1am but this poor employee stopped thy from happening. Really wish this employee would suffer some type of disciplinary actions. Other than the service I really do like their food and smoothies.'
