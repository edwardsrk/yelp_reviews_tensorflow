b"I had never gone to this place and thought it'd be a nice choice for Valentine's Day. I made my reservation a week before and asked if they would have a special menu for V-day and the guy said they weren't sure if they would (a week before, you would know I would think!). Come V-day and I get a call saying that they are understaffed and the restaurant will be closed. Really?! And they didn't even try to make up for it, offer a gift card, free drinks on next visit, nothing!! I guess I won't ever consider this place again."
