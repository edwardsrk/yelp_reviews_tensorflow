b'Props for the free trip from Downtown to the Steelers game. Its a really good value for out of towners as the ride shares surge price.  There is absolutely no way the trains leaving the game are safe. Way too many people, no room to stand or hardly breathe. I get it there are like 20,000 people trying to get on the trains within 20 minutes of each other. So uncomfortable and has to be so over capacity.'
