b'My fianc\xc3\xa9 and I went to celebrate a promotion in April 2011, so we were excited to try a new restaurant for the occasion. Unfortunately, it was overpriced and mediocre at best. The only dish worth any attention was the "Poppers" which featured raw ahi and hamachi on crispy potato cakes with tobiko. It was delicious, however, did not justify the 22 dollar price tag. I also tried the king salmon, scalloped potatoes and roasted artichoke (who drowns a small dish of chopped up artichoke hearts in overpowering goat cheese, and for 15 dollars?) and mini donuts; all of which only deserve a shrug. The service was substandard; we felt ignored. My fianc\xc3\xa9 is nowhere near as pretentious and particular as I am, however, he was equally disappointed with our meal and experience. Their filet mignon may have been exceptional, but you need more than just a good steak in a town where there are competing steakhouses within feet of each other.'
