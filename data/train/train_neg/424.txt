b'MOST UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS LADY I HAVE EVER MET!! This woman is VERY rude and charges EXTRA for everything including shoes with your tuxedo rental. She has everyone in the party come in for "measurements" then when you come back to try on your clothes NOTHING FITS!!!! Im pretty sure she does this on purpose because she charges for each alteration on your dress!! The men\'s tuxedos DID not fit so we had to wait while she did alterations. Her alterations are done half fast and are very noticeable. It is VERY HOT in her place and her dressing rooms are very dark. Trying on clothes in this place is disgusting because its HOT in there! She has her kids running around everywhere and makes her workers take care of her kids as well as take care of the customers needs! Her workers are overwhelmed and frustrated because ALL the customers are complaining to them because none of the clothes fits! Tuxedos are OLD and dingy! The white shirts have stains and some of the pants have cigarette burns in them! DO NOT PUT YOURSELF THRU THE HELL WE WENT THRU WITH THIS LADY AND GO ELSEWHERE!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE FRUSTRATION!!!'
