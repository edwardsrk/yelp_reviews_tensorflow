b"Honestly this place was not that good. They had lots of flavors but many tasted way fake. The pistachio was just awful! Like a box of Jello pudding! The texture of the gelato was off for me, it was almost too creamy, like eating marshmallow fluff or something. Reminded me of Cold Stone's crappy powdered mix.Go elsewhere -_-"
