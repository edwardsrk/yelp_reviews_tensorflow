b"Again, this is another restaurant that I only learned about when they offered a Groupon.  I went for lunch and took a friend (that had also never been there).  We go to lunch every couple weeks and usually to Mexican places.  They told us when we arrived that the coupon was only good for dinners, but that if we order from there dinner menu we could use it.Their food was average.  Chips and salsa were good.  Drinks average.  Nothing special and since it's a bit of a distance from my house, I won't go back.  The service was excellent but possibly that was because there were only a couple other tables occupied.  But the service was good."
