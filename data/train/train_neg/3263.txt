b"I'll try the place again because it seems to have potential and the ramen broth was good flavor (although the noodles were a little overdone).  Lasagna was not good at all- watery, no tomato flavor) and served with 2 small slices of focaccia bread that wasn't really any good either.  The server was nice but overall I'd give service a 3... We are used to being greeted like family and treated so great at other places we frequent downtown. And it is HOT inside- we were sweating throughout the meal they need to do something to ventilate better"
