b'My husband and I just moved to the area and were scouting out a new vet.  Our first visit here happened when our dog got a decent sized cut on his chin.  Our neighbors suggested the SHAH over the Castle Shannon VCA simply because the VCA charges double of everywhere else.The building is older so it appears dirty and dated, but it wasn\'t bad at all.  The staff seemed friendly and attentive while we were in the waiting room, which wasn\'t long b/c we were the only people there.  We were escorted back to a room, and the vet came in shortly.  She barely looked at his face before telling me she was going to clean it with hydrogen peroxide.  On more than one occasion, I have been told that HP is too abrasive for pets, so I voiced my concern and explained we\'ve been keeping it clean with saline.  She kind of shrugged her shoulders and said she\'s been using HP for 40 years and has never had a problem.  Before I could regain my composure from her shrug-off, she had produced a syringe, went into a schpeal about getting him dewormed (to which I explained he didn\'t have worms.  She said, "Well, he can get them when he goes outside and eats grass and dirt" to which I explained that he doesn\'t eat grass and dirt), and before I could ask what she was giving him (I thought she was trying to give him a deworming shot!), she gave him a shot and walked out.  I was dumbfounded. I stood around for a little bit before someone stuck their head in the door and said that we were done and could come pay.  I walked out to the counter were they gave me antibiotics (that they didn\'t explain how to administer), and I had to read through his discharge papers to find out what kind of shot she had given him.  The vet had AWFUL bedside manner, especially for a new patient, and didn\'t take the time to get to know my dog and his medical history.Needless to say, we\'re still looking for a vet.'
