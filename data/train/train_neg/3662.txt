b"Very slow service and depressing atmosphere. If you're in a rush and aren't willing to wait a while, it isn't the place. However, the Dosa was delicious and had great flavour to it. Additionally, the mango lassie was very refreshing and tasted amazing as well. We also ordered the chicken and mutton Koththu of which the mutton Koththu was highly unsatisfactory. I do not recommend getting it."
