b"They claim low rates?  BS ... my son and his girlfriend broke down in Los Angeles and needed to rent a car to get to Phoenix.  He is 22 and his 1 day rental came out to $212!  AND, he had gotten to Riverside and had to turn around because bone head at Anaheim Enterprise left his keys in the rental ... they gave a small percentage off and no help on added fuel and bill was still $212!  Go to Budget!  Cheaper and they also rent to under 25 as long as you have a credit card and they didn't charge a one way fee.  He rented at budget for return to Anaheim for $68."
