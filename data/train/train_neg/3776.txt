b'Well i appreciate that the atomsphere was lovely and the waitress was nice.The prices were a little high for the quality of  the food.Seems to be like a cool place but i didnt like the sushi.I ordered the bagel,and usually it has cream cheese? Theirs did not,and it was mainly fried rice and no salmon,just wasnt made that good,the california roll tasted old,real dry and not too good.Seemed to me as if a bunch of amateurs were rolling the sushi/running this spot. The waitress wasnt too helpful,she had informed me on my saki sampler on each taste of each one & she was completely wrong! None of them tasted the way she explained.Behind the bar was a worker that was on the telephone placing orders for more alcohol,i was sitting right beside the bar and over hear her ENTIRE convo,it was extremely rude..make a list and take that into the office please. I believe that they could use a little help over all,and to me it doesnt seem like it could last long in this location.Would go here to grab drinks only maybe,or i may never go back.'
