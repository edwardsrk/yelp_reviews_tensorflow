b"Terrible local customer service. Beautiful resort and restaurants but they fail to take good care of locals. They used to cater for local ambition but lately they have been drawn in to becoming a resort i.e. MGm. It's sad to see it transition this way because I've been a fan since 2007 but with all the event bookings and over flow, gvr has now become a senseless strip hotel. Please bring back the station casinos that locals have gathered behind and we ll be there"
