b"Terrible experience. All I needed was some simple blood work done to be cleared to have my breast augmentation done, but Dr Meena Venugopal wanted to do all these other tests I did not need for clearance. She also said breast surgery was a major surgery and takes several hours??? Um wrong lady, It's minor surgery and takes about an hour. I felt she was just judging me and wanted to do everything she could to not clear me for surgery. She also looked at me and said I should have a Hep C test done because I have tattoos! Are you serious?? I WILL NOT go back here. I'm getting my blood work done and having my surgery without the help of this place. I've never felt so judged in my life."
