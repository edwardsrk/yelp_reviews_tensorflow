b"UNDERWHELMING with a capital U. Starts with the decor and layout.  Person at next table was back to back with person at our table.  It's one thing for a place to be intimate but another to be flat out cramped.  Then they have these red metal chairs that are completely uncomfortable.  They look cool but are much more form than function.  Next, we sat right by a giant flatscreen that seems out of place where it is hung on the wall and it was even weirder that they had cartoons playing on it the whole time although I only saw one child in the place, who was not even facing said TV.  The service was really really awful.  Fumbled the drink order and then took forever to finally bring drinks, so much so that most of us decided not to order a second round even though we were there for quite a while.  Server went MIA for long stretches at a time but it was not that busy on this particular night so it was just odd.  He may have driven to BevMo because the bar was also out of stock on some things.  Appetizers and salads were just nothing special.  Had a wedge salad that was uninspired.  I get less being more but there is also less being truly less.  The main entrees I will say were good but would need to be outstanding to make up for the rest of the flaws here.  Server admitted they were not on their A game that night.  Understatement of the year.  Gave us a ten percent off card which seems more like a Denny's tactic.  I threw it away.  You'll shrug and live with sucktacular service at some places but not when you're dropping $100 for two people.  This city has way too many good restaurants for us to go back.  So we won't. I hear their catering is awesome but maybe they are working out the kinks for a restaurant."
