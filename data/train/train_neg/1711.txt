b"Unbelievable.  It's 5pm on a Sat.  I have a page out of the Teacher's Health Trust that says they are open to 7pm.  My 9-year old daughter has strep. What is that, 5 minutes to write a prescription?  They said the doctor is there alone, so they want to clear out the office.  Nice way to care about your fellow man, heartless bastards!  What goes around comes around. Hope you get what you deserve over there!"
