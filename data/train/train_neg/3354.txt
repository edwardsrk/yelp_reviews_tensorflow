b"I'm a first-timer at Chipotle (not just this location, but anywhere). I had high expectations because my nephews love it. Well, first of all the menu is very confusing and totally lacks explanation. The workers expected me to immediately know what I wanted, with no guidance or suggestions at all. The place wasn't even really busy, and yet I felt I was being rushed through the line by the person at each station like some auto assembly line. And I'm a decisive person...I don't linger in making my decisions. But this was ridiculous! Terrible service experience. I'll skip over to my critique of the actual food. Yuck! I got tacos, which sounded like a safe choice. To me, a taco should be a perfect mix of meat plus all of the lighter crispy stuff. Well these tacos were so loaded with meat up to the tops of the shells, they were only able to dot the top with a few measly lettuce shreds, tomato chunks, and a shred or two of cheese! Now I know some people love meat, but it was ridiculous! That to me does not a taco make. And the meat was horrible, although that was probably just my taste buds (I hate cumin and it was overpowering, and it was too spicy for me...again, I understand these are just my taste preferences). Finally, they were WAAAAY overpriced! Ten bucks for 3 tacos plus a drink...SHEESH! I could have stopped across the street and got one of Applebee's lovely Oriental Chicken Salads for the same price and been 100% happier. Bottom line is I will never be eating from there again. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it seemed clean to me and it's convenient. Whoopie."
