b"I haven't been to this place in years, although it's painfully and tauntingly close to home.  Reason being that the service sucked, and the food was marginal.But, Ari was closed last week when I had an afternoon craving, so I thought I'd give EE another chance.BIG mistake and waste of $25.I order tempura and sushi to go.  The sushi was beyond aromatic (smelly) and the seaweed wraps were so stale, I couldn't get my canines to rip through it to even chew the food.  The tempura was made in what seemed like pancake batter, it was so heavy and unappealing.  How hard is it to screw up something fried?  Ask EE.Basically ended up taking a bite of everything, and then throwing all of it out.Never again."
