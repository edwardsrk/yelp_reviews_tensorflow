b"I stopped in on my way home from work, and it seemed like the women rolling silverware was more focused on that then helping the people coming in. I stood for a while with the to go menu, no one acknowledged me, so I just walked up to the counter. I had a 20 voucher, and the women didn't know what to do with it and had to go get someone else. Kinda weird. We will see how the food tastes."
