b'Hate to write a bad review here, as many people really like this place. I\'d say 4-5 stars for the food, but the service was really bad when I visited. Here\'s the scoop:  So, when I arrived there was only one other customer who was waiting for their to-go food order.  I was greeted by the server, and told her the order was to-go.  She gave me a menu and disappeared.   After about 10 minutes, I was going to walk out, but someone from the back came out asked if the server had taken my order -- I said no.  This person disappeared for a few more minutes, then returned and took my order since there was still no sign of the server.  This mystery person was not a server, but was super nice and helpful. She took the order, got the food, computed the bill, but when I presented cash she had to find the server for change.  After the transaction was complete, the nice person said goodbye, and wished me "Happy Easter" (while the server making change seemed almost angry that she had to do something).  I turned to the nice person that did all the work and put a tip right in front of her, looked her in the eye, and said "thanks for helping me out".  Then the most amazing thing happened.. the server (who did NOTHING) reached way across the bar and stole the tip from the person I gave it to!  Wow!  In hindsight, I should have said something, but the action was so crazy, rude, and unexpected that I just walked out amazed at the audacity of the server. I feel sorry for the nice person that has to work around such a person.  I have no plans to return.  :('
