b'Do NOT eat here. The food made me violently ill. I should have known it was a red flag when I saw employees sleeping in the booths in the back of the restaurant, very unprofessional... But the price was right. Anyways I was poisoned for 24 hrs. Muscle pains. Cold sweats. Heavy vomiting and diarrhea. I can only imagine the other poor patrons who were eating there probably all got sick too.'
