b'The photos posted of the rooms are definitely NOT indicative of the room I stayed in except for the one of the broken electrical socket.  The plug for the tub didn\'t fit properly hence I couldn\'t take a bath, the electrical socket was broken and didn\'t seem to even work enough to charge my cell phone or the portable charger, there was bird poop all over the window of my room, there was food sitting outside the rooms next to mine from room service for the ENTIRE time I was there, and the breakfast buffet was bad.  The lettuce in the salad bar was wilted, the scrambled eggs were runny, the "soup of the day" wasn\'t labeled. It may have well been mystery soup as it had a creamy base but with random spinach like veggies and tasted a bit over salted. For the over all price I payed for both the room(almost $200 for a MONDAY til TUESDAY, 1 day stay), I could have stayed at a better kept or newer casino.  The last time I stayed at the Flamingo was probably about 15yrs ago and it was better kept back then than it was now...Maybe they spent all the gambling revenues towards the birds and fishes in the courtyard as there were only flamingos there the last time I stayed there.'
