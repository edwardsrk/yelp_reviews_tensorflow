b'Had to amend my rating for this gym. The best part about this place are the classes. The instructors are knowledgeable, really great people who love their job and it shows. They are worth all the trouble and double talk you go through once you join. Read the contract and do not listen to a single thing they say...its lies and a scam. If you do find yourself entangled with this place try the classes. Yoga, 5 star. Zumba 5 star.'
