b'Walked in to great looking pastries and small menu. Decided what we wanted only problem was there was no one to take order. One staff member seemed to be running the whole show ( I think her name was Stacy give her a raise). Poor girl was doing dining room, drive trough, cash, while another competent cashier was assembling baskets and management no where to be seen. She finally Managed to catch her breath long enough to take our order, walked out, coffee empty as well as half and half, pet peeves to have to ask someone to fill them they should be full! Food decent, nothing special, longer I sat there chatting with my breakfast company the more I could see other customers getting irritated that there was no one to take orders when they came in, one guy even yelled to someone who appeared to be a baker, "hey is there anyone who can take my order!?" Management get a clue, come support your staff!'
