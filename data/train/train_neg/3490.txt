b"This is a brand new Five Guys in Gastonia and not one of the better ones I've visited. After visiting other Five Guys, I knew what to expect and this location definitely let me down. I was very disappointed with the hamburgers they served for my family. The fries were tasty and well cooked. The burgers where dry and somewhat overcooked, definitely not the standard of the Five Guys I've been to such as the one at North Lake Mall. You can pass this one up because it's not what you'd expect or deserve."
