b'I\'m going to open up this review saying that I have several tattoos and have been into many tattoo shops in my lifetime. I am not just some college girl who wants a tattoo on spring break. Saying that, this shop had a sign out Halloween weekend for $25 tattoos. I had a couple pieces in mind that I wanted to get done (most importantly my San Francisco Giants tattoo) so I decided to just go inside and see what the dealio was. They were doing Halloween-themed only for the deal. I jokingly mentioned that mine was orange and black. When I told them what it was I wanted, one of the artists said disgustingly, "I won\'t do that for $25." Wow that was rude. All you had to tell me was that it didn\'t work for the Halloween special. Now you lost a potential customer. If you are trying to get foot traffic, being rude to your customers isn\'t going to help. I\'ll just go back to Tattooed Planet, where I don\'t feel judged for being a young college girl.'
