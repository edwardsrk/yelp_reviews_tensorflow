b'I\'m giving two stars and that is solely based on convenience and the fact that I like the food to begin with. When my family and I entered this location a couple girls entered after us that apparently knew one of the workers. While we were ordering the girl working behind the counter screams, runs, knocks over equipment behind the counter slams into the door and runs out to hug and greet her friends. She stayed out of the kitchen for a few minutes one manager watched her run out and went to get a second manager. The both of them proceeded to stare at the girl as she was with her friends but no one asked her to come back in. It wasn\'t until she went back behind the counter that one manager told her that she knocked over some equipment and all she had to say "oh well it\'s just ten dollars to replace." After this she went back into the kitchen with gloves on and ate some ice cream and without changing her gloves, started preparing food. Aside from the cashier, who was friendly and professional, the whole experience was just ridiculous and unnecessary. These people could learn some professionalism and proper work etiquette.'
