b"Giving one star only but that is because you can't do negative stars. Stopped by this morning for a bagel and coffee. Ordered an Asiago bagel toasted with Salmon cream cheese. The staff was overworked and rushing through the orders. When I got to my office and was ready to eat my bagel, I open it up to find that there was literally just a shmear of cream cheese on my bagel that was spread so thin, there was at least half the surface area with no cream cheese and another quarter of the area barely had a slight smudge of cream cheese. I know this isn't the end of the world but if I have to pay $5.19 for a bagel and small coffee, then I would at least like to get enough cream cheese to cover both sides of a sliced bagel. Not cool!"
