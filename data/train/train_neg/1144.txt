b'Been here for a few years before. My mom still goes here to get a perm & cut, my sister comes to get her hair straightened. Really liked the way how my sisters hair is done so I thought maybe I should give it a try. Called to book an appointment and explained the condition of my hair to the male staff. Knowing that I\'m calling a week ahead for that specific day to get my hair done. He says you need to come in for us to see how your hair is on a weekday. I said I need to work on weekdays and the best day is on the weekend. So I\'ve asked for that day and he said "well, I don\'t want to book you in and then you not doing it. I don\'t want to ask a stylist to come in and then calling it off because it takes a third of a time". VERY UPSET with this kind of service. Pretty much asking my family and friends not to go there anymore.'
