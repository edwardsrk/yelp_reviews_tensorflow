b"My brother wanted to try a new fish and chips place so while passing we decided to go in. The lady behind the counter and the cook were both really nice and friensly. But while it's named after its fish and chips, there is way more Chinese food on the menu than anything which was a bit of a red flag for me. We ordered 2 Halibut and chips and an order of BBQ wings. The wings were pretty good, crispy and aaucy but not oily. The fish on the other hand tasted frozen and was really oily, while the fries were okay. I don't think I'll be back but the service was great."
