b'my dad & his wife wanted 2 go 2 this place 4 dinner so i took them. they seems 2 rave about this place but i wasnt impressed at all. my dad & i both had 2 fish rolled up tacos & a shrimp burrito. i like my fish tacos better grilled & in a soft corn shell, not fried. the shrimp burrito didnt have that much flavor 2 it. it was just 2 much tortilla & i dont like that at all. my dads wife had some beef tacos & she seemed 2 like them. ive  definitely had better mexican food than this!'
