b"I frequently come here for my coffee and a bagel. I've also had a couple of their sandwiches but I am not a big fan. They are usually too oily, too bland. The only thing I would get on occasion is the Thai Chicken Salad, but it's quite pricey for what you actually get.This particular store is so close to my home and that is the only reason for me to come back. Staff is very unfriendly and so terribly slow. Also, I have ordered bagels for meetings and they couldn't be bothered putting them in smaller paper bags, but threw 30 bagels in one big giant bag and threw the cream-cheese on top of it. I had to stop somewhere else to buy a couple of paper plates so it wouldn't look too bad at the meeting. I've recently asked if I could have 10 paper cups for coffee (while buying 30-40 bagels plus cream cheese) and it was not an option at all. Very poor service."
