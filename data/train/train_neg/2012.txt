b"I've been to almost every cigar store worth going to in Phoenix and I have to say that the Tinder box has a lot of potential and that's about it. The store itself is nice but once you enter the huge humidor you quickly realize that somethings not quite right. the humidor is only 30 to 40%  full and of that 30 to 40% of cigars it's a lot of off brands, bundles and empty boxes of cigars on the shelves. When the cigar inventory improves the tinder box will warrant another look and probably 4 stars but for now it's 2 stars, you can't call yourself a legitimate cigar store without legitimate cigars."
