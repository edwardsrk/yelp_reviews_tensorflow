b"After reading numerous rave reviews about this place me and my friend decided to try it. The restaurant is smaller than you would expect but the ambiance was very nice.I ordered the jerk chicken dinner and my friend chose to order the jerk wrap. His wrap came to the table already broken which was very irritating as all the meat kept falling out as he tried to eat it. For my dish I was happy with the presentation but the food not so much. The portion of the rice was small and my coleslaw was rotten. It smelled sour and the taste was rancid. The smell was so bad my partner almost threw up from it. What irritated me the most was that the owner was there and asked the server what the issue was. Afterwards she continued to talk to the diners she knew and paid us no mind. I don't know about her but if I owned s restaurant I would have at least stopped by the table to ask if there was anything she could do or apologize for serving rotten food. On top of that we had to remind our waitress for a coke that we had ordered and my chicken was not fully cooked. Several pieces were a bit too tender but after constantly calling the waitress over I gave up on the meal.  We got our bill and left. At least the waitress took 15% off our bill. This place wasn't memorable and I wouldn't dine here again."
