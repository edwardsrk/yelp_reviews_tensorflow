b"What a poorly run establishment. One of our entree's arrvied before the appetizer, I reminded the waitress 3 times that we were still waiting on an entree which still hadnt arrived after an hour and a half. I asked for the check, reviewed it and asked the waitress whether or not they felt they should do anything for us because the poor service. She took it to the owner who sent it back un changed with a different waitress. I let them know I would not be paying since i came to dinner expecting to get an entree and since I didnt get one that I would not be parying for dinner. I let them know that if they would  pay me for my time which was wasted and then I would pay for what I ate. They would not discuss. I walked out, they followed me to the parking lot and called the police. I would advise you to not waste your time with an establishment who clearly does not understand the service industry!"
