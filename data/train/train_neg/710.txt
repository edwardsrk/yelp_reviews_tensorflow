b'Extremely disappointed in the service I\'ve gotten my past two visits. Both times I\'ve waited in a long drive thru line (the line moved moderately, but that\'s not the problem) but, when it was my turn to pull up to the microphone to order, no one said anything such as: "can I take your order?" or their usual catchphrases!  The first time this happened I waited about a minute and then said... "umm helllllooo" I was greeted with a "what do you want." Ummmmm excuse me???? First you\'re not going to ask what id like to order and then you\'re gonna get annoyed?The whole time I ordered the girl had a rude/ annoyed tone to her voice. The second time this happened was today and after 30 seconds of no one speaking I just started ordering. I mean come on people???? The crazy thing is both times I could hear them greet the person in front of me and behind me so why ignore me when I pull up? Rediculous! And this time they forgot the extra sauce I asked and paid for. Probably won\'t be coming back.'
