b'This is my second visit and I am still not convinced by the food here, hence the reason I\'m keeping it at 2 stars. My previous 3 star review was removed by Yelp HQ, upon the request of the restaurant owner.Where do I start this time? Coming back for seconds, I think I can put a solid score for this place, no bias or discrepancies. The first time I had the cheese burger, fries and beer and I was not entirely impressed. This time I had the Central Park, something that\'s supposed to scream "quality" over the regular cheese burger (I would assume the quality be served to me whether I ordered something expensive or cheap?). Like I said before, this burger did not impress me. It had a relatively thick patty, but considered thin if this place was all about the gourmet burgers. The patty was slightly overcooked, but most of it was covered by the onion ring, blue cheese and saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms so it\'s hard to tell in the picture. It was juicy in some spots but dried out in some. The fries, though it came out nice and golden, was still overcooked just like my first visit. I also ordered my beer to wash down the food, so that was the best part. I keep thinking in my head, I paid $16 for the burger alone.. With beer around $20 not including taxes + gratuities. Is this what a gourmet burger combo/meal is supposed to be?The most unfortunate part of my visit is the realization that I made a mistake by coming here again instead of driving further north and dine at The King\'s Landing or Main Street Burger Shoppe in Stouffville. Not to mention they don\'t charge serving water. Even if they did charge for water, it\'ll be a dollar less. It\'s not a problem with me bc I like my burger with beer anyway.Service was fine, but not spectacular and managing a business, especially an eatery has its challenges. 2 stars for managing and maintaining this place, 0.5 for food on the second try.'
