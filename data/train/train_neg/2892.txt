b"I've been to this trader joes location 5 times in the past few weeks... I usually shop at the one in westlake since I live out that way... but since I'm working in beachwood now I was excited to know I was very close to a trader joes..  Let me just say that the service at this one doesn't even compare to the westlake location.. When I go to westlake they make me feel like family and I have a great time shopping there.. The service here is poor and not nearly as fun and helpful as westlake.. I usually checkout at the register closest to the door and the past 3 times the cashier was rude!! Never said thank you, good bye, have a great day or anything!! Rude!!! Westlake kudos to you for being WAY better and MUCH friendlier!!!"
