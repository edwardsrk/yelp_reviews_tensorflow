b"Some of the worst Asian food I have ever had. Took one bite and sent the food back.  Was offered a replacement meal but it was so bland that I didn't want anything. Chicken didn't taste like chicken. Had a very chewy texture. Ming Fu in waxhaw is much better and half the price. Overpriced food. Service sucks."
