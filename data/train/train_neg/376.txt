b"I put my mail on HOLD while away on vacation. I returned home to crumbled mail that piled up in my mailbox. The Squirrel Hill Post Office apparently never sent my Hold Mail Request. After returning from vacation, I decided to stop by to make sure I didn't have any mail at the post office even though I still had mail delivered. I waited in line for 15 minutes for the man to tell me to go to the East Liberty location to check.  He was the only person working the counter and there was no sense of urgency as he waited on customers. I made my way over to the East Liberty location to find myself waiting another 20 minutes in line, again with only one person working the counter and she was extremely rude. I came to find out that I did not have any mail held, so Squirrel Hill never honored my request. What a waste of time. Never again!"
