b'Overall, the food was okay, but definitely not value for money. Two stars is officially described as "Meh" by Yelp, and that sums up our experience perfectly...Run of the mill fine cuisine dishes, served with sweet glazed sauces straight from a stuffy 1980\'s restaurant. They\'re focusing like so many places these days on local ingredients, but at the expense of originality. There was nothing here that we couldn\'t make at home. The drink menu reads: beer, wine, "highballs".  - No mixologist here...There are better spots in town to drop a lot of coin...on the plus side, there\'s tons of parking in a reserved lot on 15th avenue.'
