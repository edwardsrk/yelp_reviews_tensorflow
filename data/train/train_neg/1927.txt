b'I have had great service at the Main Street location but the AIRPORT LOCATION is less to be desired.  Also, I pre-paid my reservation and then there was a better deal a day later.  They would not let me change but the girl on the phone said that she would put it in my notes to have it switched to the upgraded car at the same price at the airport.  No dice!  The airport guy didn\'t let me do that and he said there was no note.  I will NEVER pre-pay an offer with Advantage again.  There is no benefit to giving your money up front.  I could make a reservation and cancel it at the last moment and get something else from another company.  You would think that advantage would give the benefits to people who are willing to pay ahead.  Never again at Advantage Airport no matter what the price!!!  Oh and I asked for a Corolla which they had available and he gave me a Jetta.  I didn\'t care too much for the Jetta and would have liked the Corolla better.  Why couldn\'t they switch it to what I requested?  There wasn\'t anyone getting cars at advantage where Thrifty next to them had 7-9 people waiting.  Next time for the airport location I\'d better go with another company. That being said... The Main St. location is great!  I usually fly with Vacations Hawaii but this time we didn\'t.  That was an unfortunate decision. If I used Vacations Hawaii, I would have had the opportunity to use the Main St. location and had better service and a better car.  If this was the Main St. location, I would have givien all "9-10\'s".'
