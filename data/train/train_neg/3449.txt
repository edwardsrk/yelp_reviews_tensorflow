b'Nothing exceptional about the Alehouse.The beer selection is good but they were out of two of the beers I ordered. The food was average at best. The service was terrible. Our waiter was slow and seemed not to care if we had drinks or if we needed anything to go with our food. It might be a fun place to watch a game at the bar but not really a place to bring the family to eat.'
