b'I laughed by reading reviews before I write mine. Loyd must have had the same driver as we did last night. The one we took from Fremont street was a driver named Eyob, must be from somewhere Africa or Middle East. He was on a cell phone already and kept talking in a strange language all the way till we get off at Bellagio. Very unprofessional.'
