b"Oh, Calgary Transit. Where do I begin? I guess I'll start with the LRT, as it is my main mode of transportation to and from work every day from 7am - 8am & 4:30pm - 5pm (and these days 6pm!).Summers: Besides being overly crowded during rush hour, the summers are usually ok. Oh, well except when the heat is blaring and I have to move my legs from the vents so they don't get burnt. Ouch! Winters: x2 on the overly crowded during rush hour. Firstly, who designed the train stations? No heat? No major enclosures (Shawnessy, 39th Ave and every single new downtown platform that was just built within the last year specifically)? What were you guys thinking? It looks pretty?! Second, BUR, you must've used all the heat up during the summer because now my mornings are met with extremely cold train rides to work! I'm even bundled up for the weather, but no heat can be felt coming from the heaters now! Next up: Bus Routes. Oh, # 15. I mostly take you when the weather is not it's best. You're never on time, you never stay a few minutes to wait for me to run to your doors.  The worst part about you is getting to the train station in the evenings and having to wait 40 minutes for you to show up. I see about 3 of every other bus that comes to the station. My question is, if it costs more to run a full sized bus, and you're never full, and you only come every 30 minutes (or more??) maybe, just a thought, you should get two #15 shuttle buses that come every 15 minutes? A girl can dream. Bus passes are going up! $90 dollars at the beginning of January 2011. Your services are getting worse, and I'm paying more?! Does.Not.Compute."
