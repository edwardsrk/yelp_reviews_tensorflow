b"I don't know why people would even go back. I am sorry but the chicken is so small and the breading is so large :( it's truly a healthy person's nightmare. I feel bad giving a bad review the place was clean, well lit, and the food was hot and the service was great. It's just the food, is so bad for you. I can't ever go there again, thanks."
