b'First time here from Ohio on business. Had the pub burger. This shop needs some work m. Burger was not quite cooked as ordered soggy bun. Not much on flavor. Sweet potato Fries also soggy and not real warm. Service in bar was slow always bothered by that. Will try someplace else for rest of this trip. The pickle was good!'
