b'I have goose bumps after reading the 1st review because I experienced the same exact experience yesterday! This woman "Andrea" who happens to be the owner flat out shocked my mom and I and left us speechless after what she did! Throughout speaking with her for 45 min about what we wanted for the bridal party, chuppa, and table arrangements, we got short answers, no visuals, and complete attitude. Being a bride, and completely overwhelmed, you would think someone who wants your business would show you samples of things and try and help you to create the look you are going for. This woman lacked any expertise. In fact, when we couldn\'t come to a clear idea of the centerpieces, I said how about I get all of the flowers through her and get the candleabra\'s through the other place we had conversed about, and she said, " How about you just get nothing from us," and ripped up the order form into tiny pieces! This form had all the things that I had planned to get through her (which mind you was over $1000 worth of business)!!! I still feel like it was a nightmare or that Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out and say, " HA you have been punked!" The only thing I could say was that the BBB would be hearing about this to what she responded, "You can write what ever you want sweetie." Are you kidding me?!!!  Please think twice about getting your arrangements here. Good luck!! - Pissed off bride'
