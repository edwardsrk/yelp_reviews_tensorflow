b'Did not like the small menu, not enough variety of food!  Way over priced for the quality of food. It is a different type of Mexican food than what I am traditionally used to.. I did not like that they charge for everything, even for rice and beans,also charged $4 for an extra taco for the kids plate!  Probably will not return..'
