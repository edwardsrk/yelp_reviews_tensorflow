b'Ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross I recommend going to Paris casino and go to La pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!'
