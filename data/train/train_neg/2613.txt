b"Pretty average spot. Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. Service was adequate. Is Baldwin street actually good?"
