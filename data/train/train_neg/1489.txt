b"I was really craving Pho and nothing was open, so my boyfriend suggested we check out Bobby Chao's in Edgemont, since it's super close. Seems like there are two separate restaurants, one for Chinese Food/Dim Sum, and one for Vietnamese/Pho. Slightly confusing, especially as we walked into the Viet side and were told to go to the other side, as it was closed. Walking in on the other side felt completely awkward. Everyone was staring at us like we didn't belong there, and nobody acknowledged our presence. We wanted to order to-go, but the menus were all in Chinese. A lady working at the till gave us another, which we then proceeded to order from. She kept cutting us off, and just being pretty rude in general when we inquired about a certain dish.  I was getting frustrated at their attitudes and was pretty 'hangry' at that point, and I guess I looked annoyed because that was when she started being nice, apologizing that she couldn't understand us. We finished ordering and waited, after taking home our food we were really disappointed. I know this isn't a Vietnamese place, but don't advertise it if you cant do it properly. And it's pretty hard to screw up Pho! Never again."
