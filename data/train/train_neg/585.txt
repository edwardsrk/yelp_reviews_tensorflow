b"Pass by the China Cafe when driving down Clifton Blvd. ordered a quart of General Tsao's Chicken, was bland, no taste, overwhelmed with peanuts, and the vegetables were cut for soup, not the oriental cut in traditional Asian Cooking, ordered spring rolls, not too good either, the sauces (hot mustard) were packets no kick to them, fortune cookies were stale too, the redeeming item in the order was the white steamed rice. If your on Clifton looking for some good Asian food, get on Madison in Lakewood, and head to the Thai Kitchen, a few bucks more, however, everything is cooked to perfection......"
