b"The massage was terrible. She literally just rubbed my legs and hands more gently then I put lotion on my own body. I asked for buffing on my nails and got home and realized that only half of my nail is shiny, the whole nail wasn't buffed. On top of that the cuticle wasn't pushed back and they could have been cleaned up more. It's my least favorite manicure I've ever received. I gave 2 stars because she did fantastic on my toenail design and they got me in quick. I won't be going back though. I would not recommend anyone to here if they like the massage potion of the experience."
