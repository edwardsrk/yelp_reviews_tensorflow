b"I've been going there a while now with no issues, great food and service until yesterday-I ordered $55 worth of food, General Tso chicken, orange chicken, shrimp egg foo young, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls etc..I got there early, a few minutes before they opened and they were kind enough to let me in to order for a Playoff party however, the chicken both Tso & Orange tasted old, recooked, dried out and the worse thing is many of us ended up with very bad diarrhea.I'm so disappointed because every time I go there I always spend $40 and up and to have people getting sick (including me) was so embarrassing and to waste my money by having to throw food out was hard because all my pennies count. Whoever cooked yesterday 16 January 2016 at noon should be ashamed for serving tainted food.You have let a good paying/tipping customer down on what should have been a great NFL Playoff party. :("
