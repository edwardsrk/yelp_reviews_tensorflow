b'I hate to leave a bad review for a chain that I love but this is a new location and they need to get their act together. They are always out of everything and the staff has no clue what they are doing. I am fine with new employees but have a manager or training person there to oversee simple tasks like good burrito wrapping! Step it up guys!!'
