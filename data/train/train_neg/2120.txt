b"really? TWO AND HALF inches room from the top of my grande frap. i asked why it's not filled to the top, it's for the whip!? that's what the rounded cap is for. hogwash!  as for lattes, poorly made as well. taste more like a cup of steamed milk, barely espresso.  baristas should be better trained in making drinks here."
