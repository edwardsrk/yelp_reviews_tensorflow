b"Was not impressed....made a 7:15 pm reservation and had to wait almost 45 minutes upon arrival to be seated.  Then once we were seated we had to ask a passing server if there was someone for our table since 15 min had passed with no one waiting on the table.  Poorly ran front of the restaurant which takes away from the food which wasn't too bad."
