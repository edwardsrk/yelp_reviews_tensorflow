b"In store order not ready when promised. When I placed my order they almost lost the sale as the employee told me what he couldn't do rather than tell me what he could do. Placed order Tuesday morning, employee said we are not to busy we will have this ready by store close tonight. Came in on Thursday to pick up order and order has not even been started. Employee made me feel like I inconvenienced him for having to stop what he was doing to move my order along. Brick and mortar stores need to be over the top with customer service online ordering is just a click away. Staples just 2 miles down the road also."
