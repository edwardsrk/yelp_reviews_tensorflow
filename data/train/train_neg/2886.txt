b"Disappointing. I am a sushi lover and was expecting something different. The quality of my sashimi platter was five-stars so I have zero issues on the food. It's fresh and wonderful, but very expensive for the setting, which is my complaint. Ginko is located under Dante, in a very tiny and terribly noisy basement, where there is barely space to fit in the bar or the few tables. This concept would be fine for a moderate price sushi experience, but it's a fail in a restaurant where you spend around $100 per person to have, I repeat, wonderful food... just in the wrong setting."
