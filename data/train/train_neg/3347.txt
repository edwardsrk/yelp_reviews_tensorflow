b"The first review makes me wonder if the person was paid for it... because my experience was quite different. I really don't care much where my lunch money will be spent as long as I get a good meal so instead of rather regular Chipotle located next door I gave a try to Tony D's. I decided to try aforementioned French Dip sandwich which turned out to be thick, crusty and soft bread (true) with a few thick slices of tough and chewy roast beef. Come on Tony D... you can make it happen for $6.99. Just get a decent quality meat and slice it thin! But until then I'm definitely not interested in coming back there."
