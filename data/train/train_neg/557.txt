b'Well...it\'s not that often that a place that serves AYCE grilled meat can disappoint me but I guess there\'s a first for everything. Where should I begin? We came in around 4PM to a restaurant that was not even half full and waited for a table for 15 minutes. When we got to our table we were left alone again for 10 minutes. We were pretty hungry at this point so we order a bit of food. The waitress gave us a stern look and told us it was too much in a more than your mother\'s naggy tone kind of voice. I assured her we can handle it. Classic rule of dining is that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. I shrugged it off. This hasn\'t been out first time to a Korean AYCE style restaurant but after our interaction earlier, I guess our server took it upon herself to make up our minds on how we want to eat. We tried to keep it pleasant and light hearted but she kept on getting pushier and pushier as the afternoon went on. At the end of dinner we had paid and left her a decent tip (18%) underneath one of the cups. We made sure it was visible so it doesn\'t get accidentally get swept away during the table being turned over. We were in our car and about to go when the waitress ran out to our passenger door and knocked angrily on my car door. I lowered the window and asked her what was wrong. Our astute waitress, still huffing and puffing angrily, said we didn\'t even tip her. I calmly said we did and where it was. She then replied with an "Oh..." and then quickly ran back inside. We waited there 5 mins to see if she would come out and apologize as I thought we were entitled one for the way she was acting and for leaving prints on my car window. We will never return here. Never have I been so turned off at dinner by bad service. Had I known that that was the kind of service I would be getting I would have spent my money at an In and Out and got my money\'s worth and a smile to go with my chocolate shake.'
