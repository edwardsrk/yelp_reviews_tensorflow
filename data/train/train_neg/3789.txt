b'This was too bad, it looked nice and the food looked good.  Other than continually being referred to as "Boss" by the server, he got my very simple order wrong several times.  The cook came from the kitchen and asked "What\'s wrong?"  When there was really nothing wrong.  Nobody had even complained.  They took part of the meal off--which was cool.  It just could have been a better experience overall for the price paid.'
