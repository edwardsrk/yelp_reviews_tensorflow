b"Went to Applebee's for a bite Sunday night. The music was loud and... interesting. Not quite like the Applebee's I'm used to. We decided to get an appetizer sampler (2 smaller portions for $10) with the Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip and Mozzarella Sticks. My boyfriend also got a Maple Bacon Chicken Piadini (no lettuce and the maple mustard on the side, in case I wanted to share). Took a little while to get our food. I was afraid the appetizers would come out cold, but they were actually warm and my b/f's wrap and fries were basically room temperature. There were 2 long, skinny pretzels and 4 mozz stix. The wrap wasn't bad with some of the leftover marinara and cheese dip.We ordered dessert via the tabletop kiosk. We got 2 Dessert Shooters as well as the new Churro S'mores, which looked too interesting not to try. The churros were very skinny and should have been warmer. I liked the toasted marshmallows but was disappointed in the chocolate underneath. It was just chocolate syrup, not actual melted chocolate, and it wasn't even warm. Not my favorite. My Strawberry Cheesecake Shooter was decent and my b/f's Chocolate Mousse Shooter was very thick and rich.Our server was alright... he seemed a bit overwhelmed, even though it wasn't that busy. The pay function on the kiosk was disabled... What a gyp! Applebee's left a lot to be desired."
