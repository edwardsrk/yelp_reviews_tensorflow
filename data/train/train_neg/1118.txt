b'I really wanted to love the new location, and was willing to put previous poor food and service at the original location aside. While the concept is lovely, the omelette was awful. The applewood smoked bacon was so over cooked, I was unable to stick my fork in it. Overall, the omelette was slightly burnt. I hope they can fix this issue!'
