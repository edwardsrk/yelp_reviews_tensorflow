b"I attended this show last night and was under the impression that it would have more of a concert appeal than the typical Vegas show. I've seen JLO in concert twice and was looking forward to a more personal experience with my friend who accompanied me. However, this was not the case. The crowd was BORING. I understand that not everyone is a huge JLO fan, but I really wish they would've considered those who are. IT IS A CONCERT! People are entitled to stand, dance, and sing, when they have paid money to enjoy their time. My friend and I were in section 103 and a few rows behind the VIP section. I was one of the few who were standing and was told three times to sit, one woman grabbed on my arm twice to make me sit, and another even smacked my backside; apparently hoping this would make me sit. That was the final straw. I had been playing nice and even ignored the first attempts to keep me seated, but after being hit in a more than personal area by a complete stranger, I decided I couldn't take the harassment any longer. I was willing to forfeit my tickets just to avoid a situation from progressing to something worse. I alerted security who confirmed for me that dancing IS allowed and thankfully allowed my friend and I to change seats. They were not nearly as good as the seats we had, but I was grateful to finish the show without any further disturbance. To say the least, I didn't enjoy my time; especially because my trip to Vegas was FOR JLO and my birthday. Unless you're able to attend this show/concert willing to pay for 6 tickets at VIP table, beware of the crowd.  5 stars for JLO! She is a dedicated performer and has endless energy that unfortunately didn't rub off on the drab crowd. The costumes, lighting, music, choreography, dancers...etc was fantastic! I absolutely love her and plan on attending again in the future at a VIP table."
