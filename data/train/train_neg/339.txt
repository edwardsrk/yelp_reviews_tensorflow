b'Service is terrible. Me and my friends came on Tuesday night to order chopping board to be engraved. The lady wasn\'t specify the size and the place to be engraved, so a few minutes after we walked from the store, we returned and came back to give the specific detail (They really seems not to care). So the lady said it will be in large size and we agree that it\'s going to be engraved from left to center on the bottom left. The next day I got a phone call 9.30am, checking the spelling of what I wrote, because another lady who was going to do the engrave for my item, cannot differentiate a "T" and "F" , even though clearly, the F will consist of 2 lines. Ok fine. I picked up in the evening to find out that the engrave words are on the bottom center to right and it was so small. It was something not apparent and not what I was expecting, considering that I paid $66 for a chopping board. I was very disappointed. Funny thing is that the lady was persistent that she followed the order written on the note from her co-worker and then showed it to me that it clearly said "left to center". Not even a single apology, she just said "Ups" (realizing her mistake) and another lady offered me 20% coupon for my dissatisfaction for my next purchase. (I won\'t even come back after this). They are not trustworthy to offer an extra care of what the customer\'s requested and expecting.'
