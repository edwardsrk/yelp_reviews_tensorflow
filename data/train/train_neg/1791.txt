b'For a minute I thought the commuter terminal at PHX didn\'t even have a bar, then I stumbled into "All Star Sports Bar."  After spending about an hour here I wish there was no bar at all. This place fails on almost every level imaginable. First of all, it\'s not anywhere close to being a sports bar.  2 TV\'s and bartenders in referee uniforms doesn\'t make you a sports bar.  Furthermore, the food here could not be worse.  Look - I\'m not opposed to the plastic cheese from a can on nachos, but if you can\'t even make that taste good, I can\'t even begin to imagine what the rest of the food here is like. Unlike the other reviewers I actually found the service (at the bar) to be fine, if not indifferent, and the one good thing I will say about this place is that they do make a pretty good Bloody Mary. You can credit that to the Ocean Spray mix they used so it\'s not exactly rocket science ... What can you do though? They have a captive audience though being the only game in the terminal after the security check point, I\'d imagine this place is a zoo on Friday afternoons ...'
