b'What a horrible unorganized, unprofessional and very slow business! Took my Truck to get paint fix that was falling off that I got done here. I had warranty so I took it back. They said it would be ready buy that Friday I took it a Monday called Friday it wasn\'t done I has to go out of town so the owner said it\'s ok we can leave it her until you come back. Came back a Tuesday 6l8 days later went to pick up my truck wasn\'t ready wait until that Friday called him no answer so I went and he shows me my truck with a different color paint and said if I wanted to take it like that I could? ???  Is that a serious response so I didn\'t take it he ruined it he fixes it. He said well come next Friday 3 WEEKS LATER on little paint job on a door turned into 3 almost a month. Then my truck passenger blinking light is out, Why? And my inside lights where moved why? There is no reason to have to be inside my truck to paint other then to move it. Then I had just pump gas full tank, I now have a no gas. I do not trust these guys I feel they took my Truck on a joy ride and don\'t even clean off the mess I have paint splashes all over the truck and the owner still has the balls to say "I\'ll let you wash that" what the F'
