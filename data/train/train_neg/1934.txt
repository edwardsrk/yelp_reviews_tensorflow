b"I was honestly disgusted by my meal. my over easy eggs were over cooked and tasted like rubber. my toasted bread was soggy and the corn beef hash had absolutely no flavor. the only good part of my breakfast was my glass of orange juice. I couldn't even eat the food I had bought. not worth the trip or price. this place is beyond gross."
