b"Writing this review as I'm sitting inside Kaka... filled with disappointment. - the batter on all fried items were bad, had to peel off the batter for it to be edible- rolls look and taste bland and no falvour at all....this make T&T sushi taste delicious in comparison...- fried scallop and chicken karage didn't taste good either. Again, no taste I do give it to them that all the ingredients are relatively fresh. However.. this is no way worth the 35 per person price tag. We are giving their speciality rolls a try as we speak. Wish us luck Update: speciality rolls are decent.. if you have absolutely no choice and had to eat here.. just get the specialty rolled and dessert. But I do hope this never happens to youUpdate 2: dont get the desserts..."
