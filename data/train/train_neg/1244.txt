b'Super slow! Took two hours for dinner and we arrived at 4:30. Took 30 minutes to bring me water and only after I asked her twice. Messed up my drink order 3 times and never got it right. Sticky floors. Several of the servers acted snotty with our requests. The hostess was rude when we asked to sit at a booth and she told us the booth was for parties bigger than ours (we had six). When we left, a party of four was in the booth! Took nearly 30 minutes to run our check! What happened to service with a smile? Go to Sandbar next door for better service, better drinks and a better atmosphere.'
