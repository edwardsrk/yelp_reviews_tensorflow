b'This place is ridiculous! Went there with the girlfriend for drinks and some food... when it came to pay the girl somehow "lost" my credit card on the way to her checkout station. After watching the staff fumble around with a flash light for 10 minutes she finally comes and tells me she lost my card... but she\'s still looking. 5 minutes later she walks back from another table with my card. I ask her of she gave my card to someone else, she did. I ask her if she understands that these strangers could have taken down my CC info. She apologises...I ask for a manager because clearly she doesn\'t understand how bad it is to give a customers cc to someone else. After asking for a manager 3 times the bartender finally comes over 15 minutes later to apologize for charging someone else\'s bill on my card... wtf?! This is the first I hear I paid for someone else\'s bill too??? I am obviously upset about this and she immediately walks away saying "you know what I\'ve got other people to help, I tried being nice " I followed her asking for a managers contact info and she simply went to the back of the bar... appalling... f**K this place. Ownership of one\'s actions is clearly something these idiots don\'t understand. Calling back tomorrow to hopefully talk to an adult.'
