b"Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the good quality dumplings you can buy at Chinese grocery store, ormaybe it's because I've had better dumpling for less in Chinatown and regular chinese restaurents, and most definitely because I've read all the raving reviews on yelp before trying out this place, but but Quing Hua was rather a let down for me.Choice: Many choices of dumpings, I have only try the old classic of dumplings, porc and chives.Quality: The dough is not particularly chewy or delicately textured, it is more akin to the factory-made/bought-at-minimal-price-at-your-local-grocery than hand-made. They probably did not made it themselves.  The porc and chive filling itself is rather bland, all I could taste is porc, which suggest that A) not enough chive and other spices and B) chives is really not fresh. The portion of filling is not generous either.Portion:The overall portion isn't great compare to other cheap eat in the area, especially for its price.Service:PoorWhen I went there, it was 3:30pm on a week day and I was the only customer, nonetheless it took a good 20 minutes for my food to arrive, and the waitress was exceedingly busy chatting with her colleagues in the kitchen to bother with basic waitressing. Price:About 15 small-medium size dumplings for 10+ bucks is a tad bit pricey for it's cheap-eat quality and service.Overall: There are just so many more restaurants in the Concordia area with higher (quality+service)/price quotient than Qing Hua..."
