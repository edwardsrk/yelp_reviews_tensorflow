b'Food was sub par but cool atmosphere. Well if you are looking for great stakes go somewhere else. If you hare looking for atmosphere that it is cool, nice and relaxing around Monte Carlo this is a good place. As someone who host clients I eat a lot of high end stake and this is not the place. But the d\xc3\xa9cor, location and service keep this from being 2 star and if you are going for drinks and aps I would give it 4.'
