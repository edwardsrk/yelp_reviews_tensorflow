b"Matsuda has the worst service I have ever experienced! The hostess was inattentive and kept wandering off as the foyer filled up with people so when she returned, she was bombarded with people trying to get a seating number. The hostess gave us a number and didn't tell us how long the wait would be. Whenever someone approached her she looked as if they were burdening her with our presence. We waited for 30 minutes before we had to ask to be seated since we were next and there had been an empty table for 4 for over 10 minutes. A table for two was empty beside us for 20 minutes before a pair were seated.The food was good but a lot of our order did not come. When we tried to get the attention of a server, they would look at us and walk away. Portions were extremely small. One roll was only 4 small pieces. My overall experience was poor and I will never be going back."
