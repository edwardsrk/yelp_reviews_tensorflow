b"I used to love T.I.S. bookstore, but lately I am so far from a fan. I'm now an off campus grad student and I ordered a textbook for class in plenty of time which they decided to not ship because they assumed I would want to pick it up...umm hello check the adress! So I got the book super late and was unable to be prepared for class which, if you know me, you know that that really bothers me, I'm sort of anal. Also it took over 4 weeks to get the course packets all copied and sorted out, super ugh."
