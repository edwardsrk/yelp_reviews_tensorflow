b'Large portions, average food, and bad management.  The atmosphere is kind of cheap looking compared to all the other fine restaurants on the strip.  The dishes ranged from $18 to $30.   I was not impressed with this place, and will not go back due to the way my girlfriend was treated.  While I would give this place 2 stars (based on food quality/taste/price), my girlfriend would definitely give them ZERO stars.  Her steak, ordered medium rare, came out fully cooked and dry.  We were in a party of 12, and it took about 45 minutes for the server to bring out a new steak for her.  That steak was cooked "well" which really upset my friend.  Not only was everyone done eating, her steak was still overcooked.  The final straw was that the manager still charged her for her portion even though she didn\'t eat the second steak and it was not prepared as ordered. While the server was nice, I think it was wrong of management to charge her for her $28 steak when it was clearly overcooked a second time.'
