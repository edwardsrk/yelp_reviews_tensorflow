b'Nothing special and way over-priced.There was nothing wrong with China Grill but there was nothing right about it either. For the quality of food, I found it quite over-priced. For example, we have a quite small pepper-encrusted ahi plate for $42. The night before we ate at Delmonico and for the exact same price I had three times the fish and more importantly, it was significantly better.The service was pretty poor at China Grill also. We got there right when in open and despite only have four tables seated and at least three waiters plus busboys, the service was annoyingly slow.'
