b"I can say this safely now and get this off my chest. I used to be an employee here, and I will share with you my experience. Most of the employees that work there are desperate seasonal employees who never stay long. Of the three months working there, the longest employee was a sad, withered undocumented old man who had meager career options. Habib the owner seems to be bipolar with a dr jekyll /hyde personality. He would yell, verbally abuse, and humiliate both the customers and employees on a daily basis. When I was first hired on, he payed far below minimum wage and under the table. He liked to call it a 'salary'. The food I saw the owner and the chef cook was horrific. The meat kabobs greasy, and soups were frozen, never fresh. The yogurt drink was expired as well as many of the market items he had next to the restaurant. He simply took the items and added a further expiration date. He took my tips and said I had to earn them by working there longer. He has lost passion for the restaurant business(if he ever had it), and treats people like animals who can't discern quality food."
