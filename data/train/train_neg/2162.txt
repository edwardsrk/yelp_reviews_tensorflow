b'I was expecting a lot more so that is why I can only give Beijing Noodle No. 9 two stars.... part of me wants to give it three, but I know better and I need to rate this as I would anywhere else.  The sleek white modern bright decor is fabulous... looks great, but after sitting there it was too bright.  Service was awesome.  Food was at best MEH (hence the two).  The one redeeming item was the corn and chicken soup (I think that is what it was).  Also... when you are not busy, please do not seat the screaming kid next to two of the only diners... they did this and it was incredibly frustrating.  I was with my boss so it was not as bad as it could have been had I been on a romantic date with my husband.'
