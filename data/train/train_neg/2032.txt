b"By far, the worst sushi place I have been to.  I would like to give them a one star and I don't think I'd like to give them another chance.  Friendly service but speed of sushi delivery is horrible.  This place seems to be busy and it's bring your own alcohol.  Students also get a discount.  If you truly love sushi, you will know this is not the place by pure observation and presentation.  The taste speaks for itself and the rice isn't sticky enough and falls apart.  If you check my other posts, you will know where my favorite sushi place in Montreal is."
