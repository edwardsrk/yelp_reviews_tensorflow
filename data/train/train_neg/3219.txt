b'This place sucks. I was charged $9.50 for a bowl of mixed veg rice and $9 for 10 small soy nuggets? That is stupid. Then they wouldnt let us sit to eat because it was almost closing 9pm yet there were two families enjoying their meal at the table slowly, and they continued to bring them food? The tea is expensive about $5 a cup, on each table there are electric heat pads for your tea. Tea is obviously important here. Then I was ripped off by paying U.S Dollar and it took 3 people to figure out my bill. This place sucks.'
