b"My wife and I went here tonight.  Cute little restaurant.  Server was ok, older lady that wasn't very personable.  Maybe it just wasn't her night.  I had sirloin steak for 16 bucks.  It was in this puddle of sauce and mushrooms that was very strong and salty tasting.  I wouldn't have it again.  My wife got the chicken ala Granny.  It was a different kind of dish, but she really liked it, she also got a side of the house pasta.  The marinara sauce was the best.  I wish I would have done something more Italian after I had a bite of that!  Oh well. For the two dishes and just water we spend 40 bucks.  Since it was that much I wouldn't go back again."
