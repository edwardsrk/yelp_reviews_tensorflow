b'The quality of the meat amd the banchan varieties were good. Ive been meaning to go to this spot for a while and finally got to try it out. The wait is horrendous of course but expected, 30 min turned to 1 hour and 10 min. So dont come here hungry. LolThe prices and quantity is expected as well very small, its not an all you can eat joint and dont expect alot of meat. We had to order another plate pf meat and cold noodles on top of our combo. We told our server maybe we shpuld have ordered the 3 to 4 people portion, he said no its too much food. The portions are really small, the pictures are deceiving. Our server was in a rush on everything, our food, the cooking and when we said we want to order more meat he kinda got dissappointed. Lol. We had to ask for cups for our water, more water, rice, napkins pretty much all the basics. Top it off with a piece of hair on our salad which we pointed out and he just said oh I get you a new one. No sorry, oh my gosh, nothing. Well I tried it and everyone seems to give this place a 4 and 5 star which Im sure at times deserves it. Its just not this time.'
