b"While visiting Vegas with my sisters we decided to find a sushi place that open late I went on yelp and started searching for sushi restaurant around the area and  found sushi 21 they have an all you can eat sushi so my sister and i did the all you can eat.  I was a bit  disappointed the sushi came out fast but the rolls was not good and the server don't check up on you unless you flagged them down . Over all if I'm back in Vegas again I won't go back."
