b"I'm editing my review because it really is inconvenient when you can't sign up for class and ensure your spot. Sometimes we're coming from work or other activities where we can arrive on time and not 30 minutes early. Because they've stopped allowing us to sign up for classes online even more students are coming to classes because they can't track approximately how many people to expect per class.  It's fun to work out in a group setting but I find myself concentrating more on not hitting the person next to me than my actual exercises. The convenience of classes being scheduled through out the day is great, even with evening classes, but they need to cap a limit on how many people can attend a class. It takes away from the experience."
