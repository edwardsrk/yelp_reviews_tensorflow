b"I do not know what all the buzz about this place is... Poor service, mediocre and overpriced food. The sauces were very basic - no nuance of flavor, and actually very blah. We waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by waitstaff, and another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Although we were very clear to communicate up front that we had a show to get to, that didn't seem to matter to them. I can recommend other restaurants in Vegas - don't waste your hard earned $$ here."
