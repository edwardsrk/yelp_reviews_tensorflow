b"I can honestly say this is the worst Tim Hortons ever!!! The attitude you get from the same 2 women is so unprofessional! I will only come here if the gas station Tim Hortons is closed. I've stood at the cash while 3 people were talking for 2 Min before asking for my order I ordered two coffees and asked for a tray... the lady looked at me and just threw it at me. There bad customer service and there is this place! They are so bad they are on another level on their ownYou might be thinking I only post negative things.. but if you look at all my reviews they are usually honest with feedback"
