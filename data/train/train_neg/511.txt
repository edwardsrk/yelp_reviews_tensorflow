b"0 would be perfect. Bought a box spring today,I asked the customer care guy in how many days I can return it he replied;7 days. Not once he mentioned that the box spring cannot be returned as per their terms and conditions or the sales guy didn't mentioned anything. Now I end up with a box spring i cant use because it made my bed to high.I regret my first purchase there and will never recommend it. Most stores in Arizona accepts returns even goodwill store. I so regret my purchase."
