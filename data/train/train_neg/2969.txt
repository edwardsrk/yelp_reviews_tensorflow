b"This place is sort of a local legend, and rightly so, as any place that serves ice cream as a breakfast food (on waffles!) is a place you should go to at least once. Having said that--We just went again and the service was terrible. It was a slow day, and there were a ton of staff on, and we still waited 10-15 minutes to have our order taken. My food didn't come as described in the menu, and the mashed potatoes came in a gigantic flavorless mound. If you want a ton of mediocre food, in a fun, old-school diner atmosphere, this is your spot. If you want something truly delicious, look elsewhere."
