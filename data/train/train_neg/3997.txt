b'Went there for the first time for happy hour , we live in the neighborhood, ordered the shrimp cocktail, very overcooked shrimp, hard as a rock, ordered the pork sliders, they were okay, ordered the kettle chips thinking they were home made, they ripped open a bag of chips threw some pieces of pork on there and threw barbecue sauce and there you have, it we will never go back there, very disappointed!'
