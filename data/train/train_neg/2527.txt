b'Went for the first time at Momo Sushi and I am not impressed and happy with their customer  service. For a Sushi lover, I have eaten and visited a lot of Sushi establishments in different states and here at home. The food is good but the service lacked. When we arrived the reception from the staff was very strained. It\'s as if sating "hello" or "welcome" was too much work for them. We were sat by the server and each of us were given menus. Since it was our first time, we were reading, very carefully the menu so we can make good decisions in what to eat. Server came to take our orders more than once. I told her we needed more time but she kept coming back really fast without allowing us to have time to decide. We felt rushed. After we ordered and our food delivered, you\'d think that they will come back to check up on us and see if we needed our glasses re-filled with our beverages. No one did that. I was parched and I had to get someone\'s attention to get my glass of water refilled. Could it be that I only had water and not Soda or an alcoholic beverage? Whatever the reason, I feel that I shouldn\'t have to flag someone that many times to get my glass of beverage refilled. The food was good but I\'ve eaten better in other establishments that are cheaper who also gave us better service than they. The place is simply not friendly and welcoming. To return to this place will not happen again. Not a  recommendation to anyone. I give them two thumbs down.'
