b"All these people care about is getting paid. This is not a review by someone who has only been there once. I have taken 2 dogs and a cat there for years and spent thousands of dollars.  They are condescending and do not communicate with each other.  They are not good at checking previous history of our visits.  I am glad others have had a positive experience but every time I go in there it makes me cringe inside. My wife did not share my opinion and that is why we continued to go there. After today's visit where they were rude to her and accused her of being a bad pet owner she finally agrees with me. We will be switching vets and would not recommend this place to anyone"
