b"I use to love this place but the last few times I have been there they completely fell off. They served me a meal I always get that was missing 4 out of 5 veggies. They never notified me they were missing items, I had to figure it out on my own. I had to ask them to rectify the situation with some other items which they did but the dish did not taste the same. If they are out of things they should just tell people before they order it. Another situation I ordered an appetizer that never came, turns out they did not have anymore of it. Once again just notify the customer so they aren't expecting their food to come."
