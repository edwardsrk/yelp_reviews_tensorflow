b"This place is a joke. They don't honor their own coupon. On the phone they said $80. I go, coupon is no good for the iPhone. I ask to talk to the owner. Twice. He then comes out and now says the price is normally $99. That's funny, I never told them I had a coupon when they first told me $80. What a joke. Never ever ever will I go back."
