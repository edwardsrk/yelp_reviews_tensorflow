b"First off, let me say I believe Five Guys has ruined me for any other burger place.I didn't like Char-Grill, I felt the burger was dry, even after I had chili put on mine and the fries were just ok.  I think I could have got the same thing at a fast food place for .99 cents.  I probably won't go back, unless someone else suggests it... maybe."
