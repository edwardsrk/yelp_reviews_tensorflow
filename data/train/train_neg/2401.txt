b"Pad thai, tahini, parsnip, olive, mustard, vinegar, everything bagels - the list goes onnnnn.  Some fun and some strange ingredient combinations, the gelato flavours here are constantly changing.  Personally I think some of the sweet and savoury combos are a little too weird for me and I didn't enjoy my scoop which was keffir lime, buffalo yogurt and honey. I also taste tested a saffron, red peppercorn and ginger flavour.  Really weird :(  Not for everyone, but major points for originality."
