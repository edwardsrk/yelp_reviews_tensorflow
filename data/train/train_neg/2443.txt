b"If you plan to have lots of errands in a day... Do not try to go to DMV. (Specifically here by Sahara.) the long wait is absurd. I guess bcos it's one of the busiest dmv here in Vegas? Idk. But the volume of people waiting in line is just huge. Though they have a big area for seats, it's just not enough to accommodate all most all people coming in. It's like 1:10 coming in. Customer service is a little low for a fact some of the staffs will really just yell out of the blue like can you guys just use an intercom or something? But over all there all helping these tons of people.  Hoping for a better and bigger DMV Sahara."
