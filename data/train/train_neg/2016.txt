b"I would have given this place 1 star if not for the service from the front desk.  I checked in on Saturday during memorial day weekend, waited 30 minutes to try to valet park my car and failed to get on the porte cochere due to mismanagement and understaffed valet crew.  There is no excuse for that kind of thing at a hotel especially where there is no self park option.  Ended up parking across the street at the mall to check in, ridonkulous.The service at the front desk was good to great, they were apologetic about the valet and whenever I called down for my car (once I was able to valet my car), they fought to have my car ready by the time I got down.  Accommodations are decent, nice big jet tubs, good sized rooms and a mini kitchenette in the studios to boot because these are condotel units.  The location, despite being off strip, is workable because you're walking distance to the Wynn and directly across the street from Fashion Show.  If you're staying here, you probably don't want a casino and so being next to fashion show is a plus.  I can't stress how understaffed this hotel seemed to be and so I probably won't stay here again if I'm paying the same price as a on-strip 4star hotel.  I was able to book at a $100 discount to other comparable hotels with a casino though so something to keep in mind."
