b'I was pretty excited to try The Crepe\'s gluten free option but when the waitress told me the batter was buckwheat I decided against it. Buckwheat ins\'t what I would be using to make a crepe. If they try Gluten free Bisquick or use cup 4 cup maybe I\'ll return. Luckily for me the farmers market was going on so I was able to get a fresh smoothie from one of the vendors.  My mom and sister however tried two of the breakfast crepes. They took a little while to come out and both left saying their crepes were.... "interesting" and dont think they will be returning anytime soon. My Mom had the FRANCE - ham, eggs, farm cheese, scallions, chopped parsley, tomatoes topped with b\xc3\xa9chamel sauce. Her crepe was swimming in the bechamel which had no taste at all. My Sister on the other hand had the CANADA - Canadian bacon, egg, potato hush and maple syrup topped with toasted oats crunch. Her\'s was swimming in maple syrup.I really hope this place makes it but based on what I saw on Saturday, It doesn\'t look to promising.'
