b'requested for fridge for kid\'s milk as soon as we checked in at 3:30 on a thursday with a not very full registration desk...waited for an hr and when we followed up they said we don\'t have to be in room for them to bring it....ok so we left for 2 hrs. and upon returning to our room at 7 pm still no fridge... followed up at 8 pm and front desk says " they set it up and delivered it"... i say well it\'s not here obviously that\'s why I am calling....and waited another 1.5 hrs no fridge...housekeeping dept asks "were you gone from your room?" I said yes but they told us we could leave and they would still bring it... she says"well sometimes they don\'t" ok so lady be consistent with your rules and don\'t tell us we have to be here waiting for someone.... finally it arrives 10:15.... wow I guess you can\'t enjoy and be stuck in room just for a fridge....hopefully tom will be better service!'
