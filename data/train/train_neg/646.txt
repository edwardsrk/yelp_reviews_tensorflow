b"I decided to swing by to buy a few medium sized mid priced cigars since I live around the corner. I spent $15 on 3 cigars. Sad to say that even though the cigars were kept in a cabinet humidor that they were dry as a bone when I got them home. I smoked one about 10 minutes after buying it and while cutting the cigar it crunched and practically shattered. After lighting up the cigar the wrapper flaked off, it burned incredibly hot and unevenly and was so bitter that I couldn't finish it. Too bad since they are so close to home, but I'll be traveling elsewhere from now on."
