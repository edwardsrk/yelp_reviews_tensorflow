b"Worst experience ever.  my new car was dented after shopping!! food quality is unacceptable.  hot foods are greasy and I threw it in the garbage after a bite.  They display milk and yogurt in room temperature which I worry about its safety.  The price is very attractive but I don't want to eat sth in my stomach that may hazard to my health."
