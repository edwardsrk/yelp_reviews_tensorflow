b"Worst Thai food I've ever had I ordered scallop asparagus and shiitake I couldn't have more than 2 bites... It was tasteless and after I had the first bite there was a paste of oil on the top of the inside of my mouth it was so gross!! Also the scallops were like rubber so chewy!!.. I also ordered basil noodle with beef it had no flavor the only thing that was decent was the BBQ chicken from the grilled section... And I asked to get some peanut sauce for it which I didn't get.... I'm never coming back!!"
