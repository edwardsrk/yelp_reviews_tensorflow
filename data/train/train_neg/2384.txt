b'One of my favorite places to shop , always very friendly However sales person in designer shoes made us feel like 2nd rate citizens Purchased a pair of Prada sneakers for my daughter Thought maybe it was just me that thought sales person treated us like  we did not belong there Asked my daughter and  she felt exactly the same It is my first time shopping there where someone made me feel very uncomfortable We were not just window shopping We came in for the Prada sneakers Anyway we were very excited walking in there Not so much when we left She might have had a bad day Still no excuse to act "snotty"'
