b'Went to the presentation and spent 4 hours there.  Did not buy but told daughter and husband they need to listen to it...Thought it was good.  Went to use the travel gift but they can cancel on us within 3 weeks of the date!  We have to take off work and get airfare and then possibly (most likely after reading other reviews) cancel on us!  Shame on Wyndham!'
