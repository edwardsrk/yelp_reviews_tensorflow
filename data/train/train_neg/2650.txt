b"Downgrading by 2 stars as was made wait for 55 mins over estimated time on a pick up order. This is the 2nd time it's happened. It was busy, but after spending $80 I would expect some gesture of goodwill since they admitted they lost my order after 2nd time checking up on it. Phone order 6.50pm, got food 8.10pm."
