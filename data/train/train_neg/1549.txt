b"Go to St. Louis wings all the time. Came to this location expecting the same amount of customer service. The waitress was extremely rude. Never had this experience of customer service. I've Been neglected before but never had this amount of personality come from a waitress. When asked the waitress about the specials that l I noticed outside, she flipped the menu open and said she doesn't know about those ones but the weekly specials in here. Just read it. When she brought our food out, we asked for the St. Louis special sauce, she was rude about it. Brought the bill out while I was still eating. Needed to pay with credit but never came back with the terminal. Fries and burger were both over cooked and dry. Left a really bad impression of St. Louis wings in general."
