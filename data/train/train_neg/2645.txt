b"The food here is amazing, but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been here 3 times and every time I hope that the service will be better but it never is. Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE."
