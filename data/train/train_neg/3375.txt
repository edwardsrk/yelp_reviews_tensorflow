b'I took my 2 kids their for their biannual check and clean. The lobby is small and cramped. If they have more than like 8 people waiting it is crowded. I am not sure how the cleaning went because no one but the patient is allowed to go back even for young children. I am not sure why they would not allow parents to go back with their small kids. After the cleaning was done, I did not talk with the dentist or assistant, I talked to the lady that works up front to check you in. She passes along the information like third party.  We have found a different dentist for them. Do not plan on going back here.'
