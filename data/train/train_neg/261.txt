b"Stopped in today to see if they could fit me in for a walk-in pedicure. The young man at the desk said yes, and within a couple minutes had me go sit in the pedicure chair with my feet in the warm bath. I sat there and no one came over to start my pedi. As I looked around, all the techs were busy. I sat there for 25-30 minutes, now the water was cold and my feet pruney. None of the techs even appeared close to being done with their current clients, and no one had ever told me they'd be with me soon. I decided to leave and as I gathered my things, a tech asked me if I was leaving. She told me she was going to do a manicure, then me next. I told her I couldn't wait that long, that my water was cold, I'd been sitting there a half hour. I told her it's ok to say they don't have time, or just have me wait up front, but they shouldn't have sat me in a pedi station with my feet in water waiting for that long. I won't be back."
