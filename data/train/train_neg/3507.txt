b'Disappointed that the restaurant\'s success has lead management to drop the complimentary chips. The explanation by our server as to waste made a little sense -to a point, since one bowl could still be offered gratis upon request (they promote consumption of good but higher margin cocktails!)That said the rating still would have managed 5 stars had we not been overcharged $2 each for the shrimp burritos we enjoyed. While the menu clearly indicated that they were under the flat taco / burrito price in the banner for the group- as only whitefish and pork belly carried a premium- our waitperson still challenged us and had to bring in the manager. The manager did make the adjustment but only after serving up a lame and nonsensical excuse / explanation about "new" menus - while only the ones that we ordered from matter  While we enjoyed our meal, we had the sense that we were not appreciated and will be faced with unsupported rising prices at on future visits.'
