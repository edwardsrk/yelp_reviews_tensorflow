b'23 min wait for two chicken tacos with rice and bean, Uber eats orders were expedited fast and efficient during my wait, however there was only two tables when I walked in that already had there food I was the only one in line , place was dead decided to go there instead of Costa Vida so I could get a bit e to eat fast, a couple of girls ordered after myself but finished there whole meal before I got my order to go, brand ambassador not present. Weak for a new place trying to get traction in a competitive market'
