b"Passed by here after we went to raijin ramen and thought everything looked super cute. Bought 3 bread, the charcoal salted egg, an almond croissant and a coffee walnut bread. All three, after discount came to almost 20$. I was quite excited but upon trying them all, the croissant was pretty good (but I've had better, ie nadege, etc) but the other two were very mediocre. The salted egg bread was very one dimensional as the bread itself wasn't very flavourful. I thought it would be closer to a moon cake concept where bread is a bit sweet and counterbalanced the salty egg yolk but instead the egg yolk overpowered everything else. The walnut bread was also very weird as the coffee had a weird after taste. For the price I would def not come back."
