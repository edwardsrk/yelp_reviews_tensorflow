b'Loved it the first time but today was terrible. I had raved about this place and posted it on two different local FB pages saying how great it was. Today my sandwich was so skimpily made and the "Dutch crunch" bread that I have dreamt about since my first visit was not crunchy at all. The manager was only slightly apologetic and when I showed her the small bit of artichoke leaf and that the rest was lettuce she kept insisting it was all artichoke.She did say their baker has been baking inconsistently lately. I don\'t know why they would accept inferior product.She did have the kitchen staff remake the sandwich but it felt extremely uncomfortable.The second sandwich was tasty, but the overall experience was disappointing.'
