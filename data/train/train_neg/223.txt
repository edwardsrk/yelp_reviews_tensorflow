b'My friends and I were very excited to have brunch in a nice French restaurant while in Las Vegas. However, our experience was quite disappointing.The 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. But the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. We were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a "medium rare" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. We probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.Our waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in French. She was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. I was wondering if this was a French thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.Glad I decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the Venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in Bouchon.'
