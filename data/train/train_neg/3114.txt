b'ALTHOUGH b.m. has created a beautiful room and probably a welcome local alternative to all of the clubs on the strip if you\'re into that sorta scene, it still is as far from cool as can be.Talk about a sausage fest!  I was hit on by at least a dozen butt-faced boneheads in the 45 minutes I was able to stomach this place.  Butt-faced in this case refers to both the people and their condition.If you\'re into (to borrow from a previous reviewer) douchebags and doubaggery, then you\'ve hit the motherload!  There were more goofballs there with fake tans, coked-out eyes, highlighted faux-hawks and Ben Sherman "Vegas-shirts" than at a Jersey bachelor party!  Some girls might read this description and say "Count me in!".They get 2 stars for the room.  Well done.  Potentially great place, but infected by the douchebagism.Have fun, chix with skank-striped hair, orange skin, stripper voices, and tramp stamps!  You are going to love the Blue Mar-tini-weeney!'
