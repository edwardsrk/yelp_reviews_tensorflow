b"Too crowded for me. Some may think it's ok, but I hate it. Should be at least 50% bigger. Awesome people work there, so it's not a 1. Good equipment selection. Great location, but too many people make it hard to work out without conflict, or use the equipment I want. Too small with too many people who don't realize that timeliness and using one piece of equipment at a time is fair in such a crowded place."
