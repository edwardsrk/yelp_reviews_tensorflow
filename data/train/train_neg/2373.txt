b"This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't."
