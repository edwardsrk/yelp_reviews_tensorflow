b"I purchased a brand new Hyundai Sonata at this dealership and the smooth talking salesman was trying to get me at $436 per month payments. I told him I couldn't afford that amount, he then said how about $380. I still said no. I needed to be closer to $300 per month. after bringing out the heavy guns and the closers to basically strong-arm me, we reached $320 per month payments and I had to put $1000 more down. I went to sign the papers and I noticed that the crafty finance guy added 6 payments to the 72 months that I had agreed to. I got up and walked out. My wife and I went to another Hyundai dealership in Las Vegas, and I don't want to name them because people will think that I am biased and probably work for the other dealership, but I don't. I am a retired vet. I think that most of all these 5 stars given on this report are a scam and are from people who are affiliated with this terrible dealership.This practice of switching paperwork should stop. Henderson Hyundai Superstore are a HUGE SCAM!!!!"
