b'Awful!  Went to AT and T bc my pictures are fuzzy and was told phone was defective- the lens.  Went to this store and although they had people swarm me anytime I looked at any product - NOBODY could see me about my phone.  Service after the sale of my six plus= zero.  This is exactly why American companies are folding.  Worship the dollar- big bucks.  The customer is last!  The atmosphere in this store is equivalent to a used car lot meets a strip bar.  Never again!  Sorry Apple- for being such a "liberal" company you love the dollar- but care little for the people unless one waves $$$$$$$$$ in the air.  Your store is a big silver pile of dung -'
