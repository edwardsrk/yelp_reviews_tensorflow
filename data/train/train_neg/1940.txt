b'I paid to have the wiring redone on the back of my bike and a new 3 in 1 function tail light as well as have the back and front brake switches replaced because the brake function was t working and would only get bright lights. Went to go sell my bike and the guy who bought it knows a lot about electrical on bikes and had to redo all that work that I paid tons of money to have done. Not sure what my money went to or the work that was suppose to be done but it all had to be done all over again 3 months later.'
