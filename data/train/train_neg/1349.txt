b'Integrity is just a name with this company. I was having issues with my AC not blowing cool air so i called this company out to have them diagnose the issue. Little did they know I had already called a competitor and this was more or less a 2nd opinion. The technician although professional was attempting to sell me at the door with his scripted intro and pamphlet offering me some service package. After he evaluated the situation he presented me with a 7 item list of issues with multiple levels of criticalness(previous company noted water in a pan, and low capacitor).He stated that level 1\'s and 2\'s were required to "Get me up in running for the night" Included he noted that I needed 5 pounds or $500 worth of coolant. I thought this was odd since the previous company noted that my coolant levels were good and I  also had coolant added to the system last summer. He claimed that my system took a maximum of 5 pounds and required the entire amount, when i asked him if he was claiming that my system was completely empty of coolant he stated that "It was possible". Because I was aware that this was a flat out lie I agreed to pay the service call and asked him to leave. All in all this company provided me a quote of nearly $1,500 and I had a competitor come in and remove the water from a secondary pan and clear up a blocked drain for less than $200. My AC is working perfectly and I didn\'t have to be robbed in order to accomplish it. I would never let this company do any work in my home, they will take advantage of unknowledgeable customers.'
