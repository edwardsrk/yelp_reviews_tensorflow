b"DO NOT SETTLE! KEEP SEARCHING! WASTE OF MONEY!This hotel was NOT what I expected for a Las Vegas property in the center of the strip. Do not be fooled by the lobby, the rest of the hotel is old and outdated?Hallways smell, scuffs and dirt marks on the doors, directional signs missing from the wall, moulding was breaking off. Inside the room, outlets barely work, furniture was chipped, my dresser was missing a top drawer, vents clogged with dirt. There are about 15 elevators and only about 5 were working! The pool is nice....but all vegas hotel pools are nice.As much money as they make daily; there is NO REASON this hotel should look like it did. I will NOT stay there again. Keep searching for place to stay. I've stayed at Super 8's that were better than the Flamingo!"
