b"Used to come here a lot when I first moved to Vegas. Coming from LA, I had a lot to learn about Vegas nail shops. Biggest issue is they won't do two things at once. I want to get in and get out. One day I was there really early, got my pedicure started while the nail techs just sat. By the time my pedicure was done the nail techs were busy and I had to wait. Good service would have been for one of those nail techs sitting on their phone to start my nails so I could finish faster. Another time I bought my daughter and boyfriend to experience a pedicure, the wait was long and it took hours to do all three. Went again for my birthday nails and pedicure, thought I had planned enough time, nope still took longer than expected. So, I just stopped going there completely. The work is just ok but way too slow and nothing special."
