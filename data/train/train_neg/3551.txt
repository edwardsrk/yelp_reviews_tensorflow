b"Meh.I was hankering for some kielbasa, as I had just purchased some pierogies and holubchi from another vendor on the same level in the St Lawrence Market.It was okay. Nothing special, especially for the price I paid (almost $10 Canadian).I've had way better in the East Village in New York City, so maybe I'm spoiled that way......"
