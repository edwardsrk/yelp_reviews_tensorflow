b'My husband and I showed up for an early dinner late lunch.  Prices seemed reasonable & there wasn\'t but a few other people in the restaurant. We order our meals: 1/2 a rack of Baby back ribs with fries and "fresh steamed" vegetables for him, and the Gilley\'s chopped salad with chicken for me. My husband also orders a beer. The waitress brings the beer after 3 or so minutes, he asks for a glass and she just leaves. A few minutes later she comes with the glass almost pissed he asked for it!  When our meals come out, his 1/2 rack are dry & looks like it came from a pot bellied pig, his fries are COLD and his vegetables are soggy. My salad is drenched in dressing, lettuce is soggy, chicken is dry and it\'s just a mess.  To top all of this off, our waitress continued to be very curt and short with us and our bill was $45! We just paid our bill and got the hell outta there. This town is too big with too many other restaurants with people who enjoy their jobs.  Kinda sad, we were hopeful for this place.'
