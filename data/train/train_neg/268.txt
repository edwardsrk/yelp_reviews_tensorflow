b'My wife and I tried to eat here, but we couldn\'t get the staff\'s attention.  We entered through the main entrance, saw the "seat yourself" signs, and sat ourselves outside.  We\'re both easy going so this is fine.  We looked through the menus, decided what we wanted, chose our drinks, and tried to make eye contact with the staff.  The last straw was when, after 15-20 minutes of sitting there without any acknowledgement, the manager came by and looked at us, instructed the busser to do something with the fireplace near our table, turned on his heel, and went back to hanging out with his employees.  We were looking for some sort of hint that he would send someone over, but we did not get it.The worst restaurant service experience I had in Paris was better than this.  I wasn\'t even mangling the language and we felt like personae non gratae.  We ate at Lucille\'s Barbeque around the corner instead, which was great.'
