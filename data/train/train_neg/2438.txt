b"This used to be my favorite place to get prime rib. We always shared it with others as the place locals go and you have to get over the run down look outside because when you go to the coffee shop you are going to get a good meal. Today they made a liar out of me. I started with their clam chowder that had so much grease in it I couldn't finish it. Then the prime rib was tough and so was the steak my husband got. And if that wasn't bad enough, apparently you have to be a regular customer to get good and friendly service. Our waitress stopped by the tables next to us multiple times and their drinks always stayed filled. My husband's soda was filled once, but my water glass stayed empty for at least 10 minutes before I finally flagged someone down to fill it. He also brought us a box for our leftover food. We had to flag down our waitress and ask for our check. We had discussed dessert, but gave up the thought when we realized it wasn't even going to be offered. Once we asked for the check, she quickly gave it to us and wished us a good day. When we approached the register, one cashier was counting her till and the other said she would help us and asked for our check. She quickly processed our check and wished us a good day barely looking up from the register and never looking at our faces. When she handed the receipt to us with one hand, she was taking the check from the next customers with the other hand. It was clear that good food and good service are no longer a priority. I guess it is time to find a new and better place for the locals."
