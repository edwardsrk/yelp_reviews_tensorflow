b"I found the portions quite small for all the dishes we ordered.   Food is decent but not out of this world and when you factor the price ($15-$16 for the dishes we ordered), the good atmosphere and service could not make this one of my go to places.  However the place is quite busy so I'm sure many people may dispute me.  Not saying it's a bad place but found it expensive for the food/portion size."
