b"I would give this place one star for customer service but I'm giving it 2 stars only because my nails turned out nice...  my original nail shop is in green valley & ever since I moved I was being lazy to drive all the way there so I decided to check this place out.. I just wanted to change my nail color (shellac) so I called and asked how much would it be and the guy said $20 so once I got there I picked out a color and told her I wanted silver glitter on the top. She picked out the glitter that was more pricey and didn't even tell me it would be another $5 charge.. I knew it was gonna be extra $5 because I get my nails done all the time & usually get that kind of glitter so I didn't mind but I feel like they should tell a customer ahead of time if there will be more additional charges.. and so when it came to paying she charged me $30 to just change the color without a manicure.. I asked her I thought it was $25 for shellac nail color change & the glitter and she made up some excuse which I couldn't even understand. So I will not be coming to this salon again because they just make up there own prices depending on the customer... Other than the lady being kinda rude and not talkative, the guys that work there are more talkative and friendly so if you go there make sure you go to the guys instead of that lady.."
