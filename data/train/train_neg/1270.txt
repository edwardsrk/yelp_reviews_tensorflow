b'Checked in here last week to get a brew and bite while kids next door at Force center. I am at the Force a lot as I coach and play there. Would love for the brew co to work out but the service again was awful. I sat at the bar and had to yell after sitting there for 5 minutes without being greeted.  At least say hi be with you in a minute as you walk by 7 times. Literally I sat at the beer taps so I patiently waited before I said something. Then after finally getting a beer. Atasty IPA which was NOT theirs as they had no IPAs. What decent brewmaster has NO IPAs??My wife came in anxious for a beer and some food. After sitting there another 7 minutes she said nice service and walked out. Done done DONE with this place.'
