b"Had an opportunity to eat at the breakfast buffet on feb 28th, there is not much to say except, It was horrible.. The food was unbelievably bad, and tasteless.. Eggs Benedict should at the least have a sauce that can be identified.. This one was pale yellow, yet there was no taste to it at all, lemon was completely absent.. I have no idea what it was made from, but it certainly was not lemon or eggs.. While most things can be explained for bad food, stupidity is not an excuse.. The section that was serving the fresh bowls of fruits, water melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple sitting in large stainless steel bowls, packed in ice, had the HEAT LAMPS on.?. Actually had to tell them that they were ON.. Needless to say the fruit was hot on top and cold on the bottom.  This was my last trip to the 'green valley ranch' anything.."
