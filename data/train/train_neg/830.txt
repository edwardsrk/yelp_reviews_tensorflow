b"Got my windows tinted. Thought it was a decent job . So I asked about wrapping a small portion of my suv . Quoted me a price. I returned the next day to get it done. Told it would take 30 minutes. 3 hours later. Drove home took pictures of wrap. And the line are off. Called the shop was told to come next day. Came back shop owner not at location. So I drove to 2nd location to show problem. Just missed him. Told tech at shop problem showed him the truck . Was told would take a week to get material in. Took copy of my receipt and all my info. 5 days later I called back to get a time frame. The owner had no idea of my problem. Ask me to send pictures. After he reviewed the photos . He told me he would fix the wrap but because of Easter weekend   It would take longer to get material come back Monday. Came Tuesday was told not available to repair. Had all materials come back in the morning. So I took off work. Came at 830 and now was told material to expensive to order. Will remove and refund. WTF. So now I'm looking a little closer at all the work that was done.  Going to a professional shop to get done what I paid these guys to do. Thanks Desert TINT"
