b'I am taking a trip to California tomorrow and was in need of a thorough car wash. I just left this location and I honestly should have just done it myself, or drove a little further to another car wash. Tried to use $3 off on Yelp but the cashier forgot to honor it even tho I showed her the coupon prior to paying. She did give me extra air freshner but do I really need 3 of them? Paid $34 for handwash + $10 tip. After I left I realized that the rugs were barely vacuumed, the exterior had water stains. This is the worst car wash I have ever been to. Been trying to call but nobody is picking up the phone. This is the last time I will be visiting this god awful place.'
