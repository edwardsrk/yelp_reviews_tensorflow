b'The previous reviews that mention the service problems are absolutely correct, it is horrible.  We have visited this restaurant several times over the last few years and it has really gone downhill.  You very rarely see a waiter even when the dining room is practically empty.  Yesterday we went for a late lunch and were seated right away in a booth.  There were three tables in the entire place that were occupied by a total of 7 people.  We sat, looked at the menus, and waited...and waited....and waited...and got up and left.  10 mins is my max time in an empty restaurant without seeing a server.  That will be out last visit, too bad, I thought the food was ok for a chain restaurant.'
