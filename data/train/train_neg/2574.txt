b"My husband I went there a few weeks ago because the menu reminded us so much of a little gem we found in NYC a few weeks prior - we were craving some more!  So we thought this would be a great local find.  Maybe it's because we had such high hopes based on this other restaurant, but Flower Child misses the vision.  We likely won't return since the prices were just too high, the quantities too small, and the service was so-so (only brought us food, never followed up or checked on us). If we hadn't studied the menu before going in, it would have been confusing to order. We were still hungry after spending $30-40 for the two of us (no drinks included), so we went over to AJ's next door to pick up some healthy snacks. We aren't big people, just healthy and fit, so we have a healthy appetite. Wish the healthy menu was healthier on our wallets and was more satisfying. Gave it two stars because at least it's trying."
