b"I had a great experience the first time I came here. They helped me choose the right printer and helped me get everything I needed for it. Staff was very friendly!So I decided to come back today to pick up some supplies for my office and was treated really bad. An employee asked me if I needed help and I said yes, but as soon as he saw my service dog, he blurted out that he couldn't help me because of the dog. He didn't even point me in the right direction or get someone else to help me. I almost left right then, but I really needed these supplies and they were about to close, so I got my stuff and left. It's pretty messed up that I couldn't get help because I have a service dog. She's trained and was right next to me the entire time I was in the store. I'm definitely not coming back."
