b"Don't hate on me, Yelpers, but I really wasn't satisfied with my visit to Bouchon when I went a couple of weeks ago. First of all, the wait was only supposed to take 20 minutes according to the hostess, but we waited outside for a good hour. This isn't some Asian restaurant where the host/hostess always says the wait will only take 20 minutes so that people will be fooled and stay longer because they already stayed for a long time. The good thing is that they provided us with some really good pastries while we were waiting. But then more bad things happen...They take 30 minutes to get our order.  And it takes about another 40 minutes to get our food. My friend didn't even get the diet coke he ordered at the beginning until after we already started eating. Was this special handmade diet coke? NO. It was from a freakin bottle. I know because he got the bottle with his glass. I ordered the croque madame expecting goodness considering we waited so long to eat there and it was ranked so highly on Yelp. I gotta say, I wasn't too fond of it. The taste was just meh. And the price I paid for that was disgusting ($19 before tax and tip). I also got to try the mussels, which were alright, but the taste was a bit overwhelming. I think I would have been sick of them after 5 mussels. I got to try the waffles from the chicken and waffles dish as well.  The waffles were disgusting. There are bacon bits inside the mushy waffles. Gross.Would I come back? With all the quality food available at Vegas with a much shorter wait, probably not."
