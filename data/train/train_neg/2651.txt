b"First impression:  Coming in i didn't like the parking lot the entrance closet to the building is actually the exit. When I get in two people are waiting come to find they haven't been helped yet. The staff seems to move slow and seems slightly depressed. The food is vegetarian but good. The coffee is good, I had a ice coffee macchiato. It was delicious. Went around 3pm and it wasn't crowded but they are open 24 hours. Will have to try a different time to verify if they are just slow or if it was the time of day."
