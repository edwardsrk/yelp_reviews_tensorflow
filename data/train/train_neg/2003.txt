b"Pros: Fun atmosphere, great for people watching, mechanical bull is unique in my experienceCons: I had the chicken tenders and fries and while the tenders were alright, the fries were pretty terrible. I've had fries that didn't taste good before, but these were the first fries I've experienced that actually tasted bad. After dinner, I felt sick and had to drink lots of water to get the taste out of my mouth. Would not go again!"
