b"I'm actually very disappointed to have to leave a negative review. I ordered takeout consisting of steamed dumplings and pineapple fried rice. The dumplings were not the traditional ones, but were actually shu mai. This is not a big deal because I like both, but there were only four in the order (for $6) and the sauce was not good. I couldn't quite put my finger on it so I had my husband taste it and he agreed that something wasn't right. Although the pineapple fried rice portion was generous (as it should be for the higher prices compared to other local Thai restaurants), it basically just seemed like the standard ingredients doused in soy sauce. Again, no great flavor and even something that just tasted a little off. I was also a bit put off by being charged a good bit more than the prices listed on an online menu that I had checked beforehand. I didn't make a stink about it and was hopeful that the food would be worth the extra money, but it wasn't. Lastly, when I went to pick up my order I was immediately smacked in the face by the odor of raw fish when opening the door and waiting for the hostess. There were about 4 people dining inside and I can't imagine how this did not ruin their experience. There are so many other great Thai restaurants in the area and even right up/down the street in Squirrel Hill that there's no need to waste your time on this one."
