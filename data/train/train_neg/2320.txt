b'Very basic hotel. Just needed it to sleep and have close proximity to the ROM area. I woke up to a bedbug crawling on my bed that I killed and there was blood everywhere! I looked around and found 1 more, took it down to the manager and they compensated well. But now I have nightmares I have bedbugs now.'
