b"I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad. I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. It was cold so we decided to eat inside. The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back."
