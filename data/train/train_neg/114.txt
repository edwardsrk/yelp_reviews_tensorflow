b"If pretentiousness had a capital, this place would be it.  Went there with family to go hang out.  Apparently, there's a dress code there which prohibits Nike Shox.  According to the bouncer, they are trying to foster a business casual dress code.  Ok, fine.  More on this later.  Luckily, I live close by and grab some nicer shoes and it met the bouncer's approval.  Unfortunately, he didn't mention the cover charge, which took me by surprise when the cashier told me to fork it over.  Even though it was $10 for locals, who ever heard of charging people to get into a bar?  Whatever.  I pay my way in and met up with the gang.  Service was slow, music was way too loud and for $8 for a domestic beer did not impress me.  Remember that policy about the business casual dress code?  Funny thing about that.  As I was out on the patio, I happen to spot a guy in shorts and tennis shoes wandering abouts.  Selective enforcement perhaps?  In short, it's over rated and overpriced!"
