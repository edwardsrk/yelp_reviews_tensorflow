b"We were so looking forward to eating here. Heard good things about it. Our waiter was outstanding and that it is the only thing that I can say that was up to par tonight. Oh & the wine. My husband ordered the pig ears to be adventuresome..favorable but way too many.for an appetizer. I ordered the market fish... Alaskan Halibut, was to be 8oz according to our waiter, could not have been 4oz. No peas with it as mentioned in the menu, but instead one-sliced radish & 4 roasted asparagus, some greens & 5 of the chewiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. Good broth but for about $37 way overpriced. My hubby had a NY Strip with a big piece of gristle in it. French Fries were very good. But at $34 again the cut of meat was not up to par. Will we go back not sure, there are so many other excellent restaurants to chose from."
