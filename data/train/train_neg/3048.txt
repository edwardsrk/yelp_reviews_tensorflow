b"My fiance and I decided to try this place in Tempe because our normal Pho Place we go to (Nhat's off of University/Rural) was closed that day. We saw somewhat okay reviews and thought we would judge it for ourselves. Upon arriving there was no one to greet us as we awkwardly stood there for more than 5 minutes. An older Vietnamese lady walked up and offered to seat us. The decor was pretty standard 1980s styled vinyl booths, and when she offered to seat us by the window, there were FULL ON HORNETS IN THE BOOTH! I'm not even kidding. They were coming in through the crack in the wall and hovering at the table the lady offered to seat us at. We did not feel like getting stung to death while we ate, so we sat at another table. Unfortunately, another couple walked in right after us and were immediately sat at the booth of death and for some reason didn't notice (yikes!). The chicken pho had no flavor, and the noodles were just okay. I don't think we will return."
