b'Now that all there friends got the their positive reviews out of the way, I think the truth will start to surface. This could very well be one of my worst experiences ever. Clearly I am not the demographic they are looking for and I am truly glad, I wont be back.  I had the steak and eggs box and I can sum it up in one word, gross. Nothing more needs to be said about the food.  The music was loud and annoying, no comfortable place to sit. The staff was polite, but not skilled in the food service or any service industry. The fries were good and freshly cooked, thank gawd something.'
