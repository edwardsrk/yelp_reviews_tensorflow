b'We attend events here frequently and usually  always  have a great experience.  Today we ordered their boneless  wings, large order $16.99...very disappointed  as we got about 20 small nuggets (size of a quarter)and 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery  sticks. Not worthy of  the price Thank goodness we had a great server/bartender Wilfred who made it a memorable girls lunch experience with his great customer  service and understanding,  even with  our complaints he kept his big smile and extra celery and carrot sticks.
