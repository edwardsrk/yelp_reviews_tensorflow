b"The food is a little higher than Red Lobster. I ordered a Baked Potato but was told it would be an additional 20 minute wait. So I asked for a sweet potato instead. It was a $1 up charge. IMO, the shouldn't have charge me $1 for the sweet potato when they didn't have any regular baked potatoes ready. It still took an extra 10 minutes for the sweet potato and it came out over cooked. Our waitress was attentive, but I felt sorry for the other customers. Their waitress was constantly had her boyfriends table. She must have gone over to his table 15 times while we were there and he had already had his food served before we even sat down. She was very attentive to him, brought him out a baked potato, onion rings, rolls, etc to go with his meal. She must have filled the condiments at his table at least 3x while we were there.  When I went to the bathroom after we ate, the custodian was emptying the trash and cursing up a storm with the hostess. She saw me and they both just laughed. Neither one of them apologized for their language or for me having to wait to use the restroom. Now I am all for a clean bathroom, but I shouldn't have to listen to young adults cuss up a storm while I wait. There was no manger on site. Seems the restaurant is run by teens and young adults."
