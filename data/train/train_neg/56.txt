b"I had explicitly explained to your manager that 1) I didn't receive an email - so I didn't see this fine print that you speak of; 2) I'm in the process of relocation, so I don't have my license transferred to NV and still work in both NV and CA.Maybe the reason you boast not being a crowded gym is that you won't let anyone use your facility without these crazy conditions that I and others speak of in reviews...Additionally, you have one shower stall with a huge rainfall shower head; not everyone wants to have water falling directly on their head and no where else...Anyway, thank you to the GM for being such a jerk; this allowed for me to see that there is no flexibility whenever there is an issue that may arise with your patrons. The reason I signed with 24? Their staff was understanding of my situation and totally accommodating.  Yay for them - love them!!!"
