b'First of all, this is not a Chinese restaurant.  It is a buffet restaurant that also has a Chinese session.  There are sushi, roast beef cut station, dessert bar, ice cream bar, and soup bar.For a buffet restaurant, it is pretty good.  Foods are kept fresh and generally well-prepared.  Of course they are all heavy on sauce and many deep fried.  What would you expect from a glorified Panda Express?The surprise was the roast beef.  Well made, tender, and tasty.The beer selection was disappointing for a northern city.  I ended with Tiger beer.'
