b"I had high expectations of this place due to the reviews on Yelp. However, my actual experience was anything but good.First, I ordered house chow mein and instead of getting chow mein, I got a box full of bean sprouts and other vegetables with a few shrimp and a little pork sprinkled in, with a separate bag of wonton crisps. There were NO noodles to be found. I was amazed - never have I ever been given chow mein without any actual noodles. Second, my boyfriend got house fried rice, which tasted good ....at first. We both found hairs in our portions, short hairs that I don't even want to know where they came from. Third, we had the house special chicken, which was the only dish that wasnt terrible. There was more fried flour than chicken meat , but the sauce was good. Finally, we were excited to try their massive egg rolls, but they were just 99% bean sprouts. The theme of New Garden seems to be reliance on endless amounts of bean sprouts.This was a truly disappointing experience. Im not sure if we just ordered the wrong items, but none of the items we ordered met my expectations. I will not be going back."
