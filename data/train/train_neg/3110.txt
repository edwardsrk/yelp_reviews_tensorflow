b"Disliked when they premade the banh mi... It didn't look fresh. I asked for extra chili, the lady took one of the premade banh mi from the back and added more chili. She broke the top part of the banh mi and didn't even bother fixing it... just kinda threw the broken part in. Was really upset seeing that scene. However it's $5 for 2 so I guess I shouldn't complain. Quality is not the best, it is decent banh mi. And since they premade it, it's sometimes a hit or miss. It's quite dry sometimes.Recommend when you need cheap lunch or something quick to go with."
