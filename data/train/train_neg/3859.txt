b"Other than the fact that this plaza contains horrendous drivers and no sense of direction, the Metro here isn't any different. This place is crowded, cramped and items hard to find. I just felt claustrophobic in here, and happy that we only had come in to buy one thing.However, they did have an extensive fish and bulk shrimp collection (which I haven't seen at any other grocery, but I don't peruse Metros that much either). Also lots of potted plants in the front to buy that last minute gift before you see your in-laws (yes, I have done this)."
