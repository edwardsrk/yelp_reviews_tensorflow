b'The guy who came to "fix" our garbage disposal was a freaking joke. Our garbage disposal is shaking the whole counter and making very loud noises when it is on but not grinding anything. He went on to tell us that the reason it\'s so loud is because the horse power is a high number and that we\'d need to install a lower horse power model for it to not be so loud. After we left we consulted several online sources that said higher horse power will make it more quiet. I hope this company hires technicians who actually know what they\'re talking about.'
