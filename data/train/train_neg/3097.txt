b"The Place looks fantastic inside and out I'll give that 5 stars!!! Most of the people are great that work there, I went there for a few times now and I just moved around the corner. One of the bartender I met I think his name is Mike is an arrogant asshole sorry for my language, he is very disrespectful to everybody that comes up to his bar when he is working and starts acting like a childish kid when he get busy, slamming glasses and ignoring people he doesn't like... He made my last two experiences there awful and I might not come back. Another thing they might need to fix is the chef with all of the hoops in his ear probably needs to learn how to be somewhat quiet and respect his staff some more. He was a little scary and seemed disrespectful. Hope some of the staff gets fixed so I actually might enjoy myself when I come back."
