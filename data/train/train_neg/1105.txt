b"Cashier was super rude. Ordered 2 breakfast burritos and they gave us 2 Carne Asada burritos drowned in guacamole. We didn't realize it was the wrong order until we got back to work. Went back and explained what happened and she said that it's our fault and that we shouldn't of picked up the wrong order. Customer service was horrible, instead of apologizing and giving us what we paid for she decided to be nasty about it. To be honest I should of got a full refund after that type of service because after running back and forth food was cold and appetite was ruined. Will not be returning, food isn't that good anyways.. it's just convenient."
