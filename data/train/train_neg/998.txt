b'When the owner, Joey, tells me that they should be putting 8oz of steak on their steak sandwich and I only see 5 pieces and its well done when I ordered it med rare...he does the right thing.  He gives me a $20 gift card.  He gives me a promise that he\'d go back into the kitchen, get the staff to make sure the amount is 8 oz, and make it right the next time I come in.  He gives me a card, with his cell to let him know if they get it right.  This was last Saturday.  Well, tonight I gave his Bell establishment that 2nd chance.  I ordered the same meal.  I ordered a steak sandwich this time medium.  I was hoping his word was gold and I was going to taste redemption.  Well, as you can see by the stars, "Eek, Me thinks not".  The steak count is 7 pieces and the weight...3.5 oz.  (we took it to go).  And again, the steak was well done.  I call in.  I talk to the manager Austin. I let him know the situation.  He wants to make it right (again).  I pass... I\'m over it.  He says the next time I come in......... but I stop him and tell him there\'s not going to be a next time.  I just want him to relay to Joey that it wasn\'t right.We live in the neighborhood.  I was hoping this place would stick and we could dine here on a regular basis.  Well, unfortunately, we won\'t.  I see a lot of positive reviews.  So, I hope they do well.  This spot has turned over a handful of times.  And we need s solid restaurant in that location.  For me, it doesn\'t fulfill that need.  Only time will tell.'
