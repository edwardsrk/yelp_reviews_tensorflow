b'BEWARE!!!!!Was lied to regarding the repairs I needed for my Chevy sonic... they also tried to give false information to my father regarding his vehicle... since the location is convenient for me, I just got an oil change there, and overheard them try to swindle a lady who had just moved here....... I warned her about the dishonest business and I also confronted them about their lies... needless to say, they were very defensive and had no way of refuting the facts, when I described what a legitimate dealership had to say about their practice.'
