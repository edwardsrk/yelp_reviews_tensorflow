b"It's the name sake location, but with a little too much old-school Vegas and lack of consistency and service for the price point in the modern day Yelp life.'Sure I've had amazing prime rib, service, and experience at a steakhouse like Lawry's, HoPR, etc, but it just seems like the quality isn't there anymore that made this chain and location famous to begin with.From the acclaimed spinning salad to the amazing creamed spinach and corn, it was all just mediocre here and for the price point I was sadly very disappointed considering the options on the strip.If you want to avoid that and have a car though, this might be a place to check out and hope for the best. The large portions of prime rib will always help somehow."
