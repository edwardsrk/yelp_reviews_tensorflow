b"Went for the first time...ordered take-out. I ordered a crab burger with a side of fries (costs $1 more). I ate 1/2 of my sandwich, many because I didn't want to waste my money. The crab sandwich was oily, full of fillers - nauseating. As for the fries, not sure if my order was an afterthought. I received halves and crunchy tips, and the amount provided appeared to be the size of a kids fry at the local fast food joins. Not worth my money."
