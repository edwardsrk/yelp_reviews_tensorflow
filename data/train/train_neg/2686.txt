b"I LOVED my room. It was nice and modern and came with a refrigerator and a nice tub. The problem came when there was a call on the room phone from the front desk waking us up. We answered and no one was there. After laying back down to attempt to go back to sleep, there was pounding on the door and there was a man in the hall in front of my door who looked shirtless. In the end, he was nude. The security came up and for another 45 minutes or so, there was banging and yelling in the hall outside our door. We called the front desk back asking why they called us and the reason was because they thought the guy was coming from our room. No one apologized, said anything. I even reported it the front desk the night before and they mentioned there were other complaints and that the manager would call me back. I checked out Friday morning, I believe and there still has been no call. The reason I took the tome to complete this review is because myself and my daughter have been hotel hopping for the past 4 weeks because we have been displaced and this is the second hotel that let me down. Knowing that I am working hard daily and checking in at 9-10 pm at night, bedtime doesn't officially take place until about 11PM or 12am. So that was a huge inconvenience and my daughter has to be at her bus stop by 6:20AM. That was not nice at all."
