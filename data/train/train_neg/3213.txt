b"Unfortunately this was a let down. Food was Sub par. Footlong grilled cheese sounded great but no baguette so they just served us a kids grilled cheese. The waffled c\xc3\xa1ptese - waffle machine was broken so they served a basic tomato grilled cheese. Burger was decent. Wings were good and I really liked their traditional wing sauce. Main reason for going was the beers. They weren't bad but nothing special. Just barely average. The Duke of Dank was good. Amber & wheat just okay. They were very bland versions. (See my ratings on Untappd). Service was good but would have helped if the server knew about the problems when we ordered."
