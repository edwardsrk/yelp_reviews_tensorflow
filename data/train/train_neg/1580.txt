b"I have nothing good to say about The inner sleeve. I am very disgusted and a little pissed off. I brought some records and a turntable in to see what they were worth and the person behind the counter said everything i had was very common and not worth anything accept for 2 records that  were worth 5 DOLLARS the rest was worthless. I agree that what i brought in were not great records but to say and do that is not nice or a fair price which is stated on there web site. The turntable was working accept the belt for the turntable was broken and the person said it would cost 30 DOLLARS to fix WTF!!! What is the belt made of special rubber !! That some special belt in conclusion i will not ever do business with this establish again and for those who do you are fools. I understand they are there to make money that's fine i am all for that but it is how you do it that makes you a good establishment what you said and did to me was not nice or fair. I did go to your all you can carry once and what a load of crap you had if it wasn't for the Montovani and Nana Mouskouri records you would have had very little to offer.The record i brought in will be amongst next years all you can carry. I did get 10 record sleeves for my trouble and WTF should i support you for something that cost maybe 10 cents a for a piece plastic no thanks. All i am talking about is goodwill if you don't have that you might as well fold up your business and close your doors."
