b"Date night disaster. Stale popcorn, very dirty theater and a hole in screen 12. Chatty child right behind us during the movie (Jurassic world) did not help. Why a child this age was at this particular movie is beyond me. Parents of toddlers: do everyone a favor and leave your children at home with a sitter if you can't keep them quiet during the movie! Also, seats too small."
