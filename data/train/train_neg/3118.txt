b"The food is amazing so 5 stars for the food but not sure waiting 23 min in the drive through is worth it...I could have just gone on a bad day and got stuck behind a car that ordered a lot but I would just go in and order. The lady at the drive through wasn't very pleasant either....Went through the drive through again and waited 25min only to have them get my sandwich wrong...so pissed. If I decided to go back it would only be for a fruit tart or cannoli.."
