b"If I could give negative starts, I would. This place HAS THEE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! They discriminate against people of different color and did not even try to hide it! The manager, was not helpful at all. I would put all of the rude people on blast if I knew I wasn't going to get filtered! I will be contacting Hastings Law firm for the horrible horrible weekend I had with my family there. We even booked the mediterranean suite because it looked to fabulous. Later we found out the carpets have not been washed for how many years, mold in the restroom, and just plain horrible. The worst part? RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS and BABY RATS!!! Ewwwwww!!! I felt bad for people who were having thier wedding held there because as soon as I saw the rats, I didn't even want to leave my room. Maybe I should call the health and food commitee to have them check out the place? Sad part is, Green Valley Ranch was my ALL TIME fav spot to be in Vegas. We started going there when it first opened... When I was about 18! I'm 30 now... Green Valley had a special place in my heart. Up until now, I have never not once felt discriminated on until I went to Green Valley recently. What a horrible mess it has become. One more thing. The chlorine in the pool is to strong! I didn't even dip my head in the pool and my eyes were watery the WHOLE time while watching my son.Sorry but this place SUCKS. They couldn't even admit they were wrong. Horrible place to not be a great customer service person!"
