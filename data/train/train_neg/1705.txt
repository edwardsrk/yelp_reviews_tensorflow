b"Young guy cleans my pool. Comes on Fridays. Sometimes early, sometimes not; sometimes NOT AT ALL. My gate is usually locked, and I admit I sometimes forget to unlock it. However, I work from home and I am here ALL DAY. This guy can very easily ring my doorbell and ask to be let in, but he doesn't even bother. He'll write a shitty note and leave it on my door. I haven't seen him 8 out of the last 12 weeks. I have refused to pay my bill for the weeks he hasn't serviced my pool. Now they say I owe $270. My pool is dirty. He didn't even come today to clean and I did unlock it at 7:30am. When he does come he doesn't clean out my filter. I am required to pay to keep the pool up by the terms of my lease and he's not maintaining it and therefore causing me to be in violation of my contract. My husband & myself have called the office and left messages and we never get any response from anyone. I am beginning to think this business is a sham."
