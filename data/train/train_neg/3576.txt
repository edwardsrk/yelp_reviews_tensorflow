b'So I have been to Sambuca 3x. First time, got the prix fixe me and my girl. Food was delicious. A dude waited on us and he was lovely as well. Second experience was good too, portions are pretty big. Very good deal. Food is not amazing but its not shitty either. The mussels are the highlight of my meal. My girl got a steak, nothing phenomenal. 3rd visit was TERRIBLE. Food was cool. The asian lady who was waiting on us was RUDE. Basically it was one of those, I am slightly broke but I want to go out to dinner, so let me go here for the prix fixe. So tab was around 50$ and we dropped 3$ for tip( I know cheap but one those days broke times). She came to our table and said "hey guys, was the service bad or something?" , I was so shocked. We responded with so much embarrassment and said no service was ok. she was then slamming our dishes as she was picking them up....huffing and puffing all angry.Terrible'
