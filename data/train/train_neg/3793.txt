b'I went out to Matadors with my friend Sara on a Sunday night. Walking into Matadors is like walking into a super Wal-Mart at 2am; empty, Large and impressive. There was more staff standing around than patrons. We sat at the bar and I whipped my computer out to start my meeting and ordered an ala Carte seafood burrito and a bottle of beer. Sara\'s attempt to sober up with water is acknowledged and ridiculed for a few seconds I get into my meeting and the food comes. The seafood inside of the burrito was not really seafood at all. Sara describes the mash inside the wrapped tortilla as consuming half cooked sea monkeys. The only saving grace on this boring tasteless plate was the refried beans. Soft and cheesy, the beans saved the day. I order another dos equis lager and put my attention back to my online meeting. From the corner of my ear I hear the twinkling keys of the old time piano in the corner. I look up to see Sara stroking the ivories in the dark corner of the bar. She is on the phone with her mother excited she can remember a tune played when she was a child. We leave Matadors with... "Let\'s blow this taco stand"... The bill was less than $30 bucks.'
