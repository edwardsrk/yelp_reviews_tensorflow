b'This car wash has been around for a while.  It seems like it is slowly downsizing.  Gone is the impulse shopping area.  The car wash service itself seems to be slipping as well.  Now you can get a quick, economy, exterior only wash and stay in the car while it happens. The complete wash is not as elaborate as it had been, and is not as thorough as other washes in the area.  Convenient location to the area is what it has going for it.'
