b'I rented a car for 3 days ($298.00 midsize vehicleI had to change flight due to mechanical error, airline ask me if I can go on the next flight. I called Advantage and told them that I was keeping the car for an extra day, the representative told it would cost me $194.00, it\'s in my contact.  They need to change the name "Taking Advantage"  I will never rent from them'
