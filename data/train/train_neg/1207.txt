b"After explaining our disappointment with dishonest agents and online companies, they assured us they had been to the resort we were booking and that it was truly a 5 star. HAHA. What a joke. We arrived to find cockroaches in our room, along with ever present spiders (halls never cleaned), stained carpets, rusted out bathroom fixtures, falling apart furniture and terrible food. We sent a photographic record to them as well as Conquest Vacations. They both ignored our concerns and did NOTHING to make us feel any better after spending $3,000 with them. Of course, I shouldn't have been surprised. They were involved in some highly unethical dealing with the OutGames wherein they were trying to extort money from Toronto's gay community by forcing them to purchase membership in Team Toronto with the punishment being that you would not be allowed to march in the opening ceremonies of the OutGames. A TOTAL LIE !!!. RAINBOW HIGH should change their name to Rainbow Ripoff the Gay Community. They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of their position in Toronto's gay community. STAY AWAY from these thieves."
