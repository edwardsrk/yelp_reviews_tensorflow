b'Nice place.  Bad service.  We left after only being served cocktails during our 1 hour wait.  No bread, no salad, no service.  Never had a chance to try their food.  I mentioned it to Shannon a co-owner, she seemed not to care.  But they sure like selling drinks while you wait for no service.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu, we had no other choice.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We were offered cocktails 3 times, we still had cocktails yet they still tried to sell us more.'
