b'I am a big fish taco fan, and to my disappointment this place did not live up to the hype. Food was just average. Margaritas are just alright. The ingredients seemed cheap. Perhaps their fame comes from being the only Mexican restaurant in NoDa, I wouldn\'t dare to say it is because of their food. I had the blackened mahi mahi signature tacos and  "meh" is all I have to say. Best fish tacos? Seriously?? Only if you have low fish tacos standards.'
