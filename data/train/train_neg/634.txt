b"I went to Casa Reyna nearly four months ago after a several year hiatus.  I am not sure how to write this poor of a review because I've never done so with as much emphasis on poor as this one. I went with a group of people who all experienced lackluster service and agreed on bland tasting, watered down food. For a restaurant which, in the past, had an amazing reputation for their genuine, traditional Mexican cuisine, most - if not all - of my party left generally uninspired and unwilling to return.  Despite what appeared to be the same authentic, expansive menu (which excited me beyond words) we all felt the actual food (and slow, rude service) was a waste of our time and money.  I could go into positives vs. negatives like I feel most reviews should have but, to be perfectly candid, the only positive I can think of is the cool set up and decor.  Since this could easily turn into a catastrophically negative review on a public forum I will refrain from writing anything more than:  1.  I should have tried the true staple Nopalas (I have concluded that finding this on a Pittsburgh menu is extremely rare) and 2. Don't rely on Casa Reyna's previous reputation because, for whatever reason, things have dramatically changed (possibly explaining our terrible experience?) ... do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Local comparison:  El Paso Mexican GrillNot recommended."
