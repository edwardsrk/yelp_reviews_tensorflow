b'Poor services. I had reservation for dinner with my mom traveling from another country. As we were heading to there from Toronto downtown, we took Go Train and the Train was a little late. They did not contact us at all and cancelled our reservation. And when we arrived they did not show any apology and even a little arrogant. Well if the cancel-without-contacting-customer is your style, at least write down when people make reservation and I will call you if the train delay happend. But they did offer us another table. They had plenty vacant tables in normally busy Saturday evening (yes I totally understand if that is the service). And for food, I am a big fan of Italian food. But honestly, compared to tons of Italian restaurant in Toronto, the taste is not recommended. And if anyone is travelling Port Credit, there are many other better options to dine.-------------------------------------------------------------------------And after I post the review above, I received their reaction about the complaint as below:make me laugh.'
