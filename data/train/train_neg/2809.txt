b"I have to say Pho Viet has an awesome website! The menu has pictures how each single item looks like!! And I can tell you, the real things looks exactly the same! :)I was there for lunch on a Friday afternoon around 12 pm. The restaurant is not busy at all when I walked in and by the time I leave there is a wait for tables!Pho Viet seems to be frequented by people working in the area. The owners knows what their usual orders and that made them feel really welcome and special.I have the pho noodle with raw beef.. I ordered a LARGE... The soup is quite tasty, the main disappointment is the noodles not being fresh ones. The noodles they use in the pho are the dried varieties. There are tons of  noodles in the bowel though, for sure you won't be hungry after eating that. However, I just don't like that taste of dried noodles at all...There are not much ingredients in the noodles though... I guess when you order a bigger size, that's is just more noodles....not more meat.There are no lunch specials.They accepts Interac and Cash only."
