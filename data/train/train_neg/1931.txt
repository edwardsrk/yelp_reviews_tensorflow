b'I have never felt so let down as a costomer. My 7 month pregnant wife and I have been in a vehicle debacle for going on 3 weeks. We have been searching on Craigslist for 3 weeks and have had no luck. We finally decided to try a delarship.  We arrived at this delarship. We met with one sale man, who then passed us off to a drunk sales person who smell like booze and cigarettes.  We let him know that we were looking for a reliable, low milage, and at a specific out the door priced vehicle. We were then informed of a 2009 Nissan Altima. As we were getting ready to take the vehicle for a test drive we met a 3rd sales person. The vehicle drove well. Every one knows that purchasing a vehicle is a big decision.  After the test drive my wife and I let the sales person know that we would take a couple of hours to make a final decision. Prior to leaving we did meet with the used care sales supervisor who did know of our cash purchase intention. We left then returned a short time later. No welcoming sales person and watched 2 separate sales persons act like they did not want to have anything to do with us. Then the use care sale supervisor arrived with a paper with the out the door price of 4 thousand more than what we advised in the first place. We again told them that they knew our initial intentions and advised that there was a miscommunication, no reasoning from the sales staff to make things right. Pinical Nissan staff need advise in truth and honest business reputation. We wasted 4 hours of time we will never get back. This could have all been fixed if the would have just said that they do not have anything on the lot in outer cash price range.'
