b"Just a very average breakfast as we tried this place for the first time.Best part I was told was the sausage gravy.Smoothies - they must use a mix because my ingredients separated and both smoothies (even the one with kale ) were super sweet.Breakfast Burrito - not alot of bacon and that bacon was not crispy. Also the potatoes were overcooked and had the odd tasting skins on, so it became more of a mashed potato thing .Side of salsa - pretty uninspiring.2 Breakfast Burro's and two smoothies were $25. The middle size smoothie costs $7 and then they nickel and dime you on the burrito. It starts at $4.50, but it's extra ($1) for potatoes, extra to have it grilled, etc.Might go back and try a sandwich at some point."
