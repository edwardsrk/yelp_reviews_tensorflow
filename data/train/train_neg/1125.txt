b'We reserved a luxury strip-view room, and a couple days later i called to make sure we can get a smoking room becuz we r smokers. They said they reserved us a smoking room. Then after waiting in a 45-minute line (on a sunday, no less) to finally check in, they said we didn\'t reserve a smoking room and no smoking rooms are available. I said "so u guys can\'t guarantee smoking or non smoking rooms?" And she said no, we cant. Sooooo now we r stuck with a room we don\'t want. I suggest u don\'t stay here when in vegas cuz they can\'t guarantee if u have have a smoking or nonsmoking room!! How horrible is that? What if u have kids and r stuck in a room that smells like smoke? Just bad bad bad. Very disappointed.'
