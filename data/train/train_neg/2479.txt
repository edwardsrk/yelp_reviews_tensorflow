b"Basic Mexican fare, the prices are way to high for what you get, especially the margaritas (whose prices do not appear on the drink menu - red flag). I ordered the OG Margarita, it was  over-priced, too sweet orange juice that may have been in the vicinity of tequilla. The shredded beef taco left much to be desired - mostly lettuce, hardly any shredded beef. The carne asada burrito is HUGE, the tortilla is delicious but the carne asada was slighly sweet, and strange tasting, not spicy or brightly flavored at all (which to me are signs of quality carne asada). I had about 4 bites and didn't finish it. The waitress (who was very friendly) offered a to-go box but I couldn't bring myself to tell her I didn't want to take the rest of the burrito because it tasted awful. Would I go back - no."
