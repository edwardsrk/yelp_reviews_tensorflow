b"When will the food hype finally understand that BIG does not necessarily equate to GOOD? Primanti Bros was featured on TV for its enormous sandwiches, which in addition to a generous helping of meat also feature fries stuffed in between two slices of bread. That's what made them famous, that's what got them on national TV.The quality is above average, and as expected, the fries just add more bland carbohydrate-ish taste and additional calories to an already unnecessarily calorific sandwich. The meat itself is good quality, but also nothing to write home about.The short: overrated, nothing special, there are better sandwich shops to be had for the price."
