b'No bueno. Sales Associates was helpful and nice but the manager.... Rude, condescending, no interpersonal skills, and probably another 5-6 vulgar descriptions. The new Mazda\'s have tons of features and drive pretty smooth. My next car will most likely be a Mazda but best believe not from this dealership. The attitude the manager was giving is out of this world. Coming into the dealership, I expressed that I do not NEED to change cars at this time. I can, if I get a lucrative deal, but it\'s not a must. I am generally happy with my car but since I\'ve had it for two years, I CAN upgrade. I repeatedly expressed this to the manager, as well as the MOST I am willing to pay but it seemed that he thought it was "The Price is Right" while for me it was more of "Deal or No Deal". When he saw that I was pretty serious about what I was willing to spend, he got snappy and said that I\'m supposed to meet him half way. I don\'t know how HE does business, may be starting really high on a price typically get\'s him the amount he wants consumers to pay, but that does not work with me. Needles to say, I will be going to another dealership, just annoyed that I have wasted my time here.'
