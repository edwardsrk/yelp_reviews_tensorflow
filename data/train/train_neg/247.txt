b"This poor rating is for the guy that runs the headlight restoration. A couple of months ago I stopped by to find out the cost for restoration...he comes over and gives me this full load of crap that I need to have this service done to remain safe while driving at night and he just wanted to help; didn't want me to have to replace the actual lights because it would cost close to $200.00 and he could do the restoration for $150.00....I advised him we can replace the headlights ourselves for much less and that his quote was extremely high. I always wonder if these guys truly believe that woman actually fall for this tactic. I went to the Walmart on Lake Mead off of Rancho after leaving the car wash and they completed the restoration for $29.00....the headlights are like new and the service department was great."
