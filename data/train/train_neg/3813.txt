b"First time trying this place. Service was prompt and fast but food was below average. The grill salmon was too dry and the steak was not that appealing either. Sushi was only ok, not amazing but not so bad that you'll get sick from it. Most dishes I ordered from the kitchen were a bit on the bland side; stir fried noodles kind of reminded me of the lacklustre attempt of my university's cafeteria. Maybe I caught them on an off day, and it seems like this is a new location so perhaps they are still working out the kinks, but reality is, I most likely won't go back again."
