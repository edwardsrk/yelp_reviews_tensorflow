b"This place is a travesty. First of all, it's unclean. The cooking equipment needs a good scrub and the counter by the front window is so greasy the arm of my shirt stuck to it! Oh, and there were flies all over the place. Secondly, the cost is excessive. They want $12 for a four ounce piece of haddock [with chips]. That's about three dainty bites. They try to make the fish look bigger by pounding it thin, but that just means it absorbs more fat from the fryer. Thirdly, it's just not very good. As mentioned above, the fish is greasy and it's also overwhelmed by the batter. The chips are soggy, and as they cool down they seem to coagulate into a big, mushy ball of carbs. There was a highlight: the pop was really, really cold...good fridge, I guess. I was there several years ago, just after they opened and I seem to recall the product was significantly better at the time. It's basically a tired old place, and not worth a visit, even with the coupon we used."
