b'Canceled my subscription on Sunday 2/21/16 after yet another missed delivery.We only get the paper on Sunday and the carrier can\'t even get it right one day a week!If its raining, I am guaranteed a wet, soggy, unreadable newspaper because the carrier will not take an extra 2-3 seconds to tie the bag closed. If its dry, its a guess as to if I will receive a paper or not and where I will find it, in the road, the ditch, the neighbors bushes and on the rare occasion, in the driveway. Did not get the Thanksgiving day paper that I paid extra for either. It was just not worth the aggravation any longer.Complaining does no good, because you get the same scripted response each time-We\'re sorry, we\'ll talk to the supervisor and the carrier, we\'ll extend your subscription, blah, blah, blah.When I canceled my subscription, the apologized for their "apparent" error and wanted to know if they could speak with someone else in the household that would continue the subscription.That would have been the wife and she would have said Hell No!I didn\'t even answer them back. I am so over The Charlotte Disturber.'
