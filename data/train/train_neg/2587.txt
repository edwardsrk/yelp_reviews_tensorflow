b"Not worth the money. Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food. The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had. It made the $35 roll taste even worse. The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs.Service was good. Decor was very nice. It takes alot  for me to say these things about any place. Good luck."
