b'Absolutely worst experience ever. Produce is over priced, staff is rude. Probably not coming back here. Staff would not help wife with two toddlers. Got on intercom to ask them to move tables instead of asking in person them (tables were wide open and not used). And best yet, the Costco strawberries taste better. Avoid if you can.'
