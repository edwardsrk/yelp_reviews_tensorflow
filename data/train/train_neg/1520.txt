b"AVOID THIS PLACE...I went to this salon to get my legs waxed and I have never ever had such a horrible experience in my life. The waxing is done on the second floor and once I got to the second floor it was DISGUSTING; it looked like it has never been cleaned in years. There was hair in the sink and all over the floor; no tissues, no soap. The lady who is doing my waxing is talking to a another co-worker in their language which i thought was highly unprofessional. To make matters worse, I got such bad rashes on my legs which I have never gotten when I go to other salons. this place is not hygienic at all and the guy at the front desk (am guessing owner???) is just money hungry and doesn't really care about providing good customer service. I will never be going to this salon again."
