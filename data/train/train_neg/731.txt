b'I  have been there before and wanted to make a reservation for 11people for a graduation party, the owner calls me back to tell me he will CHARGE 250$ deposit!! What if our bill is 200$? People are paying for their bills so why charge me??? its not a party of 100! it is sooo ridiculous!! Even high end restaurants do not ask for this stupidity!!! DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!'
