b'Horrible experience. It was first and last time I will go there. Had to wait while the host was on the phone, then seated at a table where there was a couple with a small child needing a high chair that made the seating situation incredibly tight. Once we were seated, we had to wait another 10 minutes before our server took our drink order. Then we waited another 10 minutes before he took our order. Two other couples at the table had been sitting there for close to a half hour. Meanwhile tables that were seated after us were getting served. I was really looking forward to eating there. Guess I will find another tapinyaki restaurant to go to.'
