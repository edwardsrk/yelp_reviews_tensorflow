b"Look don't get me wrong for giving them onlyb2 stars... Maybe I should have given them only one start. Here's why, the food was delicious, I ordered the chicken best teriyaki with noodle. I enjoy the food was delicious, however the 2 star is because the lady at the counter doesn't make you feel welcoming to this place. She was not rude but she was not nice. No smile, no hi, no thank you.... I'm my book this is a no no.... Will I go to this place again??? Maybe.... Maybe not."
