b'I wanted to like this place. Shanghai 1938? What happened then? What does it mean?As it turns out, it means I make judgements based on the superficial and that I deserve what I get. We were 7 minutes inside the restaurant before anyone acknowledged we were there. I interpreted the dismissive wave we got to mean "sit anywhere, stupid," so we did. It took about an hour to get our food once we ordered it. I didn\'t expect a kiss on the lips or anything, but a "can I get you anything else" was in order. The food was unremarkable (despite my remarks about it at this time), and pricey. The chicken was mostly dark meat, which I dislike, and should have been cheaper based on the cheap cut. Incidentally, there was a refugee flight TO Shanghai starting in 1938, as it turns out. Now would be a good time for me to make a crack about fleeing FROM Shanghai 1938 in 2014, but you get the picture.'
