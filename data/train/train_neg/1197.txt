b"Too busy to focus on excellent customer service? Or is it because I'm a single sitting at the sushi bar that I'm not as important or profitable of the table of four? Tonight was the final straw for Ru Sans. My server was so neglectful and rude, the whole experience was ruined. I literally had to get up and go to the bar to get my bill because I only had seen my server once the whole time and I literally couldn't find him.  Did I want another soda? Did I want another sushi roll? Did I want dessert? Shame on you Ru Sans. After many years of coming here, I'm done."
