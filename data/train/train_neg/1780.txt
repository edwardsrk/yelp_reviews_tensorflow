b"This place made me want to vomit. This is by far the worst restaurant in Phoenix Arizona. There food tastes like vomit. I tried some of their nasty carrot juice and spit it back into the flowers they put on the table. This place is for old smelly people who have lost there tastebuds and don't even know what they are eating. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend UNLESS MY FRIEND WAS 100 YEARS OLD. Although if my 100 year grandma are here she would probably die because the food is so disgusting. This place is disgusting please shut down this restaurant NOW. Watch out Flower Child this girl is very upset."
