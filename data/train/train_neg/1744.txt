b"Restaurant was deserted. Almost didn't go in but did after 10mins of peeping in bc didn't want to spend too much money. Had to keep calling waitress for napkins, to order, for drinks. Came here with 6ppl total. Ordered 5 dishes to share. All we tasted was salt. A bit too oily, too. Seemed like a family business that is too comfortable like at home and not like a restaurant environment. Better off going to Panda Express bc it's good and you don't have to pay tips for bad service."
