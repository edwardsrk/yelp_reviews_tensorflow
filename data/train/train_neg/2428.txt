b'I don\'t know what people are talking about. Being from NJ I can tell you this is NOT good NY style pizza. It\'s the kind of pizza you get in NY and then never return to that place again. I tried the regular and the white pizza. The white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. The regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. I hope there are better places for "NY style" pizza in the area.  We left hungry. They also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.Also they weren\'t wearing gloves or anything. Maybe I\'m a stickler but I don\'t like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. Gross.'
