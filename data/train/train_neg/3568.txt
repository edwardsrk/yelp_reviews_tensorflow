b'I had this place bookmarked and thought we would try it out.  Sadly, disappointed. Service was very very friendly but the food we ordered not so great.  I ordered some Hawaiian pork with a side of macaroni salad.  The pork was overdone and crispy like it had been cooked before.  The mac salad was very salty. The hubby ordered a noodle bowl and said the noodles were not cooked and it was just okay.  Prices are not "cheap" for the value. We spent $30 and it wasn\'t worth it especially for the small servings.  There were lots of flies buzzing around, they did have some fans but it didn\'t help.  It\'s located in a rundown dirty strip mall-it could use a face lift.You do get some assorted Korean appetizers but none of them were for my liking.  I usually get my Hawaiian fix at other local chains with huge fresh helpings and I just didn\'t feel mine was fresh or tasty.  The place was very busy with many locals but this was just not my cup of tea:('
