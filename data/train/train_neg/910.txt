b"I went in there today because my normal spot was jammed. Never again. I even told the girl I was in for the first time, but just to get a fill. She didn't even speak to me. She filed my nails down to nothing. Couldn't even file them evenly so I had to file them myself. She filed them so hard and so fast, never even asked me if I liked the first one she did. She was awful. I learned my lesson for sure. Stick with the people that take care of you, even if you are in a rush. I shouldn't have tipped her a dime, but I've been in the service industry for so long that's not my style. She did a crappy job, and I paid for a fill and could have gotten a beautiful full set down the road for that amount. 0 stars. Go to LV nails. They take the time and treat you very well."
