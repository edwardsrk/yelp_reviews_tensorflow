b"This place is packed and the rounds take over 5 1/2 hours.  They do a good job of marketing, too good.  So that all the hackers and everyone under the sun show up.  I have no problems with hacking since we've all been there.  I do have a problem with no marshal regulating play, the starter not effectively staggering tee offs and people so drunk they can't even stand on their own two feet.  Consider this place a really pristine muni course, actually you're probably better off at a muni courseThis was a weekday, I heard weekends are a joke"
