b'this is the place to go when you are low on change in your pockets and just looking to get full on mediocre food. buffet style food, nothing super spectacular. food is what you would expect, beans, rice, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, taquitos, tamales etc. salad bar was far from a salad bar, and decided to stay away from that area, did not look to appealing so dont think i missed out on anything there.they do have servers walking around to get you things you need once you are seated which is nice. the dessert was better than the actual food. So yes i got full here but dont think i will be craving this place anytime soon and begging to go back.'
