b'Congratulations Bar Louie! Another 2* Review. Apparently, that\'s what you\'re aiming for. I went in tonight after I got off of work for a beer and some food, primarily because my brother had mentioned he thought the place looked cool about a week ago. Do not get it twisted; this place may appear busy on Wednesdays and any other day from 4-7 for one reason only, their happy hour prices are nice. Their bar staff on the other hand can make Stephen Hawking seem like he has a bubbling personality. I\'m a young single guy that eats out alone quite a bit because my work hours leave me eating past a normal dinner hour. I also worked industry for 6 years, so I know a bartender who\'s destined to work back of the house when I see one. My bar"tender" Crystal had zero personality, ZERO. I counted 5 singles and two deuces at the bar-top and she didn\'t engage one person in any conversation. Just pacing, making drinks, and complaining to coworkers. Was a Wednesday night around 7:45 a little too much for you to handle (nine people, that\'s almost double digits...)? Need a second bartender up there? Or maybe just some Midol? Didn\'t receive a "hello" when I sat down, a smile with service, or a "thank you" when I was leaving. But, I did leave 20% because I know the industry and I almost felt sorry for her poor attitude. The bottom of their receipt says "Thank you for your business. We hope to see you again soon." Maybe they should tell their FOH employees to try to make people feel like they actually mean it.
