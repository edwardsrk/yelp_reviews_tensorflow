b'Absolute WORST EXPERIENCE. I do love Hooters Wings, but won\'t EVERRR GO BACK HERE. Extremely EXHAUSTED I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE HOOTERS RESTAURANT. Unbeknownst to me it takes over 45 mins to get a 10 pc wings to go. So I thought. After waiting over 40 mins while sitting at the bar, I asked the hostess "does it normally take this long?". She replied "what did you have?" I stated a 10 pc Hot. She turned grab a bag and said "well we didn\'t know where you went"........ ummmmmm at the same bar you brought my water and receipt to. ON THE SAME CHAIR!!!!!! I asked for the Manager and Mikey comes up and immediately starts to explain how long the wings take.......I\'m looking really puzzled now. I\'m focused on the customer service aspect of being notified that my order was ready then handed a bag with cold wings. I verrrrrryyyyyyy calmly stated Mikey I\'m simply providing feedback on my experience and food takes time to cook I understand that, HOWEVER BETTER POLICIES SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO YOUR TO-GO CUSTOMERS.'
