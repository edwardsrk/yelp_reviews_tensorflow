b"I was relieved to read some of the other reviews of this cafe and see that I wasn't the only one who didn't feel that welcome. I've tried this place four of five times now and have just decided that though I want to like it that the quality of food and service make it a challenge. On my last visit I ordered a blueberry smoothie and ham and Swiss crepe. The crepe was perfectly fine but the smoothie was bland. The bigger issue is that the layout of the front order area is disorganized with things apparently placed randomly and the place overall doesn't come across as that clean. There was shelving in construction in the main order area with no signage to be cautious. In the meantime I noticed sandwiches being made with Wonderbread and have heard comments about pastries having come from Costco. I support small businesses in this area all the time but this one needs some quality TLC."
