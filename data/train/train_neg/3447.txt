b'There is a beautiful rotunda where you can casually have a cocktail and overlook the strip on couches.  However, there is a mandatory service charge for food/drink and the service was non-existant.  Thanks for bringing my lunch with no napkins and then taking 20 minutes to come back.  Like most pool parties, if you are not a big-spender they ignore you.'
