b'My wife, son and mother go in at 8:30 on a Sunday evening to bring back custard to our home. Clearly the worker was ready to go home. Three blendini\'s and two other items were ordered. When the blendini\'s were handed out, they were HALF full! When questioned, the worker simply said, "We fill them to the top and they settle." No solution was offered. Are you freaking kidding me!?!? That\'s the biggest crock of crap I\'ve ever heard. $25 spent for 5 items and 3 of them were half full! Absolute BS!!! Dairy Queen will sell you a large blizzard that\'s full to the top and cheaper than that. I will NEVER go back and I will NEVER send my kids or family there again. Awful!!! Wish there was a no-star option to pick.'
