b'Landed late, on a tight schedule... Got to my car. Filthy, inside and out.  It smelled like a hockey team had lived in here for about a week.    The client that I had to pick up made several comments about the vehicle. It was pretty embarrassing.  Upon my return, I called Hertz to get their address for the drop off location. They gave me the address to their corporate office, directed me several miles out-of-the-way before I caught on.  I rent a lot of cars... This was the worst experience in a long, long time.'
