b"In Regards to 5 star review which he posted in response to my bad review of him:1) obviously, I am not a valued customer of his. I wouldn't want to be!!! I never hired him because of his incompetent, reckless way of dealing with potential clients. The purpose of these reviews is to warn others of how I was treated so, as I stared in my review: they, the BUYER BEWARE!!! And2) what exactly did I falsify or what was inaccurate? 5 star fails to state one thing in my review of him that is inaccurate or false. He just says: I posted false info & I'm not a valued customer ( which I am glad I'm not) & to remove it. & 3) I have saved ALL MY e-mail correspondence between him & me concerning our dealings & how he failed to honor his terms & agreements.  I CAN PROVE EVERYTHING I POSTED IN MY REVIEW. HE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL OF ACCUSING OTHERS OF FALSEHOODS WHEN EVERYTHING HE SAID IS IN WRITING. Also, I will make those e-mails available to anyone from YELP that would like to see them & also, I will make those e-mails available to any potential client of his that can't make up their mind as to whether  or not to hire him & would like to see them first to ensure my veracity.To me, 5 Star is only digging its hole deeper as I only posted this review on Yelp. Now, I intend to go to FACEBOOK , & other review sites I know of , & keep posting these same reviews as I am more confident than ever that the public needs to be warned about this 5 Star Movers.  Your move, 5 STAR MOVERS."
