b"Good breakfast meals. Gluten free options. However, service is horrible. My mom and boyfriend came in way before a couple of other tables and we received our coffee after everyone else. I guess you need to be a table of young girls to get your waitor's attention. On a Saturday around 1pm, we waited to be seated for about 15 min."
