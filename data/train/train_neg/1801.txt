b'It\'s a shame that I have to write this review due to the fact that I\'ve been here on other occasions and been happily serviced. But this one instance has ended my wishes to return. My mother and I have been going to this location for a couple years now with both my nephews and brother and just us ourselves as well and haven\'t had awful experiences as those who have reviewed so negatively below. We used to love this place. The owner seemed knowledgeable and somewhat friendly, but we never needed to pester her with too many questions so I can\'t say we saw her "mean" side as many have stated before. But my grandmother, mother, and I went in on a Tuesday a few weeks ago and were so excited to paint some Christmas presents for a few women from the church. We had been planning this day for about a month and had everything ready, even the coupon for my grandmothers first painting experience we had found on their website. The same website we found their hours, all listed accordingly. But, we were sadly mistaken when we as arrived to their location. The door was locked and unlike the hours stated online, it had said that we\'re closed on Tuesdays. Tuesday\'s? Really? Such a random and pointless day! At least update your website so that customers can plan better. We decided to go to "As You Wish" on Gilbert and Germann instead and had a far better experience we had hoped for. I am sad to end our business here, but something better came out of it.'
