b'Is it me or does it seem like Trump spent the majority of his budget on the exterior golden windows and lobby. Guestrooms were NOT impressive enough, after walking through the amazing lobby and  front desk area. Very dissapointed. For looking like a gold brick from the outside, the guestrooms are dull and lifeless.After staying at Wynn and Encore, Trump tower seems like a slight downgrade. I mean its probably fine if im a 65 yr old woman. Service here is seriously BELOW average. The Valet failed at washing my car, when they PROMISED to do so. They expected me to roll around Las Vegas Blvd in my dusty vehicle, dirty from my 9 hour drive!! super pissed!! At least they offered me a free towncar to and from The Strip. And later that night, they finally detailed our suv.Also......One of the girls at the poolside cafe, accidently, charged my boyfriend $200 for suntan lotion instead of $20. So glad he noticed and had the manager refund the 180$ (which took over 25 minutes of valuable tanning time.)Some good things i liked about Trump was the food at the Poolside cafe. yummy. The gym was very nice too! I had a great workout.I also Loved the decor.... in the LOBBY.. ONLY... Prob wont be back to the Trump International... unless i have a free offer. Encore is my HOME'
