Come on. 15 dollars for chicken strips fries and a drinks and the employees can\'t smile at one guest and have a good night....dont ask for ranch the give a bad attitude oh and the manager Javier can give a rats ass you yoh complain. "Oh we are busy." You have 4 people in line seriously you are busy??? It take 2 seconds instead of saying here you go how about thank you have a good night with a smile. Is it that hard....really smile....these people are beating their hard earned money the least you can do is smile and say have a good night. Mediocre food high prices with bad attitudes......'
