b"This review is for Katerina. We had an email dialogue before I came in for the cut. I told her I wanted to cut off 1.5 inches max. Very clear. I came in on the day. She was very standoffish and rude. And she looked at my hair and said because I already had layers. I had to cut off closer to what she held up which was 3-4 inches. Otherwise it wasn't worth her time. Such a waste of my time!! Are you kidding me? I even sent her photos of my hair so she knew exactly what she was getting into. I told her what I wanted and she just wouldn't listen. Walked right out. Very rude would not recommend. Went right around the corner and went somewhere else."
