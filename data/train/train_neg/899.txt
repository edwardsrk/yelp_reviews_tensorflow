b'Poor service. I ordered something to go. When I received my order it was wrong. The young lady proceeded to tell me I ordered wrong. They attempted to correct my order by not making a new one and adding regrilling what was messed up. After paying $20, I then had to pay $1 more dollar for salsa. WOW. Food tasted less than average.'
