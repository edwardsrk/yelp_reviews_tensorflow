b'Service department was horrible. The service advisor performed the intake and tries selling me on getting new times from him. Bragged that he could match or beat any other tire shop in town even if it\'s by a few dollars! He then said except for Costco because they "don\'t sell real tires". I said what the heck does that mean? He said the tires Costco sells aren\'t the same even though they look like the tire everyone else sells. Told him he needs to stop telling that story because he\'s making himself look bad. He then says he will keep in touch with me throughout the day and keep me informed of their progress. At 4:45 I call and leave him a message! He finally calls back and says it\'s ready. Not even an apology for not keeping me informed or taking 9 hours for what was supposed to be 4-6. I get there and he doesn\'t go over any of the paperwork and when I ask him where the quote is for the break job he blames the tech forgot to add it to the paperwork. Tells me he will call me the next day with a price... still no call. Won\'t be going back!'
