b'Today my wife and I visited this place to try the food as we have an upcoming party. We were looking for a new Indian place to serve yummy food for our guests (expecting about 100-120 people). Our experience today was awful!!!! The food was terrible. The chicken tandoori was raw, the chicken dum biryani( it is not even called a biryani), curries had no flavor, the desserts were not good( the fruits in the mango custard were not fresh, the carrot halwa( I don\'t want to call it a Halwa. Very bad!!!)). It\'s good that we have tried the food before ordering for our party. We have ordered at "Kabab palace", "Pastries N chaat" and "Chennai Fusion Grill" for our previous parties and the food was never a fail. We love those places. This time we just thought we will try something new but we absolutely regret going to this place. We will never recommend this place to anyone( friends, family and colleagues). Finally, decided to go back to our old favorite spots.'
