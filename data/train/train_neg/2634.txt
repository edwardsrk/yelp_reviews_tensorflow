b"This is my third time here.  We thought we bring our friend here, who is visiting from out of town. We signed in at 7pm. Place is busy!  But there were only 2 names ahead of us (party of 8 and a party of 3). Great, I thought!  Hmm, not so much.  We waited one hour to be seated.  Somehow, I saw at least 4 - 5 tables sat before me.  A party of 12 just miraculously was written in ahead of me and then sat. And the lady who signed in after me got bumped down when the server just added a name above her.Now, I worked in a restaurant before as a host. I know that when you do something like this it causes frustrations and disgruntled guests. Even if this was happening, for whatever reason, I don't think that it was right for the servers to leave the list out for us to see. While we were standing there we saw the server scratch names off the list and insert other names.Then if that wasn't enough, after we sat down we specifically asked for our order to be made in a weigh that is typical of other Korean barbecue restaurants. And the eyes and the stares that we got from the employees was horrific. We had to continuously ask for certain things and by this point the restaurant wasn't as busy so it couldn't have been that they couldn't accommodate these simple requests.  Rather, they just don't care for the customer at all."
