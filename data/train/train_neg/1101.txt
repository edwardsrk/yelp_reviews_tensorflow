b"I'm not 100% sure but I think they have 6 types of nigiri and 6 different rolls. Compare that to the dozens that most ayce places have and the conveyor belt just becomes a gimmick that doesn't work. It's boring. Service was fine, food was ok. Nothing special. They need to work desperately on the variety of what's on the conveyor belt. Otherwise, it's just not worth the money when so many other place have so much more variety."
