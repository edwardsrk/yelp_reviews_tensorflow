b"Went because I had a groupon.  I'd say skip it.  Really didn't learn anything useful.  Went over basic chair dance.  Then pole dance.  Would have been better to concentrate on one or the other and practice so u could actually put it in use.  Preferably the chair dance because everyone has a chair but not a pole.  Drink upgrade was not a drink really, little alcohol if any....so if you go, skip that too.  Take a bottle of water.  First class was cancelled so I waited 1.5 hr for next class... Comped me one of the non-drink-drinks....useless.   Left my Maui Jim glasses in cubby, called for them to check and get them for me.  Said they would call me back, never did.  So that's $200 glasses MIA....Spent more time watching the stripper pole dance than learning anything.  How could you not watch and wish you could do that stuff??  Then she had a tip jar... Seriously...???? Basically a glorified workout class if you really put the effort into it--nothing more.  Expensive lesson for me and 3+ hours of my life I'll never get back..."
