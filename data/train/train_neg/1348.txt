b'Food (2/5)The food was sub par. I started with the red lentil soup which was probably the best part but nothing spectacular. For my main I had the seafood pasta which was something I could have made better myself. The noodles were from a packet, the scallops were tiny (about the size of my fingernail) and there were literally only 2 shrimp and they tasted like they had been in the freezer for too long. The creme brule was okay but it was cold.Service/Atmosphere (1/5)We booked this place for an office Winterlicous lunch (aprox 15 people) and since we didn\'t have alot of time, we had asked if we could preorder so the food would be prepared but Victor assured us that  everything would be quick. This was not the case. The food came out slowly, and often times one group would be done their course before another group had even started. Water was not refilled and no one came to check on how we were doing. We were at on the patio which had been closed up for the winter but it was raining and a few people were constantly getting dripped on. They also did the "bait and switch", something I had heard of before for winterlicous/summerlicous but never experience. Upon arrival, the entire winterlicous menu had changed from what was posted. On the original menu they advertised things like tiger shrimp in the rissotto or salmon fillet, but when we arrived we were offered pink shrimp or tilapia. To top it all off, we were charged 20% auto-gratuity ontop of tax which we were all unhappy about.'
