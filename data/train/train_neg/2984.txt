b'$4 for a tiny bottle (not a real size bottle) of Diet Coke (no refills). Mild salsa tastes like bathroom cleaning solution / has the aroma of urinal cakes. Overly expensive menu with Mexican food atrocities. Who puts pickled veggies on a taco? Gross. The carne asada meat was good, the tortilla was good. But stale chips and everything else that makes Mexican food good is missing. Sorry guys, not worth your time or money.'
