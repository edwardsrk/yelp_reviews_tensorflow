b"I've never had such a bad meal in this area and I've lived here for 2 years. My wife ordered the salad and it came out wet and devoid of any flavor. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and it had so little beef I contemplated sending it back to the kitchen. We both took most our meal to go. We'll have better luck dressing them up ourselves.  Highly doubt I'll be back unless it's for katsu. However, Katsuya is in the area so why even bother?"
