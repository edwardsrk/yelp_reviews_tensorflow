b'The closest Vons aka Safeway to our hotel when we were in Vegas for the 2012 Olympia Expo and Show.Ummm, it\'s ghetto and there\'s NO bakery section. WTF?! You walk in and the only baked goods they got goin on is the little display counter in the front left side of the store.No self-checkout stations. Boo!And the produce didn\'t look too "fresh" to me.Only plus side to this store is that it\'s open 24 hours.'
