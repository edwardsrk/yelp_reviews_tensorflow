b"Pretty terrible. Reserved a room with king bed. Was given a room with 2 double beds. Tried to call and get the mistake corrected and was just put on holdIndefinitely. Tried to go to the front desk at 11:00pm and the front desk completely ignored the main line and waited on people who i guess were more important because they didn't wait at all?! Definitely would not stay here again!  I've worked in hospitality and this was the worst I've ever seen. Room is ok but when you reserve a king you expect a room with a king. I guess that is a crazy concept at this hotel."
