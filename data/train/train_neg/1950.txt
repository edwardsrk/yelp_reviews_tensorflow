b"this has to be one of the absolutely worst mexican food restaurant that I have been to. Came in starved. Had the guacamole ($10) hmm, thought quite steep for portion, BUT IF it was good quality, portion size doesn't matter, this  just tasted very watery - and the tomatoes on top were mushy and old, which didn't add much to the dish. This also was on a thursday, not beginning of week. The comp nacho chips and salsas were very nice. we had ordered fish tacos, and were told that people come there specifically for them. I have to admit, they were actually the worst I ever tasted, and I love fish tacos. Is it because we came in around 9pm? The fish was so limp, greasy and, just not at all fresh tasting either so not sure when it was actually prepared, earlier in day? The cole slaw had no taste or flavor at all, or crunch of any kind. Chilli relenos looked great and were fine, but then \xc2\xbc of the order was just onions.  Bottled beer was good, but margarita was so very watered down. This was just a big disappointment overall. I suggest trying some of the other mexcian restaurants in the city, where freshness and quality play an important role in the food served"
