b"After coming to Vegas for five times now, Flamingo hotel has the worse customer service I've ever seen. After multiple calls for service request because our shower wouldn't work, they lied and said that they did not have any other room available so we would have to wait for engineer to come to fix the shower (when? Who knows). No one ever came to fix the shower and they finally switched us to a different room (no room available, huh?) They do not care whether you are unhappy with your stay or not. A girl named Teddy is extremely rude and should not be working in customer service. Also, the manager here could care less if u complain. So please don't waste your vacation and find a better hotel to stay at. They do not even deserve one star. Please save yourself a headache and do not stay here."
