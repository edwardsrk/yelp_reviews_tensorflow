b"DO NOT GO HERE!Avoid this place. When I went here to be seen there was only one person ahead of me and it still took about an hour for me just to be seen. Once in the back I waited about another half hour before a doctor entered. He spent approximately five minutes with me, but only because I kept asking questions. If I hadn't, he would have left the room within a minute of entering it, literally; no hyperbole here, folks.After being seen I waited I waited another 30-45 minutes for my prescriptions and paperwork for my employer. The one good nurse there gave me my paperwork and even though she said the paperwork for my employer was within the reams of paper it was not, so, of course, I had to go back and get it which meant more waiting.This place operates at a snails pace and the staff, from the receptionist to the physicians, were rude and  generally unhelpful.  DO NOT GO HERE!"
