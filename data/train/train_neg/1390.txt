b'I will never go back or refer a friend to this place. The customer service is the worst I\'ve every experienced in Vegas (and I\'m a local). Extremely unprofessional and I was working with the store OWNER! I found this place on craigslist which advertised it with a $5 off coupon. Checked out the website that was linked at it says for an iPhone 3gs to be unlocked and jailbroken for $20.I went into the store at they try to tell me its $15 for unlocking and $15 for jail breaking. Totaling to $30. I showed them that THIER website says $20. He tried to tell me he can "meet me half way at $25, but I can\'t use the coupon"...excuse me?? I asked for the owner, "wookie", but he doesn\'t come into 1pm. This was so unprofessional. I drove 30 minutes from home to come to this place, so I decided to just let them fix it.  It was 10am, when they open. I asked how long until its fixed, they told me the tech guy does\'t come in until noon. Why open at 10AM then? Its a phone REPAIR shop and the person who repairs doesn\'t get in until noon? I left.I called back later several times that afternoon to talk to the owner. He didn\'t come in until 3pm. Wookie told me to come in and talk to him to work it out. I asked when he will be in tomorrow, he told me "all day". The next day I kept calling to see if the owner was in. He didn\'t come in until late that afternoon again. When I got there the owner told me the same thing and wouldn\'t respect the prices on their own website. He kept talking to other customers mid-conversation. He gave me a lot of attitude and finally told me, "pay what you want" almost yelling t me. I am a soft-spoken young woman. By no means was I trying to fight with the owner. And even if I was, the customer should come first. I will never go back. This place is a joke.'
