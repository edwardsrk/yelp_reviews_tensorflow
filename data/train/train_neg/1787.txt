b'Pray you are not in an automobile accident and the party at fault has Erie Insurance. I was driving home from work. As I was making a legal left turn a lady with Erie Insurance ran a red light and smashed into my car. She admitted fault. This was Monday night. It is now Thursday and after many calls Erie Insurance has still NOT provided a rental car. My car is not drivable and was our only means of transportation. As a result, I have missed work and may face disciplinary action up to dismissal. Fortunately, yesterday a coworker drove 30 min out of his way to give me a ride. Erie Insurance, you do not choose to do the right thing.  At this point, we still have no transportation. Why Erie Insurance, why!!!'
