b"I have given this place a lot of chances, but my past few experiences have not been good at all.  The sushi smelled rancid, but I thought it was just me.  It made me sick!  So, I tried with just their chicken lo mein.  Tasted good, but again, make me ill.  I also think it's overpriced.  The people who work there are really really nice, but it just seems like their food is not fresh."
