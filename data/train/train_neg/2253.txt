b'I\'ve been here before and the food was good, overpriced but good. Today, however, I sat down for breakfast that I was really looking forward to but was left completely unsatisfied. I ordered an omelette and it was bland. No salt or seasoning, bad texture, the side salad was very sad. The only redeeming component was the coffee. The service was poor as well. The "server" seemed irritated the whole time. I will not be returning.'
