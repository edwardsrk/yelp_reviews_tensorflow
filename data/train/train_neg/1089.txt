b'Bad service. We were super patient as we waited almost 20 mins for our waitress to bring water.....water! She then proceeds to bring water for only half the table and it took another 10 mins to bring water for the rest of the table. Two tables that came after us got their food before we even received water....water. Sad to say our first experience here is beyond disappointing.'
