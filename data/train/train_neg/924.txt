I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the sign on the door was wrong so I knocked several times and pointed to it. For ten minutes. They aggressively avoided eye contact with me and looked at each other, laughing and chuckling. As if I'm the crazy one for knocking on the door when they should be open according to the sign they put out on their door.If you want bad service from all around incompetent and rude people, Bacus Bros is the place for you."
