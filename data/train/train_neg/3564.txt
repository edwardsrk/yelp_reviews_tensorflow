b"Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is.. it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment."
