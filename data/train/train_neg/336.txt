b"Bandwidth Violation is all I got from them.I have a family website with little to no traffic.  They took down my website.  Customer for over 10 years.  They refuse to refund my money.they want me to take down about 20 pictures, cause the pictures are causing their servers to breakdown with all the bandwidth.   Who are they kidding?I'm fighting for my 6 months they owe me and they are refusing to work with me.  On conversation number 6 now.  Must be really low to work as a tech there.  There is no way my 20 pictures are taking down their server on a family website that is not advertised on google."
