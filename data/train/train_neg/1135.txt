b"My friend from Toronto that now lives in Victoria recommended this place to me in an email about a month ago. I was driving down Hurontario and saw it and thought about his email and figured I would stop in. I walked in and did not know that it was a buffet style restaurant. The woman that took my order let me know that I could still order something from the menu since lunch buffet was over and dinner buffet didn't start for a few hours so I did.I ordered the vegetarian combo meal which came with 2 spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, and Chow mein noodles with mixed vegetables. All I have to say was that this was the worst Chinese food I have ever had.The rice had no flavor and was extremely dry with dried up cauliflower and carrots, the noodles were seriously just ramen swimming in chicken broth. I don't eat meat and chicken broth was not something that I was looking forward to tasting. I got the food to go and didn't realize this bad food till I got back to the hotel. I was not about to drive all the way back to the restaurant. So I tried to eat the rice and the spring rolls and threw the rest of it in the trash. Yes, I felt bad about wasting food, however I couldn't bring myself to sit there and actually eat it either."
