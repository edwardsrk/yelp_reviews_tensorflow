b"I've just moved to Phoenix and I attempted to use my chef's table birthday certificate that is a yearly tradition for me. This year, I was unable to use it because I was dining alone and apparently I needed to order 2 entrees to use my certificate. The certificate does not clearly state that 2 meals need to be purchased. So not only did I have to pay for my meal (which I didnt expect), but i left my entire entree at the restaurant because I had to get to work. They offered to hold it for me, but i didnt have time to get back there. So basically I paid $35 for an entree I did not receive. So frustrating. Guess I will have to find a new tradition. On a happier note our chef, Kyle, was fantastic. It was the best show I'd seen yet. Thanks Kyle!"
