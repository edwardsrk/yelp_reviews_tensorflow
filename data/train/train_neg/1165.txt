b'Came here after spending a Friday night at Savoy. We talked a lot about shawarmas so we decided to check this place out after seeing their sign.That $9.99 for 2 shawarma deal is lunch only. Normal price is $6 each. Chicken was meh. And the guy was very stingy with the meat. Not worth it at all. I ordered samousas afterwards (2 for $3.50) and those were meh too.Cheap? More like a rip off. I have had cheaper and tastier shawarmas before.'
