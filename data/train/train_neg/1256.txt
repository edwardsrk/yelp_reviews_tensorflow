b"Servers can't tell a real driver's licence from a fake one. Refused service for my daughter who is of legal age to drink and bluntly embrassed her by telling her the ID was fake. She tried to show that the birthdate on her government Health Card was the same (She knows a health card's can't be used as ID).  Eventually, the server spoke to a manager and offered to serve, but without compensation for the embarrasment. A free dessert, discount.  They need to be smart serve certified to understand how to determine real ID from fake. Maybe, asking for another piece of ID as well to confirm the legitimacy of the birthdate. Food is overpriced."
