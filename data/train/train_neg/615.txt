b"So I went to Zupas today and ordered the half salad and soup (their special) Hungarian Beef Stew. What I got was more like vegetable soup. I did see some strands of what may have been beef, but definitely did not get what was pictured. Very disappointed!! Good thing it is only seasonal...Of course it would not do me an y good to let them know, because they do not comp you anything. For instance, I ordered one of the creme brulee's a few weeks ago, and halfway into it, there was a cluster of fresh rosemary. I sent an email to their company and they replied they would let the store manager know... did not offer for me to get another or comp my money back.."
