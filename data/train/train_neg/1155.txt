b"While the service is great the items (different products and supplies) are overpriced and trash. Shame.Update: Funny how I get a response to my review from Ben H about my review (the only review this person has ever done) Telling me I'm wrong in my review. ROFLMBO I am not fooled one bit. Ben H is one giving a review on a business he works for or owns. Which is a no no big time. Then lashing out when someone who's been in the dump gives an honest review.  IMHO if you're looking for a good deal check out Goodwill, Salvation Army, Savers or a garage sale. The items will be cheaper and cleaner.Copy of response load into photos."
