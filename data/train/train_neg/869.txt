b'This place sucks. No line cuz they let everyone in. Can\'t move. The floor is nasty. People tackled by security taken away by cops. I showed ID and was told to throw away my water. No problem. Threw it away and walked in, other guard grabs me strongly by the arm and pulls me to the other side of the rope telling me he didn\'t let me in. He was standing right next to the guy who did. So confused I go around a pole and the other guys acts like I\'m stupid flashing me in like "hurry up". Wtf? I go in the floor is nasty. My shoes SUCK to the floor. The place is overcrowded. People acting stupid. Girl RUNS out to vomit. An employee not taking our order grabs the card, he\'s not helping is at all or even knows what we want and my friend says hey, what\'s up? And the guy helping us finally says HE WORKS HERE. Ok... but why is he taking our card? It\'s just shady and nasty and they herd you like cattle. It\'s ridiculous. We had one round and went across the street. Way better. Better music, better drinks. I can still fee his grip on my arm. It\'s excessive. I\'m not one of the other drunkasses barfing outside. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Literally anywhere else would be better. They should really just  erbally tell people what to do instead of grabbing them. What the hell. NEVER happened before and I go to way better clubs in the San Diego gaslamp. Like do not touch me. Unacceptable.'
