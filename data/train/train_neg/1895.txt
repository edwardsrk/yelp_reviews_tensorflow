b"We were honestly disappointed. When you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? You can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. Seriously SO weird. I ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. The pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed."
