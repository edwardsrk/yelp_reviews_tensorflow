b"Drove 40 miles from the west valley to check out this bakery and wow was I ever disappointed.  I was hoping to see something similar to Karsh's Bakery that closed its doors in 2014.  Not even close.  There was hardly anything even nearly tempting to buy but most of all the prices scared me away and so did the customer service.  Really unfriendly and even rude!  Will never bother going there again!  So disappointed."
