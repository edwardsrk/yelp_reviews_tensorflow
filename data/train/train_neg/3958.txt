b'Definitely a nice space. Open. Well appointed. Tried it for lunch. Two of sat at bar. Crowded but we got there at 12:30 after the rush. Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. Beer came. Very short pour.  When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left. Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back. Nice, but seems pretentious, over priced and under managed.'
