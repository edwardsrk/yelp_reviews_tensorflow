b'Slipknot concert 8/29/15 - was in the lawn, the music sounded horrible. The sound would get quiet and soft occasionally the guitars would get turned up but then down again. I could talk to the person next to me with out yelling (this is a bad thing) why would you hold a concert in August in Arizona? Thank god for the water  cannon that would spray the crowd down every now and then. My expectations did not meet my reality, the bands performance was great, fix the sound. I went to listen to some loud heavy music what a bust. Oh and direct parking better as well!'
