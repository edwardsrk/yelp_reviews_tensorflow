b'Ever since South Point opened, I have desperately wanted to like it. Truly. I just can\'t. It\'s the "motel hotel" of LV casinos, ranking slightly higher than Terrible\'s. From the car park to the layout of this "locals" joint, I don\'t care for it at all. There\'s always a funky stench. I\'ve had food poisoning in the Cafe. The restaurants here aren\'t good & barely decent. And yeah, that goes for Steak & Shake, an over rated, get what you pay for, dump. There is nothing about South Point that would inspire me to return, or want to return. The decor alone is plain & unappealing. It\'s very boring. If you like understated, and find GVR, M Resort, or Strip corridor resorts over the top or extravayou might enjoy South Point. They definitely cater to a different group of guest.'
