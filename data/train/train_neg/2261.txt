b"The parking is easy and plenty of room But the place is run by ASSHOLES We made reservations and when we arrived we where 30 min early. The park only had a hand full of spots occupied, yet they made us park on the back of lot and wait until 2 o'clock. Then there were 7 other people at also had to wait so now at 2 there was a line that took 1 hr to check in. Also the park is out back of the hotel but they don't even offer a shuttle ,so at night you have to walk back through a dark parking garage in not the best part of town..."
