b'I gave this restaurant only two stars.  The food is mediocre and under seasoned. The Yorkshire pudding, although gigantic, need some salt in the batter.  The tea service that was brought to the table was dirty and we asked for another.  The tablecloth was also sticky.  They need to clean a little more. All in all....not the greatest experience we have had.  Dirty restaurant.'
