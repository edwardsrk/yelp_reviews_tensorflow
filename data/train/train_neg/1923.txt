b'I went in to exchange a 55" TV that I got no longer than 2 weeks ago. I was told that I would get a refund because they didn\'t carry it anymore. I got home my fianc\xc3\xa9 informed my that we had a factory warranty, so when I went to retrieve it I was told my bank card had to be swiped a 3rd time. I contacted my bank and was told target never reissued the funds back onto my card, after I put Emily (the rep whom was helping me) on the phone with my bank i was told that I had to wait 3-5 business days. I didn\'t wait 5 days for them to take the money off of it. Longstory short I have to wait to make my claim to the manufacturers due to targets horrible customer service. I forgot to mention that the first time I went in an elderly group of people were raising hell, because of a five dollar coffee maker and was accommodated for their trip. I asked on my third trip what was my accommodation and was told I would have to come in again. I don\'t want to use the race card but I definitely think its because I\'m African American with dreadlocks that I received such a hard time.'
