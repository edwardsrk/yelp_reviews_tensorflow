b'First of all, after waiting almost 20 minutes, I had to leave my table to ask for a glass of water. I ordered crab fried rice with no egg extra garlic. I also explained, I have a allergy to egg. When the plate arrived, it had lots of egg. I explained to Ann, the order was incorrect. Ann was so unbelievably rude. She tried to convince me that the egg needed to be in the plate even after I explained for the second time, I have an allergy to egg. Even after correcting my order, I waited  20 minutes after I was done eating for  the check  to arrive to my table.  Not once did they come by to pick up my plates so I just put it in the table next to me. Jump is the name of another employee there and honestly he was very professional and apologized then tried to encourage  me to come back. Unfortunately, first time impressions last forever and I will never come back. Becomes of the nice guy named Jump I  gave a two star instead of one.'
