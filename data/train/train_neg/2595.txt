b"I ordered the fettuccine, after trying to figure out the menu, sigh.  I've worked in several Italian eateries/restaurants so I'm pretty familiar with  consistent and quality Italian food, which this was not. The noodles were rubbery and I can tell you that's from being over cooked and left out too long. Very disappointed. The carrots were fine but that's not saying much. I didn't finish my meal.  The place was clean which is good, the music was great, but really, it's the food that's supposed to speak volumes about your reputation and it definitely didn't. The manager Debbie, was very courteous and pleasant. But I won't be going back."
