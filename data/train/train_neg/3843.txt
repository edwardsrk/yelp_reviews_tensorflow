b'This is my first night here... Room is not as bad as i thought it would be. The service is slow but gets done. I was gambling at the blackjack tables and the dealers were nice. This is the only con i encountered but needs to be addressed. I ordered Johnnie walker black and the lady brought me something else.  I asked it to be changed nicely and was brought back the same exact drink and she said she said she saw the tender pour the correct drink.Now... im not a fool and i have been drinking the same drink for 5+ years.  I was thoroughly dissapointed when i asked the drink to be changed and was brought back the same exact one i was given,  the one i gave back to her. This is one of the lowest customer service experiences ive encountered for a while.  Shame on you flamingo employee for having such lousy service.'
