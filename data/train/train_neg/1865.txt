b"The food was not good I order 2 bowls with ex meat for both paying over 24$ The meat wasn't cook through. Me and my boyfriend both got sick. I called to let them know the lady ask me if I wanted a refund or to remake the food. I went back 2 days later for my refund. I would never eat at a Chipotle  again."
