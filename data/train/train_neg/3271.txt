b"I was staying at the Hilton, and didn't want to go out in the heat, so I decided to have a Scotch and eat at the bar. I had the chicken Marsala. I never order this dish, but my wife does and it's usually delicious. Not so for Nook Kitchen. The sauce was too strong. The chicken was tough. The Glenfiddich at the bar was superb, though."
