b"Place has gone way downhill in the past 6 months. My favorite dishes I no longer order, as they are greasy and bland where they were once fresh and bursting with flavor. Still have a couple things I like, spicy chicken fried rice and thai hot & sour soup are still good but I think it's time to finally look for a new thai place to get delivery from."
