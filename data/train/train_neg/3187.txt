b"They only take cash. They do not have a children's size/price. They are expensive. If you do decide to splurge, you may find they are out of the flavor you want but it's too late because you pay first. Yes, it is delicious (although I think their gelato is too sweet), but customer service does not stop there. Oh, and their bathrooms are disgusting."
