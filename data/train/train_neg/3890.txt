b"it was just... okwe got a pitcher (14 bucks on thursdays) of mill street which was great. for food we got hot burgers and spanish paella. the beer was good, the sweet potato fries were yum, and the food were fairly cheap... that's it. the burger was served with what tasted like day-old bread that's thick as a brick.. kind of killed the whole burger cuz all we tasted was the bread. the paella was just not.. anything special. it tasted of chicken, rice, tomato, and a bit of salt - I had much better flavored paellas in the past, this was not super impressive. maybe a good spot for drinks and fries. food you can skip."
