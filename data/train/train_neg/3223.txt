b"First of all let me start with the positive. The PT specialists are wonderful. They got me up after a total knee replacement and taught me how to walk again. They were encouraging without be pushy.  Now the bad. The doctor I had was called Dr. D. He was more worried about the pain meds than the patient. I was in a lot of pain and he kept decreasing my pain meds after a total knee replacement. I heard that he was retiring but I would definitely talk to the doctor there before I decide to go there. Now I'm home and my surgeon is giving me the right pain medication to help me continue with my rehab."
