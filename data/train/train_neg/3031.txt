b"Meh, I've had better experiences. It was a beautiful day, so we wanted to go somewhere close to enjoy both the weather and Sunday foootball. We were able to enjoy both.However, the food and service is what givesthis place a poor rating. I ordered an Aslaskan benedict with hasbrowns. It wasn't as tasteful as I expected, the benedit was dry and the hasbrowns were cool. The service... slow. Our server took awhile to greet us, so we had to order with another waitress. After ordering, we had to wait a good amount of time for our food, which as I mentioned earlier, were cool. The Alaskan benedict was rather dry, I wouldn't reccommend it. My boyfriend got a burger with hasbrowns, which were also cool.Finding our server to get the check was also a challenge. And waiting on her to get back with our check was another challenge as we were in a hurry to make an appointment. Overall, I won't be coming back."
