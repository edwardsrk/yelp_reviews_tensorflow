b"Terrible. Tried for the first time and was extremely dissapointed. I got the phoking pho bo and it barely had any noodles in it... like a couple strands. Mostly bean sprouts- how cheap can you be with rice noodles??? Paid like $10 for this and was not even full obviously. Went over to the Mexican place next door to make my lunch more fulfilling for a better price. It's like I basically donated $10 to their cause."
