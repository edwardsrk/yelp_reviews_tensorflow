b"I really wanted to like this place because it's in a great location and has a good selection on the menu. As a vegetarian I was impressed with the fact that they offered more than one non-meat entree, including a veggie burger, a portobello burger, and an egg salad sandwich. The problem was that the veggie burger was almost inedible. They had deep fried it, which was certainly unexpected. Deep frying it robbed it of flavor, made it unhealthy, and made it scalding hot and crunchy. The bun it was served on was brushed with oil or butter and was ice cold. It would have been nice if they had grilled the veggie patty, which I assume they do when someone orders a regular burger. Service was lacking. The server, who came from behind the bar to take our order acted like we were bothering him. Despite there being almost no one else in the restaurant at the time, we never got a refill or were asked if the food was okay. I had to flag him down to finally get our ticket. We left half the food on our plates. He never asked about it or offered a take out box, which we didn't want but would have shown some consideration. Nice try but disappointing."
