b'Rarely do I come sonic but only when i have coupons. The little kids they had working on the night of 9/23 were loud and disrespectful. I had to repeat my order 3 times stating i had a coupon. Only to have the child raise their voice at me like she was a man. Chick needs to learn some respect and listen to the order the first time instead of giggling and acting like a complete uneducated idiot. Never coming here again and nor will anyone i hang around with.'
