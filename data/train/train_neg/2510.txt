b"They are focused on the wrong thing. This was the most rushed haircut I have ever had. Quality was very poor. Haircut and shave in about 20 minutes. Yeah you can guess how it looks. The shop was filthy, hair everywhere. Not just because they were busy but because the didn't clean. There was hair in places that was clearly there for months. Gross!! They need to focus on being clean and giving good service and worry less about how long the wait is or how many jobs they can do in a day. Slow down and hire more people!!2 stars because they were really nice guys. Otherwise it would be negative 2 if available."
