b"After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B."
