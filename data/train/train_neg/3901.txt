b'I found myself in possession of a gift card to Best Buy resulting from an errant purchase, so I was forced into shopping here. I came in knowing exactly what I wanted: a blue tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone. I thought this should be a simple purchase, but I underestimated the lack of competence of the Best Buy staff.Things started well enough. I walked in, asked for Blue Tooth keyboards and was directed to a certain section of the store. In this section, computer keyboards greeted me, and although some were wireless, it wasn\'t what I had asked for. I proceeded to search around for several minutes on my own, but then decided to heed the voice of my husband in my head and ask for help. Dramatic interpretation of events that followed. "Hi, I am looking for a Blue Tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone."Best Busy Associate: "I don\'t think they make those.""Yes, they do. I have owned one in the past."Best Buy Associate: "Why would you want a keyboard with your iPhone? The screen is so small.""I want one. I know they exist. Can you just tell me whether or not you have them?"Best Buy Associate: "Um... let me get on the computer and do some searches. What is it exactly you need again?"  [Aimless searching on computer commences.]Best Buy Associate: "Maybe he can help you?" [points to someone else]"Can you help me find a Blue Tooth keyboard?"[Blank stare from second associate. Aimless computer search continues. I just walk away.]I eventually find the best option for what I need, which is really the only option they carried. My previous keyboard, which was better, came from Radio Shack. I never thought the thought "Radio Shack has a better selection," would run through my mind, but it did. The combination of rather unhelpful, uneducated staff and limited inventory left me one frustrated consumer.'
