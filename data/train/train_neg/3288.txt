b"Visited this place last week, and was fairly disappointed. Very small seating area, and the food was mediocre. I had their Greek salad and spicy crab soup. The crab in the soup was clearly imitation. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Only positive about this place is that it's fairly affordable during lunch hours. Don't plan on ever going back!"
