b"This place by far has the rudest employees I have seen in a long time! So unhelpful, made it seem like I was such an inconvenience when asking a simple question.. I first called multiple times and the phone just rang continuously, so I made the drive down there from glendale and asked to speak to a manager and she was busy! Yes that's what the gentleman told me! I will never be back there!! I will also spread the word of how terrible their customer service is! If you do not like working in that industry find a new job!"
