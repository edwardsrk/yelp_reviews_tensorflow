b'I actually saw this show twice because my in-laws insisted that they take us to see a show. On the spot, I racked my brain for shows my husband and I both haven\'t seen and for some reason,  the name Mystere came to mind. Maybe I should have said Ka... The day we were supposed to go, I said to my husband, "What the hell was that show with the giant ugly baby called? Was that Mystere?!" After a moment we both realized, oh no, it was. And we both just totally forgot what it is was called. The show, obviously, wasn\'t really all that memorable. The second time I saw it, I still enjoyed all the acrobats but the side show attempt in comedy was still poor in my opinion. Some of the acrobats were amazing but I didn\'t really get their whole theme and felt it wasn\'t all that grand and surreal like how Cirque shows try to be. Just odd.'
