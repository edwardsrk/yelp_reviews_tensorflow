b'There is truly nothing special about this "smoothie" shop. The ingredients do not seem fresh, the prices are high (typical airport pricing), but the shelves are rather sparse and oddly stocked. I only stopped here because the line was nearly empty with only 2 people ahead of me. A smart water was around $5. And the naked smoothie close to $6.'
