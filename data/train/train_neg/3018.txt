b'The decor is very nice, and the staff is nice and attentive. $4 an oyster, $5 a shrimp? LOL The hummus tasted.. not great. The salad was good, but nothing special (blood orange salad). The raw bar sampler was okay, but the ceviche was not fresh and made my boyfriend want to leave after tasting ... yikes.. I was embarrassed I chose to go there. There are lots of awesome restaurants downtown and this is not one of them.'
