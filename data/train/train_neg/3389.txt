b'While the food is excellent and the drinks are what you can expect from a martini bar, the service is the worst in Cleveland. My wife and I stopped in after a Cavs game on a Friday night to get a couple martinis and maybe an appetizer. It literally took 32 minutes before we even got a water, at which point we proceeded to get up and leave. We will not be returning here and never recommending it to family or friends!!'
