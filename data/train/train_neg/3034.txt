b"Not good.  Freezing inside. Horrible service. Won't be back.I felt the pho was not salty enough and instead was sweet.  I was also aware of some mal-odor that was coming from the meat or the broth? Maybe rancid meat? The floors were littered with table scraps and even worse, stuck to the chairs and table like it's been uncleaned for days. I felt like I needed a Hep. shot after that meal.  I do agree that the broth was murky but I didn't mind that so much, it was the fact that it smelled rancid and tasted sweet. No, thank you, Pho Little Saigon.  I'll continue to get my 24 hr Pho from Kim Long across the street."
