b"This place changed hands, and my son was so upset at the changes he cried. They took down all the superhero decor, removed the bouncy ball machine that my kids loved, and no longer allow the kids to make their own pizzas. They also dont have the coloring contest anymore and they changed the way the cheesesteaks were made, which was a big reason to come here. These were all the things we loved about this place - POOF - gone. I was super sad about all of this. My best wishes to the old owners, wherever you are. My best wishes to the new owners too, cuz this was one longtime customer who probably wont be back. Moral: if you buy a place and take over, dont make too many changes. You'll lose your customer base."
