b'Travelocity is definitely not worth your time. Incompetent representatives, false advertising, sneaky flight details, bad customer service.  You\'ll be given the run-around if you need to address an error that they have made. When you ask to speak with a manager, they tell you to contact their "Consumer Relations" department. Then all you get is an auto-reply email stating that they will get back to you within 7 days.  Of course they take the full 7 days to get back to you, only to tell you that they need more information. I will NEVER use travelocity again.I bought what was detailed as a ONE STOP ticket and after I purchased the ticket, I got an email confirmation that states that I purchased a TWO STOPS ticket! I would not have purchased a two-stop ticket with a 3-year-old. The whole company is a SHAM. DO NOT USE TRAVELOCITY. Better yet, use them for the list of rates for all of the airlines, then when you find out which airline has the best rate, go the that airline\'s website and purchase directly from the airline!'
