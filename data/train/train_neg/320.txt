b'This company has horrible customer service! I got Moxie to spray my house. They assured me that their chemicals were safe for pets and children. Two days after they sprayed, my cat got very sick. She passed away a few days after. I have contacted Moxie and they are forcing me to pay the $150 cancelation fee. They KILLED my cat and I am expected to pay to stop this service. What an awful company!!'
