b"Meh. I was here for a private party. It's a large space. Plenty of room to move around. The stage area was alright, but far from good. There were plenty of bars, so getting a drink was always easy. The beer selection was meh. The food spread was pretty awful. I can't say how it would be here on a typical night. However, based on my private party experience, I would go in with low expectations."
