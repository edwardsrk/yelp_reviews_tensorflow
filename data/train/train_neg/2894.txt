b"First time customer and very disappointed.  First tried to up sell to the detail and explained came with all the items in $39 package I was looking for.  I indicated first time there so just the  Platinum package for now.  Once that was settled the attitude seemed to change.  The folks inside were very nice, asked about how long and told 30-45 min, so went for quick walk.  Came back and saw my car in bay area being worked on.  Waited inside for a bit and finally went up to the front desk and asked don't they call numbers or have listed somewhere to know if done.  The guy indicated busy today, otherwise would come in and announce, so walked me out and told me to give ticket to one of the guys.  Gave me car keys and started to walk back to where my car was parked at back, when got to my car turned around the guy was gone.  I got in and oil everywhere from the leather cleaner, smelled terrible.  My trunk wasn't vacuumed.  Started to walk back, but thought forget it I had it done on Saturday and even yesterday my daughter was asking what is that smell when she got in. I certainly didn't expect a detail job, but would have expected my trunk clean and not all kinds of oily stuff streaked across the trim inside.  I ended up taking a rag and cleaner to it myself and will have to go vacuum it later today.  Only reason a 2 was because at least it was somewhat cleaner and my tires looked better.   I will not go back."
