b'Thirty one minutes waiting in line observing dysfunction and chaos behind the counter--unfortunately all too familiar with this location. When I complained to the manager about the excessive 31 minute wait for an 8 minute meal, he barked back at me about his 150% employee turnover. Perhaps it says something about the management. One employee behind the counter was joking "free sandwiches at Panera" to reduce the line and his work load. I!d encourage all to take his advice. The Chipolte product is great . The service, a disaster. This place needs a major reorganization.'
