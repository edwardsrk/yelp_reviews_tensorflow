b"I was craving a bagel sandwich but was pretty tired of TH's, so when I saw this place online I was eager to try it out.  The other reviews didn't hurt either, so I made the effort to go there.I cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  Salt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.   The presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.There is a sign on the wall announcing a change in management, which I could possibly have forgiven their lack of knowledge of menu prep if the changeover date wasn't listed as 2010!!The people serving me were Japanese, and I suspect they don't know anything about Jewish deli at all.  They really should stick to what they know best, and that isn't deli any way shape or form.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
