b"What a total disappointment. There were flies surrounding our table so my family and I couldn't fully enjoy our visit. The waitress was totally clueless. She took our order to another table that was also a family with the same amount of guest (I guess all black people look alike) when they told her that wasn't their order she tried to bring the food to us but it had already been passed out and placed in front of the other family. It took forever for the food to be prepared and even longer for the waitress to bring it. The appetizers came out with the meal which took a total of 32 minutes and no we weren't offered the standard hush puppies while we waited nor did our drink order come out before the meal (and it was incorrect as well). Terrible visit."
