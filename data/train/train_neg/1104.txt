b"Bad customer service, blaming the customer for the terrible upload they did to Sierra which have a feature that slows down everything. My laptop is useless for 48 hours on top of the 3days from the upload. A whole morning wasted in trying to fix the problem with a very rude Genius who didn't even bothered to say goodbye. Time is money for some people, not for the one that assists you."
