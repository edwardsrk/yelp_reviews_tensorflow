b"In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches."
