b"I was really looking forward to this meal. I'll keep it short. Me and my wife got the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu $395/Person.Some of the dishes had olive oil drizzled on top which was not pleasant because we started out with La Cerise and La Coriandre which both tasted like olive oil. Don't get me wrong their olive oil was really good. I'm not there to taste whats behind the olive oil flavor. The scallop dish I had way better else where. It wasn't seared right, a very light sear. I didn't get this dish Le Caviar. Just so simple. Besides the green asparagus was the best steam asparagus I had. But it's just asparagus with caviar on top. Well this was the best dish of the night Les Crustac\xc3\xa9s. Reallly gooood. The bread and butter was really good. Everything else was just so so.Presentation was really nice and pretty but in the end food must taste just as good. Which was not.I thought this would be the best meal of my life. I was wrong. I had better at no star restaurant."
