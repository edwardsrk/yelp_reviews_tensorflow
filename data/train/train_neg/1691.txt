b'From the moment we walked in we should of just left. It took 5 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge us with no wait. When we gave our names, mind you it was just me and my husband her response on wait time was, I\'ll let you know. The restaurant was half full but it took 15 minutes to seat us. Waiter started off great took our order right away and the. It then went awry again. People say after us were getting there appetizers and drink refills. Waitress comes over and says there was a problem our order was never sent to the kitchen. Mistakes happen I get that no harm done. BUT it took 25 minutes for them to acknowledge the mistake as me and my husband sit there twiddling our thumbs. She puts the order in but gets our appetizer wrong. It was nachos... So 45 minutes happen and we get our appetizer and she tells us the manager will be over to talk to us and discount our meal. Never happened. So we get our entrees and finish them and have to sit another 15 minutes after staring at everyone else getting service when we are ignored. We finally got a box from a different server we flagged down as ours was no where to be seen. Ours finally makes her way over to us and gives us our "discounted" bill. They took off 5 dollars. I kid you not. Never going here again.'
