b"5 stars for the doctor he is a good doctor. Zero stars for Kenia the front lady who has no idea what customer service is. Its a shame that for staff like her they have to lose patients. Of course they don't care because its not their business they just want to get their check. Horrendous service. I just wonder why people that hate customer service work in that environment smh. Don't even bother calling for an appointment because they will hang up on you or just leave you on hold for 25 min. And if you're lucky they pick up the phone with an attitude. Great!"
