b'The food was pretty good, but the weird looking blonde guy behind the bar was quite strange. He was in the parking lot, smoking, when we arrived and he starred at my fiance and as we entered, he then followed us in. We sat on the sushi bar side, this guy was the bartender. He continued to stare at me, very noticeable by myself and my wife. He also made it a point to walk past our table several times, for no apparent reason. When we were finished and leaving, he followed us out, got in his car and left.'
