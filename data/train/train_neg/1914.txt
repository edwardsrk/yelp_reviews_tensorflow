b"This place was one of the worst dining experiences my wife and I have had since moving to Phoenix. We had a reservation for 7:15pm and didn't get seated until 7:30pm. The waitress, when I asked about the deviled eggs appetizer, was rude and just continued acting that way the entire night. No surprise here because of how lax our waitress was, but our appetizer went to the wrong table, and the manager apologized, which was the only redeeming thing about the experience, sadly. But then our entrees took a really long time and were subpar at best. Short ribs were overcooked and seasoned poorly and the combo of everything on the plate just didn't make for a great bite. Too heavy. Wife said scallops had an odd smell and taste and were too earthy. Fried potatoes and chorizo with scallops? Not the best complement. Again, too heavy. I wouldn't go back here."
