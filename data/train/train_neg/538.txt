b"They told us we had 20 mins to order because they were closing. We ordered. Food didn't arrive until 30 ish mins later because they were tending to the take out orders. We sat there for a very long time...hungry. It was after we got our food that the waitress gave us the rushing vibe. I know they were aware that they were taking a really long time to give us our food, so why not give us some naan bread to help make the wait a little easier? Customer service really lacks here. If you're here I'd recommend going to another restaurant that's nearby."
