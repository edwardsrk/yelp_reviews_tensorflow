b'We chose this venue for our wedding because of the discounted rate. On the day of the wedding the place looked great, but there is no professional service whatsoever. The "coordinator" was no where to be found and guests were actually wandering the building and coming to the bridal suite to say hi instead of being ushered to their seats! It was a free-for-all and no one was in charge. Careful with this place too because they started my 2 hours of open bar BEFORE THE CEREMONY! Therefore, a good half an hour of open bar is thrown away since guests are watching the ceremony, not waiting at the bar. I thought that was really shady. If you are a control freak, RUN AWAY! Gloria is scatter brained and none of the process goes as she says it will.'
