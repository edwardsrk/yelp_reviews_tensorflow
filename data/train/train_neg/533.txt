b"I have been looking for a traditional Mexican taqueria, so I search on Yelp and found this store which has a taqueria in the back, so I drove the more than 15 miles to get to this place just to be disappointed.I had to admit that I've arrived one hour before closing but, that shouldn't be a reason for their poor quality food that they sell there.First of all they pre-prepare the meats and the condiments early in the morning so by the time when I got there the food looked really old and nasty, the condiments like cilantro,onions,salsa and limes are all placed on a salad bar for all the customers to pick their favorites,the drawback of that is that by the time when I got to pick mine everything was mixed up salsa on the onions and the cilantro and the limes were old,very unattractive look. So I didn't start looking at the place until after I have placed my order and just by looking at the meats and the salad bar I had to throw my food in the garbage and walked away from that place. I thought about saying something but, what were they going to do?Give my money back? Or replace the tacos for others with the same kind of meat? I didn't even tried so I just walked away and never coming back."
