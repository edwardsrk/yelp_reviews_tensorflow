b"Nearly every delivery time is not met.  Drivers come an hour or so late.  Some call, some don't call to let one know they are not going to deliver the groceries.  Nearly every order has 10 percent of the times not delivered, but those items are in the store when one goes there to pickup items not delivered because you need them for the recipe.  I would drop this internet grocery delivery service in a heart beat if there were some competition."
