b"Not my type of nail salon. It's the day after my nails were done and they're peeling and chipping!! I was also asked for my address which strikes me as strange and now I regret leaving it. I went in with a Groupon voucher and left completely disappointed but happy that I didn't pay the full price which is outlandish for the work I had done. worst money I've ever spent!!!"
