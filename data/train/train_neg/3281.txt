b'I stopped by Bamboo Bistro because I used to go there a lot when it was Pho Hoang, a nice little family run spot. My girlfriend told me she liked a BB that she went to so I decided to try it out.For me, the pho experience is all about the quality/taste of the broth. When I got my pho tai the broth was only warm not piping hot so it was hardly "cooking" the rare steak. The chicken wing appetizer just looked scary!I\'ll keep going down the street to Jenni Pho.'
