b'The only reason I put down 1 star is bcz there is no 0 star. i would even put negative if I could. today my husband had to take yellow cab and they made him wait for 3 hours because "the distance is not far enough. I don\'t make money out of this trip" When he called they even lied to him that someone came and called him but he never answered. he was holding the phone the whole time to make sure he wouldn\'t miss the call from the driver. I constantly had problems with yellow cab but today is the last straw. I would never ever use them again, Uber is so much better in price and customer service.'
