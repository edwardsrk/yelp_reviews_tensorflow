b"Not impressed. Prices are high, which if the food is great, I'll pay the price. But this was not of the places... I got the non spicy fried egg, bacon, hash brown quesadilla-salty, super fried doesn't mean tasty, and even the bread was trying to be fancy. Again not impressed, won't be going back, even if it was a free."
