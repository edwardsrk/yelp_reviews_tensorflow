b"Got take out sushi today - half of the avocado was brown - like really brown.  If this is a sushi place you would think the products they use in AVOCODO sushi would be fresh.  Or at least call the customer & say that the avocados aren't good - would you like something else.  Not just send the product on it's way - my hubby picked it up - so not sure if he even looked at it before taking it.  I would have taken one look & refused it.  Got all the way home & it just looked gross - feel really bad cause my little daughter was the one that wanted it .  We picked out the good ones & tossed the rest.  Now - saying this to the manager - he didn't even offer a refund or an apology - second manager did - & offered an apology which the first manager didn't even offer.  Really disappointing.  Feeling sick  with stomach pains - which is what prompted me to call.  Very disappointing."
