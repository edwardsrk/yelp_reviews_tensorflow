b"First off this is my first review on yelp. I don't do reviews. That should mean it's either really good or really bad for me to post this to the public. Unfortunately this is a really bad one. 4 stars? Wow! What are people thinking? This place is horrible! Salad was old and full of water with nothing else really. Whatever that white sauce with cucumbers in it I believe was nasty. I'm assuming it was a type of taziki sauce. Chicken is fine if u like unseasoned meat just grilled. I expected more marination of sorts. Basically no effort except cutting chicken and putting it on the grill. My girlfriend bought two meals. I had the chicken kabob. The yellow rice is completely tasteless. I could buy one of those instant rice packets at the store and been more satisfied for .99 cents. Not sure how this place is still in business. Wouldn't go back for free. I would not recommend it to anyone! If you think this is even half way decent food from anywhere, well I feel sorry for you and I should make you a meal that would easily surpass this place with just about zero effort. Just to let everyone know I had no expectations of this place good or bad. I would be happy to help the owners for free to provide a better product. I work for a very large hospitality company that serves all kinds of food and different types of experiences. This has to be one of the worst places I ever ate and paid for it. I'm a food and beverage manager in Vegas who is from Chicago and let me say this food needs a lot of help. Save your money. Really, if you need help I'd give my consultation for free if wanted. In fact I wouldn't mind a refund if possible. Sorry:("
