b"This cab company ripped me off then tried to double charge me today Feb. 23.  First,  the ride was just over $33 for an 8am ride from the Venetian to the airport. Not happy, but paid by CC. I knew the fee and a tip brought it to about 40.  Then the cab driver rushed into the terminal and said the CC did not work despite the reader saying my payment was accepted. I told him I'm not leaving the terminal and I will call my CC company to see if there is a pending charge.  He kept insisting and I told him to get the police while I'm on the phone with the CC company. He then left. The CC company said the charge is pending.  Will never use this taxi company again on my next trip to Vegas."
