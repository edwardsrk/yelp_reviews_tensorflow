b"I can only assume the lunch chef is not quite up to par with the dinner chef because wholly salt lick was it salty. I spent most of the time I was eating deciding if my sandwich was supposed to be hot or cold as it was room temperature. I can say I do believe it wasn't cooked right based on how ill I felt the rest of the day. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was a cool place and our waitress was awesome!"
