b"The staff are hit or miss. One or two of the guys are nice, the rest seem to absolutely hate it there. I (used to) grab slices from here because I live close and it's cheap, but I found every second time I did, I got really Ill afterwords.  I can only speak for the veggie or cheese slices, but if THATS giving me food poisoning, I'd be really afraid of touching any meat product here. Something is wrong with the food in this place.  You're also surrounded by mirrors inside, and I often find myself looking into them asking myself what fuck I'm doing eating there again."
