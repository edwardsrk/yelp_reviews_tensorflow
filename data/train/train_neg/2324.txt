b"The atmosphere of local is very fun, which is why it gets more than one star.  This is especially true in the summer when the windows are open.  It makes for a great day drinking spot.  The drinks are also pretty good.Now to the bad.  The food is average.  I have never heard anyone I went there with be impressed with their meal.  I got a burger on my last trip there.  Ordered it medium rare and it came out dry and well done.  My wife's breakfast sandwich was soggy and lacked flavor.  It's the little things like this that are annoying about a place that has potential to be great, but just misses the spot.  The service is always slow and mistakes are made often."
