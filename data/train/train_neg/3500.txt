b'I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011.  I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience.  On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.  I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.  Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.'
