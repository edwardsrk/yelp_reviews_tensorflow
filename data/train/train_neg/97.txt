b"I grew up going to this hotel and wanted to try and start the same tradition with my family and son.  Boy oh boy has this hotel gone downhill....was so disappointed.  There were many problems:1.) Check in took 2 effing hours, we didn't get into our room until 2 am2.) Be careful, you don't want to sleep on the side where the Cromwell hotel is...their rooftop club will keep you up all night long :(3.) This hotel is no longer family friendly, it's more fitted for 21 year olds.4.)  Was super sad about their new Go Pool crap, use to be open to all guests, now only 21 and over and more of a club now with super loud, annoying music5.)  Families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.6.) DO NOT try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere7.) The rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job8.) Elevators are scary9.) The buffet used to be amazing...it's terrible nowI was very disappointed and sad that we will no longer be carrying on the family tradition at this hotel...can't believe I wasted money there.  I wouldn't even stay here if it was just my friends and I, terrible.  So mad my son had to endure this icky hotel."
