b"We got a couple of pulled pork sandwiches that came with one side each. We got beans and potato salad. Very dissappointed the pork was so dry and the buns were semi hard. After dousing them with 21/2 packets of sauce it wasn't bad. The sauce was good but the sides weren't anything special. I can get the same at walmart. For the $ price I would go someplace else. $20 for everything. I guess the que for 2 would've been better. It will be long time before I come back."
