b"bop is so over-the-top ridiculous. the prices are outlandish for the very little fabric you're actually buying. i've been in there a couple of times and feel like i've entered an alternate world: a land where it makes sense to spend $80 on a tube top covered in cheap rhinestones, a land where the employees believe customers should be discouraged from buying their clothes by sending them sneering glares, a land where they forget their neighbors are pizzeria uno and fair trade coffeehouse. ugh."
