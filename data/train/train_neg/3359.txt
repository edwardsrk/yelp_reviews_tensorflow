b'This location has been open several months now and all I can say is keep trying. The only thing they are consistent with is inconsistency. Some days the drive-thru is quick. Some days you can wait a half hour. Going inside is a joke. They hardly pay attention to you much less take your order. They have around 8 employees in the morning and 7 of them are handling the drive-thru only. The one handling the walk ins is trying to restock & start fresh pots of coffee. The day I went inside, I was met with a tons of attitude. For 6:20am and a $7 coffee, drop the attitude!'
