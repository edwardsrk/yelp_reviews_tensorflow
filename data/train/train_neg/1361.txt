b'I went there on a date and got there before the live band on a Saturday night. We waited for a table to clear and as soon as one did we grabbed it. A waitress comes and tells us that we couldn\'t sit there because that was someone else\'s table and it shouldn\'t have been bused. She acted like we stole the table but actually the busboy cleared it. So we moved to the bar and after spending over $80 on drinks and appetizers the big bouncer came and told us we had to move again. Why? so the "girls could dance on the bar" Really! Well why did they have bar stools there. I gave them the finger, left and said I would never go back. It is not at all like TK\'s song...'
