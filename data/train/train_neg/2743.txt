b"Would not recommend.  It is usually a good price due to being off strip, but you are TRAPPED there.  The cabs are virtually non-existent after 5 PM.  Forget going out to a different club or hotel after dark.Rooms are pretty nice for the price - elevators seem to be from the 1930's and take forever - stay on the 1st floor if you want to save time.Definitely not worth the money unless you don't have much."
