b'I have to give this business a bad review because of safety. The netting was horribly maintained so therefore there were many holes. I was not playing and I was shot in the shoulder. The paintball missed my 4 year sons face buy a few inches. Also the employees did not enforce the barrel plug rule consistently. There where many children running around in a unsafe environment. I hope they resolve these issues soon.'
