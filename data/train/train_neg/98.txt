b'A lot of the 1 star reviews seem to be about the portion size of the meals and I have to agree. But my main issue was the service. When our server came to take our ordered I let her know I wanted a tempura roll and a bowl of the ramen and her response was "That\'s it?" First of all, what would be the issue with ordering that for two people plus drinks. I find it extremely rude to question the lack of portions for my order. There is a warning about the volume and the vibe of the restaurant before being seated. My boyfriend and I thought there would be loud music but the restaurant MC was more annoying than entertaining. I would definitely not go back.'
