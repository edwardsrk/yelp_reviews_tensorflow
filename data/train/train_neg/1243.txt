b"This place is a 4 star if you're maybe in your 20s, but if you want a nice meal and being able to have a conversation, this is not it. The music was just way too loud. It feels like it's trying to be a night club more than a restaurant. The food is decently okay; definitely not the best and nothing to go gaga over. The waiter we had was incredibly rude and went off on us for ordering something they didn't have. I mean, seriously? We spent 800+ dollars with a mandatory 22% tip and this is the service? Never coming back again..."
