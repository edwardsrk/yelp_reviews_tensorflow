b'Got carry out from here on a road trip back from Cleveland. Had to wait 5 minutes after our burgers came out to receive our milkshakes... We were asked why we still sitting at the bar area when we already had our food. Server was annoyed when we explained we still needed the shakes. Manager fixed it but the server should have cared more since I had already tipped her on the to go order when I ordered.'
