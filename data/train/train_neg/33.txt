b'We regularly went to Marche Bacchus for many years. The French food was excellent without being too expensive. I used to eat their filet mignon. They changed their chef and booom, no good anymore. Because we love the ambiance so much, we still went and had their pate, french fries and their wonderful crispy baguette/brea that is the foundation of French food. Now they changed their pate, taste like the one at Vons, they do NOT have their crispy bread anymore, but a mushi bred like in any cheap restaurant. The American owners who bought from the French owners DO NOT UNDERSTAND what French food is. The ambiance is stil great, the service is amicable but the food remind me of Mary Calenders. Shame on you for not maintaining the quality of food we had when you took over.'
