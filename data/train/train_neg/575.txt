b"Me and my husband decided to try this out for the first time he had chicken pho I had rare pho . With that being said it will be the last time I ever go there I've never had it where the cinnamon was so overpowering that I puked when I got home. They were very polite not the cleanliness of places but they were very nice their food I can't say the same about it was gross and believe me I love my Vietnamese soup. So beware unless you like an overpowering cinnamon flavor don't eat it. We also had their spring rolls not the greatest at all. So will not be going again."
