b"I'm not too sure about this Petsmart anymore. Especially the lady who helped me in the aquatics section today. She was on the y'all side, skinny with light brown hair and looked to be Caucasian. First of all, when I was originally going to ask for help, she was the first in sight, but she immediately ducked away and avoided eye contact, so I went to the cashier and asked for help with pick out the goldfish that I wanted. Well guess who came to my help... the First Lady... She looked totally unwilling and was even having arguments on her headset and laughing. This isn't so much the part I'm upset about. What irked me was the way she handled the fish. MY FISH. She scooped out the first fantailed goldfish in a fast swoop, then when she got to the second (a black moor) she ended up pinning him between the net and glass, pinching the left side of his tail fin. Now it has a sag... which it didn't have before. Roughly tossed them in the bad and was sloshing them around when writing the sku. I kept quiet the whole time as the fish were still in her hands and not yet my fish. Fancy goldfish are slow swimmers. The fins in fish are also a bit delicate. None of this was needed. I wish I knew her name. I'm so glad I got these guys out of there, but can only imagine how else they've been treated. That person is bringing down the rep of the store. I've had better experiences than that in the exact same store. I'm disappointed tbh"
