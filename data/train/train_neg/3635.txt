b"I have been here a few times already. The only reason why I end up coming back is because of out of town friends who want to eat here. The Anime character decor is cute and the waitresses are unique with their outfits, but those are the only good things going for this place.The food needs a lot of work. I have tried:-Shoyu and Miso Ramen: The broth was very bland and the noodles were too hard. You know it's bad when you feel like you can make a tastier bowl of instant ramen at home. -Gyoza: tasted like one of the frozen brands that you can buy at the grocery store. -California Roll: it was okay. I mean, it's hard to screw up a California Roll right?-Furikake Fries: interesting concept, but the furikake does not stay on the fries. They might as well just serve regular fries only. -Honey Toast with Ice Cream: probably their best menu item. Nice presentation, tasty and not too sweet. The service also needs a lot of work. Other than our very first visit, the servers have been horrible. We either always have to ask for drink refills or we get nothing at all. On our last visit I had to ask for napkins because they forgot to give us some. There were 9 of us at the table. Really?! Also, don't even think about ordering sliders because for some reason, they take forever to come out of the kitchen. Parking? Nonexistent. If you really are curious about this place, I would say go once to see what its about. If you are looking for a decent place to eat, don't waste your money here!"
