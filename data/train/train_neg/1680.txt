b'Despite how nice a business is, if it\'s unethical then it deserves 1 star no matter what.  Not as if this is the nicest hotel I\'ve stayed at, the bed is very comfy though.The unethical part is when I ordered a double bourbon on the rocks at the bar, and walked away with a $30 bill.  I inquired the next day about the price of the drink with the Restaurant Manager, and her response is "That sounds about right."  I said the menu upstairs has a cocktail with the same bourbon listed at $14, but I didn\'t receive a cocktail, just a double bourbon ($14 per shot).  Her response?  "Oh that\'s because the cocktail only gets a half-pour."WHAT!!  You mean to tell me this hotel not only exorbitantly over charges for alcohol that already has a high profit margin, but you are selling cocktails for $14 that don\'t even have a full ounce of spirit in it?  That is called shady and wrong.  Good job Hilton.  I hope this review makes you lose the money you are trying to save by ripping people off.'
