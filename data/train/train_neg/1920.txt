b'I have accounts at both Chase and Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo is a complete nightmare.  Every time I go into this branch I have issues.  When first opening up our accounts the ATM cards we received did not properly line up to our accounts.  Once we got that settled, our online banking did not work.  It took four trips to the bank to get everything working okay.  Now, many times when I use online banking the site times out on me going from one page to another.  Trying to pay two bills took me logging in three times.  RIDICULOUS!!  Hate this bank and will be moving my accounts elsewhere.'
