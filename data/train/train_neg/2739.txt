b"Excellent location right at Yonge and Eglinton. I love the idea of a place that does one thing, but does it really really well. Unfortunately The Contruction Site isn't one of those places. The restaurant feels a bit too 'fast food chain' and doesn't feel like that much effort went into it. I wouldn't mind that if the sandwiches didn't start at about 6 dollars for a grilled cheese sandwich without taxes which IMO is waaayyyyy too steep for what is basically two slices of bread with cheese in the middle that is heated up. I ordered mine with tomatoes (a dollar extra)  in it which was a big mistake. The tomatoes took a longer time to cool down than the cheese in the sandwich and some bits of it were disintegrating (probably from being pressed while being grilled) I would expect them to use better quality cheese for the price and was a bit dissapointed with how it tasted. All sandwiches are served with chips or a salad. The chips are apparently 'home made' but they didn't taste too different from something that came out of a box. This brings me to my final complaint - the box that it is served in (even if you're not getting take out) had a slight wierd carboard like smell to it. Now coming to the good part - the service is great and the staff was very patient with me. They also have free wifi and offers if you check in on foursquare. There you have it - my compliment sandwich for The Contruction Site."
