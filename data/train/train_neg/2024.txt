b'Food was great! Loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! Service was sub par. They hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. When we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. She never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. She coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. Furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. We stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. Our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. No one addressed us. LOverall: good food, bad service.'
