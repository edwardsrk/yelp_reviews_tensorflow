b'If you\'re looking for breakfast, do yourself a favor and go to the Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet instead. My breakfast of granola, strawberries, bananas, and vanilla yogurt was crazy expensive, inedible, and disgusting. The yogurt was what I\'d imagine unicorn sperm to be: gloopy and sickeningly sweet. My boyfriend ordered a bowl of Raisin Bran (one of those single servings you can buy at Costco). It was $10. I know it\'s Vegas, and everything\'s more expensive, but $30 seems like a lot for yogurt, 2 coffees, and a cup of raisin bran. The atmosphere sucks, too, unless you like smoke wafting in from the casino, and watching promos for "Extra" on one of the many TVs in the restaurant. Meh....'
