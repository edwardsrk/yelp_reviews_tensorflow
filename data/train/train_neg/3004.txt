b'This is near the downtown district and hard to get to by bus - you have to walk a good 1-1/.2 mile from the bus stop (yes we did not have a car).   The booth table was wobbly, we moved to the next one.   We were there at 12:00 for lunch and ordered the soup and sandwich combo (was told the soup would be "a few more minutes - not ready)",  we werent told our sandwiches were ready (we had to ask) and pickup.   However, our soup was never told it was ready.  We waited patiently as the clock ticked and we waited for OVER 1 hour for a cup of soup and we had to ask for it almost when we were done.   This is really a take-out place even if there are tables and chairs there.    Staff is extremely slow.   It is hard to find, and in a Gamblers Store.    Sandwiches were o.k., but location and service was below par.'
