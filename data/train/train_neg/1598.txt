b"I'm am very disappointed in this store I have always had good service here. I ordered 2 gyro salads they gave me Greek salads no meat for 12 dollars. I've gotten salads here with meat. I got all the way home before I saw no meat. If some one orders a gyro salad you would think they would at least ask if I wanted meat. If i would have wanted a greek salad i would ask for a greek salad. I said gyro.When I called them on the phone they were not too nice. I'll be finding a new gyro place. There's one by my post office I guess I'll give them a shot"
