b'I\'ve totally given up on this place.  The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting.  Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7.95).  It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, "Where did it all go?"  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, "Is that all there is?"For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery.  On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken.  Flavor is just meh.  A bit on the bland side sometimes.The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt.Since it\'s mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.  If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.  But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better.On the upside, if you do end up eating inside the restaurant, very nice people work there.  But, the food coming out of that kitchen is just bland, bland, bland.'
