b"Heed the negative reviews.This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food. As I said, pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise I can't see anyone going back for more."
