b'I decided to try this place out as it was the only viet place around the area and I was craving pho. The pho was done extremely poor as the broth was very salty and dark which from first look you can tell its not very "traditional". The beef was super over cooked and aside from that I don\'t really remember much about it. For $9 (small) I can really find much better pho basically.My friend ordered a pad Thai instead which looked pretty decent.'
