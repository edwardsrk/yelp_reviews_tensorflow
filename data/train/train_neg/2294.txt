b"Walked in and knew exactly which car we wanted. Did a very short test drive and we agreed on the internet advertised price. The next morning I was looking at the paper work and noticed the base price had gone up over $1600. I called to ask about it and the guy asked me if I was looking at the total after taxes etc.  Ok. I don't know how stupid he thought I was but of course not!  I was looking at the base starting price!  After going in to the dealership to pursue this it was pointed out that the advertised price does not include mandatory dealer add on charges, such as window tinting (it was a used car and already on), nitrogen tires and other things that added up to over $1600. I guess it was on something I signed while getting to the desired monthly payment, but why wasn't it clearly pointed out?  And why dont I have any documentation or itemization of it in my loads of paperwork?  If I had in fact purchased these things I should have some sort of receipt for them. I think it's a horrible way to do business. We had verbally agreed on the advertised price and those add ons were glossed over and snuck in on top of that price. I have bought many used cars throughout my life and I have never ever run into this.  I will never again buy a car from a dealership who has mandatory dealer add ons.  If I see a price online I should not end up paying any more unless it is for optional items that are my choice.  Why would you even want to do business this way?  You've got a great line of quality cars. People will buy them. By looking at this site this same issue has made a lot of people really mad. You want people to feel like the got a great deal, not that they've been had. I gave two stars because most of the people there were actually pretty nice, but I still feel like that was a pretty slick move."
