b"I really had to make a yelp account just to tell this. This particular branch has a special spot with my sentiments as I went here alot, but tonight's shift served me uncooked chicken with my Bacon club toaster. I called and I really appreciated the manager taking the time to look up my order and have me make a new one. I guess I could understand that they were busy, but I try to figure out how the staff could've missed this. I'm sure whoever messed up was dealt with and I wish him the best.No receipt was given either."
