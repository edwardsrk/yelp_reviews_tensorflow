b"I had been a loyal client to Oreganos for many years; today our relationship ended. I had noticed a steady decline over the past couple years based on some menu changes all geared toward bottom line profit. I get it, and have no problem with it, IF, the service and product remains consistent. For instance, you used to get all drummies when you ordered wings, now you get a mix and only 10. They've started using chips and now up-charge for waffle fries. The quality in the food product continues to decline while demanding more from the consumer. I made a to go order and after driving 20 minutes to get it and get back home I find that it's wrong (wrong type of wings) and one of the items was horribly made. I called and commented on the experience and although they reversed the charges (what they should do) I have decided that there are too many options with more consistency and care for the client. Putting profits before people is a poor model and Oreganos used to be an establishment where great food paired with great value was served by incredible people; that is no longer the case in my opinion. I bid you farewell and truly hope you get it back on track, I absolutely loved this place."
