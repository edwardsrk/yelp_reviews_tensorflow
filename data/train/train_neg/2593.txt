b"I'm sitting here still at the vig waiting for about 20 minutes while our waitress Sierra  chit chats away with the host Instead of  checking us out. This has absolutely been the worst experience I've ever had. I usually go to the downtown vig but decided to come to this location since it's closer. Boy do I regret this so much. She didn't take our kids drinks orders and walked off in the middle of me trying to place my order which was extremely rude. All of our drinks remained empty for most of our meals. This will be my last time coming."
