b'I\'m never coming back to this place !!!!Let me tell you why...Turns out that we really wanted to go and check out this place, and for secret reasons we were running late and needed to have a late dinner, well, their website clearly reads: "Hours: 6 pm - Late", so it was perfect, right ? unless we don\'t understand what late means...  now hear this, we even call this clowns before going there, just to check if they were going to be open, and we specifically axed ... at what time are you guys closing the kitchen tonight? we are thinking about late dinner and we want to head over there... and so the deception begins, they told us they were not closing the kitchen until 11 PM (take note) 11 PM !!! OK, perfect!We take a taxi to go aaaaaall the waaay there,  and so we show up at about 10:20 PM, all looking like idiots.... guess what???? Kitchen was closed !!!!!  why would you do this to me ???? I\'m here on business !!!!!!!!So we were just standing there, feeling like dog feces and talking to the hostess, explaining to her that we were on the phone earlier (like half an hour earlier) with her, and she told us that the kitchen was going to be open... and her response was a simple "well, they changed their minds"  !!!!! ????  : |       excuse me???? they changed their minds ?????  dafuuuuuuuuqqqqq ?????  oh ok.... So, never trust this clowns.... for all we know it may not be open today (even though it is supposed / advertised to be) , or they might could close early, how about closing today at 7 PM??? sure, why not! or maybe it\'s going to be 10 PM .... you never know.... because  THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS frequently..... What a joke!!!! I declare this place a big pile of feculence !!!   in other words:  this place is NOT ALLOWED !!!'
