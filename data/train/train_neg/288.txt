b'So Yelp took of my review over this Hyundai dealership earlier because its seems kind of personal. But my thing is, I think everyone should know what kind of person they are going to deal with here in their sales department.  They have bait and switch guy in the internet department, inexperience green peas salesperson and douche bag sales manager. If you are still going to this dealership to get your hyundai. Well, you have been warned. You can take of my review again Yelp if you think it doesnt fall within the guidelines again.'
