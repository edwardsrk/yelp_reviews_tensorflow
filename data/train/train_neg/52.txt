b"I placed a custom order on 30 August. I was told it would be ready in 2 weeks. By early October I hadn't heard anything about it. I contacted Carrie Hood and asked for an update. She apologized and said it would be ready that Saturday. I messaged her after I didn't hear back from her about my order that Saturday and received an automated response. I have since messaged her several times and have received the same automated response. On November 4th I sent a message asking for a refund and again received the same automated response. This morning I attempted to contact Rugged Moose Decor again only to learn that I have been blocked. I was using Facebook messager to communicate with Carrie hood. Now I can no longer reach her and I don't have my order or a refund. This company is a scam."
