b"As my Valentine night is coming to an end after a fabulous dinner in downtown Tempe we decide to stop at MWC for the first time on our way home at about 10:30.As we get our drinks in front of us, the music stops and the packed Cellar starts to file out the door. Wait....What?  The place is packed on a Saturday night and you close at 11pm? Ummm......ok.  We get our bill......$19.27 for a beer and a glass of house pinot?  Where am I? Thanks but no thanks, I doubt I'll be back. I really wanted to like this place too."
