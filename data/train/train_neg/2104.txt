b"The Better Half (TBH) and I were antique shopping next door and she decided to stay much longer than I expected, so I walked over here to watch some basketball in the Sports Book.  This place is a dump!  It's old and very smokey.  The last time I was in this casino, was in the late 1990's and it still looks the same.I watched basketball games for around 2 hrs while TBH shopped and when I walked back to see her, she said I reeked of smoke....yuck.Return Factor - 5%"
