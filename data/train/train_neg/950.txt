b'These people are below average intelligence Try to rip you off Argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!Had enough of them I do not have the time to teach basic common sense !The special reads add any pizza for 9.95(Equal or lesser value )I order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.Simple right well they say they can\'t honor the "2nd" pizza because it\'s a "specialty"What does it matter what order I say my pizza\'s in?Is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? Common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?Well if I have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it I will just find me a new shop!'
