b'I used to like this store, but I will shop anywhere but here now. The last straw was the seemingly endless renovation, which made it difficult to find basic things in the store (they didnt put up signs to let people know where things were). But before that, I have had to return chicken over three times, as it was bad when I got it home and opened it to repackage it for the freezer.  I finally figured out WHY the meat was bad - I went to the meat section to pick up chicken that was on sale, and it was in trays on skids waiting to be put out.  So I walked the store for about 30 minutes, came back, and the same meat was sitting there unattended, and no one had even made a dent in putting it out. There must have been 7 or 8 large trays stacked high, and I imagine it would have taken a good 30 minutes to put it into the refrigerated display cases. Which means the chicken was out of refrigeration for at least an hour. No wonder the poultry I buy is bad!And the bagging thing - that is another irritant. When it is busy on a Saturday, would it hurt to have a few baggers on hand to help out?'
