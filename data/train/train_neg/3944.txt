b"Went here on a Friday night, wasn't too packed that it was hard to move around or find a seat. Just the right amount of people! Didn't come for food, just some good ol'fashioned drinking which I found to be quite expensive. Typical stocked bar and nothing extra special on tap, unless your totally in love with Irish beers.In my opinion this place isn't anything special, especially being located on the square. Better off just bypassing."
