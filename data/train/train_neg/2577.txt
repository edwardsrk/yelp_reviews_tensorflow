b"Love Trader Joe's, but this new-to-the-neighborhood location fell short of my expectations. My expectation is for the store to be well stocked. At least as much as Smiths, Whole foods, etc. no cucumbers, no lettuce, slim pickings on produce and even frozen food. Please step it up management on your ordering.Oh, and cute cart girl, when you see a customer walking toward the carts, don't shove the cart in your hand into the others, offer it to your customer."
