b'My husband and I decided to check this place out...mainly because of me and my love for the musician....DONT GO.  The greeter was RUDE...because we came in the wrong door.  The table was dirty...as were the seats.  Our server was very sweet.  She did her best to make sure our experience was a good one.  That is where it ended. My husband had the BBQ chicken...dry...bland.  I had the BBQ chicken wrap.  Tasteless.  I ordered a Bloody Mary...horrible...and the $4 frozen margarita...which tasted like well water.  It really is a shame that the food and drinks taste so awful....The concept is a good one...like the music....but the rest....lets just say McDonalds would have been a better choice.'
