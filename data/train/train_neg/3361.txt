b"What a disappointing experience. We had wanted to get into this place after experiencing their craft cocktails at a local festival. After always trying to get a reservation on open table but it showing it was booked we decided to call. As it turns out they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We went and waited at the bar for a table. The cocktails were great although my drink was about 3 sips so not great for the price. At our table we were served one by one. My friends husbands meal came out first then my husbands came out cold and without chicken as requested then my friends came out steaming hot. My food came out so late everyone was nearly done with their food. My husband told them he was missing his chicken and he received it after finishing his meal. Our servers switched during the meal and when asking for our bill they asked us if we had a bottle of wine (which we didn't). They also took away our heat lamp during our meal for another table. We asked that we keep it as it was cold and they said they would bring another which they weren't able to light. It seemed as if they knew they missed the mark when we left but in no way offers to come anything (even the chicken my husband didn't eat because it came out so late). The service was really poor and the food was not amazing. Maybe it is an okay place for a drink but don't waste your time on a meal."
