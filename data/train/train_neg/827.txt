b"My husband & I ate here on s Saturday night. We wanted to bowl but there's 1.5 hr waiting list. No big deal, we decided to put a $20 bill into new arcade card and play some games. Literally more than half the games would NOT read the card no matter how slow/fast we swiped or what directions. Many of the ones that did read ate our card balance & didn't let us play. We reported it to arcade/projectionist Guy  & he made us walk around & relive everything that went wrong. He gave us extra tokens & put $4 on our card. I'd rather have $10 back. We were treated like we were trying to score free crappy token gear instead of like customers with an issue. Whatever. Won't be back. Plenty of places to go on Saturday night in Gilbert besides fat cats. No thanks. I'll happily pass on this place. Bad service=bad time."
