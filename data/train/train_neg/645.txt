b'I had an amazon return drop off. The first thing I walked in the store its this stare, no greetings... no questions... just a stare with no smile on this guy\'s face. After I told him I needed a drop off, and the guys wants $2 to tape my box. Seriously? I said I\'ve been to other ups, never charged for extra taping?! And he was like "well, go there then!" Wow! How rude?! I\'d love a manager gave me an explanation for this!Worst customer service ever!!!!!!!!!'
