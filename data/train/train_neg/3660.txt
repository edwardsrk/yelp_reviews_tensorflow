b'I would have rated this resort 5 stars had there been better ventilation in the casino. The cigarette smoke was overwhelming and very poorly ventilated. I would expect similar air-quality at a 2 or 3 star hotel but I feel it is unacceptable at a 4 1/2 star resort! The management staff were only able to offer me an apology. If you intend to use the casino for entertainment or dining, I would not recommend this resort.'
