b'I\'m assuming it was the owner but he got up in my face and confrontational when I asked about where rice was with my order. The particular dish I ordered I\'ve never received without rice elsewhere. He then started throwing out tourist trap casino prices like $4 for a bottle of water in irrelevant comparrisions bull*hitting me. His resteraunt is an "away from the casino" option in a lower end strip mall. A Walgreen\'s sells his $4 bottle water claim for a buck and a small shop further down for 2 for $1. I get better food for less and with rice nicer areas and places back home with I\'m pretty sure higher overhead. The food was actually decent but with all the add on hits and bad service you can do better. I obviously won\'t be going back.His Google review diverges greatly from yelp; peculiar and probably loaded.'
