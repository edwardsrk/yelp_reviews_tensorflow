b'Please thank your head server for telling us to sit far away at a table far away from everyone because according to her our 2yo twin boys are loud. We had just walked in for 20 seconds! Her actions made it possible to have an excellent dinner at Bachi Burger. We have been there three previous times with the worst sounds made being the little soy sauce dishes being tossed on the floor. We were seated at the last table in the restaurant closest to the restrooms at the time. The same person sat us that time as well. She is a shorter Asian woman with glasses. Our boys are not children who cry throughout dinner, in fact they do not cry at all when they are out eating. Because they love food!They are the type who flirt with the other very friendly tall server and wave at the man who brought our iced teas. You lost repeat customers who will take every chance that we get to make sure everyone knows what kind of a person you choose to employ. Very rude and poor customer service! I have never had heard anyone works in service industry would talk to customer like that.'
