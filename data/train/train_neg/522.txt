b'Food not too great. Horrible service.  Think the owner needs to train their staff better.  At the very least, tell them to come around to the tables more often and ask your guests if they need anything.  We had a table of of 13 or 14 last night.  About 8 of us were drinking.  In 2 hours the waitress asked me only once what i wanted to drink.  Once!  I had to ask her for my second drink.  Was never asked again after that.  This was pretty much the same for everyone at the table.  They easily could have had 2 more drinks/beers sold a piece from the eight of us who were drinking but they never bothered to ask us if we wanted another.  Cant understand this if your income is based on tips.  Dont know if she was new or just not properly trained.  But the more we spend the more you make!As far as the food goes.  Ordered the turkey wrap club with fries.  Got a chicken wrap instead that was all lettuce, very dry and with very little chicken in it.  Fresh cut fries were good.'
