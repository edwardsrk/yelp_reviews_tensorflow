b'Looks like I will add to the horrible reviews for this place.  The staff and practice as a whole is unacceptably slow.  They called my wife over an hour before her appointment regarding insurance approval.  She have then the approval number again since the approval person failed to do their job correctly the business day before.  Instead of doing their last minute call to the insurance company since my wife assured then we would be there early for her appointment, they did not call until well after we arrived.  We arrived almost 30 minutes before the scheduled appointment time.  After waiting 30 minutes after the scheduled time, we are informed that part of the delay is because of them verifying with the insurance on the phone.  We have been to 3 different companies for imaging in the last few months.  Simon Med is the only one that is not only late but continuously make their patients wait in a full waiting room.  When is corporate going to actually read these reviews and realize they need to evaluate their processes.  Some high notes(only reason they get two stars)1.) The front staff seemed professional.  They were not rude.2.) The music!  They play instrumental versions of Top40 hits.  I guess the popular music in a calming tone helps sedate people while their time is being wasted by poor management.'
