b"I need to lower my rating. My love for how tasty and consistent St. Louis wings are has not changed. It's the service that truly needs help.The staff there are friendly. We were a group of roughly twenty folks saying goodbye to a fellow colleague last Tuesday. His manager booked a reservation for us.Our software development team comes here often. Service at this establishment as of late has been bad.It was Tuesday, meaning that you can get wings for half price. I ordered two pounds of wings. I chose honey garlic and sweet chili as my sauces. It came with fries. I also ordered a Diet Pepsi. I ate half my wings and packed the rest home when I finally got my order.I placed my order at around noon. Our server was jotting down everyone's names. I thought that things were getting better service-wise. Nope. So wrong.In our group, I was the last person to get my order. A fellow colleague came in later than I did (12:35 pm) and got her food first before everyone else!I was the last person to get my food, waiting for over an hour. I thought that I was going to die. Luckily, I have enough fat stored around my belly that I snapped out of hangry mode! As soon as I heard my Brazilian developer say that his wings weren't what he had ordered, I knew that he was munching on my lunch order. Yep, she, my server, had given him my order. Ugh!I finally got my order. My software development manager advised me to not give a tip. I rarely don't tip, but I had to. It was just not right.(187)"
