b'First of all, I come here with my family and walk into a crowd of people in line.. There was an older lady, Im guessing the "owner" that came to help us,I got 1 kids scoop and 2 regular scoops of Ice cream.. I was getting ready to pay when the lady handed me my last scoop of ice cream saying "Have a great day".. too me I thought that these scoops of ice cream were on the house being as the bigger group before me was still in front of the cashier paying.. I said "are you sure?" to the lady when she replied, "Have a good day" In my head I was thinking.. wow what a kind lady to give us free ice cream.. then I walked away and sat down with my family.. I told my husband this and he said he would leave some tip just because he wanted to be nice.. As we walk out and my husband places the tip in the tip jar, the lady said to me.. "oh I still need to ring you up, right?" I was in shock... on top of that I felt so humiliated, thinking that these scoops of ice cream were on the house... She asked me if the tip my husband left in the jar was the money we were going to use to pay for the ice cream.. I told her no, he wanted to leave tip.. She was gonna ring me up with two kids scoops and a regular scoop.. I corrected her saying two regular scoops and a kids scoop and paid my $9 bill.. I am not the type of person to run out on my bill and I was more than happy to pay in the beginning.. She confused me soo much on top of making me feel like a complete idiot.. maybe I missed her saying to pay later on top of the loud crowd, but I was humiliated... Horrible customer service... She also gave me "expired" coupons, telling me it would still be valid.. which if I ever go in here and get humiliated again by having expired coupons.. I don\'t know what I would do... Needless to say.. I am never going to this baskin robbins again after the customer service that left me feeling horrible!!'
