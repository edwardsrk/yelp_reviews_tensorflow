b"Reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... With that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... Food is mediocre but always frozen ya I can tell.... With that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at Madison's or Boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull"
