b'So far, not a happy customer.  I am only able to give this rating in regards to the reservations I made.  I made reservations for a bigger party (14 people) and had these reservations well over one month in advance.  I received a phone message today letting me know that my reservations are to be canceled and to call the Hofbrauhaus back.  I have called 4 times with no answer and was finally transferred to the hostess desk to be greeted by a voicemail.  I am not pleased with the fact I have been canceled on for such a large reservation for an important event.  I am also upset that I received this info by voicemail without an explanation and have yet to actually get in touch with the restaurant to understand what the meaning is.  As of right now, I have no desire to ever make a reservation or even stop by this place for a drink.  Hopefully, this will be cleared up and I can change this review to a better one - but I believe first impressions are important.'
