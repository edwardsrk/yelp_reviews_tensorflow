b'This was the worst experience with a company I have ever encountered. I hate that I even have to give a star! I purchased the living social deal for 2 movers for two and a half hours and a 27 foot truck. I called and left 3 messages on the voicemail before talking to a person. When I set up the appointment for 2p, I was given a window that it could be as late as 4. At 330, I received a call from the owner that they were picking up my truck and would be on their way. About 5 minutes later, I received a call that there was not a truck and a mover had passed out, but I would definitely be moved before that night. I called several more times, with no answer. At 930p I finally spoke to someone who had excuse after excuse. I asked if they were canceling and if I would receive a discount. I was told they would still come after midnight and that I would "definitely NOT" receive a discount and then I was hung up on. I have three small kids and only had one day to get everything moved and was extremely disappointed. If you want your belongings to actually be moved, never call this company!!!'
