b"My boyfriend received a BOGO deal via email which was why we chose to dine with Milestones this evening. Usually Milestones has great service and food at the various locations we visited but not the one on Queensway.Service started out fast in which we were seated immediately during the dinner rush, and drinks and salads came out pretty soon after we ordered. We were disappointed that they ran out of the Italian sausage ravioli so we tried the grilled chicken penne asiago. Additionally, we ordered a regular sized medium rare prime rib to share. The pasta was decent but definitely overpriced. There were barely any chicken pieces and the entree was a bit salty. Sadly this was when the service went downhill. We didn't receive our prime rib until 30 minutes later since we ordered it. The wait was so long that we expected a delicious prime rib. We were disappointed when it finally arrived at our table. I have to admit that the prime rib I made last week was definitely better...I'm not even joking. The next time I want to eat at Milestones it definitely will not be at the Queensway location."
