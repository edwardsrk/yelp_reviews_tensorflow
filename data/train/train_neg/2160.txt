b"I don't know why people think this place is good. Although the service is great this place does not serve authentic Mexican food. To begin with, the rice is not Mexican. They serve white rice mixed with canned vegetables. The salsa is also not freshly made. The nearest taco shop has better salsa. I ordered  a combination plate which came with a Chile relleno, a veggie taco and a rajas tamal. The veggie taco was the most edible thing on my plate. It cost $18. Maybe I am being harsh because I am Mexican and I know what Mexican food should be like. I also ordered a guacamole appetizer and that was a 3.5 out 5 stars. In all, this place is way over priced for the quality of food they serve. Good luck if you come here."
