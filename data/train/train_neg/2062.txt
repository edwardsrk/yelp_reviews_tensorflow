b"Four of us went during the first few days this restaurant opened. we ordered the fries (delicious, with rosemary and salt) and each ordered a burger. I had the steakhouse which has a red wine sauce and was really very good it came as I ordered medium well. The other three people who were in our party all had a problem with the way the burgers were cooked. Everyone else's were too overcooked, my parner's burger was cooked to a crispy well done even though she had ordered it medium. Our waitress was happy to send my partner's burger back and have it made correctly. Our waitress also seemed very nervous and seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown.Overall I liked my own burger but was unimpressed that 3 our of 4 burgers that were ordered at our table were cooked incorrectly. I will likely not be going back to this restaurant. I felt it was also a little overpriced. For a great burger I will continue to go to Tessaros"
