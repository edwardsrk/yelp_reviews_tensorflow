b"Hmm, I really don't know what the fuss is all about.  We heard it mentioned on a few travel shows as being THE place for bagels in Montreal, but were a little disappointed that they only do bagels, no cream cheese or spreads, no coffee, cash only.  The bagels are stacked up high for volume, and the place is a squeeze to get to the counter when it is busy.  But they are fast, and the bagels are tasty - I just don't think you can compare this place to others that sell the fixings and coffee.  And maybe that's the point here? And if you are a local, you buy in bulk and bring them home?But if you are a tourist and looking for a cafe/bagel experience, pick another place."
