b'I had eggs Benedict with hash browns. Lots of salt in every component: hollandaise, biscuit, hash browns. The eggs were swimming in hollandaise. My husband had biscuits and gravy and he was disappointed with the flavors, overcooked hashbrowns, junky sausage AND too much pepper in the gravy, and dense biscuits. He also said the coffee was worse than gas station coffee. I thought even the water tasted gross. The only redeeming qualities were their wait staff who are supremely kind and very quick, and it is decorated sort of cute.'
