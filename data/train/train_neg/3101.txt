b"I will say the food is tasty, which is the reason for 2 stars. But the wait is ridiculous. I have been here 2 separate times, the first time we waited for 20 minutes for 2 lunch specials. Now the second time I am here, well over 15 minutes to pour (pre-made) soup in a bowl. And then I had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for a box and my check. I understand it was prime lunch hour, but I still found the wait to be excessive for what I ordered. Very annoying and probably won't be coming back."
