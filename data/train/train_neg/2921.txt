b"I really wanted to like Momocho, but unfortunately, this experience just didn't deliver. The hostess was really nice and squeezed in a table for us on New Years eve, and then proceeded to seat us immediately when we came in. However, the experience did go downhill from there. We got our tables close to 7:45, by which time the restaurant was not as busy as earlier in the evening. However, it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to get the attention of any server (despite me waving at one). The drink orders were decent and the guacamole was pretty good, however the chips serving was not very much - just an average sized bowl. This would not have been an issue if they were not charging $8.50 for a guacamole serving, and $2 for each chip refill. For the main course ordered the Chilli Relleno, which was pretty good, a beetroot Taco dish which was ok, and their best beef tacos, which, honestly were tough. We've had more tender meat at a Taco Bell.Overall, it seemed like a place that had potential. There were definitely sparks of greatness (Cucumber Margarita and Chilli Rellenos). However, the overall experience just was not what I was expecting."
