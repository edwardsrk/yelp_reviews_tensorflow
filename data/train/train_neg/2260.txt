b"We really wanted this to be a good Thai place here in Fountain Hills so that we didn't have to go to Scottsdale every time. (this is a staple for us every week).  Wasn't looking for great...just decent. Unfortunately, our first experience was disappointing as we ordered two classic dishes: Pad Thai and Spicy Fried Rice ....Pad Thai is a dish that should be consistent in flavor, regardless of where you order it..this dish had a flavor that was not consistent at all with the dish and was quite bland (was ordered at a medium spice). On the contrary, the Spicy Fried Rice was over powered with flavor, but it was unfortunately too much sodium and soy sauce...and pretty much inedible.  Based on the other reviews, it may be worth trying again, but quite frankly, with so many other strong and consistent Thai restaurants within a 10 mile radius, it's likely we'll make the trek down the hill for the sure thing."
