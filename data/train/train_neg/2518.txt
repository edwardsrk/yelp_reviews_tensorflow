b"Generally good food, but expensive for what you get as the portion sizes are fairly small. A few hours after lunch I was really hungry again. Three of us had lunch specials and two small bowls of tom yum soup and we spent $75. Charging us $7.50 for a pot of jasmine tea which most places give for free was not cool. Parking in the strip mall is difficult as there are quite a few food establishments in a row. Given the premium prices that they charge for just an okay experience I don't think I will be returning any time soon."
