b"I can careless for a fast food! But I work by this chi fil A spot and me and co workers go there atleast once a week. I don't remember one time that I got my order right! Once I ordered today, didn't get my cheese and the ketchup and had to wait 5mins just to get a slice of cheese! 2 nights ago we ordered number one we got a spicy one instead! Like it's just a simple sandwich with a simple order! How can you get it wrong every time! And lately the food is coming old and cold! Either warm it up or cook a new one"
