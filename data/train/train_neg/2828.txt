b"Completely underwhelmed. All the hype for nothing. Target in canada is lame and doesn't even come close to target USA. In the states, target actually competes with Walmart, not so much in canada. Their website isn't even up yet, at least not the shopping section. Pros: exclusive line of clothing and food products.Cons: not competitively priced like their u.s. counterpart.In my book, walmart is still better."
