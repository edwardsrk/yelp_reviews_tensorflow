b"Horrible service. Ordered a plain hamburger at 7:16 pm. At 7:30 pm they hadn't even put it on the grill (needless to say there was nothing on the grill for about 10 minutes). Not sure where the disconnect is between the cashier and the cook who is 8 feet away. Everyone is complaining and the customer in front was waiting even longer. Samantha did nothing about it until people started demanding a refund. Said she was sorry and couldn't give a reason why everyone's food was so delayed. 7:43pm we got our plain hamburger. Corporate please help before this location fails !! Update: the burger had cheese."
