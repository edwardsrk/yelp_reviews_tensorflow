b'The server Alex was awesome... The reason for the bad review is because of the food... it was disgusting... I would never eat here again. I would train the kitchen staff how to cook better. I had to send the fish back because it smelled and tasted expired. It had a bad smell and when I tried it i had to spit it into a napkin because I could not swallow it. I asked for a chicken sandwich instead which was dry and tasteless... I will never come back here due to the food...'
