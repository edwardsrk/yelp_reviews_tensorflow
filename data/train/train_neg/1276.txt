b"One of the sales associates lured my boyfriend in to the kiosk and offered to clean his shoe, while cleaning my boyfriends shoe the associate noticed a spot on my right shoe and said it would work on mine as well...so he proceeded to clean the spot. My boyfriends shoe came out looking really good but my boyfriend said he wanted to see how the product dried up and if it did so nicely we would come back to purchase the kit. We walked around the mall some and I noticed the spot he cleaned on my shoe was showing come kind of yellowish/brownish discoloration and I thought it just wasn't dry yet, after giving it more time  the spot wasn't going away. We go back to the kiosk and show the associate and he said it was probably the towel he used cause it was new and possibly still bleeding, and he will just clean the whole shoe will a different brush and towel and it would be fine. To make a long story short the shoe didn't dry up nicely now my whole shoe (nike free run 5.0) are damaged. Although my boyfriends red vans came out looking good I wouldn't recommend this product on white mesh shoes possibly no white shoes at all. Its disappointing that the associates don't know what the product is safe to use on. And from reading other reviews I can see I am not the first victim. Now I have to go through the troubles to finding a way to restore my shoe but I doubt it will ever be the same."
