b'Been here a few times. My husband likes the different tacos, I don\'t. They are all mediocre. Service usually sucks for mediocre food. Called for reservations for his birthday, when I wanted to add two more people to the party, I was told that I couldn\'t because seats fill up too fast. When I explained that it was his birthday, the lady could care less. Her response was "well at 945 at night we can seat that many people." My reservation is for 515. Completely ruined his birthday. And it\'s completely ridiculous. After this- will never return. My money and time is clearly more appreciated elsewhere.'
