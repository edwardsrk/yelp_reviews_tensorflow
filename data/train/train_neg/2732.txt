b'I feel bad giving such a bad review because the people there were all extremely nice which is the only reason I gave a second star but I feel like people should know what they\'re getting into. First of all it\'s not the type of massage where they lead you to a private room and you get naked and under a blanket. You must keep your clothes on because it\'s a huge dark room with see through pop up curtains separating people. They put a rough towel over your body and your face, and of course you still have clothes on (in my case jeans and a t shirt) so the entire massage takes place over so many layers of fabric. About 10 minutes into the "massage" the towel on my face slips off a little and I see a middle aged man standing there staring at me while they get the table next to me ready for him. They did put up a divider between us but it was incredibly jarring seeing that. My massage itself was subpar (the worst I\'ve ever gotten) and was just incredibly uncomfortable, the man was definitely not a real masseuse. I couldn\'t get out of there fast enough.'
