b"So we have stayed at the Flamingo the past 3 years, the last week of July. This year will be the last. I should have listened to all the other recent reviews. We got the GO room floor 20, it stunk so bad like mold or who knows what, and a bucket sitting in front of the elevator for leaking water from ceiling. We called down to the desk and told them and they moved our room one floor up , with no smell. They charged us 80$ resort fee (they never did that in the past) for wifi etc. Had NO wifi connection the whole time I was there , and needed to check into my flight. Spent another hour at the desk complaining about this. Then the next day we had no air conditioning in our room. Yet more time at the desk trying to resolve another issue. The last thing I want to be doing on my vacation is complaining at the service desk. Oh and don't forget the food court was closed due to the plumbing issues and constructions going on in the casino stunk like sewage from an incident a few weeks ago. They did resolve our issues in a timely manner however , refunded our resort fees, free breakfast etc. Next time Ill be staying at the Hard Rock for the same price.What I love about the Flamingo ... The pool is always a BLAST !!!GO rooms are really nice for the price and you cant beat the Flamingos central strip location!They just really need to work on the rest of the property."
