b'This place has subpar food and exorbitant prices (for what it is) which is never a good combo. The first time I got the tomato and egg noodles, and those were pretty tasteless. ..not to mention they came in a tiny bowl and I was hungry an hour later.  The second time,  I got the chicken chow mein, which although greasy,  was decent,  after I added a good amount of salt and two packets of hoisin sauce. Bottom line- save your $12-$18 and get a good lunch somewhere else.'
