b'How does this store stay in business?  I try not to come here for the very reason that happened today.  Walked in looking for a specific item.  I saw three Home Depot people chatting away by the popcorn machine.  I waited several minutes for any of them to acknowledge my presence.  It was as if I was invisible!  Could not even get popcorn!  They were so involved with talking amongst themselves.  I found another Home Depot employee actually working and he "pointed" me in the right direction.  When I got to the aisle I found what I wanted, but if I did have any questions, there was no one to be found.  How does this store stay open?  Terrible customer service!  I will spend more and go to Ace Hardware.  At least they have someone who helps you!'
