b'My expectations were high after reading about awards it\'s received.  Over-hyped should be their next.  Liked:  cool & swanky decor - drinks - short rib "cali-belgique" Where things fell short:* The fried brussel sprouts should be renamed "charred" brussel sprouts.  I was debating between the brussel sprouts & the cauliflower.  My waiter pumped up the brussel sprouts and made them sound like heaven.  Then they came served black & crispy.  :-(* The scallop diver surf & turf...where\'s the turf?  For real.  Don\'t advertise turf and serve flakes of corned beef with a $35 price tag for 3 scallops.  I better be wowed and just wasn\'t.'
