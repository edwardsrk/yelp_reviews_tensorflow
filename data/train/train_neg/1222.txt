b'This is the worse service I had on my life, I did asked to bring me water 3 times half of my order was missing when I asked the waitress she said sometimes they lost the order and you have to order it again. They bring each sushi plate to the table every 10 minutes, but when you asked for the bill they bring it away. Right the food was good but they have very very poor customer service. And one star is too much for this restaurant'
