b'We came here at 9:30 on a Saturday, and although the food was well executed the atmosphere and service made the experience an overall negative one. Almost everyone that worked there seemed exhausted and overwhelmed which is understandable given how dark, loud, and impossible to get around it was. We waited for about 15 mins to be asked about our drinks, and were able to order everything then. As I said, all of the food was very good as we had expected, but they need to make some overall adjustments to make this a pleasant dining experience.'
