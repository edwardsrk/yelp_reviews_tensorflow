b'We had a terrible experience at Biarritz this evening. I was there with one other person initially. Once we had decided to stay, we called a few other people to see who would join us. We then ordered the $50 poutine... had to see what this was all about.A little while later, around 11 PM, our friends arrived - 6 in total. They were told that the kitchen was closed. They asked if they could get a drink. They were told they could not. So, we had invited them over, it is -17 degrees outside, and they are being told to leave. Do you see a problem here?And so they left. We should also have left. Instead, I tried to discuss what had just happened with the server. She was not interested. I then talked to the manager to see if I could get a tiny bit of understanding out of her. No. She insisted that I was wrong because we had sat at a table for 2... There was no way for them to know that we had friends coming. But this is Montreal, on a Saturday night, in a restaurant on St. Laurent with music blasting. Who would expect it to close at 11:00 PM? Anyway, they decided to argue with me instead of trying to figure  out a way to settle the issue.  Then the $50 poutine arrived. Terrible. The meat was inedible. It may have been 25 oz of steak... but 24 ounces were inedible. It was beyond fat.We ate the mediocre french fries, paid the $50 plus tax for the worst poutine I have ever had, and left there very unhappy.'
