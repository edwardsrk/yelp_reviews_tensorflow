b'Listen I have lived in southside for a couple years, and I go to primantis about once a week. They recently hired a woman with half a pony tail, half a buzz cut. (Will add a photo). My friend and I walked in, and asked for sandwhiches. She said "you know you can go to the back of the building for food" we replied "can\'t we get food here?". She says "I guess". After this encounter she completely ignored us for the rest of the night. I had to get my own ketchup and buffalo sauce from the BACK of the building (apparently the only place I\'m allowed).'
