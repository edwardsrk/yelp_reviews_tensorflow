b"I am reviewing Asian King based on their Lunch Specials.Not too many choice in the area for decent Cantonese food... so you might be stuck with Asian King if you have that urge.Decent price for lunch $4.99 for a soup noodle of some sort, and the portion is huge.My Beef Brisket with Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.99) was really flavourable...by tons of MSG. I was thirsty for the whole day after that. On the other hand, my Hot Yoga Date Thai vegetarian Fried Rice ($6.50) with soup and Spring Rolls was really blend tasting.Services here is cold and efficient...... I don't know if I would be back to Asian King  for more MSG experience!"
