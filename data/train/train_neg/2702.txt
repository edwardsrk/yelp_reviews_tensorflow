b'Salty Seniorita is an old town institution. I have spent many spring training afternoons and mornings at Salty\'s. It has been a favorite of my friends and family and we\'ve developed an affinity for their friendly service, good drinks and great food. However, over the last few years, the service and attention to detail has deteriorated to an extent that I won\'t be taking my business here any longer. With so many new options in old town that actually provide some level of competent service (including RnR across the street), it doesn\'t even make sense. Yesterday, my party and I were seated after a 15 minute wait (not bad for a spring training afternoon) but the service was just terrible on so many levels. We started with two orders of the bacon guacamole which the waiter said would "be right out"\'after a 20 minute wait. They turned out to take 20 more minutes. When we finally placed our food orders and 45 minutes had passed, the waiter came to ask us how we\'d like to split the check BEFORE we even had the food on our table. Truly egregious. We had an outdoor table and it was kind of ironic to look across the street and wonder how much better the meal would have been at RnR. Again, the waiter and restaurant had clearly failed any measurable service standard and instead of trying to make amends, he simply tried to accelerate shuffling us out of the restaurant. Unacceptable way to treat long time customers. The food did eventually show up and as always, the tacos did impress. Salty\'s still does a great job with the food. So my advice: if you want great Mexican food with terrible service, Salty\'s is your spot. But if you want decent food with some actual service--there\'s 30 other options in old town alone. Bring back the old Salty\'s atmosphere!'
