b"If I had wanted Denny's service and Denny's food I would have gone to Denny's. What happened to Olive Garden??? You used to be regarded with a higher standard now, you are barely one step above fast food!!!Went in around lunch time and the service was so slow.  I ordered and iced tea with lemon and was brought a raspberry tea which I detest.  I told the server right away and I didn't get a replacement until after I had already finished the soup and bread sticks.  Mind you she brought the drink before any of the food, and I told her before she brought any of the food.  I didn't get a refill until after a box was brought for my order. Pathetic! I love your iced tea and you deprived me of having it. The food came and I asked for a extra Alfredo Sauce on my Chicken Alfredo. I didn't get it, so I asked for it on the side.  10 minutes later she brought it and it was the smallest cup of nothing I have ever seen in my life, not even a full cup of nothing!  My order came with the buy one take one and I got the 3 cheese zitti to go.  When I got home to eat it, it was do disgusting it went straight to the dog.  My daughter ordered the lunch lasagna and the portion size she received was that equivalent to a Fancy Feast dinner you would feed you cat. You all know which dinners I am talking about.  I am done with Olive Garden.  Macaroni Grill here comes our lifetime business.  You have great iced tea, and Alfredo too. I did something I don't normally do, and I didn't leave a tip.  You don't go to a sit down location and not expect a drink."
