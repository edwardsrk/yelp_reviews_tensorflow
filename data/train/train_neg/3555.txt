b"This was one of the first salons I had gone to when I was new to the nail game. In the beginning I thought they did a good job, but after leaving and trying new places I realized they didn't. Looking back my nails were crooked and sometimes different lengths. I had asked for a marble nails design once and it looked like zebra instead. I would try another place for the amount of money they charge and the quality of work they provide."
