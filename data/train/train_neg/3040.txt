b"If it wasn't the service that was good this place would be a 1 star. The fish belly was fried. The sashimi was not fresh. The dish and plate didn't feel clean. The crab leg was a joke and I'm not even going to mention it. The clam same thing. A tiny whatever with mayo sauce heated. The ginger milk look disgusting."
