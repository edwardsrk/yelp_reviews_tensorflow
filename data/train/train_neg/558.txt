b'Worst airline ever! Very sad they are merging with US Airways, hence they both are terrible. I wish AA would just go out of business. Not only is their staff rude and not helpful at all they are just terrible. It is worth spending an extra $100 or even more to fly with someone else. Their plane broke down and when I get back to ask for refund they want to give me a voucher to use their crap airline again. Not only did they tell me that I would get reimbursed for renting car to drive since they did not have another plane to fly us for 2 days but that they would reimbursed us for the trip. Once I got back to request for these they do not want to refund me at all but give me a trip voucher. We lost so much time and money since it took us 8 hours to drive and spend money to rent a car and fill up with gas. Such shit airline and customer service no wonder they are going down and have to merge with US Airways. They could care less what your situation is even if their airplane had mechanical issues and had no other planes for 2 days and too cheap to reimburse you for the trip since it made everything difficult. NEVER AGAIN AA. Oh and we had to transfer flights coming home and we were late and almost missed our transfer flight. The stewardess could care less to let us off the plane first to run to make our transfer flight. Since they all had boarded already they gave us crap for coming late when it was not even our fault. Think twice before ever booking with this airline. HATE AA and their staff!'
