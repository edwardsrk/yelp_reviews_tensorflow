b'Fraudulent. Handy seems great. It was great. Until they removed their phone number from their app and the internet and started billing me for cleanings that I DID NOT BOOK OR RECEIVE. When you cancel the returning service they will still bill you and there is no way to contact them. They stopped responding to my emails by the way. I have wasted so much time with my credit card company about being repeatedly charged for services and they wont respond to my emails. The BBB and federal government needs to be involved in stopping this'
