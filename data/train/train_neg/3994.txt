b'Nice people. Very friendly.  Provided some free garlic sticks while I waited for my pizza.  I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    While the pizza was worth $10, I would\'ve felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe).  The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just "so-so" such that I don\'t really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  Such is the case here.'
