b"I'm consistently frustrated by how difficult management makes it to eat here.  When I called ahead to make reservations for our party of four, I was told that they do not accept reservations for parties of less than six people, but that we would be fine if we got there by 6 oclock.We arrived at 530...and there was a 30 minute wait. I'll never go back- I prefer dining at establishments which respect my time."
