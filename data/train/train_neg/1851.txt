b'The supply service ended so I called them and they told me Pacific Pulmonary took over the business and to call them back in a few days.    I called again today and was waiting on hold for 18 minutes before hanging up to call my doctor for referral for another CPAP supply company.  The website is down too.  Great start too lose new customers PP.'
