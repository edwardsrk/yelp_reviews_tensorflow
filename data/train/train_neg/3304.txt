b"This is one of the nicer VZW stores I've had the pleasure of visiting.  However, the wait is always long and the gimmicks are always in play.  I only go when I have to.  The displays are live and you can play with various devices until your heart is content.  The salespeople are always locked in to whatever Verizon tells them they can or can't do.  The customer service is lacking when it comes to troubleshooting or satisfying a customer's true needs.  If you simply want to buy a phone, they are all over it!  Good luck!"
