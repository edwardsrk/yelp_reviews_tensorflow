b'Quite a selection of flavor choices!  That was probably the biggest positive.  Found the yogurt itself to have a funny aftertaste.  The quality of the yogurt was not nearly as good as Qoola or Tutti Frutti.  Toppings are the same at all the Fro-yo places so that was good.  Taste of the yogurt will probably keep me from returning.'
