b'I have given this place a try quite a few times during the past few years. I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It\'s not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named "Aloha" Kitchen, you\'d think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It\'s just not one time, it\'s consistently like this, no greeting at all!   The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That\'s probably why you get your food real quick!! It\'s already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen.'
