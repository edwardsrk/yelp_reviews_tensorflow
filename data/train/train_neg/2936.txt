b"I was very dissatisfied  with my first visit to this restaurant. I saw some nice pictures from friends and I wanted to experience the same. Early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes (big bone soup and lobster pho) as well as their coconut ice cream. I know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases I would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes. They didn't even do that or show much empathy to the fact that I was disappointed that they didn't have what I wanted. This staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant. What I got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service. At the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them. Then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of. In my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible , two is cause for concern, and three means they may need to fire their purchaser. They have good product but the business is amateur. My visit was 1/3/15"
