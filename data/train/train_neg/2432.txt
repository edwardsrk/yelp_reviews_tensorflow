b"Dr. BeeCroft is great, but unfortunately you will never know what your charged until the bills start rolling in. Every time I go, I'm told what is and isn't covered and then get bills with mysterious charges that they can never explain. Oh, this was put in a wrong day, oh well I guess it wasn't covered like we thought. Serious!? As much as I like Dr B, I will be finding a dr with more competent staff."
