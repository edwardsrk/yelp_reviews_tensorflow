b'If you look up the definition of hospitality in the dictionary the Flamingo is definitely not mentioned.  Terrible front desk service.  I usually don\'t mention people in specific but Emilio who "helped" deserves dishonorable mention for being one of the least help people I have ever experienced. I booked my room through booking.com and clearly my confirmation stated I had reserved two rooms . Upon check in I was told they only showed I had one room reserved.  I was told I would have to take the one room get out of line and figure it out on my own.   Not until I got a supervisor involved was I able to resolve the issue.  Never once did Emilio apologize to me or tell me anything about the amenities they hotel had to offer like the front desk associates around him.  I will not stay at Flamingo again.'
