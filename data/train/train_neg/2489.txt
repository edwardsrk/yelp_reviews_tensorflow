b"I am super disappointed with Loving Hut these days. Oh, when the shine comes off the newness... Actually, I think there's been a change of ownership. This place has been consistently really good for the past few years and then, Bam! One day I walk in and yup, something's wrong, no warm, strong aroma of blended spices. I pick up the menu and it's abbreviated, turned into an acronym of its former self. Worst yet, what's still left on offer has lost its flavour. Once again, food assembly, speed and the bottom line has become the goal. Less for more, sorry Loving Hut, I'm breaking up with you."
