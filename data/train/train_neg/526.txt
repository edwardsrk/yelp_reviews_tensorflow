b'Before you stay here, read the fine print, and expect the owner to exploit any situation to his advantage.I made a reservation for the weekend of the Toronto film festival on booking.com but by mistake reserved the following weekend. I realized the error when I showed up and they had no room for me. When I attempted to cancel, they still charged me for 60% of the original cost. Considering the nature of the error, and the fact that I actually did show up and want to stay there, it seems that Downtown B&B exploited the situation. They had several rooms available for the weekend that I booked, and so they lost no business from my reservation.'
