b"I've shopped here about three times because it is the closest one to my house but I have NEVER had a good experience. I'm rarely greeted, they never bother trying to help me find something and when I tried explaining I needed to exchange a shirt and return a dress because I was about to go to a funeral I was given the worst attitude, the lady looked so annoyed and actually mad at me. I work retail too and know that returns suck but the way she handled it was incredibly unprofessional. I also had my baby with me and she was getting fussy and she instead gave me store credit despite asking for a return. I'd rather drive twenty miles to the San tan torrid and feel welcomed. In fact, I was so hurt by the terrible service that I felt the need to call San tan and tell them how much I appreciate them because the Tempe marketplace location was so terrible. I will never be buying from Tempe again. I suggest no one else does either."
