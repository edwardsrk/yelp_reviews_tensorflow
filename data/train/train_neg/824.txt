b'Since my last review was turned down by yelp lets try again; It\'s been a while since we ventured to Sewickley for a meal, best way to describe Lola is an over priced version of Ave B but with less than perfect preparation and very few local choices. Server was surprised there was such a  thing as a "red zinfandel" so obviously the pairing question was a bad one. Appetizers were OK, We enjoyed the ambiance, place was dead for  Saturday night.  left most of the food on our plates, left a small tip and went home.'
