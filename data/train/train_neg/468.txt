b"Would have loved to meet her, but the rude office staff cut me off and hung up on me! Was told she runs 2 separate businesses- one for gyn only (was told I would not be allowed to mention the word hormones in my appt), and the second business for hormone management only. While I was trying to discuss if it would be worth it for me to come to a gyn where certain words are not allowed, receptionist cuts me off and says 'well ok thank you, good bye' then hangs up on me! Guess they weren't willing to listen long enough to get my business, definitely don't listen well enough to manage my care."
