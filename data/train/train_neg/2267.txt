b"Bad: the guy that runs this place will only treat you with respect if he deems you worthy.  Being close to my house, I used to stop in to pick up gear quick or get a repair but the owner was always rude.  Maybe because I was wearing a polo shirt or showered or something.  I don't know.  Good: free air pump in back on my way to work"
