b'2 stars for one main reason: I did not want to give 1 star because I did not give the place a chance to earn 3 stars. I left the property before sunset as it was not my type of place to stay (i.e. safe, clean, and relaxing).Better A/C units in rooms that are newer and less noisy. Better cleaning services that notice things like liquor bottles/caps under the table and bloody kleenex re-stuffed in the tissue box (that was a nice surprise). But most importantly, improve property security, I did not feel safe in this property. The casino had yelling, angry vagrants inside and out, and obvious drug use just outside on the sidewalk.'
