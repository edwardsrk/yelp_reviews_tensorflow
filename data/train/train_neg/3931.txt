b"I had high hopes for this place based on the ambiance and decor of the inside. It was very pretty and had a great feel, I was impressed when I walked in. However, I ordered two California Rolls to-go and I was not impressed food wise. It look good in presentation, but it just wasn't the greatest sushi I've ever had. I wouldn't order it again. I'm willing to give them a second change, try something different on the menu, but as of right now I have experienced better."
