b"I pondered ordering from here for over a year because they put a flyer on my door. The pictures look good reviews seemed ok also but when I got my food it was not good. Looking at it looked ok but when I tasted it the chow mein left a weird film in my mouth and the vegetables fried rice had a odd taste to it that Made me feel like the pan it was cooked in had burnt residue in it or something. I tried to eat it because I was hungry but the lie caught up to me and I threw it all away. I wouldn't waste my money again eating here. I wanted it to be good but it wasn't.  Im sick of people throwing slop together with sweet and sour sauce here in the valley and calling it Chinese food!! Why cant we get good Chinese food here in phoenix."
