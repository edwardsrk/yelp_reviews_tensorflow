b"I had high hopes for this garage and had taken my car there once for an inspection with good results.Last week I asked if they could change my oil. The man said to drop the car off on Thursday night and leave the key in the key drop, he would get the job done on Friday. I left the car in the lot, dropped the key in the slot, and came back for it on Friday afternoon even though I had no phone call telling me it was ready for pickup.To my surprise, the shop was closed during Friday business hours when I arrived! Nobody was around, the car had not been touched, my key was still inside the shop, and the phone number was going to voicemail. I left without my car.I called again on Saturday. Voicemail again. No car. Called again on Sunday. Voicemail again. No car. Finally someone answered on Monday. I told him I would be there to pick up my car in the afternoon and was told they would be closing early, and would be closed by the time I got there. Unbelievable.I managed to arrange to get my car back finally after FOUR DAYS. Luckily I was able to make do without it by bothering my friends and borrowing their cars when I needed to go somewhere, and had no emergencies, but imagine if I actually needed to use my own vehicle! Unprofessional and unacceptable. I would not recommend using this garage unless you are comfortable with not getting your car back for days with no communication because they decided not to work that day for some unknown reason.No apology. No discount. When I brought up the fact that they left me stranded for four days the man on the phone said 'that's between you and the other guy'... I will never take my car here again."
