b"Was excited to try location closer to us. Went in on non busy weeknight last week. Server was very quiet, couldn't hear her and not much of a people person. Put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later I asked if her meatballs were coming out. Oh I forgot to put them in. No apology or here let me grab them at no charge. So we just forgot about them. Had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot. Never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did. First and second half of pizza came out almost cold. Couldn't guess why on that. Only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time. Leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them. Will not return would rather drive extra distance to Scottsdale or just go to Pomo downtown Gilbert!"
