b"Disgusting!wow!!If rude and conceited behavior were highly valued, this place would rock the town.The very strange, cold reception that I received from the 50-plus-year-old Nazi woman, who seemed to run the front counter, would offend nearly anyone who has considerable customer service skills. Five stars if nasty treatment is what you're looking for. I was immediately turned off, and would hate to give them any of my money. Or my plumber's money."
