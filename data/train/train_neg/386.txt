b"This is my first post to Yelp. It has taken a lot for me to actually do this as I my self am in customer service. This McDonalds is horrible. It is filthy! I drive a lifted vehicle and you can see the floors and counters while I'm in the drive through , atrocious. I travel a lot and see a lot of drive throughs and this is bad. They're constantly out of supplies (Coffe, soda, ketchup).  I am currently sitting at a booth that half of the cushions are missing, no sign, tape or anything warning someone not to sit there. Because of convenience I try it once a month but I will drive the extra distance to another one. Please, someone raise the standards.OMG. I just checked my order. Took them 3 times to get it right......"
