b'Waited 30 minutes no help - finally got help, waited 20 more minutes for them to say they couldn\'t find the charger for the drill I wanted  - than $5 off a drill that was 2 times more expensive - they basically told me to get out - go somewhere else this place is a joke - asked what was taking so long and I was told "man we just transferred here everyone complains about this location".....'
