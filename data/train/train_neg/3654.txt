b'It\'s not good. I ordered the pork tacos, and while the pork was delicious and tender, it was advertised on the menu as being "street style" but what arrived were flour tortillas. It was my mistake for not reading more closely, and they tasted fine, but the problem was the "street style" referred to them coming with onions and cilantro on the side. They did come on the side, of a plate so hot that I almost had a facial. The plate had spent time in an oven, then had fresh lettuce, onions, and cilantro plunked down... so it was almost like a fajita! Except that I didn\'t want cooked onions and cilantro. It also came with a lime. Fresh lime squirted on tacos is delicious. I managed to finally squeeze one drop from the shriveled lime I received. When I questioned the manager about the tacos and the hot plate he was very considerate and offered to replace the food, which was very nice.My daughter ordered tea and received water.We will never return. LaUnica is less than 7 miles away, and much much better for authentic street tacos.'
