b'My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a "patio" sorta), we chose to eat inside. It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a "c"...)Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO. Last time I believe a New Times food review. Come here for some eye rolls and bland food. PS-Perhaps the owners should establish a "complaint section" away from customer\'s ears as it\'s not super impressive to complain about diners-especially when they can see/hear you.'
