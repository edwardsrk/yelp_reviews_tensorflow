b"Five dispatches were sent for me and none arrive.  Confronted one cab driver who turned out to be nice. Told me that all the drivers had been told not to go to Oakland because the congestion was terrible.  She surmised that they were deliberately ignoring the call.  It turned out to be a ten minute trip and she received a nine dollar tip.  Dispatchers began hanging up on me. I was lied to several times - told that you couldn't books fares online anymore and etc. Very disreputable company with sleazy and amoral employees. Update July, 2018: why is Uber under attack? This is a perfect example of why I avoid cab companies."
