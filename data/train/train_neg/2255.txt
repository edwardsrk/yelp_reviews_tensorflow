b"I have been going to McDonalds a lot lately since I have been constantly on the road, and it's cheap. Usually McDonalds is pretty good about how neat the food is presented, and the other night I decided to swing by here on my way home real quick. I ordered a mcdouble, hot n spicy, and fries. When I got home, the fries were cold (it was only a 5 minute drive home), and the mcdouble and hot n spicy were the messiest sandwiches I have ever had. Granted, it all still tasted good, it's $3, you can't really expect too much I guess. It's just that other McDonalds have been very good lately so this caught me off guard."
