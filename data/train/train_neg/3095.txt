b'I\'ve been to this Shoeless Joe\'s location on quite a few occasions, and have been to a few parties in their bar as well. The thing about this Shoeless Joe\'s, is that I want to love it, I really do... but I just... don\'t. Why do I want to love it? Well the staff are super-friendly, and the space is amazing! They have a sports-centre in the back of the bar area with reclining leather chairs and wall-to-wall screens. They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. So why don\'t I love it? Well I\'m extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick\'s Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a "wonder-bread" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you\'re paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better! I\'ve been a few other times and have had salads (which are decent) and also they make an excellent Caesar, which have little pepperonis as a garnish! Their food on a whole though... is just okay. I really think it\'s the fact that I love the staff that will keep me going back... but they will probably keep disappointing me on the food-front!'
