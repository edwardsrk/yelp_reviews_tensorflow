b"First I'll say that the service is OUTSTANDING! Possibly the best I've ever experienced!!And, second, I hated the food. I'm sorry--I'm sure it's good for many of you out there that love cheese, bacon and butter. I tried to order some non-greasy sounding vegetable sides but they were so heavy in cream and butter than I ended up only taking a few bites of each.I'm from the south and really, sometimes I would just like a southern place that does justice to what we ate most of the time--freshly picked field peas and a side of buttermilk cornbread with some serious raw fixin's on the side like green onions right out of the garden, freshly picked tomatoes and cucumbers and some home-canned jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers (and once in awhile a side of fried okra). None of those were cream, butter and meat-laden and they were still awesome and yummy!"
