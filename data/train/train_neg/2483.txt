b"Location is great, very close and convenient for me, but the prices are too high compared to other stores and the product doesn't seem so fresh. We purchased watermelon 2 times, a medium size one, not organic or even close to it. Both times we cut the watermelon and it was the worst watermelons ever bought. Price almost $4 for 1 watermelon . Another time I was in there the gallon milk I buy from Sprouts is about $6.50, I bought from here $8.50 . I guess for a quick run its ok but I will not be buying my weekly groceries from here. I wish they brought a Sprouts market here instead. The best store ever!!!!!!"
