b'I have eaten here a few times.  The food is always good.  Not great, good.  I usually hit TBones in Summerlin.  TBones is always right on.  Hank\'s can take a lesson from TBones.  I ordered the petite filet.  I ordered it medium rare.  The steak was served to me rare..borderline raw.  It was chewy.  I told my server and he politely and understandingly took it back for a little more fire.  The filet was returned....possibly a new piece if meat.  As I started into it, all was fine.  However, once I hit the center, it was raw....again.  The server cleaned plates and asked me how everything was.  Now, the remains of a raw piece of meat on my plate should be a red flag.  But it wasn\'t.  I told him that the center was raw and he.....apologized and asked if we wanted dessert.  No thanks!Here is my takeaway....  Stick with TBones.  Service at Hank\'s is ok, but the servers need a lesson on "plate clues".   If there is a raw piece of meat on the plate, figure something is up and don\'t just jump to dessert.  Offer a free dessert, offer to take the raw piece of meat off the bill.  Neither happened.  Stick to TBones!!!I'
