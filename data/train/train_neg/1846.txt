b'Although everyone was very nice, good d\xc3\xa9cor and decent service, the food was overpriced, portions small and food just generally not good.The waitress tried to sell us 2nd portions of certain items as there were only 3 pieces for our party of 4.  After we ordered, the runner then told us for an upcharge, they would have put a 4th piece on the plate.The ox tail croquettes were burned, the large lettuce leaves overwhelmed the pitifully small portion of Peking duck, the pot pie  balls were dry... you get the idea.Thank goodness they gave us cookies at the end for my birthday, otherwise my party would have left hungry.I predict that they will be closed within a year unless they bring in Bar Rescue!!!!'
