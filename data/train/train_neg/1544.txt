b'DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME HEREIf only I had the option to give this place 0-star! This place reached out to me when they came across my resume online. I was hoping to find a professional job out of state and was asked to come in for an interview.Met with Sherry who displayed very little professionalism! Red flag signs throughout the interview as she indicated that the person who I was on the phone with was "let go" and interrupting me as I explained my current job position to comment that the insurance industry that I work in is such a terrible industry. Irrelevant comments/opinions that she did not need to share with me! So unprofessional! She said she would communicate with me during the process and reach out to other offices to help find me a job in my desired state. I had not heard from her for about 2 weeks and no response after I sent a followup email. The degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here.I\'m guessing this place must have high turnover rates. And also heard that appleone is the lowest in the tiers of recruiting agencies. Wish I knew that before wasting my time with them! Word of advice, avoid this place as there are much better recruiting agencies out there.'
