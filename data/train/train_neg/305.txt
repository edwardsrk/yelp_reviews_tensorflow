b"I didn't HATE the place! Hate is a strong word but I wouldn't come back again for its food! My friend says that people come at night and drink. I came here during the middle of the afternoon and I didn't enjoy my experience here. Food: They had a lot of asian fusion. I for one, despise Asian fusion cuisine! It's just weird... if i want Asian food, I would get asian food. Unless I have no other alternative... I ordered a burger there and it tasted OK. Not something i would pay that much for again. The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. Service: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. The atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated. IDK if that's intentional or not."
