b"Came here with my cousin who was visiting from Fort Bragg because I had heard solid reviews from others. He got the Mahi Mahi tacos which he said were average. The fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about.I had the chicken tacos which were so watery that the tortilla they came on was soggy, damp and crumbling apart before it even reached my table. That should've been my first sign.There must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.Anyway, I ate a good portion of the tacos and began feeling sick about 45 minutes later. Spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable.I will never go back here."
