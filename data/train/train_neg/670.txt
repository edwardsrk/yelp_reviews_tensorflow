b"Nothing special here. Being from New England I expect a hot dog joint to carry a large variety of dogs and buns. This place was just like any other. Here are my disappointments.1. No New England style buns. They didn't even know what they are and the cook looked at me funny. To me this is insane, the bun is the second most important part next to the type of hot dog. A cheap potato bun doesn't cut it.2. I asked for my bun to be buttered and toasted, again they were unable to do this and looked at me funny again.3. I wanted my dog boiled and charred, again they don't do this. I am okay with boiled dogs and would have gone that route but they didn't even offer them boiled! Head scratcher on that one.4. The only natural casing dog they carried came as a foot long. I did order this and it was good. I wish they carried natural casing dogs in regular size as I was not too happy with the price of having to order a foot long.5. Service was slow, not friendly and they seemed rather irritated I asked question. Also ordering was confusing with all the people behind the counter you would think someone would want to take my order. They must not be that hungry for money.On one positive I did enjoy the onion rings. They kind of reminded me of the ones served at Wahlburgers in Hingham Ma.Any case, if you are from New England be prepared to be disappointed. I had high hopes seeing this was a franchise from New York, but then again New York is not part of New England.Late,"
