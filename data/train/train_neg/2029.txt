b"I've had both good and bad experiences at this location.  It may be far fetched to expect at least DECENT customer service.  I know it is a fast food restaurant and the cashiers are likely making minimum wage, but come on!  At least be happy you have a job (for now) and stop treating people like crap.The only thing that keeps me coming back is that it is a 24 hour drive thru and really hits the spot if you've been drinking.  Although, if you hit it at the same time as the rest of the drunks, the line can be really long, and it seems like the food takes forever sometimes (although I will not complain, at least it is fresh)."
