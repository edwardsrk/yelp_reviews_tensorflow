b'NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!  You will regret it.    It took me over 7 hours to get a room.  The front desk staff or awful!!  No customer service.   I will never stay at this Westin or any because of my experience.I had 9 employees with me.  We spent 11K at this hotel for the week.   All of us had to wait over 7 hours for a room.  The reason we  were told even after we complain to the corporate Westin was the following:  " As stated this was our peak check in time" WTF People!!!!    Every hotel has a peak time.   I travel every week for work.  I have Never had to waited 7 hours for a room.Then after waiting this long.  I go to my room and it had NOT been cleaned from the previous guest.  I go back down to the not so friendly front desk.  And I was told.  "yes it is"   I said no it is not.  Room service from the previous night is still in the room.  the sheets or on the floor and trash is everywhere.  I was told  "Well the computer says it is"   Do you still want this room?   WTF!!  really!!!   I had to wait another 45 minutes to get a room.   Then I get to this room  NO WATER!!!!     I did not have any Hot water for the four days I was at the Westin.    POOR  POOR  POOR SERVICE and they do not care..   No gift shop.  No place to get bottle water, coke etc.    DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE!!!   It is ran by and bunch of idiots!!'
