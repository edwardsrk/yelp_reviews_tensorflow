b'If you\'re stuck at this part of the Old Port and you have nowhere else to go, ok. Otherwise, there are bunch of other places in Montreal with 10 times better service. The food is ok, nothing special. But I think they don\'t think their customers as returning customers they don\'t really care about the service that much. If you\'re a tourist in Montreal, it means that you have the time to take the cab or the metro to go places. Spend 20 more minutes and go to Lawrence, Manitoba or VORO. Eat better, experience a nicer place. At the end, that\'s why you\'re visiting Montreal!If you\'re a local, I\'m pretty sure you won\'t go here anyways, unless your friends are like "Oh, we found this place but don\'t remember the name. Let\'s go there." then you end up here.'
