b"Staff could of been a little more friendly. Order and pay first than sit buzzer goes off get your food they will not bring it to you even if you are sitting at their counter. Don't get your drink until your food gets done unless you pay separate.  Took way to long to cook the burgers they were just okay not great especially for the price."
