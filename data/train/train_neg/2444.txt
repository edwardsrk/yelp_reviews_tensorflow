b"So much MSG, oil, and salt! We felt so gross afterwards that we immediately went to Smith's to stock up on fruits/veggies for a raw food/juicing diet. True story.We ordered:1) Duck Fried Rice--It was so salty! I felt like they poured in a cup of soy sauce and spoonfuls of msg into that dish. Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.Service was decent. Even though we came at a busy hour, the waitresses were still attentive to us and quick with our orders.Our total meal came out to be $22 including tax/tip."
