b"I went into this store yesterday and it was horrible!!! It was sooooo dirty. I'm talking there was trash everywhere!!!  Not only that but it smelled like trash! It was 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon so I completely understand it being a little messy but the store just looked horrible!!! Not to mention the were out of pretty much everything on the store. I honestly will probably start going down the road to the next Smith's."
