b'Have taken my dog here once before to Holly (my neighbor referred me to her). Holly did an excellent job and I rescheduled with her. Had to change my appt and was put with someone else that was available on the day I needed. I called to double-check the appointment time only to find out my appointment was never moved to the new day and that now I couldn\'t get in. HUGE inconvenience because my doggie is getting surgery and that\'s why I moved the date up. I realize errors will be made but come on! And when I reminded the scheduler about our original conversation and guessed that he just "forgot" to make the switch, he put me on hold and someone else got back on with a lame excuse. Poor customer service...I won\'t go back, even as good as Holly is.'
