b"If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks. If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's."
