b"Maybe we caught it on a really bad day. My friend's brisket was mostly fatty pieces and this was after they had to take the plate back because she ordered chopped and it was brought out as a hunk. The Mac and Cheese was crunchy like it was not cooked properly. This was after the dish was replaced because the first one was rock hard. The hot chicken was bland and the only crowning glory was the cornbread, which was delicious. My friend said this was probably the worst BBQ that she has had here. Definitely won't be back."
