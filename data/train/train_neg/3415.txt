b"First off I have to start by stating there are two Maki Restaurants right next to each other.  There is Maki I (no teppanyaki) and Maki II (has teppanyaki).Maki I (the restaurant with no Teppanyaki) is absolutely terrible.  The food is awful and the restaurant smells like lake Ontario when it smells like fish.  It was really bad and I didn't want to eat there but did.Maki II (the restaurant with Teppanyaki) used to be really good when they first opened.  Then the restaurant just went downhill.  I tried it a few more times after my amazing experience and they always seemed to disappoint me.  The waiter would glare at you when you ordered more food (Ayce Sushi) and you could tell they didn't want you to really eat that much.  When I did Teppanyaki the last time they were out of all of the expensive fishes.  We could only order some of the inexpensive fish on the Teppanyaki menu which costs over $28.00 per person (I can't remember the actual price).  I definitely left unsatisfied and don't plan on going back."
