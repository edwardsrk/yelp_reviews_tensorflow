b"I went here on Saturday for the breakfast special but turns out it's only available on the weekdays, fair enough. So I went again on a Wednesday around 7:20am and it was not even open yet. I saw 2 other cars waiting outside but I just left right after I saw there no lights on and no staff inside. That's ridiculous.. they must have some irresponsible staff working there."
