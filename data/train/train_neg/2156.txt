b'I called early Saturday morning to make an appointment for a gel manicure and a pedi and just a regular manicure for my niece.  They were able to work with the time I asked for and when I went in there was not much of a wait. My pedicure was great and the people that worked there were very nice! But the quality of the work was not the best. I know I am a walk in and not a priority but I pay just the same and feel that I should have walked out with the best nails my hard earned money can pay for.  My nieces manicure had to completely redone and the polish didnt cover the entire nail on each finger. They were nice and redid them.  My nails some are round some are square and my glitter nail has pink under the silver.  I gave 2 stars because they were very nice but the quality work I had done was not worth the money I paid.  I do have pictures but this is my first review and do not know how to post them'
