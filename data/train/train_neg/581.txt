b"This may possibly be my worst dining experience. I've heard terrible things about the service at Smoky's, but I LOVE checking out local restaurants. It'd be nice to have good BBQ you don't have to wait forever for like at Black Dog. A group of 5 of us came and their menu was completely different than what it showed online. Our server was in a sour mood and spoke in a condescending tone when we didn't realize the sauce was on the table as the menu says to ask your server for sauce. My son ordered the kids ribs, they were received cold and dry. When I mentioned it to the server, she was shocked. She couldn't believe it because she said it just came out of the hot box. This was our first and only visit. I will not be back."
