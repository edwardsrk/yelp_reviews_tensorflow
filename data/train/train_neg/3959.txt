b'They have interesting and quality fitness gear, that\'s for sure. But they need obviously more "hot or not" staff. The guys there yesterday were more interested in two hot girls, and not in the tiny geek who wanted more info on fitting small running shoes. Basically, I was told "yeah, wear thick socks or go to New Balance".  I went to Running Room TO GET HELP BECAUSE I HAVE SMALL FEET, and people who are supposedly experienced tell me to go somewhere else? I will, I am sure. TL;DR: I wear size 5-ish, they hate me.'
