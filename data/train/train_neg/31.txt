b"SCAMMERS!If you pay your tab in cash...make sure you DO NOT forget your card (credit or bank). If you do, when you go back to pick it up, they'll charge your card for the total amount of your bill...AND...you may find additional fraudulent charges like I did. In the day that management had my card someone purchased an item from  Barnes and NobleCredit and a Credit Report. Now that's customer service."
