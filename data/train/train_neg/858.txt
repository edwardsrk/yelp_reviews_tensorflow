b"TRULY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! This place isn't fancy enough to be so snobby. My husband and I went here for his birthday tonight, and we were immediately ushered upstairs. This would have been fine, but once seated they told us they don't do happy hour upstairs. Weird rule, but okay. After the waiter brought our chips and drink... he... never... came.... BACK. He literally served every table around us, and left us sitting in a corner awkwardly and hungrily. Finally, I just got up from the table and asked another server to cash us out. It was the weirdest and rudest experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Never going back."
