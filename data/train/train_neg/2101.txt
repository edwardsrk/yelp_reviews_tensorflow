b'sadly I have to write a bad review, I got food poisoning from here, I called to speak to the manager just to inform, but when I asked for the manager one of the employees told me to call back later, so I did, then I kept trying to call back and I never got an answer. Other than that when I ordered the food, the front service was very polite and nice.'
