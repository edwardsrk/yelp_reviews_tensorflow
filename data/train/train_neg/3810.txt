b'Decided to give this place a second try after really poor service the first time.  Service was greatly improved this time, server was very friendly and attentive.  Decor was lacking, the place needs a redecorate.  Food was really good but I found hair in all the four dishes we ordered.  Figured the first one was mine as it was the same colour (I\'m blonde) but then kept finding them, it was gross and I\'ve never had that experience before.  I probably won\'t go back as now I\'ll always think of it as that "hair" place'
