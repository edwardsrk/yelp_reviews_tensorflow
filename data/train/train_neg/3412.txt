b'We were seated and a mature lady gave us one menu and said she would get us another one. After around 10 minutes  she came back with menu and asked if we wanted a drink. She seemed irritated that we wanted Negra Modelo. Why? She brought it and water and we ordered. No smile again. Meanwhile  she chatted with other customers and took her time with them. Several nice helpers asked if we wanted more  salsa and chips. Our server walked by several times and never asked. By now all beer is gone and she did not ask if we wanted more. When she finally brought the food she just plopped it down and started to walk away.  My partner asked if he could have more beer. She looked at me and said with an air of annoyance, " and YOU too?" We won\'t return!'
