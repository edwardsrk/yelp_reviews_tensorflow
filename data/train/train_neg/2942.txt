b'Cool ambiance.  Completely overpriced menu with mediocre food.  Lobster pot pie was over baked and tasted like a frozen one.  Sea bass was cooked nicely, but the rest of that entree was soupy and unappealing.Flatbread pizza was good, although a bit pricey.  The wine by the glass options were extremely limited.I expected more.'
