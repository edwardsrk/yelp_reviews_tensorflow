b"I'm not sure if I will be back. Some of the shrimps in one of our dishes still had some tails on which was hard to tell since they were breaded and had sauce on it. It is an unpleasant thing to chew on!! The chicken was way too lemony. The pot stickers were too crunchy, the sushi was warm. We had also ordered the lettuce wraps and the amount of meat in general in all our dishes was mediocre. The vegetable was also grated carrot basically. You had to look for the other vegetable . Quite disappointing!"
