b"They listed 2 cars on the internet (bait cars).  I arrived and the salesman said yes they have them and walked me around the lot stopping me at 'other' cars to find that neither of the 2 listed cars were still available.  But wait,check out this VW EOS.  I said no please dont wast my time, please.  He said we can get you into this one, it's the end of the month.  I argued right off the bat saying my time is critical that I not waste it.  He assured me I can get into that car.  Long story short, it didnt happen.  I complained the next morning via email and got a call from manager telling me because of my hardship they have agreed to offer me a brand new altima sedan for 17,800!  He sent me a link to this actual car but did not realize it had the price on it at $17,100.  He offered me a 'great dea'l on a car I have no interest in and for a higher price than they have it listed for!  I asked for the owners contact info 2 times and never received.I went to Moore's in Peoria the next day and purchased that same EOS fot $4000 less,and  nicer. They also threw in a 3 yr powertrain warranty.  That is how a good business succeeds. I will also make a point to rave on their reviews."
