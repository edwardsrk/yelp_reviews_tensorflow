b"Absolutely terrible service. Ordered take out, showed up at the time they told us it would be ready. Sat at the bar for 20 minutes without a server or bartender asking us if we wanted a drink or talking to us at all. Over an hour after our food was supposed to be ready, the guy, supposedly the owner, comes up and hands us the bill. It was very overpriced. He didn't apologize and didn't explain why it took almost TWO HOURS to make 4 people's take out Chinese food. The food was also terrible quality. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, I'd give it a three at most. I had beef chop suey that had very little flavor, and my brothers both had chicken chow mein that had almost no noodles in them. The staff was inconsiderate and there was no excuse for their tardiness, as there was maybe 5 other patrons in the restaurant. There are many other good Chinese/Asian restaurants in the area, and needless to say, I will not be coming here again."
