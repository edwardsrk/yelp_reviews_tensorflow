b"Unfortunately it did not go well. The service was friendly but when I got my take out home I found there was hardly any sauce on the pad se ew so it had no flavor. I had to make my own sauce and add it. Then I was enjoying my fresh spring rolls when I found a bug smashed on the piece of lettuce that was under them. Not very appetizing to say the least. I probably won't be back since both dishes I received had issues."
