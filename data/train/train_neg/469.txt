b'I stopped in at this restaurant for a quick lunch. I have never been here before, but knew it had been here for some time. I asked the male and female counter attendants about their slice pizza and was told $4.99 including drink. They told me the slice was 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I ordered a slice and drink. After about 10 minutes the slice was delivered to me. I instantly asked the server if this was the 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I was told yes. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The slice was mostly outer edge crust that barely done. The rest was a very small triangle. The sauce was sweet tomato-e. The cheese topping was a mix of mozzarella and provolone. The cheese was of poor quality and sparse. There was paper thin pepperoni on top.  It was not worth $1.00 much less $3.99 (without drink). Employees did not seem to care. I will not return!'
