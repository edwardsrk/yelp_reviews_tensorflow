b'Update- She said she would rebuild my band at no cost and without getting the insurance. We agreed to that only if she would write up paperwork saying if any stones fell out of either ring she would give us a refund. She agreed and said she would get the paperwork to my husband that same day- 9 days later, after hearing nothing, I emailed asking about it. She emailed my husband & said we could use the email as her paperwork bc it has her name on it. Really??? Not to mention her exact words for the guarantee were "we will warranty the wedding about against any stones falling out for 6 months after you pick up the new band"- no, you\'re not reading that incorrectly, those were her words. Confused? Yep. Us too. My husband asked her to include the engagement ring in the guarantee so he could then he could let our council review it. She copied & pasted that exact line I quoted & resent just that statement-That\'s what she wanted us to show our lawyers. Talk about a joke. This has gone on far too long. I haven\'t worn my rings since August-after the 8th diamond fell out. All I want is my ring. A ring I don\'t have to worry about a diamond falling out if I wash my hands while wearing it. This is absolutely the worst customer service ever. You would think, with HER name being the name of the business, and the fact she\'s on the county council, she would be a much more professional business woman. This is a nightmare that just won\'t stop. We filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on 10-2-17. I haven\'t heard a thing from her business, she has yet to reply to the BBB either. This is not a surprise though. I will update once we have hopefully settled this unnecessary situation.'
