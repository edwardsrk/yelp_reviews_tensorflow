b"Absolutely and positively the worse customer service ever. I purchased a new iPhone and went it to see if they could transfer all my stuff from one iPhone to the new iPhone. He said that they weren't able to do that because they don't have WiFi capabilities. I've had co workers tell me that their carrier ATT did it for them with no problem. I couldn't get Verizon to do it nor did he even bother to look at my phone. Low and behold the new iPhones you just need to put your phone side by side and it pairs from the other phone. If the unhelpful employee even knew anything or even gave me more than a minute he MIGHT have been able to give me that tad bit of information. Great employees you are hiring Verizon! Keep up the good work on selecting employees that lack the motivation to help others when your store is completely empty and hd couldn't take him 5 minutes or less to help someone out. This is the 3rd time we've been in a Verizon store and the employees have been lacking in customer service. The other Verizon store that lacked Good Customer service is the one on Eastern and St. Rose. Hopefully ATT or TMOBILE will get better with their  coverage so we can leave Verizon soon."
