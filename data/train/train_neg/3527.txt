b"8:30a on a Saturday.  Expected a crowd., but it's fairly empty. Seated immediately and waitress was attentive and brought beverages quickly. We ordered eggs over and fried chicken and my wife got eggs and bacon.  We waited 15 minutes for the food. My fried chicken need some additional time in the fryer. It was soggy. Eggs were cold. :(   My wife's order for crispy bacon didn't work, but her eggs were warm. We weren't impressed with the texture and taste of their super biscuits either. If it wasn't for our excellent waitress, I'd have given this place one star.  We won't be back for pricey and poor food."
