b'Looking at my nails this past week has been extremely disappointing. I paid $40 to be embarrassed how terrible my nails look. I came in and had a backfill which I haven\'t had in years so I was asking questions about the process. Apparently offending the man doing my nails, as he informed me he had 20 years of experience and insisted on rudely "showing" me each nail as he went along. The good thing is he got is resentment out.. On my actual nails. The surfaces are clearly filed down leaving huge and noticeable markings. Again I am so embarrassed by my nails at this point and will have to switch back to a full color rather than pink and white in order to cover up him grinding down the surface of my nails. The miserable process dragged on for over an hour.. Just to top it of off he applied the gel coat but missed large portions making my nails uneven and prone to miscellaneous spots being discolored. Never going back that\'s for sure!'
