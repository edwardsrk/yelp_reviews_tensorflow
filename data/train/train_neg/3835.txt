b'Lobby and casino look good.  But this hotel is old and in need of much upgrades.  The hallway on my room floor looks/feels like an old parking garage.  The room was big and clean. But the bathroom super small and cramped   Vanity cracked with a terrible paint job.  No fridge/coffee pot. Walls too thin. So much potential here. In need of major renovations. In the end, you get what you pay for.  So treat yourself better.'
