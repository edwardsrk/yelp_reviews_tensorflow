b"After raving about Harlem Underground to people, it pains me to have had a mediocre experience there. We were a group of six hungry diners who were ready to eat. We ordered caesars and red stripes, a round of appetizers, mains and sides. The server was not able to give a recommendation and seemed terribly confused. Our apps came without a hitch, the catfish layfeyette (battered and fried catfish) was moist and well seasoned with two dipping sauces, but the crawfish in chilies was underwhelming and overly finicky for the taste experience. Our server seemed to stop noticing us at this point, we had difficulty having drink orders fulfilled. When our mains arrived they hadn't remembered to order one of them. The rest of us awkwardly ate our entire meal while our friend waited for almost 20 minutes for his food. There was no profuse apology or rush to get it out once they realized their mistake. The fried chicken was good enough, but waffles and gravy was stone-cold. The mac n' cheese was bland. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, which isn't enough for me to want to return. To top it all off, groups of 6 or more have an automatic tip on the bill - when the main didn't arrive, we expected it to be discounted at the very least and we did not intend on tipping the full amount. After we asked awkwardly, they deducted 50% of the main from the bill. So much drama when all we wanted was some good ol' fried chicken."
