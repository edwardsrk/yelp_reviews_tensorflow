b"La Comida was not our first choice for dinner, but after attempting to eat at three other places, it was the only joint that was open and didn't have an hour wait. It was late on a Monday night, so it wasn't even close to crowded. However, the service was some of the worst that I have ever experienced. Getting water refills and the check was painfully slow.The food was overpriced and uninspired. You expect fajitas to come out sizzling on a hot cast iron, but there was just a small hunk of meat and a lot of veggies on a plate. The carnitas tacos were dry and underwhelming, and did not come in the pulled pork form that I am accustomed to eating. My margarita was not much better. I feel like this place spends more energy trying to look impressive with the decor and fancy names for menu items than it does on its food and service."
