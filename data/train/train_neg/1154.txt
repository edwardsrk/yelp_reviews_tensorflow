b"I'm handicap with great difficulty walking  and visited the restaurant on Sunday 06 Nov 2016 around 1pm.  We entered through the concourse level since we parked in the underground.  We stood at the back entrance and the waitresses said they had no table available on the upper level.  So I hand to hold onto my partner since we had to descend 3 steps.  I was handed my rollator/walker once on the lower level.  The waitresses directed us to an empty table near the front.  We proceeded to the table and sat down.  We asked the waitress for menus, but were ignored.  A female supervisor came over after 5 minutes and told us to get up and join the line at the front of the restaurant.  I told her that the waitresses at the rear directed to the empty table.  Another 5 minutes went by now the manager Joe Bagorro came over and told us to get up now since there were 5 parties waiting ahead of us in line.  He told us we had LIED about the waitresses in the rear directing us to this table. Why on earth would we lie?  Since we had been seated, over 5 parties had been seated, so we are to get up and now go to the end of the line with who knows how many had come after us.We just left.  Totally inconsiderate management and made me feel ashamed to be at a disadvantage.  Poorly handled situation with total disrespect for my disability. As a result of this, we will NEVER again visit any Fran's locations.I had been a patron of Fran's since the early days on St Clair Ave West.We also had to pay $7 for the underground parking for almost being thrown out."
