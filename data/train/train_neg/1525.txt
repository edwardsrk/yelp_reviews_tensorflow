b'Stayed at the Palazzoo so this was one of the places in the hotel itself. Walking by in the morning, we decided to stop by after dinner for some desert. Came in at 10.30pm and saw the amazing array of treats. My wife sampled 2 and decided while son was still deciding. I asked for a sample and was ready to order when I saw creme brule flavor and asked her for another sample. The tired looking, rude lady that was working (this is on Apr 12 Saturday 2015 if the managers care about customer care), rudely said only 2 samples per person. I said ok so I need a sample of the creme brule. She rudely said sorry no more. I walked out of there. She saw that most of my family was ready to order and only I was the one still deciding, but she still was so rude. Not recommended at all.'
