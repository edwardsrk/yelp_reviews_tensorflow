b"This place is your run of the mill older / outskirt large casino. Comparable to a Coast casino or something like that if you are picking up what I'm throwing down.It's great for a cheap game of craps and a way to spend some time with old folks. After my experience I'm not sure if I'd throw anymore money at the food here, but at least they've got a theater to burn some time at too."
