b"Fix the elevators! I stayed at the Flamingo for 5 days and 4 nights and only 2 elevators worked at one time (by the end of my trip, only 1). A group of 50 people or more would always be waiting in the elevator section waiting for one to finally come down. The average waiting time would be about 15-20 minutes. One night, we decided not to go out because we didn't want to have to brave the elevators. Once we finally found stairs, they were in one of the most sketchy stairways I had ever seen and it led us out a side exit of the hotel.The room was perfect. I have no complaints about the room and cleaning ladies.Check-in was horrid. All weekend, the lines were LONG. We got lucky and checked out on a Monday morning at 7am with no line. But any other time, you spent 30-60 minutes in line.The flamingo exhibit is great as well.$7 shuttles to and from the airport, non-stop.Get a bus pass (the Deuce) in front of Harrah's if you are visiting. It takes you up and down the strip."
