b'This place started out great, but the quality and service have really suffered. The staff is uncaring about your needs, and unresponsive to your requests.When seated, we were given glasses of lukewarm tap water, we were never offered refills on the drinks we ordered, coffee and iced tea.Food was mediocre at best. Two of us ordered eggs Benedict, which comes with poached eggs. At first, we were given the wrong meals, when the correct meals were brought, the eggs were not poached, they were hard boiled. My meatball eggs Benedict was mushy, and the English muffin was like a piece of soggy cardboard.They did comp the doughnuts we ordered, but this was still $77 that I wished I had spent somewhere else like Park Brouge in Highland Park. I was a regular customer, but I will not be returning.'
