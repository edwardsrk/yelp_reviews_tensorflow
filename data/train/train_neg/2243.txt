b"We had a coupon for $20 each ticket for this show, and I think it was still too much.We saw this show on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. But it seems pretty straightforward, right? Zombies. Burlesque. Cool.Out of the 75 minute show, I think we got about 15 minutes of actual burlesque. The rest of the show was the unfunny host talking... and talking... and making crappy jokes... and let me tell you, I am ALL about offensive jokes, but these ones were just tasteless and fell completely flat. I just wanted the host to shut up. They REALLY did not make it clear anywhere that this show is more of a musical and an ATTEMPT at a comedy. Even the burlesque we got was a little disappointing, because the girls were hardly made up as zombies, if at all! I didn't expect full body paint or anything (despite the banner for the show), but most of the girls just had some white paint on their faces and nowhere else on them, no blood, and one girl had NO zombie makeup at all!The stage is TINY, and all of the seats are on one level. Unless you paid extra for bench seats, you're screwed. At least we got free jello shots... good thing they were strong, because it was about a teaspoon of jello."
