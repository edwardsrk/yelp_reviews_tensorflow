b"Green House came highly recommended while we were in town, but we were disappointed in the service.  Our food, on a sunday night,  took exceptionally long and not once while waiting for our food, did our server come over and check on us to see if we needed anything until just before our food arrived.  Our entrees - everyone ordered burgers - took an hour. The meal started off on the wrong foot , as we waited for another table to leave from the patio to accommodate our group of 8, while an empty table that could accommodate us sat empty nearby. We finally had to ask if it was an option, and wound up getting seated there, 20 minutes after we were told we were about to be seated.  Presentation of our dishes was also lackluster. Thankfully, food was quite good, but the rest of the experience was frustrating enough we won't return."
