b'This a very SMALL museum and at $8 A head which includes anyone over 2 years old, My wife and did not think it was very good value for the money spent.With my wife daughter and granddaughter plus tax it was almost $35 for the four of us and it took maybe 30 minutes to go through. At the end I said "Is that all????" expecting more but it ended quickly even going out doors and walking the nature trail down to "Fort Wild" an outdoor play area. Now I wasn\'t expecting The Museum Of Natural History in Raleigh, and we did enjoy some of the exhibits, but at  $8 a head plus tax we were expecting way more than what we got.After our granddaughter finished playing outside, we went back through again to feel like we at least gotten a little more for our money. If your trying to find an activity with the kids to beat the heat this summer, this place won\'t give you a very big bang for your buck. Also with it as small as it is, we had several summer camps coming through with small children and it was getting way to loud in there, so thank goodness we were leaving.As most reviewers have said, save your money and go next door to Freedom Park, Its free!Two visits in one for us, first and last!'
