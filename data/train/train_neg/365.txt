b"This place is aweful. I got a drink and sandwich and didn't even walk out with a drink. I was on a hurry and the lady didn't give it to me. Guess that's how they make heir profit. The girls that work there are lazy. Don't greet you, and aren't too big on wanting to serve you. Also skimped out on the toppings."
