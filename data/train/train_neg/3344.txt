b"Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. The bar tender was quick to get me a beer (the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good) but after that I was totally ignored. Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. I got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to Uno's. Glad I did... Got great service and my meal came quickly.Verdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if that's what you want but if you're hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table."
