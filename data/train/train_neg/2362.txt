b'I had high hopes for Reyna. My family and I have been to the Hatch chili pepper festival for the past 2 years and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Although the food was good at Reyna the customer service left a lot to be desired. We got a table quickly but waited more than 20 minutes for anyone to even take our drink order. Then my husband got the wrong dish. It was really a bummer. I will try it again and I do hope they get the service thing figured out'
