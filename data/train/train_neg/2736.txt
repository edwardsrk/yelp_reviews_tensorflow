b"Pros:  cool building, nice view of the brewing equipmentCons:  beer is mediocre at best.. Tastes watered down, food is way overpriced, and the shrimp mousse appetizer thing is horrendous... I mean disgusting.  The chefs creations remind me of the crap I see on Gordon Ramsays kitchen nightmares where the chef gets excited with weird flavor combinations that don't jive... Plus bizarre glasses and food holders that are just annoying.  I will not return.  There's no value here."
