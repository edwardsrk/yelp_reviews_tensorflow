b"I waited at the speaker for at least 2 minutes before someone came on the speaker. I ordered my food. Carne Assad fries, no guacamole and sour cream. I pull around the bend and there was a grey Cadillac with a few people in it. They seemed to be friends with the drive thru person. They pull off within 15 seconds. I get to the window. It took at least 4 minutes before the guy came to the window to inform me, he put guac on my fries. Meanwhile in my car, I can hear a female and other employees laughing and having a good time. My problem is, if they weren't jacking around; they could have got my food right and not have me waiting in drive thru for 10-15 minutes. This isn't the first time. I work in this business, I know exactly how long it takes fries and meat to cook. Horse play is great but not at the expense of a customer."
