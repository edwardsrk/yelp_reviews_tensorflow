b"Great service without a doubt.  Decent space, though not particularly romantic (some harsh lighting in spots).   I've eaten there twice and while the food is fine, it's not something I'd return for.  Tonight I had a flatbread with goat cheese and eggplant and tomatoes. I think it was fine, but I'd suggest that it if it had been grilled, served hot, and maybe with a lemony dressing (as an example), it would have been a much better experience.  Similarly, the kale salad was okay, but the dressing was overly vinegary.  Nothing wrong with a simple oil/vinegar dressing, but it's also not something I go to a restaurant to experience. Overall, very friendly, respectful service with so-so food."
