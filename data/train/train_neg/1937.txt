b"I had the crab cake dinner. It was expelled by my lower body less than 15 minutes after I got home. DON'T EAT THE BAD SEAFOOD IN THIS PLACE!!!!We were dumb enough to try again. I had the Tilapia topped with crab. Terrible, Fish overcooked, dry. Crab was like eating cream of wheat. Please, I will never go back."
