b"This Famous Dave's was awful!  The only reason I didnt give it one star is because our waiter was so friendly. My husband complained that his Sprite tasted like dish water. I laughed him off thinking he was being particular. When he got his food he said his mashed potato tasted like medicine. So I decided to try it. Sure enough the mashed potatoes had a peculiar after taste and the Sprite did have taste like how dish water smells. My son said his burger was burnt. Took a look and the edges were burnt. Our food came out lukewarm. I get hotter food at my job's cafeteria. The corn was tasteless, like eating water. They need to change the distributor where the get corn from. Vons have great sweet corn on the cob, LOL!!! Im sick to my stomach to have spent the money I did on a HORRIBLE dinner for 4. I'll never, ever go back to this Famous Dave's and I'm on the verge of not going back to this chain all together. If you want good REAL BBQ stick to the mom and pops non chained non franchised places like TC Rib Crib, Big B's Texas BBQ etc. It seem like chain places dont put the effort or care into their food because they've made their millions and a name for themselves so why care."
