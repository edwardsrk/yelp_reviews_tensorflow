b"Went there to go to the movies, parking structure to the elevator, elevator has no a/c. Okkkkaaayyyy, walking down to movie theatre everything good. Go into theatre and very sticky and humid inside, sat down and seats squeak when your leaning back, not just mine, everybodys, then when the movie starts ( we seen Lucy by the way ) the suround  sound speaker was blown making a crackling sound . I don't know if this is a GVR isssue or a Reagle issue but if your going to compete with Brendan or century this is the little things that will not bring people back."
