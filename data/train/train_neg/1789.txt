b"Nothing worse than false specials.  We are all smart enough to know anytime you see buy 2 get one free or buy 2 get 2 free, you're really not getting 2 free.  They jack the prices up to make it very close to their true price.  I get that.  But come on m, 2 tires for 605.00 bucks .  So I drove down the road and was matched by pep boys.  No questions.  Got better tires and better warranties.  All I ask is to be a little bit honest.  This is why you never just purchase without verifying."
