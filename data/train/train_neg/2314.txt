b"Went there on Saturday night.  They weren't exceptionally busy, there was no wait and tables available, but they did have a decent crowd.  The service was VERY slow.  Once we were seated, it took over 8 minutes for the waitress to even say hi, and take our drink order.  We weren't in a hurry so that by itself wasn't an issue, but the slow, inattentive service continued.  We ordered the bbq plate and the half chicken plate.  The bbq and chicken were both good.   Neither was the best I've had, but both good.  The sides on the other hand were a whole lot of meh.  Between the service and sides, you can do better at other BBQ places in the area."
