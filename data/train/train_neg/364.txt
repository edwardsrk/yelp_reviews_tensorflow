b"I realllllllly wanted some minestrone soup!So, we went out to dinner, ordered our drinks and food at the same time (I ordered chicken alfredo w/ soup and my husband order tour of italy w/ salad).Got our drinks shortly after, he forgot to bring lemons for my water (I won't drink my water without lemons). Shortly after we got our drinks we brought out the salad and breadsticks, which was great. BUT, not my soup or lemons!! After the salad and breadsticks are completely gone, out comes our entrees, STILL NO SOUP! I had to ask for my soup and when I got it, it was horrible. The waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us.I seriously HATE going to this location, every time we go the service is HORRIBLE!Definitely will not be returning to this location, I would rather drive 15-20 mins to another location then to have to come back here."
