b"I've been there for brunch two or three times now and each time I go to service gets worse and worse. The restaurant has two hosts and is always short on waitstaff. The service is extremely slow I actually finished my second plate for brunch before they brought me my taste of a bloody Mary which was terrible and I did not get my drink until I was onto my third plate. I don't think we ever would've left had we not ask for a check."
