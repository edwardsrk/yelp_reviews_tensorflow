b"I've visited twice, and both times weren't exactly positive experiences.In terms of food, everything tasted okay by all means, but everything was a little on the bland side--flavours didn't really pop (and weirdly enough all the food looks... kind of pale?), but for fair-priced sushi and appetizers, I was honestly satisfied with what I paid for.My real issue was with the service.  Maybe during both trips the staff were just having bad days, but I was astounded by how blunt the servers were--the worst of it was on my second visit.  My group was welcomed in politely and halfway through eating, were asked if everything was okay, which so far it was, but when it came time to pay everything became so much more confusing than it needed to be.  The server seemed irritated that we wanted to split the bill according to what we'd each ordered and bluntly asked us how we wanted to round our payments--as someone on the shyer side, I was almost intimidated by her attitude.  We all ended up getting confused and pooled the money in a mess, which left them a bigger tip than we realized--which, after the fact, we had decided was hardly deserved.  I believe in the system of speaking with your wallet--anytime I have a bad experience, I still thank staff and leave quietly, and then promise myself not to come back, as was unfortunately the case here."
