b'Ugh, I get frustrated just to think about Sahra.  I didn\'t receive the service I purchased, and I really couldn\'t do much about it because like all other guests I had been asked to "pre-tip."  That\'s right, they tack an automatic 20% gratuity onto your services when you check in and if you didn\'t like something you\'ll never get the chance to mention it to them because it\'s out the door with you after you\'re done.  That all being said, the amenities were quite nice and I wouldn\'t mind spending a couple of hours there, but I wouldn\'t get a service again.  I left feeling a bit tricked.'
