b"So yesterday I go about 515 in the morning to get a couple Vente blonde roast coffee's she says I'm out only have enough to make one if you can wait five minutes I'll brew another pot I said no problem next thing I know the 2nd cup is ready already I asked her did you order that while it was brewing or waited till it was completed she took it from the first few cups that went through the grounds so the coffee was so strong it was like drinking a cup of espresso mud so this morning I go in bringing the cup of coffee back that was disgusting no apologies no I'm sorry I explained to her when you pour coffee from the pot before it is finished brewing your first few cups will be very strong and not tasting proper more like Chickory. So needed be said I have to go back to either my a.m. p.m. or my 7-Eleven for my coffee"
