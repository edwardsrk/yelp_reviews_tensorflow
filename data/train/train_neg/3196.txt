b"Lately I've been going to another place, but decided to give this one a chance again. I ordered a large breve latte with sugar free vanilla. Was about 6 dollars.  Other places give 3 shots of espresso in a large latte, they gave 2. And it tasted like it.  My drink ended up tasting like hot vanilla milk.  Pretty gross.  I think I'll pay the extra 15 cents at another place and get something that tastes good with 3 shots of espresso in it."
