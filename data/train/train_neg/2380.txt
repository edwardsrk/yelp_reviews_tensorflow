b"Visited this spot with a hungry stomach & a friend who wanted eggs. When walking in we didn't know if we seated ourselves or waited to sit down. The register is by the door & that specific space was a little cramped because so many people were coming into buy bread. The rest of the place is sort of small but lots of tables to sit at. When sitting down I quickly looked at yelp & wish I had taken the time out to actually read the reviews & know I should have tried the custard. However, the only thing I saw was that customer service was not too great so I was curious to see how our visit was going to be. Staff were so so. Not super friendly but friendly to their regulars. We ordered our beverages, me an apple juice & my friend a coffee & it honestly took a while to get to our table. We both got the omelet with Portuguese sausage & I added mushrooms to mine. The plate came with 4 huge slices of bread which was good & the omelet wasn't something I favored. The omelet was basic, I just overall wasn't impressed. I wish I had taken the time to read reviews & try their custard as people recommend & maybe then I would have had a different experience."
