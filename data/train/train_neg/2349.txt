b'The messages were great. Professionalism was just not good at all. The lady messaging my boyfriend phone rang 5 times during our session in messaging. Not to mention that his lady came in first and mine came in 5-10 minutes after. Cutting me short on time, as we "finished" both on time. As I was changing heading into the foot message area I was being hurried to put my clothes on to move rooms. Her exact words were "hurry please" as she\'s moving me out the room and I am still zipping my pants up. Also, in the middle of our messaging session, keep in mind we have paid already, they begin to upsale the hot stones to us. My boyfriend ended up getting them anyway as they didn\'t ask me. But honestly in my opinion I have already paid what messages we were having there was no need to upsale anything more. If you are coming here for the experience I totally do not recommend it.'
