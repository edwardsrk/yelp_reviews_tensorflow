b'This place is hit or miss. It\'ll depends on who is in the kitchen, I think, and whether or not management feels like taking the job seriously.  I\'ve had good meals here, and I\'ve had really bad ones. I\'ve had enough bad ones that I try not to go here unless there\'s no other choice.  I got a piece of fish once that you could drive a nail with. The Rubens are always stringy and it\'s impossible to take a bite out of the sandwich without dragging all the meat out in one big glob. And I don\'t think I\'ve seen the same waitstaff here more than once. Big turnover. There\'s no pride in the service or the food at all.  This place is never been truly "good", things just seem to keep getting worse.'
