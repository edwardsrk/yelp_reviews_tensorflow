b"I enjoy this hotel/casino. My family and I go bowling here, go to the movies, and also have brought family friends here when they're in town ans have recommended this place for people to stay when they ask for a decent priced hotel to stay at. My main complaint and why I didnt give 5 stars is that this is an off the strip hotel/casino ans they dont allow Locals into their pool. Thats just silly. I have lived in Vegas for 18 years and I you fo to most off the strip hotel/casinos and you show a valid nevada ID theres never an issue just as long as you're not taking in an entire party of people. But two or three people going to the pool to buy drinks/food and enjoy their pool in 115 degree heat is a must. Hotel/casinos are supposed to cater to the locals. I mean we are the ones that put in a good word for for people that ask where they should go. It should just be a limit of a certain amount allow in and possibly a pool locals guest list. My daughter and I would for sure be at South point everyday if this as the case because I dont like M resort as much. And M resort is too far."
