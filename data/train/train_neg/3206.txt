b'I am not a fan of the ice creams however this place is tried for my husband based on the reviews here on yelp. Completely agree with the negative reviews for this place. Their cookies are under baked and also their ice cream taste is not up to my expectations .Looks like this place got a hype which made me step in here and May not be a turn back place .'
