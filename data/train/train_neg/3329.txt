b"OH DEAR LORD! (and not in a good way) So I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year now. This past Saturday I finally convince the hubs to go with me. This is a place that takes donations from people who are renovating their homes, you can find anything home related as far as building materials and the like go. I was pumped on finding a bath vanity, people have reported that they have stuff there from high end homes. We must have been on a very very off day as everything there looked to be from the 80's mayyyybe 90's and older. Nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days. The appliances they offer there are old as hell as well, there wasn't anything worth looking at. And used toilets? EW!"
