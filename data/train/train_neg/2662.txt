b"My first time but probably won't return. We had a party of five and didn't get drinks or a waiter for about 20 minutes... then once we did order they gave us our drinks in plastic cups you get at Walmart... Our beer also was served in a plastic cup then we noticed people around us had glasses. So it was hit or miss, but once we did ask for a glass the server gave us attitude about it. We ordered a lot of food so the time in getting it was understandable. The prices we mild but I didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The pizza wasn't bad but the service and cheap plates, cups etc. wasn't a positive vibe."
