b'The service is all around Slow. There is major construction going on and the is no easy way to the Strip. Also all the pools and hot tubs are closed because of construction, except 1 pool and it is jam packed with people laying in walkways and on steps. Management doesnt care and says "the web site warned us". My point is; stay away till at least memorial weekend. It is supposed to be done by then.'
