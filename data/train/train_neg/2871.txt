b"Just another Big Y restaurant with decent food and horrible service.  Way overpriced for what you get. Be careful when ordering or a piece of plain grilled fish can easily top $50. Our food was ok but under seasoned.  I had to get up and search out the manager to get some salt and pepper when our server was no where to be found. The deck is nice in good weather but why they leave the sliding doors completely open in hot/humid weather is mind boggling.  Please allow people who want air conditioning an option.  Like all other restaurants in the Big Y group, wine is 3 1/2 to 4 times retail, so you're paying $100 for a $25 bottle...pay their high corkage fee and you're still ahead."
