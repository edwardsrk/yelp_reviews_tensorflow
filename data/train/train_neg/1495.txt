b"CAlled in advance to check time of karaoke.  Left a beautiful bar at the Cosmopolitan to get my karaoke on and get there to have them shut down a half hour in after ordering drinks.  When I asked to speak to manager about being given wrong info for times, he was dismissive and didn't even offer to complete our drinks we had just ordered."
