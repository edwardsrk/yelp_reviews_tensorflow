b"Although still often hard to get a reservation, the quality of the food and service continue to slide from an easy 4+ stars to now a 2 to 3-star rating.The food used to be well prepared and now it is either over or undercooked with low consistency. We used to come here and try to imitate some of their dishes, like the burrata, but we make it better at home now as their grapes are often not toasted, although we still reminisce about our first time having it there. Same with their pastas, almost always soggy and overcooked, never a la denete, even after you send it back. Service is pretty casual and sloppy now too, but at least they take items off the bill when they've served you something horribly made (although it still spoils your dining experience). And once they've tainted your dining experience, your server basically ignores you because they think they're no longer getting a tip, further tarnishing your dining experience. In fact, we had to flag down other servers for service.I highly doubt we will eat here again and recommend diners go somewhere else as this place is highly overrated. Enoteca Sociale is a superior choice for this type of fare and not much farther west on Dundas."
