b'Do not go here! My wife had a terrible time scheduling an appointment for our 2 day old son (extremely rude).  When we finally went got the appointment scheduled she had to wait over an hour with our newborn.  No empathy or apologies, just "you\'re next".  Compounding the issue there was no place for her to nurse.  Literally wouldn\'t go here if this was a free medical service.  We will never go back here!'
