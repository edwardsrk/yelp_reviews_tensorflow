b"I'm not sure what to make of the previous review as this Panera looks exactly like every other.  However, what sets this one apart is the poor service.  The 'kids' working here are not trained sufficiently and spend more time socializing with co-workers and same-age customers than they spend serving the other customers, cleaning  or stocking.Most recently we ordered a dozen bagels sliced, and we received 11 with just barely the tops cut.  The young man waiting on us apparently didn't  know how to use the slicer, and instead of asking someone for assistance, he sent us home with these bagels that are a mess and don't fit in the toaster, because we have one extra fat half, and the other wafer thin with just the topping.This isn't the first time we've experienced issues like this at this Panera.  It seems the whole staff could use additional training.  Also, this store is generally not cleaned as well as others we've visited."
