b'This is the single worst Wells Fargo Branch I have ever visited and will never set foot inside this branch ever again.I went it to simple have the tell cash a check and then deposit the cash into my account.The Teller decided to argue with me about it.Now I didn\'t expect to be given treated so poorly because I wanted to cash and deposit my paycheck.  Then on top of it the teller could get the deposit right.I was standing at the window looking up my available balance through my phone app.  and it didn\'t show the deposit.  But the teller kept telling me that its ok the money is in there and here is a paper receipt to show it.I don\'t know about you but what good does a paper receipt do when the money isn\'t showing available in your account.  And why would I trust that it will all work out when I have never had this happen before.  I felt like I was being ripped off and my money had been stolen and that I should take it on faith that my money was in my account.  When nothing showed that and nothing was being displayed via the banks phone app.Then the teller decided to "reversed" the deposit and I had to walk outside to the drive drive up ATM, because they don\'t have a walk up ATM on site.  and put my money in there.  which then instantly showed up in my phone App and in statement that I could see.I have never been so insulted in my life.If this kind of treatment continues from the people at wells fargo then I guess I will just have to find a new bank and close my accounts with them.'
