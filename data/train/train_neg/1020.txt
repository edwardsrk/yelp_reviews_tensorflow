b'This was honestly one of the most disappointing stays I have had in a very long time.  I was keeping my loyalty with the Marriott Brand and chose to stay at the local Westin even though my event was at a competitor\'s conference center.  I started my stay in a room with a beautiful view but the vibration from a fan was so powerful It began to hurt my ears (which I found out after the fact was a complaint in the past).  I was then moved to a different room.  I was so tired at this point that I just wanted to get rest, but upon entering the light was out and the bathroom had the previous guest\'s hair all over it.  I had also "made the green choice" and came back to find my room had been cleaned.  This is typically not a problem, but I found a cleaning rag under my clothes!  My stomach was in knots just thinking about why my stuff would be moved and a rag underneath.  I didn\'t feel that management took my concerns seriously and just brushed it off as an error in the system as to why someone was in my room.  Furthermore, being there on business, I needed to use the business center to print and scan some documents.  Their printer was not working and there wasn\'t any concern to fix it in any hurry.  To end it, our conference was to end at 12:30 and my flight to leave in the evening.  Because of a concert, the hotel would not honor late checkout (even for 1 hour for me to return, freshen up and head to the airport).  This was certainly not your typical Westin Experience so please consider your options.'
