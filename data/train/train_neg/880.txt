b'We went here on Father\'s Day. Ordered the queso dip. It came in a container a little bigger than a ramekin. The price was 7.50. It was thin and very bland. For dinner we ordered the "cadillac" beef fajitas. I think they gave us yesterday\'s beef. They were very tough. The tortillas were good. I would not recommend the guacamole. 3.75 for a very small side. No flavor and runny. Our server was nice and kept our drinks filled. We will not be back. If we want fajitas Chili\'s or Applebees has better.'
