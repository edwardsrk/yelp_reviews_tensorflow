b'Very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but I make it better. The first time I went to this place, I felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well. So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat. While enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat. Our waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. "How about desert right now" I remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm.
