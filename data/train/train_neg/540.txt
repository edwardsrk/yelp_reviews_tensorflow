b"I've had to go back now twice in 5 weeks for a terrible cut and a perm that did not work.  After consultation with the stylist I explained my hair doesn't take perms easily.  Instead of listening to me, she proceeded to leave the solution in my hair for 45 minutes, and only after I complained about it burning my scalp did she have her assistant rinse and neutralize my hair.  She was rude and unprofessional.  She has also told me to not come back even though the issue was her fault.  I suggest skipping Etch.  Scottsdale has many more salons to offer."
