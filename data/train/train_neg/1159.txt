b"Worst AYCE place I've been to.Went once with a group of 4 but was seated at a table meant for 2.Food quality was below average and the service was horribly slow.  What ticked me off is that they kicked us out for reaching the time limit (I think it was 1 hour) even though we spent about as much time eating as trying to flag a server down and waiting for food.Will not be going back."
