b'I don\'t understand what people see in this place. I can honestly say that I was not blown away by anything I ate there (nor were any of the other people I came here with). The ribs were bland and had no discernible smoke ring. The brisket was not freshly cut and was very dry with no smokey flavor. I was not impressed by their BBQ sauce or any of the sides.  When I hear people talk about the food here, they say, "The BBQ is good for Pittsburgh..." People should not use the location of a restaurant as a justification for it not being as good as other places. There are plenty of great restaurants in Pittsburgh that stand on their own and can go toe-to-toe with places all over the nation. Don\'t settle.'
