b'I had an oil change at the 15515 N Scottsdale Road location.  When the car was delivered to me, there were two engine warning lights on that had not been on when I drove the car in.  The technician said that the lights were on when he got in the car, which was not true.  I took the car to the dealer who said that a sensor light had been left unplugged when they removed the air filter.  I should have read the many bad Yelp reviews prior to going to this facility.'
