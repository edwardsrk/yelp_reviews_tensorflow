b"I don't why there are 3 seperate review posts in yelp for this very same location. I have chosen the one with the most reviews.I brought my newly bought BMW 2009 328i to this place. I shouldn't have. My odyesy lasted two days. I had a dealine because the car will be shipped to Europe and I was to leave on the second day the car was at Napa. Day one part for my car did not arrive on time. Day 2, Steve the location manager went himself in the morning of day 2 to get the headgasket. The guys are friendly and trying hard, but seems like they are not good in handling imports. After the headgasket component was installed they basically couldn't set up the factory settings. So I had to call a tow truck and ship it to my dealer, who will be taking care of completing the last step. Still at this moment I don't know how much on top of my 1145$ !!! repair bill will be add up. To be fair they send me a 100$ voucher, for which I will have no use. Stay clear of these type of big chain places, which apparently can only handle certain brands/ years. I was under time pressure. Otherwise I would have found a BMW specialist."
