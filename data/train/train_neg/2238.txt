b'It\'s a production brewery and not much else. In that matter, no tasting room and you can\'t just visit it out of the blue.They have a tour once a month. It\'s pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.The beers aren\'t anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence "one-off")Better bet going to Tenaya Creek or Big Dogs where you can see the Brewery as well as drink there. Banger Brewing downtown is also highly recommended.'
