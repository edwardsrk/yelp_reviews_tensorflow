b"Bridlewood Mall is just another one of those neighbourhood malls from around the 70s. It's a little dingy and dated, but it also has a few good points. Jennifer K.'s review touched upon most of them, but she left out one crucial point: THE BURGER PALACE. It can be found upstairs right outside Price Chopper. This place is a total gem, and if I recall what I've heard correctly, it's been in this mall from the start. People, if you somehow find yourself in this mall, go there. They serve the greatest onion rings you will ever taste.Overall, if you're just looking for the basics and have no interest in clothes, you may enjoy Bridlewood Mall... but if you're looking for excitement, this is not the place."
