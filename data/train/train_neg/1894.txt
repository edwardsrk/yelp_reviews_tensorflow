b"Food is not good, im entirely unimpressed with this place! I ordered all of my food dairy free, asked for my toast to be dry ( unbuttered) I explained that I cannot have dairy and yet my food still contained dairy and my toast came buttered. I've eaten here a few times and something has been wrong every single time."
