b"I purchased a Samsung fridge from Lowe's in 2014. A few months ago, I began having an issue with the ice maker. The ice smelled bad and tasted worse. The water still tastes amazing and is odorless. I replaced the filter and thoroughly cleaned the fridge, emptied and cleaned the ice bin several times to no avail. Chemical type smell, similar to freezer burn, but different. Emptied the entire fridge (as that is where the ice maker is located), nothing helped. Looking at Google, I discovered this is a common problem. I contacted Lowe's as I have a 5 year warranty, and they sent Buy-Rite.Tech showed up and used his laser thermometer in the fridge, drink drawer, and freezer. I explained that the issue was the way the ice was tasting/smelling, and not with the temperature. And also that it was a common problem reported online in reviews, etc. The tech told me there was no solution, but that he noticed dog hair under my fridge. I took 5 hours off work to wait for the tech to come for 5 minutes and tell me there was no solution. Very dissatisfied."
