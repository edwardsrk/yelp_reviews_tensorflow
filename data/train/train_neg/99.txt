b"I like Church's better than other fast chicken places, but this location is horrible. The first time I went, I waited in the drive through almost 40min. By the time I got to the window, they were out of the food I ordered. I waited a year before trying again. Second time I waited almost 20min in the drive through. The chicken sandwich was not good at all. Won't be back."
