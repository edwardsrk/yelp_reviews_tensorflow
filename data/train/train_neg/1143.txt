b"I have been to many nail salons and this one was by far was the worse. Their prices are too high for the quality. I got a full set with gel polish and I asked for a glittered finger and they charged 8$ for that. The design didn't come out correctly it's uneven and has spots where there is no glitter. The technicians are unfriendly and not courteous to their customers. I will be going back to my original place."
