b'Ordered delivery.It took 50 minutes for the food to arrive, and when we received the delivery, there were no forks, spoons, and napkins.The flavour and the serving size compared to the price was extremely poor.There are definitely plenty of other places in Toronto where you can receive twice as much food (that taste better) for half the price.    .'
