b'new location out front of Outlet mall. It is Roberto\'s not the best not the work just plain "a ok"updateThis location  sucks. The smell in this place is horrible, I went in today and ordered a bacon breakfast burrito...it was OK but they charged me $5 for it..I thought it was a special price on Tuesday...I guess not at this location, I am OK paying $5 for a breakfast burrito but this thing wasn\'t worth $3. plus the smell oh my was it bad.'
