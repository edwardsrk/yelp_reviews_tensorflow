b'The food is 5 stars!! But the one waitress I had named Rebecca was nice in the beginning then she became rude. She\'s a heavy set white lady w/ short blonde hair. It was New Year\'s Eve & I know that some stores & food places give out cute "happy new year" hats. I saw that she had one & I had asked her "oh do you guys by chance have the hat with the feather?" Bcs I wanted a new little head piece. & she looked at me like I was stupid & said "no" in thee BITCHIEST tone. I thought I was the only one who thought her tone was rude... But my boyfriend commented on her tone once she left & my mom even said "why did she say it all snobby?" Little things like that upset me bcs it\'s not like I was being rude to her in the first place. It was a simple question & I was expecting her to be polite. Also, in the beginning... It took her forever to even take our drink orders. she never checked on us to see if we were doing okay. She didn\'t check if we needed any refills on our drinks. She just handed us our check & left. I will not come back to this restaurant if she will be my server again.'
