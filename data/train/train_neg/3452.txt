b"Another standard ayce Japanese near my in laws'. After going to other ayces where we placed our orders through an iPad, I was reminded of the pain it was to have to wave down our server to submit and check on our orders every single time at Matsuda. Although there were multiple staffs who brought out our foods, we were only allowed to order with our assigned server. She never volunteered her time to check on our table; we had to get the other staffs to find her for us. By the time our second order was served, there was a 30 minutes of sitting/waiting around in between. Foods - mediocre at best. All the shrimp items were heavily preserved with msg. The tempura and fried times were cold when served. Sushi and sashimi took at least an additional 30 minutes after all the hot foods were brought to us. The sweet shrimp sashimi were strangely dry and salty. The best item of the night coming from an ayce Japanese was unfortunately its ginger steamed milk. The ginger taste was distinct and the dessert for the majority of the time was served hot. Forget about mediocre sushi and sashimi, I chose to fill my stomach with multiple orders of this instead. Overall - save your money for a la carte restaurants instead. I can guarantee you that there are many greater options in GTA!"
