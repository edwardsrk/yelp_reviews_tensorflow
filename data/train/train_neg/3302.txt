b'No, their gyros are not worth waiting on a long line.I went there on Wednesday, and it took me 45 minutes to finally order my gyro. I couldn\'t believe my eyes when I saw the lady who was making gyros because she didn\'t have gloves on. She was sweating badly, kept wiping the sweat off of her face with a dirty towel, and continued making gyros with the same sweaty hands! I was totally turned off and grossed out. If you want to see what poor hygiene looks like, this is the place to go.The gyro tasted good, but I don\'t think it\'s worth waiting for 45 minutes. I have had much better gyros before with much better services. I think it is arrogant to say to the customers, "We have our own rules, so don\'t ask us to do anything that is not our rule." Nope, I\'m not going back there.'
