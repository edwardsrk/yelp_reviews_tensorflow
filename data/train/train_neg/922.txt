b"I tried this place last week based in the positive reviews on Yelp. Probably the worst takeout sushi I've ever had. Ordered the Kokoro combo 4 which is a combo of spicy salmon rolls and dynamite roll. It didn't taste fresh at all. The salmon was ok, nothing great but the dynamite was horrible. The tempura shrimp and sweet potato in the roll tasted like it was made days prior and was cold with a rancid oily taste. The avocado in the roll was already super brown when I opened the 'made to order' box of rolls. The rice was ice cold and unappetizing. Plus they didn't provide the good Japanese soya sauce, just the Chinese kind that's super salty and not for rolls. Won't come back."
