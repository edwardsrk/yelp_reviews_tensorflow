b"After reviewing several reviews we decided to go to dinner at Gallaghers Steakhouse and boy were we disappointed. It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order.  A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated. I don't have a steakhouse recommendation for Las Vegas visitors but if you are ever in Chicago and want to taste an excellent aged steak, check out Joes Seafood, Prime Steak &Stone Crab...mmmmmmm!"
