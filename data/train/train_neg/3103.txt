b"I have been coming here for years and I have to say most of the smoothies are good here. The last two times I have been here the guys working behind the counter are too busy talking with either their regulars or friends visiting them. Today the smoothie I got was so sweet and not even what I asked for I was super disappointed. The guy who helped me was not even paying any attention to what he was doing because he was too busy talking to someone. When I walked up to the counter he didn't even stop his conversation to help me instead took a brief pause and raised his voice just enough  so I could hear can I help you. I gave him my order and as he finishes my smoothie walks out from behind the counter still talking to his buddy and proceeds to hand me my smoothie I smurked a little and then he realized he didn't even charge me. Wow! I don't expect people to roll out the red carpet but come on really a little attention to the customer and what you are doing would be much appreciated! I will not be coming to this location any longer!"
