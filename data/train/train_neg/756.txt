b"This one star is for the car wash attendant. She was nice! A bit salesy but still nice. I just went through this car wash for the first time, and it rubbed  a section of my car's paint/finish off! I honestly am a bit shocked because I've gone through many car washes and never had anything like this occur. Why is the car wash so rough?! It doesn't even make any sense, it rubbed off the paint on one part of my car but left bird poop on the other side. We will be contacting the owners of this business tomorrow since it closes soon. For now, Yelpers, beware! I would not recommend you go anywhere that will damage your car."
