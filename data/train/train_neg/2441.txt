b"Don't stay here if you plan on having diarrhea!!!!  It took the toilet eight flushes to get everything down.  Meanwhile, the shower didn't have any hot water.  We called to have it fixed and they said they would fix it but they didn't.  After our 2nd call they said they'd take one night of hotel fees off our bill.  The beds were comfortable, the couple I was staying with said they could hear our neighbors through the wall but I didn't.  The hotel is cute, the Flamingo garden is awesome.  The buffet was the worst I've had in Vegas (compared to Luxor and Excaliber.)  I wouldn't stay here again."
