b"This place drives me crazy. I went once a couple months back and hated it. The person that asks what kind of wash you want would not stop up selling me. I decided to never go back. Then they put up a sign saying the place was under new management. I went back and it was worse than before. the guy wouldn't quit up selling me. Then the window crack lady jumped on me. Then it took forever to do the wash. I won't be going back...ever!"
