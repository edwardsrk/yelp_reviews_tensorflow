b"There is no way this is a 5 or 4 stars place. I order a sausage and egg breakfast. The potatoes were soggy and the sausage was not well done. The waitress act friendly but I can tell she is just trying to be. I work with people everyday so I can tell who is sincere or not. The cook was actually friendly then her. I don't think I would come again."
