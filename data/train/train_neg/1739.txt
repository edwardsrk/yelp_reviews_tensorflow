b"Due to being a loyal Houston's patron, I decided to give Bandera a try because of their direct relationship. The difference was night and day... Bandera's servers were very inattentive and almost rude regarding all aspects of communication during my dining experience. My filet was mediocre at best and not worth the price tag. This place gave off a very cold and insincere vibe. I will most definitely not be returning."
