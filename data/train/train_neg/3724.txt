b"Decided to try Garcia's for the first time. We were seated right away for a Friday evening then it went south from there. The waitress (Alex) was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. When I told her we weren't ready she basically stormed off. We asked for more salsa when our cheese crisp arrived and chips and she ignored us. A waiter brought out our main course and asked him for the salsa and he brought it but basically dropped it on our table. We will never go  there again. I would rather go to  Taco Bell and get better service."
