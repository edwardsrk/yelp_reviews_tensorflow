b"I used to be very pleased with the staff and Drs. but over the past few years not so much. The staff is always changing and they don't appear to like animals. When I used to go in the staff would make over my pets and make them feel special now they rarely address them. I always feel rushed and my questions are not answered. I do not feel they truly look out for the pets best interest. I stayed with them because of the history but after so many negative experiences I have changed vets and do not intend to go back."
