b"I should have learned my lesson last time I was here for brunch when I had a bad experience with both the service and food...however, I thought it was just an off day, so when they advertised for their Doubleback wine dinner I just couldn't resist.  Service was non-existent, the food was not good and the entire event seemed like it had been thrown together at the last minute - very disorganized.  Such a shame the way this place has gone downhill."
