b"Laser treatments. Let me start by saying if I could rate this place lower than I 1 star I would. Nothing against the staff they were very kind but there is no knowledge base. The establishment takes advantage of potential clients that are new to the world of laser hair removal. When I bought the package I had never done a laser treatment before and had no idea what it would entail and they took advantage of that. They rushed my session. I now currently go to a different med spa and it is like night and day.To gain a little bit of perspective, at silk med spa I did 2 large, 2 medium and 2 small areas. I was in and out of the place within 15-20 minutes. I'm doing the exact same body parts at my new spa and it takes 2.5 hours. The attention to detail and knowledge is simply not there. I'm making this review because I'm so sad by the amount of time wasted at silk med spa. Anyone who does laser knows that every session counts and it's a process, I wouldn't want anyone else to be ill informed like myself. Huge waste of time but the silver lining is that now I really appreciate the professionalism and good service from my current spa."
