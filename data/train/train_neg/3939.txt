b"Service was good. The place was clean, open, and inviting. I liked the decor a lot. However, the food was so basic. No flavour, no sauces were given with the spanokopita I purchased. They forgot to give me the bread it comes with. Got a side of rice and potatoes. All was underwhelming. Also, it's on the pricier side - cost me $16. Not going back."
