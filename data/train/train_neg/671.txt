b"Quality went down. Their curry lentil is TERRIBLE! It's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else, just liquid. I called up and apparently it's supposed to be like that. I'm sorry but that is NOT curry lentil. The chicken feta salad is still decent but it is smaller now. I liked the vinaigrette that had seasonings in it and now its just oil and vinegar. I haven't had their pita sandwiches yet. I usually get the chicken feta pita but at this rate I probably will just save my money. The staff was nice and attentive before. The occasional new girl would suck but overall good service. I'm not sure about now. Haven't ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous!"
