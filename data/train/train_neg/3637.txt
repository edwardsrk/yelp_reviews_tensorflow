b"Like most of the skuzzy strip clubs along Highland Drive, Foxy Girls reflects the kind of place you'd find in a town that's embarrassed to have a business where men pay to watch women take their clothes off [which is odd, because Vegas revels in skin].  It's hidden away in the industrial area, it's small, the dancers are run down and the drinks are overpriced.  That said, at least the place serves alcohol.  And when we were there, the dancers were good conversationalists and didn't immediately treat the customers like ATMs (that came later)."
