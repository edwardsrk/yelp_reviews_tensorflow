b'Wanted some good Chinese food read the reviews and decided I would try it...This is literally the worst Chinese I\'ve ever had.  I ordered the pineapple chicken and it has no flavor, it\'s sitting in a "sauce" I guess and the sauce is like oily water. I also ordered the fried rice, it too has no flavor. I typically would finish a meal because i spent my money on it, but I took a few bites and threw it away. Still after just a few bites, I feel sick to my stomach. Pretty upset that I wasted my money, should have just went to Pei Wei.'
