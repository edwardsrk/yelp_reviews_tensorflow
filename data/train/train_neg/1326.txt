b'I was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last Sunday,  March 13, 2016. After waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, I decided to leave. I was later told by my friend that there was only one Server on duty for over 50 people. I understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. My first and last time at this establishment!'
