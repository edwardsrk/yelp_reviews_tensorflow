b"For the money I expected more. Food was ok, nothing to ooooh and awww over. Service wasn't great, more like a diner and not what I would expect in fine dining. Ali gratin potatoes were undercooked and my steak was also underdone, but my husband's was over done. The decor was very nice in the front rooms but we were seated in the back overflow room with none of the nice features. Overall it was just ok and I wouldn't go back."
