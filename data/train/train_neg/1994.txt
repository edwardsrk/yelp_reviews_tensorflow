b"$14 for a matinee is outrageous!  Was told I am paying for the amenities the theater offers.  Shouldn't the customers using those amenities be paying for that?  They have a bar and an ice cream shop which is great if you wanna spend a mortgage payment. I think most people just wanna see a movie.  The inside is very nice and clean. The seats are nice too.  Not are usual Harkins we go to. For some reason this Harkins really wants to stick it to its customers!"
