b"Food was decent, but if you want a martini, STAY AWAY!!!!! We ordered Plymouth gin martinis and we're disappointed in how small they were, but that turned out to be the good part. When the bill came, they charged us $19 each!!! That's right, it's not a typo, $19 each. We've been to a lot of great restaurants throughout Cleveland, the US and Europe and NEVER have paid more than $12 for a martini. I don't know what their other prices are like for drinks, but I'm guessing they are overpriced as well. So if you want to enjoy a drink with your meal and particularly if you want a martini, I strongly recommend you STAY AWAY from this restaurant."
