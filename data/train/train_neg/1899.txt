b"When we walked in they waived us to a booth where we then waited and chatted for a good twenty minutes. And then one of the girls I was with got up to ask if we could get a menu. She brought back the menus herself because they didn't.We waited and waited and waited and eventually they came over to ask what we wanted and we ordered and waited and waited. One of my companions got up, cancelled her order and decided to go elsewhere. Wish the rest of us had done the same.Probably one of the most uninspiring meals we've ever eaten. Maybe if the food was good it could have made up for the non-existent service, but it was very lackluster.  Do not recommend."
