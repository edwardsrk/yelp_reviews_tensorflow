b'My boyfriend had been talking about this "amazing" French toast he had at the Cheesecake Factory when he ate there with his family, so we finally made it over there for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too.When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It\'s so thick and, I\'m sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he\'d had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don\'t know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten...Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I\'d prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either.We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out. I\'ve enjoyed other varieties of cheesecake more than these two.'
