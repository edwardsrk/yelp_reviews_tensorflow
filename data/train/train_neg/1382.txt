b"I just got a rescue dog and I called banfield because something had scarred my dog and I wanted to bring him in for a check-up because I was afraid something was wrong. I took my dog here for a checkup and dropped him off, and they told me they would call me when they did his physical. They called me and told me that the vet wanted him to get blood work and give him a pancreatitis test and made it sound like something was very wrong with my dog so I agreed to the tests, but when I went to go pick up my dog they told me his physical had been fine and refused to tell me why they thought those tests were necessary. The staff and the vet who works there ( I believe the vet's name is Kim) were very rude and it was obvious that they had just taken advantage of me moneywise and could care less about my dog or myself.I argued with them for an hour about this and they finally refunded my money for the tests, but not before commenting that they just wanted to make it clear that I would never bring my dog back there again. I have never been treated so rudely in my life.Please do not go here. They are all about money and themselves. Protect your pet and yourself."
