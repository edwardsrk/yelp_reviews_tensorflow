b"Been dining with Muramoto for a number of years and generally been pleased with the sushi. However, today my wife and I waited at lunch 40 minutes for 3 rolls and a chicken teriyaki. This has happened several times in the past and seems to only happen when ordering one of the less expensive lunch specials. I finally asked our waiter to check on our order after 35 minutes. When the sushi finally arrived about 1/2 the rolls we falling apart. All 3 rolls were warm. The tuna roll was about the size of my little finger and tasted as though the fish was off. The cucumber roll was simply chopped cucumber in rice (no flavor or seasoning at all). My wife's lunch arrived about 5 minutes later and it was fine though probably should have been served a bit closer to the sushi.This has happened several times in the recent past. I think this is strike 3. Don't see myself going back again."
