b'Let me start by saying the food was good. However the place is staffed by young rude people. They got my order wrong and when I said what I really wanted, I was told by the young girl "No you ordered a large ...". No sorry. No we will fix that. Just indicating I was wrong. Not one "welcome", "thank you", "enjoy", smile in the place.Life is too short to give my money to places that can\'t train the staff that the Customers are important, not an inconvenience in their day.Bye Burrito Boyz...'
