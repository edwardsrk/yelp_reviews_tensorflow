b"The Women's Restroom is very filthy! I am here to see someone at Urgent Care and used the ladies room outside across the Urgent Care Unit.Very unhealthy- trash bins overflowing and all over the floor. There's also a cleat plastic bag with a bloody rag inside on the floor. The smell of the room is very bad! Just plain unhealthy for patients that are already sick. YUCK!!!"
