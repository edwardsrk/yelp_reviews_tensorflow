b'The atmosphere is gorgeous and I loved the garden just wished I had come during the day to check it all out. Unfortunately the food is a bit bland. We order zucchini chips, a Sonoran dog and the bbq chicken pizza. The zucchini chips were the best item we ordered but just okay. We will go back and try it again during the day maybe for breakfast. Cute place but the food was disappointing.'
