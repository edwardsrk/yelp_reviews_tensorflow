b'I love Fair Trade. The atmosphere is great, especially in the back near the fireplace, and the coffee is excellent. But the customer service is lacking. While studying on a busy Saturday I was approached by the owner and asked if I could please purchase something or leave because of customers looking for a place to sit. I, waiting for a friend to return and not wanting to leave our computers/phones unattended, waited to purchase a drink. I was approached a second time and scolded for still not having bought anything. I explained to the owner my plan to wait for my friend, but she would not listen. To make this worse, there is a sign in Fair Trade that says "Thieves are afoot. Do not leave valuables unattended." Interesting how that\'s what I was trying to do but I was chided for it. I am not impressed!'
