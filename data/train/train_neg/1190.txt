b'Should change their motto to...."we speak patient.....in 8 weeks".  We prepaid for braces for my wife.  The initial appointments were fine.  Now, they won\'t see us for her adjustments unless we make an appointment 8weeks ahead of time.  We had an unexpected emergency that took us out of town so we called to reschedule an upcoming appointment. They said the soonest they would see us was 8 weeks from the date of our call.  We offered to go to a different location to get in sooner but she said this was against policy.   If we hadnt prepaid we would be going elsewhere, but now we are held ransome by their 8week policy.  Go elsewhere.  The advertised cheap prices apparently come at the price of doctor availability.'
