b"I was super excited to go to this place because I saw it on the news and also saw there was one in the valley. The place is beautiful. My daughter and I received a super nice warm greeting when you entered. I thought alright this would be a good experience and a new place to go to. But afterwards I think maybe not. I will probably try again for maybe lunch or see if they do lunch but if not much better than breakfast probably go elsewhere. Our waitress was not warm at all in fact I would maybe say a tad salty like the food here. I don't know if it was a bad day though it was still early but it just felt pushy and not warm at all. The best part of the meal was the jam they give you for the toast. I heard from someone walking in they had good coffee I was disappointed with it as my mother who likes coffee as well. I had their biscuits and gravy and it was salty and also the sausage chucks were too much awesome they included that but way to big for my taste(I had other food but it was okay just okay though). I had a bite of my moms chicken fried steak and that was actually quite good. But I would love to say this place was amazing because I had such high hopes but nope maybe try again and try another breakfast meal maybe I got one that wasn't the best but other than that I have gotten better food from little greasy diners."
