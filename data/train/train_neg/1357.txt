b"I have stayed here multiple times without any issues. On my last stay however there was a barking dog in the room next to me. The dog barked loudly no less than four times during the night and I had a long day on driving the next day. The hotel general manager Tammy Brewer said that the best she could offer is a partial refund. I was kept up all night and the best offer is a partial refund?! I'm a dog lover and have two dogs, I understand sometimes things can happen. After an issue happens superior customer service does whatever possible to rectify the matter. In this instance Tammy Brewer failed miserably and lost a repeat business customer. Come to this hotel only if you don't plan on needing any sleep otherwise you are much better off staying elsewhere."
