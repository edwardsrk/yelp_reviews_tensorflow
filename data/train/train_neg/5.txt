b"Just... not good.  We want it to be - we have been several times hoping, but the experience is always at best, lackluster.  The food is not great, very run-of the mill on a good day and the serve staff though very nice is always - and I have never had the same person twice - always totally lost and under-trained.  It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service."
