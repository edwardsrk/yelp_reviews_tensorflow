b"Their lunch special is pretty affordable, yet they are not the best Thai food I have ever had. Not going back to that place ever. I got the BBQ-pork with sticky rice and papaya salad. The sticky rice is so not well cooked and I felt like getting grain. Papaya salad too spicy and doesn't taste too good. ( I requested MILD, and I am a spicy eater)Overall, not very happy."
