b"This is the worst Starbucks in this city! Unfortunately It is the closest Starbucks to me. Horrible service every single time, the drinks are always blah, and they can never get the order right! This Starbucks likes to play the game I'll pick the size of your drink for you,no matter what you order and you will never get the size you ask for. It happens every single time and God forbid you tell them they are wrong, horrible attitudes all around, they like to roll eyes and snatch drinks out of your hands. It shows piss poor leadership/management/ownership that nothing has changed, it has been going on for a long time, just check the reviews. But luckily there is a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf close to me as well, so I will take my money there from now on. Done with this Starbucks and possibly Starbucks in general."
