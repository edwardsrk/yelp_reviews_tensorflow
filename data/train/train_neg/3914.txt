b"Decided to try this place out of recommendation.  Not impressed.  A bit too noisy, waiters/waitresses sang nicely but they need to turn it down a few notches.  Food was ok I've had better.  Waitress was friendly.  I wouldn't return.  Only plus while visiting Stratosphere was winning some money.  :)"
