b"This used to be my favorite place to get sushi. The new owners have RUINED this place. Priced are jacked up, no more lunch specials and the food quality, my rolls tasted bland and fell apart... Does anyone know if the old owners opened a sushi place up I'll follow them. The customer service here was great for us,  except the short haired blonde lady,  she had an attitude problem. The food not worth it."
