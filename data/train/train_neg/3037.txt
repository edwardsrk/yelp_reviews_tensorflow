b"It is a very busy place filled with people, but it gets really loud really quickly, so it can be hard to hear your friends.  the staff are friendly but dense and don't really go out of their way to seat or serve you.  Lots of different types of people go from biker guys, to new jersey shore wannabees, lol.  Food wise, the burder was decent bar food, and the perogies were fried and though not traditional perogies my friend did enjoy them, so non Ukies or poles would appreciate them.  the stuffed cabbage and noodle dish was very bland, and I mean bland.  It was typical squirled macaroni that did not have any taste or sauce to them, I had to add ketchup and vinegar.  the cabbage underneath was sparse but sauteed, and if there \\had been more cabbage it might have saved the dish.  On top I ordered brautwurst which came in small slices and was slightly crispy and peppery, which itself was not bad, and enjoyable with our beer, but the dish really really needed a sauce or better noodles, i would not recommend ordering that dish."
