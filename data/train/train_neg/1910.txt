b'I usually go to this location. This past week I had a horrible experience. I mentioned to the drive thru attendant that they had made my order wrong on my last visit. She really didn\'t care and said "yeah we always get orders wrong". I ended up paying for my order anyways but I prolly want come here again.  It\'s sad because all the girls working are usually very nice, the brunette who helped was out to lunch.'
