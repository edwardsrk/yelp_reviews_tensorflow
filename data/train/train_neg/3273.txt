b"I was sincerely hoping for something super tasty at this spot near my new home, but was a bit disappointed.  I would say it's somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  Yes, the veggies are fresh and there are lots of them-spinach, red and green peppers, jalapenos, cukes.  However the olives are canned.  I had the chicken souvlaki with veggies and let's just say, it's not Chipotle.  And there was very little chicken-I felt like I was on an expedition.  The place was clean and at about 6PM there were only a couple of people in there.  Also, the folks who wait on you are just as friendly as you would hope.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to get a pita here which is more like a smallish burrito.  And yes, it's inexpensive, however for almost the same $ you get more and tastier at someplace like Chipotle.  However I might go back and try something else."
