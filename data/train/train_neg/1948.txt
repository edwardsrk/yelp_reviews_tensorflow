b'Love tropical smoothie, but my experience tonight was less than subpar. Poor guy was working alone with a line of people out the door, so I can\'t blame him for the service. My health nut smoothie has way too much whey protein that it\'s the consistency of sand. And as for my "PEANUT BUTTER" crunch wrap.... Well there\'s a serious lack of peanut butter. Not to mention he also didn\'t chop up the bananas. (See photo)  Just to be clear, the bad review isn\'t for employee himself but rather the management of this store. Seems like you\'re working your employees like slaves and that\'s why the reviews here are so horrible.'
