b"Worst fitness place EVER! Gyms are much better so stay far away from this unhealthy way to get fit.  You will not have proper form and therefore it WILL result  in injury.  The trainers there are not professional and don't know how to guide you. PLEASE save yourself the time and money and go to a gym. Also, when you go to cancel they will CHARGE your card for months and months after. I cancelled over 6 months ago, have contacted my credit card company changed my credit card number and they STILL are charging me. I call monthly to cancel and have gone in to cancel. They conveniently did not have cancellation forms when I came in and have called monthly since. BUYER BEWARE. I have had the worst experience, the management is very unprofessional, unclassy, rude and disgusting."
