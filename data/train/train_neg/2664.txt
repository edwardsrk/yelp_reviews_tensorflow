b"I generally like this place for going to sit down and eat, and sometimes I get takeout from here, too.  The food is always good and friendly in person service.  However, the past couple times I've called in to place and order for takeout, the people who answered the phone put me on hold and either forgot about me or purposely let me sit so long on hold that I'd get tired of waiting and hang up.  I was irritated the first time it happened, but then when it happened again recently, I was mad enough to come write a negative review on a good restaurant because you just don't do that to people who call in trying to give you good business.  I have been a good customer for years and to ask if i can hold and then never come back to the phone to take my order is rude as hell.  Bad business to do that.  Fix your phone skills Patron."
