b"My boyfriend and I were in town for our anniversary getaway. So after seeing an excellent show we both decided to go to a drive thru to get food for dinner so it'll be faster and we can have it in our hotel. We agreed on going to Smashburger to try it out since we've never been to one. Although the cashier was very nice, I cannot say the same about the food that we got. With the price we paid for, we were given food that wasn't our order. We ordered Avocado Club Beef and Smashburger beef with salad and we both got Bacon Cheeseburger and salad. I'm surely don't think it was a mixed up because we were the only one waiting in the drive thru.The worst part is that my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning. Surely it came from what he ate from that place because some of it came out when he was throwing up early this morning. We will not be going to this place at all and will not refer it to anyone."
