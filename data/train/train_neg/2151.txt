b'One word for you: Yikes!!! This is a MILF bar in a mall to begin with. Double strike for me. So if that\'s your thing, you\'ll be in heaven. Overpriced mess of a place overall.I\'ve been here three times to really make up my mind and each time I ask for "well" drinks the bartenders end up pouring me Grey Goose or Van Gogh and then when the check comes they pretend that that\'s what they heard me say. Last time all I had was two double vodka soda "well" drinks and got a bill for 45 bucks cos the bartender poured Chopin. It\'s a really dumb scam and I\'ve fought it each time. Just be on the lookout for it.'
