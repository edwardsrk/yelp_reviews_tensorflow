b'ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY. If I had negative stars OH WOULD I USE THEM. ALL I am trying to do is change my damn delivery address. BUT NO apparently this is not allowed. You have to call in and sit on hold FOR FOREVER. I have called EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS and have gotten NO WHERE. This is ridiculous. I have emailed Customer Service every day and still have received nothing DESPITE the fact that their website says that in 24-48 hours someone will contact you. This is complete bull. Now I am trying to cancel my service but this is impossible as well. WORST COMPANY EVER. STEER CLEAR.'
