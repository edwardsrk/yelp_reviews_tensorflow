b"Oh my gosh!  Italian tuna sandwich?  Honesty, it had about three table spoons of tuna with TWO HUGE pieces of focaccia bread and a hint of vinegar!  THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions."
