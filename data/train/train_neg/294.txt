b"this kfc is no longer a part of the major kfc franchise and it is really obvious because for one the customer service is the very worst! yes don! this means you! you served us some nasty ass burnt chicken and didn't even give us a receipt with our order. when we got home we opened the bucket and it looked like the chicken had been burnt in a fire! it was old, really dark and hard as a rock. so we drove all the way back to return it and don had the nerve to tell us there wasn't anything wrong with it! well, i'm not serving that crap to my family.. matter of fact i don't even think they are using the 11 herbs and spices cause it didn't look anything like the real kfc chicken. anyway do not go to this kfc.. we tried to call them and the number on the internet is disconnected so i asked don for the manager's number and he refused to give it to me.. he told me i had to go back the next day and talk to the owner.. this kfc should be called kentucky fakeass chicken!"
