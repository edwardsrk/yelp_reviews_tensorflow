b'A nice restaurant to drop in and have a drink...but that\'s the problem as East Fremont is growing there are plenty of nice places to drop in and have a drink. Love the ambiance and decor but the food is simply meh.  Think Chevy\'s meets Vanguard Lounge...except I can at least think of a couple dishes at Chevy\'s I like.I came here with several friends and one asked the server for nachos. The entertainment went as follows:Her: Can I please have nachos?Server: We don\'t have nachosHer: Do you have chicken, tortilla chips, salsa, cheese, beans, guacamole, and sour cream.Server: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.Her: Then you have nachos.Server: Sorry we do not serve nachos, this restaurant is authentic mexican.Her: [pout face]She then proceeded to order each individual item as a side and dumped them on her plate and made...yup nachos. So yeeeahhh, if it\'s not considered "authentic" I get if it\'s not on the menu but if you have the ingredients what\'s so hard about accommodating a guests request? She didn\'t ask someone to go slice up some beef stomach and make menudo. I guarantee it took more energy to individually prepare and serve those items, then to just dump them on a pile of chips. I don\'t get it, anyway, rant over. The food is subpar and considering that there are multiple "authentic" Mexican restaurants within a two mile radius, this place would only be good for a quick drink.'
