b'Let me start off by saying i am a local and brought some friends from out of town here.This is by far not only the worst IHOP I have ever been to but the absolute worst  restaurant. We asked for one extra mozz stick so we could all have an even amount. The waitress didn\'t say it would be extra just said she would see If she could get us an extra one. When our meals came they were cold. My hashbrowns tasted like they just chopped up a raw potato and put it on a plate. Our waitress never came back to see how the food was and just brought the check When we went to the cashier she was too busy talking it up with a coworker to help us. Her coworker said "you have a customer" and she said "oh do I?" And continued her conversation. When I asked her about the extra food charge she was complete bitch. Needless to say I will not be going back. I wouls give zero stars if I could.'
