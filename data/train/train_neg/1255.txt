b"Gosh, I guess you really get what you pay for. I have tried this place twice (my fault for thinking the first bad experience was a fluke). The first time - the car's warning lights started going off - of course, after I was about 100 miles out of the area on my way down to CA. The cars are OLD and NOT WELL MAINTAINED. The second time - there was no one at the counter. Just a phone number to call if you happen to show up. I call them and wait ... and wait... and wait... I actually waited for about a full 15 minutes, feeling extremely stupid - how can they advertise 24 hour service, if no one's at the counter and no one shows up? I ended up just heading over to another car counter and booking a car there. After the end of my booking (another 15 minutes), I looked over, and STILL, NOBODY HAD SHOWN UP! Don't waste your time - just spend another 5 bucks per day and go to a different car rental there."
