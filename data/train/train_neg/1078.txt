b"Showed up for happy hour at 630pm....820p the waitress comes to our table and puts a reserved sign on our table and tells us that at 945pm that someone has reserved and we have to move....uh?!? Yeah, that's not normal or good customer service?!?! If you want to go somewhere, give them your money, then get kicked out.....Have fun!!!  For a normal person....dont go! That's why we go to Miller's Ale House!!!"
