b"I was ok with  this gym until today. My wife had a terrible and dangerous experience that I'm surprised has not happened sooner. She had a tanning bed break and the lid of the bid fall down on the back of her head and it knocked her out. When she approached management after she regained consciousness they were not concerned and brushed her off. She had to make them come and look at the bed. Once they saw the bed they still didn't believe her until she showed them the welt on the back of her head. She could not see or walk straight they didn't even say sorry or offer her assistance. Very disappoint in their lack of concern for my wife. To top it off she has a bleeding disorder so this could have truly killed her. Both the other tanning beds were out of service and in disrepair.  I will being going down there personally to talk with the management  this is not ok. What else has not been maintained in the gym and what will break next and truly hurt someone.by the way I have never wrote a yelp review before but their poor customer service made me Let me add my name. This not an over reaction invade you were wondering anybody that knows me would say I under react to things.Thank you for reading Seth Johnson 4807106675"
