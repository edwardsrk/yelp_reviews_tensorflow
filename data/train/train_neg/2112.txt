b"I've been to the salon 3 times now - after the last, I dont think I will go back, even with the price in mind.The owner is very nice, and was cleaning and constantly busy. But the lack of hygiene is what really turned me off this time, and the other times I have been. Even though there is a pan by the sink with rubbing alcohol for the tools, I never see them disenfect the tools between customers. I watched in horror as they took a file just used on a woman having a pedi and bring it over to me and use it on me. They dont even wipe off the tables in between customers. I wish they took more care to show that they disenfect the stations properly. I know this is the 'no frills' of nail salons, but cleanliness is still an expectation, even with a basic service."
