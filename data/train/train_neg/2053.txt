b'Overrated.  Maybe I just don\'t get it. I do enjoy divey bars, such as the places on ossington, leslieville and junction.I do not think this is the best patio- not even close.The bar is small and divey. Basic stuff here only behind the bar. it\'s small so be prepared to be bumped into once in a while if you\\re sitting in the front room. oh are you ordering Whiskey ginger? sorry No jamiesons. bartender told me "They don\'t take credit card or debit. And the ATM machine may or may not work at times." Thanks bartender. You are so cool and helpful. ps: Washrooms are gross.'
