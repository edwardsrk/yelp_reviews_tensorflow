b"I came out to Vegas for my friends bachelorette party and stayed here and oh my  This hotel is the worse. It smells the toilet over flowed , the staff is a little rude. We had to wait 3 hours for check in when they promised us a certain time talking about they short staff. The water heater was leaking and it ruined my clothes shoes and bag. The breakfast buffet was not so good. The eggs were powdered. The French toast was hard as ever. For the cost I could have went somewhere else. The upside to it the endless mimosas was very good. That's the only reason why I gave it a two star. If this and motel 6 was the last available room in Vegas I would stay at motel 6"
