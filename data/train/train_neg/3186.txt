b"MUST READ!!! The restuarant is under new ownership!!!! New menu in place. They still serve some dimsum but the other side of the menu is now completely fast food chinese dishes. I was highly disappointed as I don't just eat dimsum alone, I eat it with other favorite authentiic chinese dishes that are no longer available. Not that I don't recommend it but please be aware of this before you walk in."
