b"Four stars average on Yelp, REALLY??? We dined here because it's Thomas Keller's establishment.  Alas, it proved that the negative rumors of his restaurants are true.  Bouchon fell short. Croque madame: seriously the BEST croque madame?? More like average to decent.  Eggs Benedict: again, way average.  For that price tag, it fell BELOW average. So my conclusion is Las Vegas dining does not compare to other places in its class (Chicago, NY, SF Bay Area).  Oh and service was atrocious!  We had to serve our own water because our glasses never got filled. The server scolded us for serving our own water.  I had to walk up to ask for a spoon.  We have to ask for bread, and it was just tossed on the table.  The server rolled her eyes when she dropped a spoon.  Is it because people don't expect good food and service from Las Vegas???  Whatever the reasoning, skip Bouchon."
