b"Omg! we drove all the way from Avondale because our pediatrician said it would be a best option. My son has an ear infection but needed an X-ray and urine test. We got there at 3:15...and with a feverish crying baby, like a lot of other partners there.. We waiting for 3.5 hours just to have his vitals taken... Then we waiting another 3 until I am not kidding past 9pm to finally get asked to go in!!!! We gave my son Tylenol 1 while waiting for his fever. He is 9months old. Then.... We waiting another 1 hour for the doctor who seems to be in a hurry and not care about our son... Then another 3 to get him checked and cleared to go home. We got there at 3:15 wedsneday got asked in at 9pm and left at 3 am!!! Now 2 days later we find that they gave us the wrong medicine!! Now my son is has blood in his stool!! I honestly do not recommend them, them saying they care and specialize in kids is all marketing bullshit! They are no better than any other hospital or Doctor. Actually you're probably better off going to those Urgent Care locations. - now just wait for the large sum bill they are going to send me becuase of their expert service! Horrible."
