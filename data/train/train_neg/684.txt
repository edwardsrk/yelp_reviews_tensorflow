b"Aaliyah at the restaurant was super rude . Maybe bc it was myself and my sister - two girls - but she was short , rude, did not smile a bit . We were asking questions about the drinks and menu, and she blank stared us and didn't offer and information. We ordered drinks and water with our food . She never came back . We asked another waitress after 20 minutes . We finally got water and then our drinks . The food was ok- but the service by far made it to where I won't go back"
