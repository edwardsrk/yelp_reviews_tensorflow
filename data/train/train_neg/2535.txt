b"Probably the dingiest US Bank I've ever been in. There's a security guard outfront, which lets you know right away you are not safe. The staff is rude, and has dirty looks stuck on their faces. Odd how they can afford a security guard, but they can't afford a public bathroom for the customers that keep them in business..?? Being a businesswoman, the place honestly offends me as a whole. I will never be back again."
