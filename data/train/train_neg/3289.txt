b'Boorring!I stopped in on Saturday for some lunch, and Udon noodles were just under what I would call "meh." First of all, the menu indicates the Udon soup will have vegetables in it. What their actually was, was one small piece of broccoli, one carrot wedge, and a whole crapdone of boring, not good onion slices. That was it.As for the quantity of beef in my udon, I would say that it was fair, but the actual quality of the Udon, and CERTAINLY the quality of the broth sucked. Bottom line is, for being in Coventry, you can get better noodle soup, or just a better meal. The staff were fine, and the place is clean and it takes credit, but I wouldn\'t recommend the Udon on my worst enemy.'
