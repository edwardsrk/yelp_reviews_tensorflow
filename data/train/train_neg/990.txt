b"A great example of #poor #service . This must be the worst experience I ever had. I just want everyone in #toronto to know that #windmobile is the worst company. I should be at full speed up to 5 Giga bites a month. And look at this speed test. Their cusomter rep is telling me everything is good on his end. All BS I tell you. Scam scam scam #CTRC should get on this . While I'm here 10 months ago I signed up on plan with tab because I couldn't buy the S5 Samsung valued at 650 + tax = 735$. I had the phone for about 10 months now and made exactly 9 payments of 25$/month towards the tab which technically means 225$. So if you subtract 735 from 225 that would give you 510$ . Right ? Well wrong I called today to buy the phone and get rid of the tab payment and #wind rep told me that I own 670$ on the phone. Does this make any sense !!!!I also had complained and asked to speak to a manager but I was told that I manager will call me back. No one called me back. I don't recommend this company to anyone."
