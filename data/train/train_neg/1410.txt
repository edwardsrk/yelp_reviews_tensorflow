b'I stopped in at the Biltmore store Panera (fka Paradise Bakery) three times now over the last 2 months and more than half of their menu board is covered by paper.  There were only four or five sandwich options.  Over the last 2 months I have been waiting for the menu to change, but none of the staff know when that will happen.  Time to write Panera off my list for restaurants.'
