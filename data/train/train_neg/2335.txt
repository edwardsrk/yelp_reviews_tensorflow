b'I don\'t know if anyone else has noticed that these cigs are less and less satisfying than they used to be when this place first opened.  ???  Myself and a few people I know have been getting ryo cigs at these stores for a few years now....and the tobacco has progressively been getting worse and worse.  Meaning....the low level of nicotine in the tobacco is not satisfying at all!  I can smoke 3 cigs in a row....and barely feel like I got any nicotine.  And the shit inside the tobacco burns like a god damn forest fire!  It smells like wood or plastic or I don\'t know what.  They smoke like crazy!  And they burn a lot faster too!  I can tell you that the Kentucky Tobacco they bought back when these places opened....is NOT the same as the shitty tobacco they get today...but still call it the "same Kentucky Tobacco".  And try to explain this to someone that works at these places who doesn\'t even smoke....is like talking to the wall.  I know the owners have got to know that this tobacco really sucks now.  But I guess they figure...you get what you get.  Clearly they are getting much cheaper tobacco than in the past.  It\'s almost like it\'s 30% normal tobacco and 70% who the hell knows?  But what I do know is....it\'s a fraction of the nicotine that was in the original Kentucky Tobacco they used to get and now it sets off the damn smoke detectors in my house from them burning like a camp fire!  Good things never last.'
