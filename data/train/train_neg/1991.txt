b"I wouldn't normally take the time to write a review, but my HORRIBLE experience today has driven me to do so.  Their Customer Service Call Center is atrocious!  Not only are you placed on hold for forever (my combined calls amounted to nearly an hour and a half in wait time), but whenever they attempted to transfer me to another department, the call was dropped!  They never answered any of my questions, only repeated what I had stated in the beginning.  I suggest to request to speak to a manager (the one that actually took my call was quite helpful) if you want to get anything done."
