b"So, once upon a time I fancied myself a rocker. I had the requisite black hair in jr high school, the ripped t-shirts, etc. I outgrew the phase like most people do, grew out my hair , started easing up on the teen angst. But deep inside I believed that I could still hold my own, so that if I walked into a punk show I could still rock out with the best of them. Thanks to the Distillery, I now know that is a lie. I am not even close to hardcore, and I never ever was. I'm at peace with this.We were heading somewhere completely different but walked by when someone suggested we go in. For some reason I did, and  due to a mis-communication half of us had paid to get in while half refused to go in and left. Those that wouldn't actually ARE more hard core, and that speaks to how the rest of the night went. The people were fairly rude, jostling everybody and giving the outsiders dirty looks. Definitely a hard crowd. Everyone looked like they'd stepped off the cover of a Rancid album. Lots of scowls. They had a tiny circle pit, as everyone was too busy affecting coolness to join in. The band was awful and the cover overpriced considering. We finished our beers and left to rejoin with the smarter group. Yep, not hardcore at all! Phew, close call!"
