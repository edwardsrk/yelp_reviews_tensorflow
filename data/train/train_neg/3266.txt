b"I am not a fan of the ordering method here as I prefer the paper pencil experience. I visited solo during the lunch rush and probably won't go back again. The service was fine but the food itself was not right. I ordered salmon sushi, kamikaze roll, rainbow roll, salmon avocado handroll and a yam tempura handroll. Postive: - the rolls I ordered came in a set of four so I wasn't comatose after - the items came out promptly with very little wait time in between (good for solo diners)- complimentary green teaNegative:- too much rice in the kamikaze roll- not as fresh tasting as other AYCE's- low sodium soya sauce tasted like regular soya- tempura sweet potato was cold (see below)Just as I finished eating, I noticed the restaurant had vacated and I was the only patron inside. I thought I'd order something hot since I wasn't quite full so I asked for a tempura sweet potato handroll. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the friers (or so I thought) click on. Out comes my handroll in record speed. I guess they anticipated more sweet potato eaters during their rush and made too much. Low and behold, my handroll came out cold and saugy-like, not crispy, hot and yummy. I was super disappointed since I was the ONLY person there and they had no other focus to pay attention to but me. Wrongo. I won't return simply because the food didn't taste amazing, really good, or good for that matter. It was just 'meh'. I'll go try elsewhere next time. Two stars because the service was good. Food gets 1/5 stars."
