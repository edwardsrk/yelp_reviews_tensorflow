b"I knew this place as Shoeless Joe's some time ago, so when it closed, I assumed with the construction on the exterior that the entire building was going to be razed in order to provide Toronto with another block of o-so-needed condominiums.  Next thing I know, Stix & Stones arrived with a sandwich board outside inviting you in.Keen to try out the new digs, I found a day that had a decent hockey game on and assumed they would carry over the sporting theme.  With a name like Stix & Stones, you'd expect a pool lounge and sports bar.  Well, they've got a pool table, and TVs that show sports in a surrounding that is more an attempt at urban chic than cozy sports bar or pool hall.  It's nice enough, but not what is expected, considering the main door still has the old Shoeless Joe baseball bat door handles welcoming you in.  The construction outside pretty much hides the restaurant from plain view, so they're already are kind of behind the eight ball.The menu is wide and has usual pub faves.  If the nachos are an indicator, food will have high and low points.  The array of multi-coloured chips and the amount of toppings were great, presented in a long stylish plate different from most other nacho platings.  Sadly the chicken on the chicken nachos seemed to be obviously pre-cooked and rubbery.The tap list is really limited for a bar and you find yourself resorting to the next best thing unless you like what they have on offer.  Service, though friendly, was really lax for the few clients they had.  Sad to say but the nachos are indicative of the place as a whole.  Stylish, but with some poor elements that are hard to ignore."
