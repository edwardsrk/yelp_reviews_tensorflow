b'It might be a bit early to rate this joint as it\'s still fairly new... BUT, because it\'s new, I can\'t say that I had a great first impression.  Thumbs up to the atmosphere and decor - it was refreshing to see a bar in Vegas that didn\'t look like a typical bar in Vegas.  I enjoyed the live music - definitely a nice touch.. took a peek at the lounge but didn\'t find it too inviting... As for the food, the appetizer selection was great.. the entrees?  Not so much.  Had one of the "TV" dinners.  Wasn\'t expecting much so I would say I was indifferent overall.Our server wasn\'t exactly friendly and didn\'t appear to know too much about the menu or what beers they had in stock (ordered 3 different beers and they were out).  Growing pains I\'m sure... but I think I\'ll give it a couple months before I give it another go.'
