b"Went here often for a few months for the cheap prices and large portions. The noodles are tasteless and dry. Plain long grain rice, not steamed sticky rice. Meat is tough. I usually ordered the lemon chicken, which tasted just like that. Lemon sauce on chicken. The bf tried different things, but always had to ask for more sauce due to the dry crunchy noodles. And they didn't seem intentionally crunchy, I think it stemmed more from a lack of freshness.The final straw for me was when I ordered wonton soup and the broth tasted like dish water. I haven't been back since.plenty more cheap Chinese eats in the city. Avoid this one."
