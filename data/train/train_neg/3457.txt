b"Friend and I came last week for sandwiches to be told that they didn't receive they're shipment and had no food to serve. Came back today and when I ordered I was told they're out of tomatoes. They're also out of straws. And after waiting for 10 minutes for my sandwich was also told that they're ALSO out of chicken... might want to rethink their suppliers and hire more to speed up their service!!"
