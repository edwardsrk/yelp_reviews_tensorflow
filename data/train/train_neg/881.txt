b'This was the worst manicure/pedicure I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever go to her again. The reasons for my low rating:1.K Von said that she guarantees her work and that it will last at least 2 weeks. 4 days after my gel manicure, it started to lift & peel. This has NEVER happened when I got gel I asked her to redo it and she would only do it on the days she was free. She refused to do it a week after it happened. That doesn\'t seem like " I always guarantee my work" to me. 2. She was very unprofessional in my opinion. She kept on talking about how little she makes in this business, how expensive it costs. I think she says that so I will tip her more. She also cussed several times in my presence and talked too much about her personal life.3. The "salon" is a small room in a salon and she has a limited selection of nail colors. Overall, number 2 and 3 wouldnt really bother me that much. The main concern is that my nails only lasted 4 days. Very disappointing'
