b'My CEO was livid.  First we were supposed to be in the speakeasy room as we had 16 people. Originally I requested the lounge but later requested the speakeasy.  I called and spoke with the event coordinator to make sure again that we got the speakeasy room.  When we showed up at the restaurant we were seated right next to the band in the lounge vs the speakeasy room.  We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated there.  We were hungry and the tables were not set up.  After being seated we waited another half hour for a waiter to come by just to order wine and appetizers.  We had to get up and track down a manager to serve us.  He was great but a little too late.  After finally getting our wine and appetizers and finishing that, we waited again about 15-20 minutes for a waiter and finally had to track down a waiter again to order food.  We spent over $3,000 to get such terrible service and to be put in a place right next to a loud band.  Not cool.  Would not recommend for large groups.'
