b"I went to Pete's because my roommates love this place, but, I come from the Pacific Northwest.  The fish was okay, but, the fries were soggy and the shrimp tasted like breaded cardboard.  The only saving grace was the sauce they give you, but, it was weirdly spicy and I wasn't a fan of that either.  Take into account that everyone has their own tastes, but, I won't eat there again."
