b"Here we are take 2 of coming to the new one with my soulmate. First experience bacon they served at dinner was from lunch. I was been offered Big Bear bucks that never came in the mail. So when my mom came to visit we came again then I told the manager that my big bear bus never came so she gave me  20 dollars in big bucks 2 that expire in 16 2 that expire in 2017. So coming in today very hungry took 5 minutes to even get a drink. And that was from somebody that wasn't even our server took our order without a pen and didn't even get it right. order wasnt taken for 10 minutes and  get my coffee , 30 minutes to find out that my food isn't even being cooked and now that it did it is rushed bread and sammich different temps and some nice grissle from the grill and no one is even come over to say we're really sorry about that your food's coming up right now. 40 mins now after writing this. Finally get my food. Thankfully I'm not allergic to tomato's that are hiding on my plate they left.  Fries are half old half 3rd degree burn in my mouth."
