b"What went wrong is the service. We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later...."
