b'I wanted to like this place but it just had too much going against it. I\'m not sure if it\'s a chain but we tried another place with the same name but that was either closed for the day or forever, we couldn\'t tell. We found this one a little bit of a drive away and figured we\'d try it out. It\'s supposed to have "the best ribs in the state", but I\'ll never know as after ordering them, we were told they were out of ribs. We had the pork shoulder which was OK but I was looking forward to ribs. We\'re not from the area so decided to eat in, lucky for us we were one of the first there for dinner as they only have 1 table. Drinks were "you can buy them from the machine there or cross the street to the convenience store and pick something up". There are too many other better BBQ places around to bother going back, maybe it\'s good if you live nearby and can do takeout?'
