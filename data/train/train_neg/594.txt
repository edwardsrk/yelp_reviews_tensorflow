b"Greeted with the smell of weed on our floor.  I don't smoke but meh, whatcha gone do? The clientele left a little to be desired.  Being so close to Fremont you could here everything going on down there.  Again, we in Vegas so it is what it is.  There was a constant knocking in the bathroom that would never go away.  To top it off, there was an uninvited guest when I turned on the light around 1am.  I will post it shortly. The cherry on top was what sounded like a piece of paper that got stuck in the AC around 2 that did not stop until we turned it off at 7.  I've stayed at Red Roof's or Mo 6's that were nicer.  The only redeeming quality was the Hash House, more on that later."
