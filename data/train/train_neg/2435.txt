b"Ouch. What happened between opening weekend and Labor Day weekend?  We had a great time on opening weekend, so much so we bought season passes. This weekend was TERRIBLE!  Sure there were more people, but the staff was rude. I actually got yelled at by an 18 year old life guard (as a 40 year old father) for standing too close to a railing. Meanwhile, no one gave a crap about the fact some teenagers stole my kids' $6.50 rented rafts from their hands in the wave pool. Later when we went to complain and get new rafts, the line was so long we just gave up and went home. I ate a reasonably priced $7.99 cheeseburger meal with fries and a medium Pepsi, but the meat was so terrible I couldn't finish it. It was insult to injury as they only had four of the eight order windows open, so it took forever to order, even though they had staff inside standing around doing nothing. Maybe it's just normal kinks they have to work out each year with new staff, but I'm pretty pissed about buying season passes now. Pick it up Big Surf, management 100% to blame today!"
