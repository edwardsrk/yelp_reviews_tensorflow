b"I visited this bar come-music -come games venue around a month ago. First off, the huge, warehouse feel to the front section with randomly scattered tables and chairs didn't feel a cosy or nice place to sit down for a meal...and then when I looked at the meal prices, my mind was made up  - so expensive!The high cost continued with the whiskey I ordered: came to nearly $9 for a regular brand - and only 1oz too! Not cool in my books.Service was fine - although it was pretty empty when we went. The rear of the premises is set out for live music...it actually looks very nice! I haven't seen a band there, so I don't know about cover charges or sound quality..but I may venture back if i see a decent band listed there.Overall, a pretty average place with above average prices."
