b'So, for some dumb reason I guess Justice has taken away their store wide 40% off sales and, apparently, have lowered all the regular prices by "50%".......I find this very hard to believe when I found a cheapy tshirt marked for $29 now - I\'m certain that was not a previously $58 shirt......Justice, you\'ve just lost a few very very good customers!!! I\'ve shopped there with my twins since they could fit into your clothes and have relied on your sales. We\'ll take our business elsewhere.....until you bring the big sales back. Newsflash - your clothing is not worth $30-50 per item, far from it!!!!'
