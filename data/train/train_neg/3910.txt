b"I generally enjoy this restaurant and tonight's visit seem to be going well. Waiter was great and drinks were delicious. We ordered calamari, crab cakes and mussels to share.  The crab cakes were delicious and so was the calamari, however. half way through we found a hair in the dish.  Obviously not on of our own because it was caked in the calamari batter.  We all know this can happen and when we told the waiter he promptly took the plate saying he would show the manager.  Our mussels were brought out later and they were yummy, as well.  The issue came when we received our check with the calamari on it.  Not only did we find the hair but the waiter took away half of the order once we found it.  Absolutely no reason why it should have been on our bill.  Very disappointed about this."
