b'Let me begin by saying I have never eaten their food, and unfortunately never will due to my encounter with this truck today in Phoenix. During an emergency situation in which a firetruck was trying to make it through traffic on the i17, I found myself gazing at the lovely looking food truck next to me (Bang-Bang Dumplings - displaying cherry blossoms and a large Buddha statue...) Ironically, as traffic was forced to move this seemingly peaceful food company decided to push their truck and food trailor into my lane, which was bumper to bumper. I had no choice but to hit the gas and go forward or this truck would have caused me to crash into the side railing to the right of me - where an emergency responder was coming up on a motorcycle. As I looked out my window to try and figure out what to do, the woman and young man in the front of this truck immediately began screaming "F*ck you!" and honking their horn repeatedly until I finally lost my temper. I admit that, but I was also unnecessarily endangered by this company\'s reckless driving. As a localist, I know I will not be supporting a company that treats members of our community this way. What a horrible experience. Even if their food is good, this ruined it for me. Glad to see from the reviews I\'m not the only one who has crossed paths with Bang-Bang Dumplings reckless driving.'
