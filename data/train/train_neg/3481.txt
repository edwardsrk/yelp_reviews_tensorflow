b"I am a very frequent customer here since before the remodel and today I was so disappointed. I go in for a pedicure and a dip manicure. The pedicure was okay. Good massage but she seemed very inexperienced. The design I wanted to get, she didn't want to do it so I had to settle for a big snowflake. It wasn't even done with a good job just kind of lazily put on. The dip manicure is what really got under my skin. She didn't even know how to do it. She had to keep stopping and asking questions and taking it off and redoing it. I asked for a French tip with a Christmas tree design. The tips aren't even. The line is shaky. And for the design, It was terrible. I asked her to take it off and she got all pissed off and finished the manicure just like that. I'm so disappointed with the service today."
