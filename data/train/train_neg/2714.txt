b"On the positive side, the place has nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.  On the negative side, the food just isn't that good and our service was a bit slow.  We tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was a bunch of bun and a small piece of chicken.  Two different burgers were tried with the sides mixed up on each.  Last was a wood fired pizza which came out 15 minutes after everything else.  It was evidently the pizza guys first night, and it showed.  The pizza was soggy in the middle and not what a wood fired pizza should be.  I would love to say I would try again, but when 4 out of 4 entrees are average to not good, it is hard to recommend."
