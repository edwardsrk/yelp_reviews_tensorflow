b'My coffee was luke warm.  I ordered a medium coffee with cream and honey. The cup was warm on the outside so I didn\'t notice it until i drove away and by that time I wasn\'t about to go back and wait in the long line again to ask for a hot coffee. They either just serve "warmish" coffee or they put to much cream that it makes the coffee cold. Either way it was a big disapointment as I was on the road and had to drive through starbucks around the corner to get a hot coffee.'
