b"This place is quick, just like any other Starbucks. Although, I order a hot drink on the mobile app and when I arrive to pick it up it was iced. I did let them know and they fixed it and I went on my way.  I decided to give them a second try the next day and the same issue occurred. This time I did not want to even bother and ask for my drink to be remade because I was in my way to work. I did double check my orders both days thinking I could have order iced instead of hot, but I didn't."
