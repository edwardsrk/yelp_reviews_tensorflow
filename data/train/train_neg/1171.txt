b'We have been to a lot of improv comedy shows and this one just did really live up to what I expect to be good improv. The location was good. The price was a little high for the product. seemed more like a place for kids. Could not stand the seats. Could not stand the MC. had some funny parts but the show in general felt dull and dragged on. Would suggest other places over this one like improvMANIA, The Torch, or even The Jesterz if you are looking for "clean comedy". I would not go back.'
