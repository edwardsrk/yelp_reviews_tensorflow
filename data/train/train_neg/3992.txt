b"I have just been to this Irish Pub with 3 friends for breakfast and it was an underwhelming experience. The server was slow and forgot parts of our order which meant one of us was waiting while the others were eating.The food:Eggs ordered over easy were cracked with the yolk leakingHash browns were mixed with overpowering onion'Irish' sausages were unimpressive (here's a tip Murphy's Law, buy your bangers from Sprouts)Perhaps it's because it's a new business but the basics of a decent breakfast shouldn't be that hard to master. I actually like the look and feel of the bar and will probably be back for a few pints and a Shepherds Pie but I would suggest you go elsewhere for breakfast ."
