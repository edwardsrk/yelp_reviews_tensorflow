b"The one star is only because our waitress Alyssa was great, but the food was some of the worst Irish food I've ever had in my life.We started off with their potato soup. One cup came to the table looking like soup and the other two looked like congealed porridge, not to mention they where all extremely salty. The cheese curds where about the best thing they had, but the onion rings were soggy and anemic looking.My wife had the pork shank that was so over smoked, she couldn't even taste the flavor of the pork. To this day she can't eat anything smoked because of it.My son had the shapers pie and said it was bland and tasteless, not worth $13.I had the bangers and mash by the recommendation of the waitress and they where in-eatable. The gravy on the massed potatoes was a gloppy gelatinous mass that would stick to the fork like The Blob.Needless to say I will not be going back there for anything ever again. Money down the drain."
