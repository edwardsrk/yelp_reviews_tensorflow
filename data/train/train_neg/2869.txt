b'I really do like this place however we went to take family here tonight and had a pretty bad experience. Place was empty except for some hooligans making terrible noise at the bar we were the only people in the restaurant. They cranked up music so we couldnt hear the noisy bar people but it was too loud. Food was good as always but then it came time to pay. They refused my groupon because they said I ordered a special item. They also assured me that I would save way more money if I paid the full price. Got home and looked at TOS of groupon and they lied about that and then calculated my price w groupon...they lied about paying full price would be cheaper as well. I can see the owners try really hard with these place but it sounds like they have hired some incompetent people. That stunt they pulled tonight cost them a serious customer. Such a shame......'
