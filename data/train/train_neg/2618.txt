b"We shop at smiths all the time, we enjoy the value and quality of products we receive from this establishment....  How ever at first I could not remember why we stop shopping at this particular location until today..... The staff needs to undergo hospitality course.... everyone at this location are extremely rude to customers, (from the customer service counter, cashiers, floor staff, and manager)..... The Manager- the main staff member that's suppose to set an example (I wanted to talk to him about the rudeness of his staff), when I over heard him yelling at the cashier (who went to retrieve him for me) stating their in a staff meeting and then slammed the door in the associate's face...... I walked out and said never again, I am done I have no respect for this location at all !!!!!!!!!!!!! Shopping here is not that serious... I refuse to be disrespected being a patron !!!!!!!!!!!! (I respect you and I expect it in return !!!!!!!!!)"
