b'I started taking my pup here for the self wash during the fall/winter months and it was great. The self wash is always clean and easy to use. The water seemed to be at good temperature in the cooler months. But as the summer months rolled around and the temperature outside increased so did their self wash water. I brought my pup here for her routine washing but I noticed that their water was insanely hot, almost scalding that I could barely keep my hand under. My dog was obviously uncomfortable as well. I was told to keep running the water to hopefully cool it. But after about 10 minutes the water did not cool down. One of the workers had told us that the water has been "sitting in the pipes all day." I figured that they did not have  temperature controlled water to ensure your pets safety. I was really disappointed to find this out especially because the staff is so friendly and I honestly love their self wash. Until it is fall/winter again, I will be going to another self wash.'
