b'As others have noted, the prices are high for what you get ($15-25) for burgers and $10-20 for glasses of wine.  The atmosphere was nice if you can snag a booth, more cozy than the sports bar further up the concourse.  The burger was a bit overdone, as were the panko chicken tenders.  BBQ sauce is the sauce of choice.  The wines were of acceptable quality, at least if you are going to pay a high price you get something that is OK.'
