b"Well, it used to be so great! but as of recently many things have changed! (1-14-14) The prices are still the same, yet the quality of it has decreased a bit. I use to LOVE their salads, and i kid you not i could not find sufficient lettuce in a salad. They also used to supply a little bag of chips No extra charge, but now the policy has changed and you must purchased the chips. Which is Fine, but then when i got to my smoothie...oh boy it was watered down sufficiently. It's not even a smoothie anymore more like JUICE! So UPSET! i doubt i will be visiting again."
