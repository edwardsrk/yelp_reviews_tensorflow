b"These people are liars and scammers!!!!  I requested a quote, which they gave me ($39 to clean an 8'x10' carpet, and $39 to clean a three-seat sofa), and then they followed up with multiple calls to try to book the business.  I thought they were motivated and eager, so I booked them.  They LIED about the service, they LIED about the price, and when the rug cleaner showed up at my house and told me the REAL price ($499 for JUST THE RUG!!!) , I called the office and spoke to them on speaker phone.  The cleaner, who could hear the entire speakerphone conversation,  could hardly believe how RUDE and DISHONEST the rep (Natalie) was to me.  They don't even send their own people; the cleaner drove a truck with the logo and phone # of a different company.  THIS company just LIES about prices and services, and then outsources the work.  I hate dealing with scum like this because they waste my time and give other honest companies in their industry a bad name."
