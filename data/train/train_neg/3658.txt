b'First of all, I would like to start with the service which deserves more than 2 stars as it was the best part. The calamari and prawn appetizers were good, as was the wine. The main course which was the special for the night the Filet was horrible! I had to send my "medium well" back as the blood was pouring out as soon as I cut into it and they were two different sizes and I believe two cuts (which were not filet) it was tough, grainy and lacked flavour. I would not recommend the Steak. My husband also had the Filet and also had two different cuts ,one was over cooked and one was under cooked. The Chef needs to learn how to cook a steak. The veggies were old and soggy not crisp and fresh. Best part of the meal was the potatoes. Pretty bad for a $30.00 plus meal. I would say if I do return, I would try a pasta dish as this is probably their speciality.'
