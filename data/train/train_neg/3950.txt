b"We liked blue nile when it was here and based on these reviews, we were excited to try this new place. When I called in our order, I asked for the injera to be boxed separately, but the woman's English was so poor, she couldn't understand me. When we got there, we saw the cute ambiance was now horrible, the tables are pushed to the front with gathering areas in the back, a horrible highlighter yellow paint on the wall. Kenny G was playing. It's true it isn't expensive and portions are generous, but some of the spices were off. I loved the cabbage, potato, carrot side, but the dark red spicy lentils tasted medicinal. They wrapped everything up inside the injera so it was soggy by the time we got home. There was only one other roll of injera per box. We likely won't return."
