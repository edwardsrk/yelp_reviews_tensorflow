b'I\'ve been to this location a few times. I think my latest visit will be my last. I hadn\'t had a hero burger in about a year and placed an order for a 6oz. The lady cashier asked "is cheddar cheese ok?" and I said "sure" thinking ok, you get free cheese now, great. Of course when I get the bill I see the extra $0.99 charge for cheese and thought that was some seriously sleazy up selling. I was also reminded how incredibly overpriced this burger combo is coming in at close to $15. People, this is a basic burger and definitely not worth that price. Anyway, while I waited nearly 15 minutes for my order, I also realized how slow this place was. When my order was ready, I realized that the lady pre-packages everything and doesn\'t let you get extra ketchup, napkins or anything. You get what they give and she made it seem like she did me a solid by giving me an extra ketchup packet when I asked her for one. There was a customer who asked for extra napkins and she gave them one. ONE. They don\'t even leave napkins out for customer to use as needed. Anyway. I won\'t be back as this place is clearly getting worse and worse. But now they\'re even being sneaky with their up selling. I\'m staying away from this communist crap heap.'
