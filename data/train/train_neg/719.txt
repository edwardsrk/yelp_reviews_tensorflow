b'Today myself my Mother and my fiance decided to visit Pho 35 for the first time. We were glad to see a Pho house so close to home. The place was busy. I ordered the number 9. It was OK had a very rich almost Curry flavor. Both my Mother and Fiance ordered Spring rolls. They seemed semi fresh the Rice paper had already begun to harden. My mother had already eaten one order and on the last bite or so on the second order a FLY spilled out from the tightly wrapped roll. I can not believe it. I am flat disgusted. I am a F&B Manager and take pride in my work for this to happen already and this place barley open speaks volumes about there Food Prep. I will never eat there again and will actively encourage my friends never to attempt such a place. Note that once we notified the server he disappeared to the back. Several minutes passed before he emerged. He said nothing to us so we just walked out. Poor service altogether!'
