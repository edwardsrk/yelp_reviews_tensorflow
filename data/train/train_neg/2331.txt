b"Had to send the steak back 3 times- unacceptable-medium rare should not be a difficult task for an establishment that considers itself a steak house-  all the sides were great (all i got to eat since they never prepared the steak appropriately) especially the little frieshere is the steak experienceask for medium rarereceive blood flowing rawsend backreceive charred on the outside no flowing blood but still clearly rawsend backreceive new steak- i tell the waiter to stay and watch, even before cutting i can tell that this steak (which is again charred on the outside) will again be rawno steak for me this nightmanager makes cursory attempt at apology, takes steak off, gee big thank you there considering i didn't eat it, nothing else was comped, i figure since my wife pretty much ate alone that they would have made up a little more-  dont think i ever paid over $200 for a meal i didnt get to eat before, and i dont intend on doing it againeat any where else in the hotel and you are sure to enjoy yourself,  would be really hard for me to consider giving this place another shot with all the other options in Vegas"
