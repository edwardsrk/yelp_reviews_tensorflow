b"As a CAMBODIAN, this is the closest taste that is similar to my own. I would not recommend this restaurant. It is highly expensive for the crappy service like this.I walked into this restaurant and stood there along with many other customers and no waiter cared enough to ask us until I decided to walk down there at the cashier and asked where can I sit. This is not so friendly service at all. That did not end there. I've been sitting there with no one come to ask me what I wanted to order for like 20 minutes. Finally when I do, it took another half hour for the food to arrive.I spent 22$ for a bowl of soup, tiny little bowl of noodles, and two drinks. People you can eat at other Asian restaurant and more food than this."
