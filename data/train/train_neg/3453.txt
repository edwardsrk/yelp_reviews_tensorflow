b"Came here quickly today to grab a burrito with a co worker. The food was okay for fast food type meal but the service wasn't. I ordered with a rude woman who sounded like we were in-convincing her. She verbally corrected everything I said with a rude undertone. Okay... I don't eat here and j don't know the technical names of the menu items but I know I want a burrito why does it matter..... We get to the window and we sit there for a few moments before being acknowledged. We paid she handed us the food and slammed the window. Maybe she was having a bad day.. Not sure. Gaiety is the ticket name on receipt. Won't come back no wonder food like this is cheap"
