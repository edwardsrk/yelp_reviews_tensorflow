b'They have come out to our house twice on service calls and done what we\'ve asked them to do with no problems. We gave them a call because they had serviced the previous owners and we had their contact information. Their work on the service calls was 5-star.The 2-star rating has to do with some estimates they provided to help repair some issues with our pool. I think, in general, pool service work is overpriced - "if you can afford a pool, you can afford high prices" seems to be the prevailing thought that I\'ve found thus far. Their prices were in line with other quotes we received. However, we had a particular issue with our spa side remote - the buttons did not seem to work and turn on the specified functions. They quoted us a full replacement on this that came close to $1000. When I did some more research on my particular problem, I found that the side remote was simply not programmed - I programmed it and now it works fine. I was appalled that they would have taken my $1000 for what amounted to programming a perfectly good remote - this makes me very suspect to use them for any of their other estimates, and when I need to get that work done will go elsewhere. I feel that they should have known that the remote was not programmed when they made the service call and feel that thy were trying to fleece me with this one.'
