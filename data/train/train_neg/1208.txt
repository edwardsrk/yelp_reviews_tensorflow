b'Because of plans that needed to be maid last minute my family and I were stuck with this hotel for the night. We paid $120+ for a $50 room.- Hotel doors face the outside so there is less security.- breakfast was the "cold bread" kind - prepackaged cereal and pastries. Nothing warm.- blankets had gaping holes in them - http://flic.kr/p/c7GdiS- best part was the signed form letter in the hotel room. Note the "Insert your info - http://flic.kr/p/c7Gdr3- nothing updated or renovated in 15 yearsIf still interested in staying there, look for the parking lot with weeds growing through the cracks.'
