b"Oh Flamingo, you old bird. All you need is a good (bird) bath to clean your skanky carpets in the common areas, and fluff your feathers-- I mean, freshen up your rooms. I actually like the atmosphere in the Casino and shopping areas... folks are pretty friendly and there's a good vibe. But you need to be eating some new birdseed... and by that I mean, freshen up every part of your business (especially lobby/casino decor, room quality, maintenance/upkeep, and food service).You have have good lineage. And your recently-refurbished guest rooms are a step in the right direction (though, while I'm not crazy about the Peptol-Bismol-pink bathroom walls, the electric drapes are a nice feather in your plume). It just seems like you're at 55% right now when, if you just got flapping, you could be at 100%. Or even 110%-- shoot for the skies!Dear Flamingo, please don't lay an egg! Leave the comfort of your nest and soar like you are meant to (or at least balance on one leg like you are meant to), sweet Flamingo!"
