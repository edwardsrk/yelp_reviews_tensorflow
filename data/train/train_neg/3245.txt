b"I live here in Las Vegas.  I stayed at Trump last weekend for a Staycation.  I usually stay at a casino based hotel but I decided to try Trump because I have stayed at his properties in NYC and Chicago, both amazing.  Sadly my stay was ruined by the train the runs by a block away every 45 minutes to an hour all night and day.  I was on the 41st floor and it sounded like the train was in my bed.  It blows it's horn 4-5 times every time it passes.  In the morning I complained to management and she said they don't always experience the train all night.  I live here.. The train passes all night.  She offered to refund my resort fee and a %25 discount.  She acted like it was my  fault the train passes.  She said they were working with the county concerning the train.  There is a railroad crossing on the west side.  The train has to blow it's horn unless they close the pass.  Good luck.  Never imagined Trump would build a hotel next to a train."
