b"Well, I sure feel like I just took some money out of my wallet and lit it on fire.The quesadilla appetizer was decent (though a waste of duck confit), but it all went downhill from there.The chicken pot pie entree was undersized, bland, and worth perhaps half of the $16 asking price. My wife's ribeye special, ordered medium, arrived well done in most parts and was coated with a foul-tasting char. Also offensively priced at $30. The only saving graces were the excellent beer selection and the pleasant (though somewhat awkward) service from our waiter and hostess. The restaurant itself, housed inside a repurposed old movie theatre, is a great idea that deserves better food to go with it. It's a shame that the food is so weak, because the east side needs more strong restaurants. I hope that Fracas can work out its issues.Perhaps I was asking for trouble going to a restaurant marketed via Groupon.  Despite the discount, still paid a sum that could have gotten me a stellar meal at Greenhouse Tavern."
