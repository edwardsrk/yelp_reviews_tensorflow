b"I had heard good things about this hotel but in my first and only stay it was pretty miserable. Vending machines on my floor didn't work the entire 3 days I was there. Internet was down more often than not. Room service unavailable because ovens were down. The 45 minute fire alarm at 3 am was the icing on the cake. I would not recommend this place to anyone ever. I'll make sure my company travel agent also takes this off the list."
