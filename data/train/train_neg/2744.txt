b"This review is for the service, not for the food!   My parents was excited to go to Vegas, and wanted to try this restaurant.  When they were there, it did not seem busy inside, and she told the waiter 2 people, and the waiter did not check inside at all, just pointed the small table near the entrance and told my mom that's the only table he had.  He did not even ask if my parents want to wait for better table.  His tone was not friendly with attitude.  My parents were not happy with his attitude, and they left.  It should be a beautiful night at Vegas, but the service was not good enough for Vegas standard!"
