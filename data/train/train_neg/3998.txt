b"Went to the Salty Senorita for after dinner drinks.  I was with my wife and a friend. We waited for about 10 minutes for a waitress and decided to order our drinks from the bartender. The drinks were great. Excellent Margaritas. Waitress did finally come by and asked if we wanted food and we declined. Never saw her again. We did end up having to go back to the bartender for another round. It leaves no imagination as to why there were so many empty tables there on a Saturday evening. I guess everyone else knew what I no know. You go there for the drinks and you will not be disappointed as long as you do not expect much service. I'll bet the waitress doesn't understand why her tips are so low!"
