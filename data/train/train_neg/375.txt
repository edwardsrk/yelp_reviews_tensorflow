b'View was beautiful and I enjoyed the roof top atmosphere. The food was absolutely horrid and the service was worse. If your into dried out awfully put together overpriced burgers with no sides your in the right Place. Our waitress could not have cared less about the service she was providing. It took almost an hour to get our ticket and refills on any drink were never going to happen. She added gratuity to the ticket which explains why she simply did not care about the service she provided. Horrible restaurant with a prime location.'
