b"I started coming to this place because it's right next to my house & I have never waited long for an oil change. I've only ever done oil changes and smog here. I actually had nothing bad to say about this place until NOW! I went in on June 15th, 2011 for an oil change & smog. They were fast, BUT at the end when I was paying Pamela, the service writer suggested replacing the front brakes, and said I had 8% remaining. She also said I needed to replace my serpentine belt & that it's a common thing in the Las Vegas heat for this to need replacement. She quoted me $320 for these services. Due to my budget (I'm in the middle of purchasing a home & pregnant with my first child), I decided to shop around. My Dad reccomended going to Japanese Car Service, a place I used to take my previous cars, to get an estimate. It is far from convenient since its located in China Town & also takes 2-3 days to get seen. I told them all the issues Purrfect Auto found, and they said I had been lied to because my front & back brakes are at 60% & all belts are just fine. WOW, this place was so honest! I will never go back to Purrfect Auto again. If you're going for a quick oil change, I dont see any problems...but don't do any reccomended work there!"
