b"Hour wait even with reservations. We made 7:00pm reservations for a party of 2 and did not get seated until 8pm and that was after having to ask the host several times, and then finally for a manager. It took at least 15 minutes for the employees to find her. This location has just really gone down hill, I've been to many Benihanas throughout the country from locations in Atlanta, Detroit, San Diego, and this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Benihana's. It looked as if they were short staffed there were at least 4 grills that were not being used. One positive experience was our chef Joseph made the food delicious and of course entertaining. The manager did seem understanding and apologized and was willing to try and make our visit better. But, still will not be returning to this location."
