b'I would give this place zero stars after the experience my friends and I had last night. We waited 1 hour to get in which was not a problem because it was expected being that it\'s Memorial Day weekend. Once we get to the front we stand there for another 5-7 mins and then the doorman told us that our guy friend could not get in because he was wearing camouflage print. He began to state that women can wear whatever they want but men can not. We asked if there was anything anywhere stated about the dress code because we tend to recommend this place to a lot of our guest that stay at our resort. He said it\'s corporate that has these dress codes in place. So still confused and embarrassed we begin to get out of line he whispered to us that if we slide him something he will talk to management and let us in. At that point we are all offended because is that the dress code or not because I can give you money on the low to get in and then on top of that still pay $40 just to get in. So how is that ok to tip the doorman so he can speak to the manager to allow my friend in. Had we had "slid him something" would we have been kicked out once security or a manager spotted my friend in his camouflage and have to leave?! That was the worst experience and the fact that we had other friends who were planning on coming that night was a huge mistake and I can no longer recommend this place to anyone else because of the bad service from the doorman.'
