b'The concept is awesome .Its $60 an hour. So it will be pricey if you think this is a date night kind of place. I guess limited space they need a deeper surcharge. I went on week night and they don\'t have any half an hour rate or weekday special to play the foot pool. So we decided to sit at the bar and eat. Drink menu was reasonable but we were hungry. Thought we would start with an appetizer- and that\'s where we stopped. Our Margarita pizza looked atrocious and tasted even worse. Raw basil on cheap cheese on a wet pizza dough that didn\'t look like it was cooked.I didn\'t mean to be rude- but when the waitress asked me how the food was, I honestly responded "Trash". I am sorry but I get cranky when I am hungry and having to eat that made it worse. Luckily there are other food places around and that solved it because that app gave me a good impression of the rest of the menu.I apologize for being rude as the servers and all the staff were genuinely helpful and very friendly.I might be back with a larger group and have drinks and rent the foot pool area.Food is bad- eat before you come!!'
