b"I know you're salty because your food tastes like it, chefs are creepy and sweaty mixed with frump and seems very unsanitary, waitress is a huge snail yet there is no escargot on the menu? everything sucks.. looks so dirty i swear i sat in the chair and dust flew up. if I could give zero stars I would, 1 even seems to be too much. Party of four wishes we would've went to our regular Ballentines spot for a steak and fries."
