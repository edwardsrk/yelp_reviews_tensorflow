b'I was very happy to see Pei Wei open at the Airport.It was really a big deal. Since all the other Asian restaurants shut down there.Major disappointment.First of all ,only a few items to choose from. Which maybe is understandable, since they need quick food ready to go.However, it is mostly all the really fatty foods. So I got a salad that was pre made.High price, but I know it is the airport.I had to wait for the girl to come to ring me up. She was angry and not happy to be there, and way too  busy talking to the other workers there about their personal life.That drives me crazy, plus I was the only one there at that moment.The 60 seconds that it takes to ring me up my order, should not take away from your personal chatter.  Plus I had to ask for a bag.When I did eat the salad it was full of white lettuce and the spine of the lettuce. Why do restaurants always do that now?The spine of the lettuce should never be in the salad! Ever!!I will say and mean it, I will never visit this place again in the Airport.Because, I really like Pei Wei normally.'
