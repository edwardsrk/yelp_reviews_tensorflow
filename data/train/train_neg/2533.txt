b'Not sure how I feel about this store.  Not the cleanest.  The dressing area was musty, and warm.   A lot of the clothing styles were nothing I would ever wear but my 16 year old grand daughter found quite a few things.  As I looked in more departments I was surprised to see so many interesting items.  Prices were sure good.  I walked away with just 1 blouse but would consider giving this store another try.'
