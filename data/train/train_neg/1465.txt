b"I stayed there from 12/23/2011 to 12/24/2011.  The room was very small and everything was very very old especially the bathroom.  It is like you are walking to a Victorian house.  The carpet has some stains on it, too.  Thanks God that I had stayed only two nights.  On the third night, we switched to South Point.  Although it was far away from the strip, everything was new - the room was very big and the bathroom was also very modern and comfortable.  In addition, South Point's buffet was only $3.30/person after using 50% coupon."
