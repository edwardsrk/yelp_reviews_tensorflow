b'I went in genuinely looking to purchase some high end beads. The owner seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. When I asked about some beads he gave me an outrageous price tag. I know beads well enough to know that they were over priced. I was friendly and said "Thanks so much, I will think it over" and he turned his back to me and walked away ignoring me. Not a word. OKayyyyyy. I actually won\'t think it over, I won\'t go back every again.'
