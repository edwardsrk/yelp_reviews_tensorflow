b"Poke has been a new trend in the GTA around the past 2 years, majority of poke places are opened in downtown so it's always exciting to see poke joints opened up closer to me. They have a ton of variety. You can either build your own bowl or get one on their fixed menu. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of food they serve. Perhaps the protein they use isn't fresh? It's already premixed with zucchini and scallions and drenched in soy sauce. The quantity of food is fair and it does fill me up, but is it good? Or will I ever go again? Probably not. There's also a line up which I don't understand since it's not even good and I'm practically surprised by how high this place is rated."
