b"Giving them 2 stars because they have made their cups smaller and I only get one drink from here which is the lemon king. It comes with a lemon and because the cups are now more taller and slender, the lemon is stuck and I cannot suck up my toppings. The cup also doesn't fit in my car holder cup because it's not standard and now the cup just falls back and forth and so I cannot drink my drink without it spilling over. I don't understand why they changed their cups when it obviously doesn't work for all their drinks. I had to open the plastic and pull the lemon out just to eat my tapioca. I would give them a 1 star but luckily their lemon king stilll tastes good. Just maybe next time I will ask them to leave it out."
