b'This place is over priced and under sized. The wait staff doesn\'t seem to know what a Pho restaurant is. I was in a hurry, so I sat at the bar and gave my entire order. The waiter goes into the kitchen comes back and starts texting and chatting with me. Fifteen minutes later, neither my appetizer or Pho had arrived. I asked what was going on and that I had a time limit. He went back in the kitchen then came back out, punched in my order. I\'m sitting three feet from the screen, I can see. The waiter told me the food runner took the food to another table. There was only one other couple there and they had already eaten  no food came out of the kitchen, it\'s a small restaurant I can see. The cook comes out of the kitchen and prepares my spring roll. Start to finish my spring roll took three minutes. I ate the roll and it was ok. 45 minutes after I ordered my pho had not arrived. Any other pho restaurant, all your food is ready in ten minutes or less. I told the guy I need to leave soon, he tells me that the cook is cooking the steak. IDIOT ALERT!! You serve the steak sliced and raw in hot broth. I had had enough. I was late. I dropped $10 for ONE ROLL and told the waiter that I was leaving for a movie. He said that he could make the order to go. I told him I couldn\'t take it because of the movie and left. The worst part. I was told very loudly, "Don\'t come back". Don\'t worry, I\'m not.'
