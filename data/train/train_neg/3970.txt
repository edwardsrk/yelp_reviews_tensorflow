b"Eaten here twice. Always gotta give a place a second chance. Both times I have been underwhelmed, especially after receiving such favourable reviews both on yelp and by friends. The meals are average quality with somewhat stale ingredients. The biggest kicker for me is it is relatively expensive for the underwhelming food. Don't get me wrong nothing wrong with value and I can appreciate a place that charges according to what they serve. This place needs to re-evaluate somewhat."
