b"It is a sorry time when a long established restaurant with good food has deteriorated to this point.  I have dined at Chicago Joe's several times over the past 15 years and it has always been a nice place to go for a solid Italian meal.  Decided to go there last minute at 5:30 last Saturday night.  Called to see if there was room for 5 and was told to come on down.  Arrived 15 min later and was seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waiter.  We ordered some garlic bread, 5 entrees w/salad and some drinks.  The garlic bread was hot and delicious, salad was plentiful.  We all normally love the garlic dressing but this time found it to lack garlic. On to the entrees, the chicken parm was an overcooked saut\xc3\xa9ed, tough chicken breast covered in sweet sauce that tasted like it was from a can with a melted piece of cheese on top.  (no breading, no seasoning, no flavor), The chicken Marsala was topped with a plentiful amount of mushrooms but the sauce was thin, watery and tasted like vinegar.  The linguini with clams was inedible and sent back. Lastly, my 12 yr old daughter wouldn't eat the Spaghetti with meat sauce as it had no flavor.  As you can see from my reviews we don't normally complain but this honestly was the WORST meal we have had."
