b"Terrible service. I'm literally sitting here waiting for my food to be cooked. I know it's nice knowing my food is being cooked fresh, but for a fast food place to completely run out of the things I wanted is just bad. I'm now having to wait 15-20 min for a fast food place to cook my food is ridiculous. They should know that the popular food items that are running low should be made right away to replenish before it completely out. As I'm waiting another customer came back in to complain about his order being short; I think he was in the drive through. I feel bad for the people thinking the drive through would be any faster since they too had to wait for the items to be cooked. Also while sitting here waiting for them to cook the tables are all completly dirty with crumbs all over. I will still eat Panda Express in the future; it just wont be from this location."
