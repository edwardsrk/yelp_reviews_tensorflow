b"Horrible!  Went there because I bought a Living Social coupon.  First of all, the booth was so uncomfortable.  The bench was way too low for the table.  Looking around I could see the same was true of the chairs at the tables.  Then there's the food.  I must say I enjoyed the chips and salsa very much.  The chips were warm and not salty, and the salsa was perfect.  I should have stopped eating at that point.  I ordered the steak fajitas -- one of my favorite dishes.  Not this one.  It was loaded with mushrooms.  Seriously, mushrooms?  Don't know what cut of meat they used, but it was tough and had NO flavor.  I actually had to salt it, which I've never done with fajitas ever!  Got to find another Mexican restaurant that knows how to cook."
