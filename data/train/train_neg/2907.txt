b"The food is pretty average here but the service was super friendly. I ordered a falafel plate and it was decent though a tad bland and kind of soggy.  It was a decent value though there wasn't anything particularly spectacular about this place. I've only been once so I'd be up for trying other items on their menu but their falafel was lackluster."
