b'I always use brake master for their clean and efficient service. I have always gone to the Scottsdale and Shea location but decided to stop by this location as I was going to be in this part of town for a couple hours. Got my oil changed and a permanent black stain on my passenger seat. I had just washed my truck the day prior and am very meticulous about cleaning my truck multiple times a week. I have tried wiping and shampooing my seats to no success. Good service but now I have this ugly stain to look at every day.'
