b"Since moving to the area we've been here a number of times. The place impressed me at first, however lately it seen the food has become a bit normal and giving you the wow factor. Sushi is decent not great, and the hot food is ok. I'd pass this one by until they updated the inside and maybe add or change the menu a bit."
