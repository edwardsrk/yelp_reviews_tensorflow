b"Went with a group of 9. Service was ok. Food was not tasty. Most remained their lunches. We tried their burgers, flatbreads, bowls, sandwiches. Nothing was impressive and honestly was bland. This was my third visit and likely the last. Unsurprisingly it wasn't that busy at the normally hectic noon hour"
