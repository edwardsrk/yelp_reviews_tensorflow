b"I really wish i could say more good things about perch but unfortunately I can't. I had such high hopes for this places based on reviews but was disappointed on multiple levels. First the host seemed like it was his first day bc he only wanted to offer me bar seating. However I was wearing a dress and meeting a girlfriend so that was not an option. Ultimately he spoke to another employee who told him to split up some of the other tables and seat us. Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down. Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it. Overall, the ambiance of the location is cute and very fresh. I think if i came back it would be for appetizers and drink perhaps. Wish i could say more good things but thats all folks!"
