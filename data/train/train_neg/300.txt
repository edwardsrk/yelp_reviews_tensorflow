b'This isn\'t the place to take your vehicle.They were suppose to front end alignment, front brakes. And change my oil with supplied oil.Got a call from Russell that all my rotors and pads needed to be redone. 1100.00, told them to go ahead, the oil was changed, with some new bolt put in as a drain plug (it is now leaking) they didn\'t put the spacer back on the right rear wheelWhen they did the brake job. The had billed the alignment, after I got there and asked about it,They removed it from the invoice cause they never did it, I\'m not done. The day after they did brakes I went to California. The from end was rattling a little more so when I stopped forGas I reached in and the top shock bolts were loose(I had asked them to check the front shocks, and was told they checked them  and they weren\'t leaking and they were fine. I own a construction company and was looking for a "honest" place to bring my work truck to as well as our personal vehicles to. This is NOT the place to bring any vehicle to. I have never written a bad review before this one, but what happened here isn\'t fair or the right way to do business.'
