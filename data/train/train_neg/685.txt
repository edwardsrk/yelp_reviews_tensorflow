b"This place deserves 0 stars. DO NOT EAT HERE! What a horrible experience my mom and I had last night. We ordered 3 taco combos for dinner. When we went to pick it up. They had given our order to another lady. They explained what had happened and said fresh tacos were being made right away. Which is 100% alright. Mistakes happen, understandable. UNTIL the women who got our order came back for her correct food. They gave her her order and proceeded to hand us the bag of cold taco combos this women had just returned... You gave a person our order. They went home, opened the food up. Noticed it was wrong. And returned it. What makes you think ANY person would want to pay and eat returned food. We got a refund and found dinner else where. I'm disgusted with the way this establishment handles business. I have a strong urge to report this to the Health Department."
