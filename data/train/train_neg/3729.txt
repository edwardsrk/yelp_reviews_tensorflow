b'I like Salsarita\'s but unfortunately this location seems to have gone downhill recently. We generally get take-out but lately we get home to find burnt quesadillas, quesadillas with no cheese on half of it, or a bag of broken "bottom of the barrel" chips. We usually go there because our kids like the place but even they don\'t like it anymore. Most of our order last night went straight in the trash can.'
