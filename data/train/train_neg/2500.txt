b"If you're looking for diner food, that's diner quality, then this is the place. It's everything you would find at a typical diner. The staff is very friendly and kind. One of the guys sat down right in the booth to take an order from the table next to us. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. The ambiance was that of a typical dinner --I thought the place was cute, both inside and out.The food is edible, but nothing beyond that. The food is diner food, and frankly, not even good diner food. I had an omelette and my son had pancakes and bacon. The bacon was so brittle that it just crumbled. My son thinks ALL bacon is good, no matter how its cooked, and he wouldn't touch it after one bite. The hash browns that came with my omelette were partially burnt. The omelette was OK, but nothing special. That being said, my dad LOVES this place and thinks it's the only place worth eating breakfast in town. Different strokes!"
