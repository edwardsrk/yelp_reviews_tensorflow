b"I feel a bit weird even writing a review on McDonald's since it's, you know, McDonald's. I do expect good service and for my order to be correct. I was pretty hungry and looking forward to eating a big mac that I hoped would be fresh. Sometimes the food here tastes old. I finally made it home and I'm ready to eat but noticed they forgot my fries. I was a little annoyed but did not want to take another trip there besides they can make it up to me with the juicy big mac I'm about to eat. To my surprise the big mac was not dry because, wait for it, they DIDN'T put any meat patties on my sandwich. Yes you read that right, there was cheese, onions, special sauce and etc but NO MEAT. Wow - how does that happen? This isn't  the first time this location has messed up my order but they have reached a new low."
