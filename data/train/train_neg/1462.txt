b'Honestly I agree this is by far the worst nail salon I have ever been to. The lady had an attitude doing my nails and complaint about how my fingers accidentally hit her finger. She was quick but really an awful job painting my nails and filing the edges, my nails looked like I could have done a better job myself than her. My nails are looking most rough than ever and the acrylics been only for 3 days and she charged me 27 dollars for a terrible filling. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT saying filling 20$'
