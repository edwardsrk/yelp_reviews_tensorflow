b"Dos Juevos is still wearing the hand-me-down clothing of former tenant Julio G's.  The sign has changed and that's about it.The Good:To my surprise though, decent food at very good prices (had the beef burrito w/cheese.. take out).Drink prices are affordable considering it's Old town Scottsdale.. be advised you'll need to drink a lot to endure the atmosphere so it's probably a wash.Bathroom was clean so points for that, BUT... out of paper towels.The Bad:Slow service with a bartender that has no interest in the business, bored and inattentive wait staff.  No propane for outside patio heaters.  The Ugly:Something fresh is needed for decor.  Bad mojo leftover from amateur that last decorated the place. Cheap black and white tiles at a Mexican restaurant? Looks more like 50's style diner. Recommendations: Hire new staff or try to train existing on good service procedures.Perform a total remodel or tear-down/re-build.  If the owner is a cheapo tightwad type, at the very least, tear down all the wall tiles and throw up some drywall (yes, paint it also).  Paint the outside also and remove all traces of the Julio G's failure.For locals, suggest take out for now...  well, if you can find someone willing to serve you. For tourists, run away as fast as you can.. there are dozens of better choices in the immediate area.Wrap up:Great potential for a profitable restaurant. Missing fundamentals though.It really takes some juevos to run a place like this. This is not typical of Old town Scottsdale restaurants."
