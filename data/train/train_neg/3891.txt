b'I hate to give 2 stars, specially when the food was good and the ambiance was great. But the service... Even though we had reservations for 20h15, we had to wait until 20h45 to get a table. It took +20 min to get the menus. My friends ordered ceviche and aztec soups and got their food in 10min. Another friend and I ordered mole and tacos and they didn\'t bring them with the rest because they were "main dishes" (???) even though we ordered only one dish... My friends had finished eating when I got my plate. It was 22h10 when I started eating! Being very familiar with how a restaurant should work, this is ridiculous.'
