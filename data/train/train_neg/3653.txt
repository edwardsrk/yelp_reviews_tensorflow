b"Chicken Satay was good. Enjoyed what sushi we tried. My Pad Thai came with red onions, which is not displayed on the menu description of the dish.  Given that I am allergic this was a problem. The service was atrocious. There were four young people standing around in whatever they had fallen out of bed in, playing on their phones ignoring customers. Not that the head waitress wasn't trying; she was great and made an honest effort to pick up the slack. The air conditioning was off. Given that it was a 90 degree day outside you could understand the discomfort. I would try eating there again, I just wouldn't expect much of the service."
