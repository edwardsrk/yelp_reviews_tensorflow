b'So we have been trying this place after my one star review... And nothing has changed, maybe worse. We ordered a shish kebab salad with no feta and scallions. Guess what? It came with both and we sent it back. What did they do? Remove the fata and scallions and bring it back. Now, all the meat is sort of cover with feta (white spots)... Terrible treatment. They have been going down hill for a very long time. They might charge more if it os going to get the quality a little back to normal. I do see us giving this place any more chance. Sorry :((('
