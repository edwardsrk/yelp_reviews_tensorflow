b'All I wanted was a haircut and style my hair for my b-day. My hairstylist was not happy she had to take me instead of her friend. Then the whole time they were chatting while cutting my hair right next to me. The hairstylist was in a rush to get me out, did a poor job in styling my hair. No hairspray or anything extra, only blowed dried. I could of done a better job myself.'
