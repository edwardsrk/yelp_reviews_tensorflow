b'Alright, we are not hard to please. The service was way below average. Little things like forgetting water a couple of times, unfriendly interactions, etc. Had a hair in my tomato and burrata salad. Not a big deal just figured they would give me a new, hairless one... Nope the guy pondered at the table for a couple seconds debating if the hair was there or not. After deciding he took the salad back to the kitchen and came back with... An apology? Not a new one?? He asked if I wanted a different salad but if not a complementary dessert would be provided. Nice gesture.... Yeah except I already asked for dessert for my boyfriends birthday with a candle and writing on the plate when I made the reservation...that was forgotten too... The two stars are for the bone-in ribeye and the onion soup. Really bummed we spent a pretty penny and it left more to be desired. Took a doggy bag home for the ribeye and the only thing left in the box was the bone? Not coming back.'
