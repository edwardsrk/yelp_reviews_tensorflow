b'My guess is I would have had a better experience if I had eaten in the bar as the other reviewer did.  The overcooked steaks I saw served to others in our party would have been acceptable if on a bun.  The stuffed pork tenderloin I ordered seemingly spent a couple hours on a steam table and the "fresh" cranberry applesauce seemed to have lived the same fate.While our waitress was gracious and accommodating, the rest of the staff was awful.  I painfully watched the bus staff running through the restaurant like bulls with their only priority being their tasks and no awareness of customers.  Pepper for one of our parties entr\xc3\xa9e, and bolting when they noticed a table needing bussed.  Same went for service on getting water or the hostess moving through the restaurant.  Oh, and then the topper, a bussed plate from another table ends up in my lap.  I get a quick "Sorry" but no offer of assistance to deal with my now gravy stained shirt as they bolt off to the kitchen.  While I was tempted to give the restaurant a single star review, there is really all the ingredients to make it a great dining experience with better customer focus.  Considerable effort needs to be made in the kitchen on providing entrees that are truly fresh and made to order.  The non-wait staff needs to realize that they are an integral part of the customer experience not just the schleppers of dirty dishes.  The warm and inviting tones of the dark woods and fireplaces certainly could lend to this being a great venue, just need to get over the other hurdles to get things on track.'
