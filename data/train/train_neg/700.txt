b'BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! I CAME HOME CRYING!  I HAD TO GIVE A STAR TO POST THIS REVIEW. THEY REALLY GOT NO STARS!!!!! I am giving this company a bad review due to the way they made me feel as a customer. I came in with my Mom and Sister for a little girls time to get a pedicure and our toenails painted. But due to my medical condition I opted out of getting the pedicure. Lin the manager told me to get out of the pedicure chair and that could no longer sit next to my family because I only got my toenails done even though there were no other customers and a bunch of empty chair. Then another worker tried to grabbing my stuff to get me to move. After that they told me to stand outside to have the sun dry my toenails even though it is a cloudy day with no sun. This company does not realize how you should treat a customer to get returning business. DO NOT GO TO THIS Margarita Nails & Spa unless you like to being treated like a piece of crap!'
