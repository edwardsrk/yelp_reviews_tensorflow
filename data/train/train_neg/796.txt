b"Horrible food! My boyfriend and I ordered out from here and got terrible food. The sandwich I got was so overly salty and the beer cheese on it didn't taste like cheese whatsoever. The wings were the worst wings I've ever had! They were so hard only little pieces of it were edible. All the food sounded so good but I was very disappointed with the prices and the low quality of the food. Safe to say I won't order from here again.."
