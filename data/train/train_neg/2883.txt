b"Natalie the owner is very nice and sweet but giving this place 2 stars not because of her work but I just didn't appreciate that when we got there for our appointment she tried telling me she had to shave down my Maltipoo close to chihuahua fur, I understand my dog was matted it's been 3 months since he was last groomed but she insisted that's the only way even when I told her I don't agree to it so we actually didn't follow through with the appointment. I feel like the price is cheaper than others but that's maybe because she just shaves down the dogs instead of giving them the look that someone is asking for. We just went back to our regular groomers which is at Las Vegas spaw :)"
