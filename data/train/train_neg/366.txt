b'Depending on who is working that day, you can wait anywhere between 5-10 minutes to go through the Drive-Thru! The manager always looks like he is lost. The positive: The manager apologizes at the window. Last excuse I was given was "I have a lot of new employees this week." Ok- but every time I came through for the last 9 months? Something isn\'t right...Oh- a panhandler selling subscriptions to some news publication often frequents the drive-thru.Update- STILL the slowest DD Drive-Thru is America.'
