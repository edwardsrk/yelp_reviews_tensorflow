b"I have been to this restaurant at least once every time I visited Montreal in the last five years. But I have never been impressed by the service here. The food is average at best given the price. The only reason tourists like me would still go there is because its location. It's close to my hotel. But if I ventured a bit east to the plateau,  I would have had a much better experience, whether or not the waiter/waitress spoke fluent English. Montreal is full of culinary adventures, W&G really needs to step up quite a bit to make it."
