b'My boyfriend and I are locals and made plans last minute to do a staycation for the weekend. We called the Wynn and was told that Jardin was the place that could accommodate our reservation time. The waiter was polite and efficient. Everything we ordered came out fast (almost too fast). The food was average at best. I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend'
