b"So my wife loves Swiss Chalet's rotisserie chicken and overall this restaurant has done that fairly well. The fries are often cold and dry but we order delivery through the app so that is almost understandable. Where my understanding stops however is right there. I'm a hot chicken kinda guy and almost every time they screw something up. I've had dark meat when I paid for white, I've had bread that was so hard and stale it felt like I came out of a toaster, I've had a bones in the chicken sandwich, I've gotten my order without gravy and a few other significant screw ups on a simple order. I have complained to corporate and they always refer it to the store where I get the usual apology and we'll offer you a complimentary meal next time you come in. Which we never have or intend to. Today though I thought I outsmarted them. I ordered a chicken pot pie. I know this shit is pre-cooked and frozen so they can't screw it up right? WRONG.This was delivered just like this photo shows and it smells like vomit. It must have soured or something because I couldn't stand the smell much longer than it took to take the picture. There's another Swiss Chalet closer to my house that is serviced by UberEats and I may give them a chance but I'm officially done with this one. If I could give zero stars I would."
