b"So if my experience wasn't bad before I went back with my receipt and the lady that helped us out at the fine jewelry was very nice, but when the manager came out she was the biggest bitch. She didn't show any concern for my horrible experience or the time wasted. Just said its policy shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Didn't say have a nice day or asked if there was anything else she could be assistance of. This managers name is Lynn. The gm of this location whose name is Chris will be getting a call as well. She needs to be aware of the poor customer service her employees are giving. Almost like I'm wasting their time after I have spent nearly 500$ there. I returned everything and went to Dillard's to buy the same exact items for the same price."
