b"We got a newly renovated room, I mean broom closet. There was seriously a foot around the bed to walk. That's it. In the bathroom, the dust hanging off the vent looked like a scary horror movie. In the 18 hours we spent at the Flamingo, a neighboring room's room service tray of used dishes never moved or was picked up. Gross. I've stayed at the Flamingo quite a few times and this last visit makes me never want to return."
