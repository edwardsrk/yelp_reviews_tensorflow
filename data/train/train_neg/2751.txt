b"I had a 1/2 chicken dinner with fries and BBQ sauce. $14 + tax.The seasoning on the chicken skin was delicious, but my chicken was noticeably dry and chewy. I imagine it had been sitting there for a while.The BBQ sauce was good; the fries were mediocre. The service wasn't exactly rude, but definitely not friendly.I know they make a big deal about their food quality, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I probably won't go back."
