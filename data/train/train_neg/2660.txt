b"Second time here... Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City. We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti & meatballs and a small cheese pizza. The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plasticThe spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more.. The sauce was also very flavorful and thick.The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor.. If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good & chewy. Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning. ."
