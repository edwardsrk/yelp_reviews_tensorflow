b'I work in a body shop and this was the first time I had ever used them , simply because a client had her car towed in here and wanted to get it out. I really wish I could give them zero stars. Girls in the front desk were extremely rude. Also went ahead and spoke with them through the phone and they did not want to explain anything I asked. Very unprofessional and seems like they never went to school. Also no customer service skills. Not helpful and when I went over I asked what a tow order was because no other tow company had ever asked for one, and all they said was " You should know what it is". I am obviously asking because I don\'t know! While I was there the lady in front with the most disgusting attitude said " Is that all you need? You only have 5 min to be in here." WHAT? Wish they would be more helpful and had better manners. If you have no manners or aren\'t friendly at all then go work in the middle of no where, were you don\'t have to communicate with customers.'
