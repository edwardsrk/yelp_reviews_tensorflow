b"I'd give it zero if I could. Wait an hour to get a half assed Dr visit. They just pawn you off to quest diagnostics and don't take the time to get to know you or your ailments. The staff has overcharged payments, lost payments, charts and literally had me wait an hour bc they didn't know I was sitting in the waiting room!Not the type of place I would entrust my health and that of my family........."
