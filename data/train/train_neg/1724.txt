b'What ever happened to the customer is always right?I have several life-threatening allergies that make dining out a challenge at times.  I travel with a detailed (bilingual) card outlining all my allergies and always present it to the server before ordering my meal. More often than not, the server will check with the chef before I order and I am presented with options. 5 Saisons WAS one of my favourite local restaurants and I have eaten there many many times.  Up till now.  Last night, we ordered the same dishes we always do - and were shocked!My meal came visibly swimming in allergens.  Thankfully, I noticed and the plate was returned to the kitchen.  The next attempt was equally poisonous.  The waiter acted put out and aggravated and even asked if it was a bad allergy!  (We told him I stop breathing within minutes!)When we complained about the issue - one of food safety - it was very rudely pointed out to us that we got our food, so the problem was solved. I spoke to the manager who told me to do whatever I want.  So I am!Food allergies are serious.  THey are not food preferences.  Those of us who live with the risk of anaphylaxis understand it is a risk and inconvenient and make our choices carefully.  We inspect our food before ingesting.  We understand that mistakes happen.  But we should not be forced to accept rude, poor and dangerous service.I understand the restaurant business is difficult and that picky eaters are unpleasant to deal with but I still do remember a day when the customer was right.'
