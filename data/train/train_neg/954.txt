b"I'm writing this review to prevent others from wasting their money at this restaurant. I have been to Copper several times and finally accepted that the food is WAY overpriced and the service is horrible. I will not be returning. The only thing I like at Copper is the naan and with the outrageous entr\xc3\xa9e prices, being charged for a second basket of naan is tacky.Recently I went to Copper with friends for a celebratory dinner. We waited an hour for a table even though we had reservations and there were empty tables all around. We finally complained and were seated in the center of a crowded room in the back of the restaurant . My $15 vegetarian entr\xc3\xa9e consisted of a few pieces of broccoli and a thick cream sauce--this was not included in the menu description.  Our appetizers were comped only because we complained.I have never written a negative restaurant review before, but my recent experience was so disappointing and the manager didn't make much of an effort to rectify the situation. Apparently Copper doesn't value paying customers. I'm sure there are many other restaurants that will be happy to take my money."
