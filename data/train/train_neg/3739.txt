b"I came here for an early dinner by myself monday on a work trip.  I always find it telling when the hostess won't seat you at a table despite the place being empty.  I was fine sitting in the bar area but had to ask for a menu etc.  The service wasn't great and the food was average.  They do have really good complimentary bread that you have to request as it's never offered.  The Mac n cheese is a delicious side and the sirloin was pretty average.  The menu looks like there is a decent happy hour with some salivating apps listed at $9 vs the regular prices of 15-20.  I also thought it was strange that the waitress asked for my name and id, not the room number that I wanted to charge the meal to.  I felt uncomfortable with the service and hence 2 stars- 1 for service, 3.5 for food, and pretty average on overall feel and atmosphere for a nice steakhouse on the strip.  I'd recommended going elsewhere."
