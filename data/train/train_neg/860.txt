b'I have been a loyal customer of Power Toyota since I bought my Scion in 2009. However, after my last visit I will be sure not to return. I went in to purchase four new tires as a routine maintenance and left with my car in awful condition! First, the rep told me it would take 2 hours to complete and after the 3rd hour, I sill didn\'t have my car. I had to contact them to check in on my car as they were not courteous enough to contact me. After the third hour of waiting, I finally got some information regarding my car and I was informed my SUB ARM was bent. After Googling the issue, this usually happens after a car accident or running into a curb at high speed. OR a mechanic drops your car from the high-rise. How convenient. The dealer took no responsibility for the issue even though I have never been in an accident in my life. They "discounted" my service taking off the cost of the alignment (even though they didn\'t align my wheels) and said they\'d replace the SUB ARM for $500 additional dollars. I asked that they did not complete the service as I felt  they were being incredibly dishonest and they returned my car in worse condition. I will never be back; Power Toyota has lost a loyal customer.'
