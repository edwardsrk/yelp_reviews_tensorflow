b'So I returned. They fixed it for free which was kind. Not 2 days later they all started to peel again. This was a gel manicure which I was told would last 2 to 3 weeks. When I went back I politely asked if they could just remove it (I did not ask for any refund though I should have) and then they wanted to charge me to remove it!Inexperienced staff and overall overpriced for all services.Also, tiny for selection for charging 20 dollars extra. I chose the only neutral colour they had.'
