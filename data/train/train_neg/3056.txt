b"While visiting family in Brunswick I had an opportunity to try the local Chinese restaurant everyone raves over.  Well, its not all that. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and Hot & Sour soup. The chicken dish was okay. Could have used a little more heat. Portion was a bit smaller than I was used to but still adequate for a single dinner. The soup however was not even close to being palatable. No heat, No sour, wrong mushrooms used, no tree ear fungus, and what's with the corn and broccoli in it ? No lily buds either. Just plain wrong all the way around. Even PF Chang can do an acceptable H&S soup. Another in our group had the salmon sushi rolls. 4 of the 5 got thrown out. Not up to the usual standards. Won't be back."
