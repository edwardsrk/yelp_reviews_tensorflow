b'I was so excited to come in for dinner being that the last time i was in this location i had excellent service (it was also their first week open and a manager on every corner) well it was a 30 min wait which i dont mind. Im also in the restaurant business so i understand it gets busy it gets busy... I felt so disrespected when the hostess Aden called my child "THAT" she never apologize and she did it infront of other guests they all couldn\'t believe it.  Im writting this review hoping that management can enforce better customer service & so that the employess can have better choice of words.. Its not that hard. I will not be going back...Sincerly,A VERY dissapointed Applebees costumer.'
