b'We arrived about 1:30 for the Saturday lunch buffet.  We paid our $14.99 plus tax and expected to have a great "lunch" with lots of selection.  We had seen nothing advertising this as a "brunch" because had we realized it was more of a brunch than lunch, we would not have gone.  Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed to see have the lunch food really breakfast food.  There were very few vegetables offered.  What we did have was very good but return trips to the buffet were just repeats of what we had previously because of limited lunch choices.  There were just too many breakfast options for someone thinking they were there for lunch. There was a huge selection of desserts.  So, the pastry chef must have been at work.We didn\'t find the staff very friendly.  It started with the cashier who interrupted our conversation when we were paying to address another individual.  We thought we were polite with meat carver with our "thank yous\' but never once did he acknowledge or return a comment.  We thought him rude.  Sever became friendly the closer it got to tip time. Pastry counter server was the friendliest.This was quite disappointing. We\'d recommend Golden Corral as a better lunch alternative.'
