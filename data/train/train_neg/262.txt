Seriously?They didn\'t even offer to pick us up. We were just expected to go to them after they messed up."I\'m on my way.  We\'ll do our best to get there at or just after 12:00"Didn\'t look like we were going to make it, so I called to beg them to wait for usNo answer.  Seriously!?So we just drove home.  Forget it.  We\'ll take our business elsewhere.Simple suggestions to avoid this in the future:  GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT LOCATION AND PHONE NUMBER TO START WITHhow hard is that?'
