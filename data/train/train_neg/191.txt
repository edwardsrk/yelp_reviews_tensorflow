b'They treat patients like an ATM. I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn\'t get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren\'t sure they could even help m today as Phan\'s schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don\'t do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn\'t want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn\'t want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn\'t enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn\'t even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don\'t care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It\'s just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was "pay up or get out" - the officer manager specifically said "we do not do payment plans". They wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain ===== Addendum 7/1/16 Yep ... These lying SOB\'s billed my insurance Lying , cheating dishonest !!!!'
