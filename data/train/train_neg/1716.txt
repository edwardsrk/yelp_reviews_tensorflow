b'Lunch review. Will not be coming back for lunch. Calamari salad was good but needed xtra avacodo. Shrimp and Grits was bad. They used small and ugly shrimp and the sausage suck. Chicken sandwich was dry. Tuna gyro was over cooked with no taste and thier crab and pasta salad tasted like garbage. The service was awesome.'
