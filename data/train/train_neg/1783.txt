b'Absolutely awful. Do not under any circumstances ride this shuttle. There are many more options in the airport that I would recommend and are 100 times better. The ladies who sold us the tickets were extremely rude, cold and unhelpful. And then after we bought the ticket it took OVER AN HOUR for our shuttle to arrive. This is after the driver of the previous shuttle we were supposed to get on told me that she had "too many stops" to take us. She had plenty of seats open on the shuttle and could have accommodated my family and I easily. Then when we started to follow up to see how long the next shuttle would take, the ladies were even MORE rude at the stand. In a city where tourism is crucial to the survival of the local economy, you would think Showtime Tours would have at least decent customer service. Take a taxi instead, it will save you a lot of stress and aggravation.'
