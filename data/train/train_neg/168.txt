b'I gave this place 2 chances. i love japanese food and really wanted to love this place because it is close to home. I was underwhelmed the first time and disgusted the second time. the food was tasteless and not what the menu stated. Soba noodles are not white, they are buckwheat and are beige at the lightest and brown at the darkest. When I called (i had delivery) to tell them that I did not get what I ordered, I was told that it was correct and I was wrong. Food was tasteless and service was Awful. Do not waste your money or your time.'
