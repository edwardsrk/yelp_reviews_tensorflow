b'Pitiful...please see my photo of my bruschetta. The picture doesnt really show the end pieces, well imagine just bread and no topping on the rest of piece. Quality definitely has gone down hill since RA purchased Sauce. I use to use Sauce for catering all the time, I will not use them now because they are skimping on portions.'
