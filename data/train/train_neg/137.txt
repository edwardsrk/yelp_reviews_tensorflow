b'Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I "Yelped" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner\'s incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don\'t care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  Sincerely,A very disappointed EX-patron'
