b"While I can say only excellent things about Yellowtail, a fantastic restaurant also located in the Bellagio, I can't unfortunately say the same for Prime, this time around.I've had excellent experiences at Prime before so I expected nothing different, however this time, this past Wednesday, I couldn't decide what was worse, the service or the food.  Maybe they were both equally bad.  My drink wasn't filled for almost 20 minutes, and I had to ask and then it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive, then I ordered another, and same story...no one asked us how our food was, the waiter was busy doing something else unfortunately and the people at the table next to us was also waiting and waiting.The NY Strip w/Soy looked great, but I actually had to change knives from the first steak knife they gave me, to a different stronger one because the meat was so poorly preapred, it was tough and I barely ate 1/2 of it and then gave up.The sea bass my buddy ordered was also over powered by the sauce it came with, another less than appetizing meal.  On a positive note, Yellowtail, I would highly recommend...ate there twice this trip and both times the service and food, as usual, was flawless.I hope Bellagio fixes these types of issues at Prime, I have had good experiences there in the past, but I don't know if I'll visit it on my next trip."
