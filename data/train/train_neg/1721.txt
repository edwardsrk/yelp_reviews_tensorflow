b"My Camaro ss was involved in a collision due to a vehicle running a red light and hitting me in the passengers side rear quarter. Gieco and brighton collision center were both beyond helpful and did great work on my car (had to return a second time for some minor tweaks to get it to my liking but they handled it for me without question) so why the one star overall you ask.. I had a very expensive gopro camera stolen from my vehicle while it was being fixed! Maybe it was their tow truck driver, maybe it was one of their shops employees.. I don't know. But what I do know is it happened in the time it was taken from me and I got it back from brighton. No solution was attempted to resolve this other than gieco telling me to file a second claim and pay a second deductible to be compensated for my camera.. I'll just buy a new gopro to save myself the hassle, just very dissatisfied with the theft. Hope this saves someone from loss of personal property!"
