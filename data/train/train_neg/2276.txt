b"I ordered a Hainanese Chicken Soup Rice Noodle.  Why was the Hainanese chicken slightly orange in color?  The green onion sauce that came with it tasted bland.  The rice noodle in soup was okay.  My BF ordered a 3-meat Dry Vermicelli.  The meat looked a little charred/burnt, but he said it tasted okay.  They forgot my Durian drink order; I had to remind them.  It tasted refreshing, rich and tasty.The service level was subpar.  The waitress left us alone with the menu for so long that we thought we would walk out of the door, and she would not notice.  She never had a smile throughout our stay .. to anyone.  It was as if she was having a bad day or didn't want to be there."
