b'I tried with these guys.  I tried.  I was extremely patient and extremely nice and easy going.  They came and repaired one of our AC units which needed a new compressor motor through our home warranty.  Although they did not show up on time, and did not show up to several recall appointments, they did initially schedule to come out quickly, within 24 hours and did the initial repair then, so luckily we were only without AC for 1 day. However the tech did a lazy job and left all our wires exposed to weather and moisture.  After contacting the company, they scheduled a different tech to come and correct the problem. It took me several messages and two weeks later to finally get this tech to come and "fix" the problem, only to find when I returned that he left the ground wire still out and exposed to weather and moisture.  I contacted the company right after that, which is now a month ago, and am still waiting for them to respond and fix this problem.  I have two air conditioning units, and the unit not touched by Air Pro has absolutely no exposed wires.  Ground wires and any electrical wires should not be exposed to weather and moisture outside of any protective casing. This is lazy and sloppy work.  I have attached three pictures.  The first pic is of the first terrible job, the second pic is of the second horrible job, and the third pic is of my other air conditioning unit and how it is suppose to look.  I hope that I can update and let you all know that Air Pro did the right thing and fixed this problem, but considering they\'ve yet to get back to me, we\'ll just have to see.'
