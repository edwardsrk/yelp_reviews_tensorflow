b"Do yourself a favor: Order Carry Out, not delivery. I order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time I order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. Not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into Google Maps and figure out where I am. The staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and I am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances."
