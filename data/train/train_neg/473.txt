b"We arrived for a couple of drinks after having dinner nearby.. Took more than 10 min to get waited on..had to flag a server.. Placed our two drink order right away.. 15 min later...NO drinks. At 20 min server hurried by to apologize and stated her bartender was so.... Busy..  After another 15 minutes we left.... No one stopped us.. No one cared.... Won't go back...what a waste of 30 minutes of my time."
