b"Waited 45 minutes on a Monday night for a table on the patio for 7 people. I can't imagine what the wait is on a weekend night. We were able to get some drinks and sit at the bar while we waited for our table, but it still took foreeeverrrr. The frozen margarita I got was a little too sweet and gave me a headache so I barely drank half of it :( As for food, I got the carne asada tacos which comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans. The carne asada was sooooo salty and the beans were not good. Definitely not worth the ~$15 cost. I would rather have Del Taco!"
