b'j.s.everyone that has complained is telling the truth.  the people that work for the arizona republic are liars.  i took out the newspaper on the wednesday, saturday, and sunday.  i was lied to by the representaive that i would only pay $29.99 like they had advised on the internet, but now they are adding up my bill.  it does not matter who you talk to down at the paper.  they all lie that they will take care of things.  i told them to cancel the paper for good.  this is sad that they are the only big newspaper in arizona.  they need another paper to take care of them.  thank god we have some local newspaper that print the truth.'
