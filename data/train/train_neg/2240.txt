b'Rocky River location. Out of four different entrees ordered at our table only 1 grilled salmon was ok. A prime rib, filet and the beef tips were poor, margarine not butter.  Dressing tasted bottled. For the price I expected a better dinner.  Longhorn or Outback, blow this place away at a cheaper price.  For the same money you can go to Chez Francois in Vermilion and actually get what you are paying for.  Will not be back.'
