b"First time at this venue. When I walked in I was pretty impressed! It looks great! Then we get to the vending. $15 for a beer and $20 for a cocktail is pretty ridiculous. Then we get to the concert. The band was amazing but the acoustics were awful. I understand that lawn tickets are cheaper because you're not going to get as good of an experience, but when I can hear everyone around me talking while the band is playing, the music isn't loud enough!!! There were speakers in the lawn area that didn't even sound like they were turned on. I was super stoked for the concert but left kinda disappointed because of the venue. I could've even overlooked the overpriced drinks if the sound was better."
