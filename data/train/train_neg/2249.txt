b'We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.'
