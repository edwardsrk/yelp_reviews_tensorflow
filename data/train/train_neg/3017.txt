b"Star deductions:1. No wifi!!! Come on venezia @ the Venetian. Join the 21st century for goodness sakes. Make sure when if you book here to stay at the palazzo instead. Who even carries Ethernet cables anymore?2. T.V.s don't work. Yes t.v.s plural. There's two of them and none of them work. It's been 1 1/2 hrs since I have complained and no ones come yet 3. The maze to get to the elevators. The two stars go to the valet, the bell hop and the concierge. Joe the bell hop awesome dude, Sean the valet who parked and re parked my car after I realized I left my phone in the car and Jaquelyn the concierge who did not hesitate to move us to the remodeled Venetian tower after I complained about the lack of wi fi and non operational flat screens."
