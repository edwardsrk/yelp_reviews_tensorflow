b'After writing my previous review, I was contacted by a Midas rep who offered to submit my complaint to head office. I appreciated someone listening and trying to help, so I agreed. I later received a call from the manager at the Midas Ringwell location around June 6 or 7. He didn\'t know why he was calling and it seems that he was just told to call me without any details. I explained the situation, and he told me that parts rust and that\'s how cars work. I asked if it\'s normal for parts to rust and seize after 5 months of use, and he didn\'t have anything to say. He then said that I could have brought the car back to them so they could "fix" it (actually do the work this time), but I told him the work had already been done by my regular mechanic. He said it was too bad, because they have no way to compensate me. I explained that this was fine and I\'ll just continue to tell everyone I meet what thieves they are. He offered to have the regional manager call me, but it would take a couple of days because they are busy. I said this was fine, but it\'s been a week and a half and I still haven\'t heard from them. It\'s interesting to note that he never denied anything I was complaining about.'
