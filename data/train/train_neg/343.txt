b'I had a bad dining experience here and will likely never go again.  Oddly enough, I went in the first place because of good reviews I read here on Yelp.  Needless to say I was suprised with bad service, and burned food that was tasteless!  I had a grilled pimento and cheese sandwich with fries.  I know that the couple sitting next to me and my wife were not happy either.'
