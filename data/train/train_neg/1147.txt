b"I see another person on here had the same experience as me.....the wrong coffee in the wrong pot...lol...that cracks me up.....how hard can it be to put the coffee in the right pot....today I'm sitting here waiting to get my order...we will see if they get it right....well we got our food and of course they got it wrong again...lol...this place is something else I've never seen a resturant with a track record like this....I asked to see a manager and there isn't even one here. .lol...What a waste.."
