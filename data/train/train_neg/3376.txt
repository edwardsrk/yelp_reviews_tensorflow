b"In August, a group of 4 bridesmaids, bride, and mother of the bride all went in to get their hair done for the big day! Appointments were made months in advance, and the bride had already done her test appointment. About 2-3 days before the wedding, they called the bride and said they had some scheduling changes, so one of the bridesmaids had to move 45 minutes earlier, okay, no problem. We all went down together for the appointment. I had a good idea of what I wanted so I went first, and I really liked my stylist. At 8:30 am the brides hair was supposed to begin, unfortunately, her stylist was not at work yet.... 8:45, 8:55, 9:05... somewhere between 9:10-9:20 the stylist walks in (after a few phone calls from another stylist at the shop), can you imagine, your wedding day hair and the stylist shows up to work 45 minutes late??? Luckily the appointment went faster than expected, but still finished late. The brides hair was fantastic, I liked my hair, and the other girls were happy/slightly disappointed. They had to touch up their own hair 2 hours later before we headed to the ceremony. There was no offerings for the late show on their part. I think offering one bridesmaid free would have been nice since it was all the bride's treat, however they didn't attempt to do anything of the sort..."
