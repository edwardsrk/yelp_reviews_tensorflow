b"The wait at this Location is ridiculous.  I came in and waited 30 minutes in the first waiting room.  I was taken back by a medical assistant to another waiting room to wait for an hour and a half.  She then came to take me to a room and told me there were still 2 more patients ahead of me.  I waited another 30 minutes.  They staff 1 dr which resulted in 2 1/2 hours of waiting.  I don't consider waiting 150 minutes as receiving Urgent care."
