b"Attended a class, originally paid the fee to attend. I was told at the time, if you cancel within 5 days we'll refund. I called the instructor who advised he was in transit to California and would get that refunded for me. I travel a lot so i understand it's tough to keep up, so i sent an e-mail to the team listed on the website regarding my intent to cancel. It's been a month, i have not received my refund and have not received any communication."
