b"I have always came here (2years) and received the worst customer service but sometimes I have to come in here due to my packages ending up here. Recently I came in and I don't know if Nicholas just got hired or hes been there but he has given me the best customer service I have ever received there. I am giving it 2 stars just because the other female employee is horrible. I seriously always pray I don't have to deal with her. They should have Nicholas train the others on how to customer service."
