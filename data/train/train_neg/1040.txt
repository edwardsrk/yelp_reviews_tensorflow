b'I was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. It was aweful!! The host was everything but a host. A guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. My party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. She was wearing a lower cut dress and I now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. When I booked the party I was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. I had 15 children and 2 babies, I was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. She wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention I was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. She started a "soda tab" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. At the end of the party I had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. A $45 tip was not what I had in mind for her. When calling the owner to discuss my issue she did NOTHING to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. I will not recommend TOY TOWN to anyone!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!'
