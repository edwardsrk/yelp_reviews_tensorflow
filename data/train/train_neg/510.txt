b"NOT SO HAPPY HOUR. My party of 3 arrived around 6:45 last night and were seated around 10 minutes later. Our waiter came by a few minutes after 7 and informed us that we couldn't order from the Happy Hour menu. A few bucks is not going to change my lifestyle but I resent being penalized because a waiter couldn't get to our table. If we were seated during Happy Hour we should have been allowed to take advantage of it."
