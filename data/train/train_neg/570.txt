b"I am accustomed to much better.In town for the weekend, I couldn't believe how much cheaper this hotel was when I booked it. Then I arrived, and it all made sense.From the carpet scarred from trying to get out one two many stains, to the paper-thin towels, to the free wi-fi I couldn't access, to the overall grimy feeling of the furniture, I got what I paid for.I checked out the next day and stayed somewhere else."
