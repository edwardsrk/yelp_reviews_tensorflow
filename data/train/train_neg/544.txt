b"If you are a CPR/First Aid instructor, I DO NOT recommend renting CPR mannequins from these guys.  I rented mannequins from them for a large class and when I opened the bag, literally pieces of the mannequins fell out.  Only 2 out of 5 were even usable.  They were completely filthy and they were falling apart.  When I brought them back they said that I had done the damage because I didn't know how to use them.  What an insult.  I've been using these style mannequins for many years.  I highly recommend spending your money somewhere else if you expect good customer service, honesty, and integrity."
