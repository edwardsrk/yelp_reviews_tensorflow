b"Dinner for three started out great.  A wonderful venue, open kitchen, quickly seated, and the food sounded good, but their timing was off, not once, but throughout the meal.  First, the wine was delayed.  Second, as we were enjoying our appetizers (not  1/2 done) of a wonderful meatball, naked mozzarella, and delicious bread along come the entrees.  I sent them back - there was no room for them on the table and secondly we were not going to rush. Then when ready, they came out again and clearly not the same items, but freshly prepared pastas Arrabiata, Bolognese and a Capri Salad - all delicious.  Next we order dessert, and wait, and wait, and wait.  Finally, I say forget it, just the bill.  Well, I am told we are just plating them.  I explain we've finished our coffee and need to move on.  At which point the manager arrives and offers us the desserts for free.  I decline because at that point we do not want them.  She was very gracious and offered to make it up to us.  The food was quite good.  The atmo was nice - although initially a bit loud with a raucous party nearby, but after they left, much better on that front. But, I cannot ignore the whole event and just speak to the food when rating them.  They need to work on their timing.  The practice of having multiple players look after you, may be efficient (wait staff, runners, etc.), but it really didn't work this time."
