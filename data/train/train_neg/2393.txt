b'Well all i can say is their Gyros are sub par and their rice pilaf is bland and bleh.  The gyro is Kronos brand, didnt mean anything to me until today, but future places i will ask.  The meat did not look fresh cut... rounded edges.  I dont see what people like about this place.  Have they never left town and visited a good greek place?  Find another is my advice.  Granted all i tried was the gyro but it was bad enough to not return.  My wife said the tziki sauce was also deploreable.  Advice... go elsewhere.'
