b"Every so often, I have a conference that is hosted at the Las Vegas Hotel (formally the Las Vegas Hilton).  It's way down at the end of the Strip, which makes the location terrible.  It's probably one of the hotels that are in most need of a face lift.You know that feeling you get when you walk into a Pizza Hut? That heavy, dense greasy smell that punches you in the face?  That's what it's like walking into this hotel.  Mostly because there's a Pizza Hut RIGHT at the entrance.  There's also a fitness center that is strangely located towards the entrance, but no enclosed in an actual room.  You can walk right by someone who is on a stationary bike, and I guess that's totally normal there.I've never stayed here, but one of the absolute biggest annoyances of mine with this place is how low the ceilings in the casino are.  The lower the ceiling, the lower the smoke is trapped.  I'm not a fan of that burning sensation in my eyes and throat from cigarette smoke, and it is painfully abundant here.  Bleh."
