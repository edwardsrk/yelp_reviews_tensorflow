b"I'm over 30 years old and I'm a big girl. You can just imagine how many buffets I have eaten at. I have NEVER been charged for not finishing our food. I can understand if it was a whole roll of sushi, or if it was self served. Nope. The food was served to us, not knowing the size of the portions. We couldn't finish the plain noodles (no meat, no veggies) and fried rice that we ordered because we thought, being carbs, it would be smaller portions. Nope again! Then BAM! They charged us for NOT FINISHING our noodles and rice. Wow. Not coming back here. I'd rather go and drive an extra 10 mins to Oyshi or Goyemon after this!!"
