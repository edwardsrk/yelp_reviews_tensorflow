b'Went to the Southeast Crab Feast setup at the Raleigh Seafood Festival this past weekend.  They advertise "All you can eat blue crab sessions" at 2 hours each.  My son and My wife decided they wanted to indulge.  After paying the 33 dollars each for a 2 hour "All you can eat" session, they were extremely excited.  After you pay for the session, you get a plate with 3 crabs on it.  Once you have completed those 3 crabs, you can get in line for another plate of 3 crabs when it is available (cooked crabs were not plentiful) and the average wait time in line was 20 minutes.  After 1 hour of this, they left extremely disappointed and only finished 9 crabs each for their 66 dollars.  What a rip off this is, the "all you can eat" is determined by how many servings they can provide and the time frame between each serving.  I would have rather paid 100 dollars and just steamed my own.Needless to say, We will not be attending any event where Southeast Crab Feast is serving, nor will we ever attend the Raleigh Seafood Festival again for promoting this SHAM.'
