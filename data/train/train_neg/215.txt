b'Montreal, what did you do in a previous life to be punished with such crummy bagels? Seriously, eating these bagels made me want to start a public service campaign called "It Gets Better" and I\'ll recruit people in other cities to show you how good bagels can be. This bagel shop must be build on an ancient Iroquois burial ground.  Seriously, on a weekend trip to Montreal, I had a goal to try these legendary bagels. These things are shriveled up, flat and taste like someone left out the salt. Matzoh Bagels. Blech. 4 hours later, they were inedible.  I love bagels. I\'ve had bagels in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and I\'ve even taught myself to make really good bagels at home (Google "Peter Reinhart Bagel recipe"). These Fairmount bagels were a huge disappointment. If I made a batch of bagels that came out like this, I\'d toss them out and try again. Hope I save some other bagel loving visitor from shlepping up to this shop.'
