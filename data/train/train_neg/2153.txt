b'I was excited about this place. It has so much potential but like a lot of places in downtown Cleveland, the administration ruins everything. Sunday wad their first Sunday Funday... there was nobody there and they had nothing from the menu...like they didn\'t prepare for it at all.Lastly, besides not having anything available to eat and not sure if they had enough ingredients for their drinks during their first Sunday "party"... they published the event as "beach casual look". However, the hosts were all wearing Sathurday night club type dresses (early afternoon on Sunday!!) which was totally ridiculous. They also looked at us weird because we were wearing shorts... eehh... beach casual? They totally failed on planing in so many different ways.If you want to stay upscale you may have to deliver on the simple things first. I hope they get better over time but I see this as another "Tomo Sushi" type situation. Great concept and poor execution.'
