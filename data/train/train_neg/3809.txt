b'If you\'re looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.  They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There\'s a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn\'t match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you\'d get from a grocery store (I didn\'t see them making it, but I wouldn\'t doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.The place really isn\'t meant for "Pizza Snobs" to enjoy a quality pie.  It\'s meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it\'s marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, "Macaroni and Cheese Pizza" as one of the types).There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18.'
