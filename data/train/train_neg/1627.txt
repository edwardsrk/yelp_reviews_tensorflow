b'If it were possible to give less than one star, I would do so. RUN away from this hotel! They are undergoing renovations and begin jack hammering at 8 am well into the evening (past 6 pm - until April 2018). The hotel did not bother to disclose this fact when confirming reservations nor will they move us to another room away from the noise. I explained to the front desk that I had to come down in person because the noise was SO LOUD that I could not hear "Guest Services" over the phone. They refused to move us to another room nor give a considerable compensation. So BEWARE! They will trick you into staying at the Flamingo only to force you into leaving the hotel to go elsewhere. Why not just go to a hotel that is all about customer satisfaction?'
