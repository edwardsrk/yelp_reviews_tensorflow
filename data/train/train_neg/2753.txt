b"Waiter was nice, service sucks..really expensive. The only reason I ate here was cause I got to Vegas Late Thursday night and everything on the strip where I wanted to eat was closed by 11 or 12..so I didn't feel like walking all over to find something and I was just really hungry at the time. I wasn't really expecting this place toCharge $67 for two burgers and a drink each for me and my girlfriend, the food wasn't bad or anything, but definitely NOT worth $67..I assumed a 24 hour restaurant would've been an okay priced place for all the travelers and drunk people to grab a quick bite. Like I said earlier the waiter was cool and all but the service was bad and place is just way to over priced..if you're willing to spend that type of money for the same food you can get somewhere else for only 30/40 bucks then go for it!"
