b"What is it with the service and quality of food at the restaurants in this area? We again had another negative experience and this time it was at Heart and soul cafe. The food is OK we have eaten there a few times. The major issue I am having is the service the completely did not have there act together. It looked like a combination of issues landing between poor waitress/waiters and short staffing. As we sat for over 15 minutes waiting for someone to come and get our drink order we watched one table go to the bar to get a drink as no one came to there table and we watched another table tell the waitress they were leaving due to the lack of attention/service. when we showed our 5% off check in office to the waitress she did not apply it and we couldn't get her attention to fix it. The hostess was the one who supported most of the tables with there orders and seating costumers. The kitchen also had the food out promptly but it took over an hour merely waiting on the waitress."
