b'As a salesman, I buy a lot of donuts for my customers. I like to spread the business around, especially to local and small businesses but I really can\'t recommend this place for its donuts. I ordered three dozen donuts for early morning pickup and everyone complained they were stale! I will not jeopardize business relationships again with this "day old" donut place.'
