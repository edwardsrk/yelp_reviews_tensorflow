b'I have been coming the Horseshow since it open and I play a fair amount every week(700.00). I am seeing the casino getting progressively worst from odds, comps and lack of pit bosses entering you into the system . I played Texas Holden last week and had a terrible experience.  There were so many shuffle master red lights and dealer switches it was a total distuption in play. I had to worry I played long enough to park, or I would have to pay. I think I played for 5.5 hours and my comp was but 1 buffet and get 1 free.  I was there alone so bring a friend to eat late Friday night was not an option. I was a Platimun member under the old system and could valet park, but the new system has me as a A with no benefits.  I think the lost focus is that a casino is a service provider and I see very rude dealers, poor service of beverage servers and the wait to cash out at the tables.  Please wait and let me chip up, or we are waiting on a pit boss to verify a 220.00 buy in.  I eat in the buffet and it was terrible with what looked like old food with long wait times to get in. I really need to see better service to continue to come here.'
