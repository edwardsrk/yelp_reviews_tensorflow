b"Garbage! How do you mess up breakfast? Was on vacation in Vegas, tired from a full day of traveling, just wanted something quick. The eggs were mushy,Taste like instant eggs with powdered cheese. One slice of toast, burnt on one side and not even brown on the other side. And to top it off the potatoes were French fries. Please don't waste your time and money eating at this place."
