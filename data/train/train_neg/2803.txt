b'Stayed here during work meeting at Wynn for cheaper rate. Big mistake. Greasy, bland food. Bathroom with malfunctioning whirlpool. Location was fine for the Wynn but still a hike for everything else. Aside from the dysfunctional whirlpool bath, might as well have been staying at a Holiday Inn. If you feel like hoofing it through a shopping mall to get anywhere this place might be for you. If you want a more convenient, pleasant experience, stay somewhere else.'
