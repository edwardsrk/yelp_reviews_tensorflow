b"I absolutely hate coming to this CVS!!! So My husband will get a text saying that 5 medicines are ready and I go by to pick them up and guess what there is only 4 ready. It would be ok if this happened once or twice, but of course I am writing a review because this happens all the time! Every month in fact! Kenny here is a shout out to you, thank you for showing me how much you don't care about any customer service! No worries Kenny your not alone, all your coworkers are pretty much the same, can't remember their names. I don't know what the protocol is for your drive through customers but I am taken back by how many times I have had the same problem happen over and over again and no apology is ever given. I get it it's not your fault it's automated system but once I am there at your drive through window I expect just a bit more concern and help. Instead I was just dismissed with attitude because you didn't understand me? What is so hard to understand that I was supposed to pick up 5 medicines for my husband not 4 after he personally spoke to some one to make sure I would not have to deal with this.  So to sum it up the pharmacy department is so not organized friendly or professional!! I hate it because this is the closet pharmacy to me but I am now certain it's time to go somewhere else where I can really have a great evening like Mr. Kenny so sarcastically wished me."
