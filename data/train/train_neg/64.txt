b'This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil\'s a shot - trying to support local restaurants. It was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren\'t deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). We started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. Then, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. For entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. The 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you\'re wanting Mexican food, you\'d be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel\'s. And my rating is not because I\'m comparing this place to normal "Mexican food" places - I know this place is supposed to be "New Mexican." I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.'
