b'You can practically smell the Abercrombie and Fitch cologne and hear the sound of collars popping as you enter this place. Douche central.Food was decent, but it took 15 minutes for them to make 3 sliders to go. They advertise these fancy dipping sauces but they were out of everything except ketchup -- how exotic. Prices are also outrageous -- $14 for 3 tiny sliders and a small fry.I will definitely not go back.'
