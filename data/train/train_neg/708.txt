b'I work nearby this location and the food is amazing the only issues I have are, when I place a online order to be ready at a certain time it never is ready or they haven\'t even started it yet. I get "oops I just noticed it" a lot of the time. Anyone that knows this location knows that it\'s packed all the time and you have to wait in line 15 minutes or more. Another issue I have is that nobody greets you. I\'ll be standing there waiting to pay and I get employees looking at me but not saying anything for a few minutes, they don\'t even bother to tell the cashier that someone is ready to pay. Food is great but the service is horrible.'
