b'Went for the 1st.time to CPK on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.           Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  "They must think I\'m  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12". Translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that\'s not my fault. And it did!!!!          My wife and I split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  \'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that\'s about all we could find. Pizza was bland, \'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. If that\'s what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. If not  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
