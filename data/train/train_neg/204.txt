b"I took my car to Ganley Lincoln service department to try and find out why horrible gasoline/raw gas odor were entering the cabin of my car, likely coming in through the HVAC system.  I suspected a likely fuel leak somewhere near the firewall but could not locate one.   I took my car to Ganley  Lincoln Service Dept. and paid the $129 diagnostic fee (steep!).  Service advisor Beth P called to inform that I needed $1900 in repairs as the exhaust manifold gaskets were leaking and had a bad seal. Yikes!!   Keep in mind this is a 2007 Lincoln Town Town in meticulous condition, always garaged, and only 65,000 miles and has barely been driving in winter. I was quoted $500 a side for new exhaust manifolds and bolts at another service facility.  However,  the mechanic of 20 years said he has never seen a town car or crown vic needing new exhaust manifolds at 65,000 miles.   He did some further research and discovered the left rear cylinder spark plug was not seated properly and only needed to be rethreaded.  Total cost was $75 for retap and INCLUDED his diagnostic time as well.   Problem was fixed!!!I know enough about engines as well to realize that $1900 sounded sky high and didn't think the new manifolds solution sounded correct.  Good thing I went with my gut and got a second opinion.   I would have been out $2000 in repairs and the problem would not have been corrected!   Stay away from this service department.   Far far away... unless you don't mind paying $2000 for repairs you don't need!"
