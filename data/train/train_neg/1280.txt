b"They greet you when you enter the store but then they are done with you. We were looking for shoes for an adult woman, an adult man and an 8 year old girl so basically we were all over the store.  The entire time my granddaughter was trying on 8 different pairs of shoes two employees stood nearby having a conversation but never offering assistance. In fact a customer walked up to them and waited for them to stop talking and turn to him which they never did and he left in disgust.  I gave up looking for shoes for myself because I was too annoyed with the store  .  When I paid for my Granddaughters shoes the cashier asked if I wanted some kind of loyalty card and I said no I would not because I did not plan on ever returning and told him about the lack of assistance.  He didn't care.   They had shoes I was interested in but never found.  For the price of their shoes you would expect a little assistance."
