b'Not a typical Hilton Property. Let\'s start with checkin, went to the counter that had Hilton Honors sign and rug only to be ignored by Tia. Then she said rudely I\'m not even signed in but yet she proceeded to ignore us for 5 minutes. The proper thing to do would have been acknowledge us and say someone will be with you in a moment. The only clerk working proceeded to help someone who came in after us. Then the "managers reception" was poorly stocked and was crackers, fruit and popcorn. Very disappointed will be letting Hilton Honors know. As a Silver member this is not typical of their properties usually.'
