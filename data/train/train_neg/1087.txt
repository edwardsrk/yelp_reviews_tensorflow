b'Do not stay at this hotel. Management is stealing money. Mexican manager Juan inflates prices per week. The staff is incompetent. You can never get a straight answer regarding billing. I questioned why weekly payment did not go down once all "fees" and "deposits" were paid. Mexican manager Juan told me to pack my things and leave. I was fully prepared to pay fee that was quoted to me by staff member Brenda. Mexican manager Juan informed me she did not quote me the correct amount. He stated she failed to add in a pet fee and charge from previous week. When Mexican manager Juan gave me a total it was the total I paid the week before. When I pointed this out to him he became angry and enrage and yelled that he would not do business with me. They owe me a deposit. This company will say you will get a refund on your $100 deposit but you have to stay 30 days or more. I was due my refund this week. I tried to call corporate but only get a voicemail when I call the number. Person on message sounds just like Mexican manager Juan. I contacted the Better Business Bureau since I cannot get a return call from Siegal Suites Corporate office. I have kept all documents regarding my stay at this hell hole. Please beware of this facility. There are roaches, open drug trades, prostitution and children unattended running everywhere. Complained about the marijuana smells coming thru apartment and was laughed at by Brenda. I only gave this review a one star b/c you have to give a star in order to leave a review. This establishment needs to be shut down. All criminal activity needs to be investigated. This establishment preys on the desperate. Thank GOD I have other means.'
