b"I've dined here twice and both times the food was incredibly tasteless. The first time I dined at this establishment I had the whole squid. It was so tough and chewy, I had to send it back!The second time, I thought I'd give them another chance and  I ordered the spring rolls and whatever they've in it that's crunchy tasted old and spoiled , like it's been cooked for days, then I had the oxtail loco moco and too much onions in it.The basil that was brought out for the pho was dried and not fresh.I suggest you hire a new cook and come out with fresh ingredients.But on the positive note, I think the service was exceptional!"
