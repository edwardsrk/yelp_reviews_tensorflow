b'Food was not that great and service matched. Kids mac and cheese had funny taste... Not bad just different like a smoky sweet cheddar. Scrambled eggs were dry and had unappealing texture. Also the server forgot my soup even after a reminder. Salads were large and good though (grilled and buff chicken). Thats the main reason they get the 2nd star. Its pretty hard to mess up salad though. I ll be goin to eatn park from now on. Shoulda never changed it up today.'
