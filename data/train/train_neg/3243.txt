b"I give a 2 star for the food. For the location, I would give a 1.This is NOT a restaurant. DO NOT go here with family or think that you would get service and a table. This is in the food court of a small shopping center and it's like a hole in the wall. The food here is oily and ok but nothing special. Meh!"
