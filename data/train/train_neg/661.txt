b"I read the reviews for Agave and had high hopes. I first called on 10/28/14 to arrange for an estimate for yard cleanup at my house. Based on some of the other reviews, I knew it could take a while for a response. I waited 8 days without hearing anything so I called again on 11/5/14. Still no answer so I left a second voicemail. I did get a call  back from Geoff 10 minutes later where I was told to go to the website and to request a quote there since I would fill out a form with all of my information. I did that as soon as I got off the phone. I then received an email from him that night saying he needed my physical address. I had already put that in the form, but maybe there was an issue so I sent it to him via email an hour later. It is now 11/12/14 and I have heard absolutely nothing back AGAIN. I even checked my junk mail to make sure an email wasn't sent there by mistake, but of course, nothing.I contacted another landscaper on Friday 11/7, they came out and did the quote today and they will complete the work next Monday. 10 days total from when I first contacted to when the work will be complete. It has been 15 days since I first contacted Agave and no one has even come out to give me a quote. Agave may do good work, but I wouldn't know since I couldn't even get them out to my house."
