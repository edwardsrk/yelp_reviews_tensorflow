b"I live in the area so I've been to this bar a few times. I like the atmosphere, but the people who work there are a bit rude. The last time I went, they added tip to my single drink order and failed to mention that they had done so after I left them cash tip at the bar - same guy who ran my card/put in the order took the cash. I didn't feel the service  merited a $3 tip for a $7 drink. Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time I've had trouble with the service here."
