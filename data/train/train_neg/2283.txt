b'I am giving this 2 stars, because I have to give it something. I am updating my previous review regarding the horrid treatment I received from the clueless hostess when I attempted to have dinner there last weekend. I did receive an e-mail from the manager asking me to call. I called him and he apologized profusely and asked for a chance to make things right. I plan on taking him up on his offer, because I really want to try this place out.'
