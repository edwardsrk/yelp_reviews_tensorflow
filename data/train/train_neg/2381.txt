b"I just met the dentist for a few minutes, so honestly cannot review her.  I'm actually writing this review in regards to the X-Ray Tech. Going to the dentist is tough for me, because of the pain, but I should not of experienced pain for 2 days after the Tech, Dakota, (or close to that name) did the X-Ray,  At one time she jammed the plastic material down on the bone of the inner part of my mouth,  totally brought tears to my eyes. Could not believe how my mouth hurt for days after.  Have not returned.  To bad the dentist has to suffer because of her techs."
