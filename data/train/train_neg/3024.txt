b'The gym itself is good, but poor execution on some crucial aspects. The womens locker room is INSANELY cold. Air conditioned to the max. WHY? This is where people come out of the shower. You can catch a cold. My teeth literally chattered almost every time I was in there.Staff here - hit or miss. Some can be friendly, others look half asleep. I only got a membership for 1 month and only near the end of that month did I realize certain things I had access to, and no one bothered to tell me. For example, I had no idea I had access to a fitness evaluation until it was too late.The gym itself is a good size and I rarely had to wait for anything. Thats where the 2 stars comes from - and from the decent lighting - lots of natural light.Also 24/7 is false advertising, like other reviewers have previously mentioned.'
