b"We were greeted and seated immediately. The carne mechada dish was small but delicious. My husband was not impressed with his shrimp dish. Service was okay, but not great. We were disappointed with the overall lack of care. Glassware was all so spotty that it was gross. Cleanliness was way below anything I've ever seen before. Not impressed."
