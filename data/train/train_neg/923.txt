b"Ok 1st off I don't expect much late night since Ive been disappointed by most places in vegas but if you're a bar that can't even get wings or a burger right - then just pls DONT EVEN SERVE FOOD!!! Why bother?You get a 1 time customer that will NVR come back cuz it's 1 thing to get bad food but it's another to get OVERCHARGED FOR BAD FOOD!!! & FYI scream when you order because apparently the waitress is deaf! She said whatWhatWHAT? after every word ugh I asked for a burger med-rare but it was so well done, I took 2 bites -seriously gross. Also ordered wings & fries -extra crispy Well wouldn't ya know EVERYTHING WAS SOGGY!!! Terrible food experience= $55Thanx a bunch Jacksons! NVR AGAIN                      *******UPDATE*******both my fianc\xc3\xa9 & I are sick from the little bit we ate/ thank God we have 2 bathrooms"
