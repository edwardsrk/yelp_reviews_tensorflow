b'Check in took around an hour, then they decided to charge an extra fee of $100 on top of what I paid on Expedia. Cold showers all three days of our trip. The bathroom is missing tiles. Nothing like what was shown in the pictures online. The maid turned the heat down to 60, and we were left coming back to the room freezing with not even any blankets on the bed. And the room always seemed to have a smell of vomit.'
