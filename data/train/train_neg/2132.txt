b"I tried Pita Pit for the first time a couple years ago when I received a free gift card from work. I was flustered from beginning to end--- I handed the cashier my gift card as payment, and he just thought it was some sort of promo card. He then asked for my debit card, which I passed over. When I questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. Then, I ordered the Gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. Well, I was confused by the fact that I was asked what I wanted on my Gyro (um, the usual Gyro ingredients?!) and that Hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the Gyro).Maybe I've never gotten over this initial experience, but I have yet to truly enjoy Pita Pit. I think the Pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. Though initially tasty, I always feel very ill after eating here... I only plan on returning when I get dragged here yet again by a co-worker trying to avoid the other two chain options on this block of East Carson."
