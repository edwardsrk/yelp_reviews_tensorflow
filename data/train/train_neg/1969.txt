b"Worst customer service from the short old woman who claims she is a manager. Absolutely the rudest and most obscene experience I've ever had at a location. Always grouchy and treats every customer and employee horribly. Rest of the staff is absolutely phenomenal but that old woman is the worst experience I've ever had. Will not be coming back if she is still employed."
