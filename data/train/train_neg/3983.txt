b"It has been awhile since I was here last and the place has changed for the worse. The rolls are good but the rest was not good. I ordered chicken parmigiana. It was just fair. The risotto was inedible. The rice was so over cooked you couldn't tell there was rice in it. It was all mushy. My wife got a steak and it was so undercooked we had to send it back. The salad had sugared almonds that had way too much sugar on them. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out. I won't  be back."
