b"I wish I could say what the others say, but while Stacy is clearly good with straight hair (as the photos show, that's most of her work), she's not as good with curly hair.  She knows a lot about hair cutting but hair does not always follow the rules and hair on different parts of the same head may curly differently or not at all.  I went back to get my haircut adjusted and she did more cutting, but my hair still sticks out at the bottom and the slant in the back is much less than I asked for.  She seemed rushed and annoyed with my request to re-cut my hair and when I indicated how I would like it, she argued with me and did what she wanted to do.  If you have curly hair, you already know how hard it is to find a good hairdresser.  I'd hoped Stacy would be that person, but this did not work out."
