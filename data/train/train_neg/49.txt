b"I have been using Handy's service for three months now. I will admit that I had 2-3 really good professionals clean my place. However, the others were just OK...Several of them would leave after 1.5 hours even though I paid for 2.5 hours. I could understand if there were not anything else to do, but there was (for example: mopping the floor.)I have had a couple of professionals who were very rude. The last one was scared of dogs even though it states on my profile that I have a dog, and he will be with me at all times. BTW: I have a 10 pound Chihweenie who is very sweet and likes all people. The last person kept complaining that there is no free parking--well I live in downtown Toronto. What do you expect? She stated that she had tried to call me and text me. However, I showed her my cell phone, and there were no contact from her.I don't get the same pros each two weeks. I am allowing a complete stranger into my apartment each time. I have decided that I will cancel my service as of today. I am truly not satisfied with the unprofessionalism, pros coming late and leaving early, and jobs that were done half assed. I am not asking for much. I am asking to clean the counters and mop the floors. I don't think that this is too much to ask."
