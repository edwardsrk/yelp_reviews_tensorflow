b'I really like their food here, but their service is just not good. I stood in line and was ignored while others were greeted and then, when I finally got my order taken, I was told to find a seat and a server would be with me. There were no seats. I stood there for 5 minutes until a spot at a area opened up and waited another 10 minutes before I finally flagged down a "server" to actually get some help. As I write this. I\'m still waiting on my food. I get that it\'s a busy Sunday lunch, but this is just bad service. Maybe add a hostess at the door for crowd control on a busy Sunday. Still no food yet.'
