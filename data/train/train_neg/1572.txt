b'Overpriced, rude staff, dishonest on giving you a fair price for your items. Talk behind your back in Spanish. News flash, lots of people know Spanish. Overall bad experience. Selection of clothes not good and all the toys way overpriced. Yard sales have more to offer and nicer people to deal with. The owner complained about me having a cat and was an overall downer. Save yourself the hassle just donate to friends or Craigslist used baby items.'
