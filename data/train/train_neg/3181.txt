b"I was staying at the adjoining Holiday Inn and found out about the 20% discount coupon for the Hyde Park Grille so it seemed a no-brainer to go to this place, especially after seeing the favorable Yelp reviews.  Living in Chicago, I am pretty particular about steakhouses but I was cautiously optimistic.  The restaurant is very upscale and seems out of place next to the somewhat rundown Holiday Inn.My son and I were seated in the bar area.  We had a pleasant server and our service was generally good.  Even though this is a steakhouse, we both ordered seafood.  Maybe this was a mistake.  My son had the sauteed shrimp and scallops and the scallops were overcooked.  I had the Chilean sea bass.  It was also overcooked, and it didn't quite have the proper texture of this type of fish.  This I attributed to being well-done but when our bill arrived, the fish that was listed on the bill was halibut.  Hmmm.  In retrospect, the fish tasted somewhat halibut-like and when I questioned the waitress about this, she investigated and returned to tell me that the bill was a mistake, it really was sea bass.  I'm not so sure about that and my Yelp rating reflects that.Anyhow, the highlight of the meal was my glass of Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot #279 Cabernet Sauvignon.  Delicious.  I will have to find that bottle somewhere."
