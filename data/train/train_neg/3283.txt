b"Sushi was overpriced for what it was. There was four of us and we ordered a $200 platter and asked if it would be enough and they assured us it would be. We also ordered a seafood appetizer platter and told we would each get a piece yet it came with 3 pieces each and  ( 2 oysters) when we questioned why we were told they ran out of oysters but never bothered to let us know or even bothered to substituted so we all had to try and share. My cocktail was horrible it tasted like a margarita with olive oil. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because this place is quite entertaining. I Would only come back for sake and beer. I left super hungry even after spending so much money on sushi and appetizers. But it's Vegas so I can't complain much."
