b"A friend went and told me that he enjoyed it. He's been a few times. Finally went in for breakfast with the better half. Atmosphere was great liked the decor, service was good, but we came here to eat. I got corned beef hash with eggs and a side of bacon. She got a omelette. We both got the biscuits and gravy. Only good thing I could say was the bacon was good. Hash was just full of potatoes. Biscuits and gravy were bland. My eggs were undercooked and runny. When I took a bite I had to spit it out I was afraid I was gonna throw up all over my plate. Home fries where just deep fried crispy crap. The better half usually doesn't complain about anything and she found the food to be not good at all and left probably 3/4 of her meal I left about 1/2 of mine. Waitress asked how it was I said just look at our plates we're leaving hungry!"
