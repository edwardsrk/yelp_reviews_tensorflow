b'Got there for a Sunday happy hour, which is great because not many places have Sunday happy hours and the beers are $3.50 for a pint.  They have all the usual Four Peaks suspects but only 3 guest brews on tap, so a little disappointing.  We ordered the calamari to start out with and followed it up with the Italian Beef Beer Bread.  I\'m not sure what arrived at our table that they called "calamari", but I can tell you that\'s not calamari.  It was more like overpriced fish sticks.  Very disappointing.  They should absolutely not have calamari on the menu if that\'s what they\'re going to serve.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread was over a little greasy, but not bad.  I\'m not much a fan of battered fries either.  Overall the beer for $3.50 is a worth a visit, but I would probably eat somewhere else.'
