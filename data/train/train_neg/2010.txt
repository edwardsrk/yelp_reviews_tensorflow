b'this place is lame! my boyfriend and i decided to check it out because it was their very first 80s night and some dude working for the club gave us a free pass.so we waited in line about a half an hour, dealt with the rude doorman, got in and um. not much else to be said. "80s night" was going on outside on the patio, and they were playing the worst of the 80s. bad 80s/hip hop mash ups were going on inside with trashy mid-westerners dancing on tables.we chugged our drinks and were in and out in about 10 minutes.'
