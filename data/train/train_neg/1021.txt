b'I stopped by here at Jackson\'s a couple months ago and I havn\'t been able to write a review but what happened needs to be seen on here. I went in short on time so I thought I would drop by just to see if I could get a quote about cleaning my car seats (some stains on them). I talked to a guy and showed him my car seats, I simply asked him "Is this something you guys could clean?" He responded with "Oh, I\'m not sure, probably not all of it." If they can\'t, I totally get that but I\'ll have to go somewhere else. So I just thought ok I don\'t want to do business here especially if they are confident that they can get done what I need done. I told him that I\'ll think about it but he proceeded to tell me that if I want to buy the cleaning it would be $50. I said that I\'d think about it and maybe come back tomorrow. Then he said that he\'d throw in some free waxes, washes, and stuff that\'s worth like $200 and he said he would only charge me for $119. I told him the same thing "I\'ll think about it maybe come back tomorrow" it was so clear that he was working on commission. At this point I was pissed. This guy would not stop and he said he\'d give it all to me for $100. I told him no and he just said "whatever and walked away in disgust". I tried to tell him I\'d come by tomorrow Because I don\'t have time and he was like "But you can pay right now and than come by tomorrow." He was awful. He was Tall, skinny, and had a beard. This was such an awful experience. I had never been to Jackson\'s before and actually went here because someone I know told me that y\'all did some good work.'
