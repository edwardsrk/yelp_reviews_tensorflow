b"I used to like this Starbucks for its location and abundance of seats. But lately I've noticed that the baristas at this location are annoyingly loud, making it impossible to concentrate on study/work and carry a good conversation. They aren't the regular staff I used to see around here.If you want to come here for study/work, remember to bring ear plug or headphone. Even with headphone on, you'd cringe as their loud conversation pierce through your music. Bring back the regular staff please!"
