b'Am I the only one who feels this place has gone down?  The last 2 x I went I have been disappointed.  The first time because they changed their breakfast preparation and got the order wrong twice.  This time food was wrong and not well prepared.  But worst of all this is what I observed.  Food handlers not wearing gloves and using their cell phones before and after they prepared the food.  Also one employee was carrying loaves of bread basically resting it on her chest with her ear buds dangling and hitting the bread.  eeeewww.  I feel the manager is not doing well.  The place was very dirty in the food prep area.  I am done.  Not going back.  Very disappointed.'
