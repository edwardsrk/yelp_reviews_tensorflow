b"Not really sure why it takes over an hour to make a salad with no meat and a chicken sandwich. The moose dip was disappointing. No reason to come here ever.We asked for our check and wanted to leave. While the owner said he'd buy our dinner, we had spent enough time at this establishment. We asked the owner how much the tab was he wouldn't tell us. He just kept saying he wanted us to stay and eat our dinner. We just wanted to pay our tab and waitresses. He never told us. We left $60 to cover our $9 appetizer, 2 cocktails, and one beer. Sure, he tried to rectify the situation but we told you no, we don't want to stay countless times. Sometimes you can't fix your poor service. Icing on the cake... My night off of grad school and work... Wasted. Waitresses, you did well."
