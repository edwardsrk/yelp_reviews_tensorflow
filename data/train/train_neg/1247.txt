b'First time coming here and my last time. The service sucked big time, very little instructions on where anything is. The food area looks like a health code violation, the plates and sliverware still had left over food. .. overall this place seems like its been open for years and everything is grimy and gross, the broth has no flavor, taste like boiling water. Was it worth the 22.00, nope... Will I come back? Nope I am afraid I might get food poisoning'
