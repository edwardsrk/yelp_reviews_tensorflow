b'I was disappointed in the way this practice handled the departure of our vet, Dr. Kolmstetter.  We were never alerted that she was changing practices, so when I found out, I was pretty upset. It\'s challenging to find a vet that specialized in exotics, so if there had been an emergency with our rabbit, Lulu, we\'d have been screwed with no confidence in where to take her in North Vegas or if the vet would have experience with exotics. When I called to make an appointment is when I found out that Dr. K had left the practice. The staff on the phone when I called was very "oh well" about it. Despite their assertion that they could "maybe do a nail trim", I had no intention of bringing Lulu back there.I think you should notify your patients that their doctor is leaving your practice. It\'s your practice, so ultimately, they\'re YOUR patients.  If there had been an emergency, I\'d have been in an even more stressful situation. That was disappointing.'
