b'This was first visit here and we arrived on a ridiculously busy night. Thought we were doing well to have reservations, but due to large party had to wait well over 30 minutes past the reservation time. Also the restaurant cancelled reservation so we did not earn points for visit. Very strange and no explanation as to why??? The server was not as attentive as we hoped,yet was pleasant and  knew menu well,plus  made nice recommendations.  Prices were a tad bit higher than quality. Food was not bad just nothing special. May return, just not weekend evening. Management really needed to do a better job with staff availability and booking large parties. Wait times without quasi reservation were 60-120 minutes. Little noisy, buy okay with us.'
