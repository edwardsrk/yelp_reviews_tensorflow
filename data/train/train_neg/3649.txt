b'Small Korean Diner in Summerlin area of Las Vegas. New and clean. Serves plenty of bunchan (appetizers) before the meal. Bunchan are underwhelming and alcohol prices too expensive. I just got back from Seoul so once the entree arrives will have more to compare. Dinner salad was plain without much taste. 3 meals ordered were bibimbap, pork katsu and dynamite chicken. My wife said the food was okay, which translates from Korean "this sucks". If it were not for the sauce I could not have finished the katsu. My kid who is normally an eating machine never got out of first gear.I think the star of the show would have to be the the TVs with the Kpop music! If you want good Korean food, save your $$ and drive to Spring Mountain area.I will say the staff is very attentive and open to suggestions. Hopefully, the quality of the food will improve in the future?'
