b'Never having heard of it, I was looking for any type of tea to help with my husbands sinus infection so I tried this place. The guy was honest about not having what I needed but quickly swept me over to check out skin care. After thoroughly insulting me and telling me how badly I need colagan (I\'m a baby faced 30 yr old) I allowed him to apply their "remedy". He insisted there was a difference, saying one side of my face looks "happy and awake" and the other is "soggy. I told him I couldn\'t see a difference and then made it clear that I wasn\'t buying anything and he immediately got nasty, telling me how badly my soggy face needs it and then he decided to just ignore me and treat me like a bum. Thanks for nothing guy. I came in bc my husband is sick. I didn\'t need to you to tell me I\'m old, gross and my face is falling apart. I just wanted yea.'
