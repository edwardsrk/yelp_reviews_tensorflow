b"I have been frequenting this establishment for almost 15 years. I think I was Hunan's biggest fan, in fact. And that was for good reason. Their food had always been tasty, plentiful and consistent. The original owner (TC) sold it a few years ago to the head chef (or this is what I was told anyway). Since that time the quality of the food has declined steadily. Perhaps they are using inferior ingredients or just don't care but your dining experience will not be what it has been in the past. At my last visit (and that was literally my last visit) I had Cilantro chicken. It looked like no one took the time to chop the vegetables in an appetizing way. There were way too many cilantro stems and the chicken was chewy and fatty. I believable a piece of shrimp or scallop made its way into my dish as well. That was a surprise. My companion ordered chicken and vegetables and it was just flat out disgusting. This dish had NO flavor. I think chicken and vegetables cooked in water would have tasted better. Additionally, it had a different texture that didn't seem like chicken at all. The server was not accommodating and charged us for the bland dish even thought less than 5% had been consumed. I'm disappointed that the quality of the food has declined. I can no longer recommend this place and will not embarrass myself when dining with business associates."
