b'Startlingly bad experience. Went for dinner and ordered a breakfast burrito (the standard: egg, cheese & ham in a tortilla). First bite in I hit eggshell. SIgh. But, okay, it happens. Then, a few bites later, more eggshell. Then it happened a third time. I cut open the burrito and found another piece of shell that would have covered most of a dime. So I went to the counter and asked for a manager. There isn\'t one, I was told. An owner? Nope. So I described the problem to three women who were up front and showed them the shell. They stared at me like I had a second head. So I gave up and rejoined my wife. But then I got annoyed and went back and said I wanted a refund -- after all, I\'d given back most of the burrito. The clerk said, "Let me call the manager." Yeah. I waited there to talk to this mystery manager but heard that she was too busy to talk to me. That\'s the kind of people who work there and who run the place.'
