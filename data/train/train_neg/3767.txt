b"I don't know who is running this place but this is the slowest chipotle I've ever been to and today is the third time I've come and they don't have food prepared. I wanted steak and they were out. The last time, they were out of fajita veggies and the time before that they were out of rice. What gives? I love chipotle so two stars but this location leaves much to be desired."
