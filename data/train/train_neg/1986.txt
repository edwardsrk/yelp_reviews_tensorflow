b"My daughter went inside to ask how long the girl said right now, she said OK and went to to tell me as I parked my car.. Then we waited and waited, I asked the front desk girl,  I thought right now? Girl forgot to ask for my daughter's name, so others went ahead...ok...waited a bit then got seated, in room with older chairs and dirty as well...she wipes down .. now it begins..both of us decided to get  45.00 service,  most expensive one, my person went to open a plastic case of tools..while two others doing other peoples feet got tools opened in sterile envelope, along with my daughter ..I stated to her I would like that as well and you are supposed to do so for each new person...then had to also ask for new file and new buffer, also items each person is required to have per health dept . Person begins my pedicure, doesn't clean sides of toes thoroughly, doesn't scrub off callous properly. Left over undone areas, so had to get redone at another spa, I usually go to but decided to try here since friend said great place lol..my place is where one never has to ask for sterile tools, and you leave with new baby feet, no callouses, awesome massages, now back to experience..My person doesn't massage properly at all so other girl doing my daughter's feet translates, my person laughs, then my person keeps doing what she was doing...NOTHING, not even strong enough to rub lotion into skin...really ...then I decide before she starts my other leg of A MASSAGE THAT FEELS LIKE  NOTHING... I told her I no longer want the deluxe..forget the mask step and call it a day...so I could get the heck out of there...the front desk girl was very kind and apologetic and viewed my sub par callous removal and didn't want us to leave unhappy, so lowered our prices. I appreciated her doing the right thing and might give them one more chance in the future.. This unfortunate experience has tarnished my feelings and that they are truly trained in hygienic processes.."
