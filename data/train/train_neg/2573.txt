b"Stopped in for carry out. I didn't have great expectations after reading some of the reviews, but I wanted to try it out. I was really hoping for a great Japanese restaurant on the north side of town and, unfortunately, this isn't it. I was promptly greeted by a friendly server. He didn't have much experience, but he tried his best. The menu is pretty limited (I didn't see any poke on it) so I tried two rolls. The Tiger roll was the better of the two, but I wouldn't order it again. The spicy tuna roll was covered in mayo and that dominated the flavor profile. Even after I wiped as much of it off with a napkin, it's still mostly what I tasted. I ended up finishing the Tiger roll but threw 1/3 of the tuna roll away."
