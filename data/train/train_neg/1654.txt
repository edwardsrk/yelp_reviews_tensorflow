b'You\'re better off calling Verizon Wireless and getting help over the phone. From the moment I walked in their customer service was far below average. I was not greeted and both employees were helping out other customers. I was never told how long the wait was going to be or anything. I had my phone stolen and waited over an hour for them to just tell me I need to call a different insurance number or do it online because they can\'t help me. If I would have just gotten greeted in the beginning with a, "What can we do for you today?" Then it would have been a good experience.'
