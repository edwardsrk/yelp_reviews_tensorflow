b"Yummy Margartia, good service, but the food wasn't anything special.  We came in for a quick, light lunch during our stay at Mandalay Bay.  Our server came by right away and took our drink order.  I ordered a Pepino Margarita and he asked if I could handle the heat and I said yes.  It was really good and spicy, but not necessarily hot to me.  We ordered tres tacos, which our server upgraded to 4 (2 steak and 2 chicken) and a chicken quesadilla to share.  Our server mentioned these were small plates, but we didn't want to eat much.Overall, the food was on the bland side I thought."
