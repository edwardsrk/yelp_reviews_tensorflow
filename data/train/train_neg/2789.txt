b"I thought we had a good thing going with this place but after this visit I can say we will definitely not be back. The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. There is no reason for almost an hour wait between receiving our appetizer and our entrees. Drinks were empty for probably 30 minutes of that time.This place needs to get their act together with the scheduling. After coming here weekend after weekend experiencing the same issue we can clearly see there's a problem that those who come every once in awhile do not."
