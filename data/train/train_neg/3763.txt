b"Nothing to wait on line for. Was a more expensive version of In and Out and the fries were not as good. The burger was tasty, but chicken was so-so. Liked the fact we could have a beer and Sonoma Coutrer. If this was the only game in town that's one thing, but Old Town Scottsdale has so many options. Just a few doors down  the Z burger @ Z Tejas would be my burger choice @ the mall."
