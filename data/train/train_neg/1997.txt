b"This company was sent out through home warranty. My a/c broke on a Saturday. Warranty company said they can't send someone out till Monday. Air pros get here on Monday and says my blower fan is broken. Says he has to order the part and could take 3-4 days. WTF, I live in Vegas! Parts should be readily available. A week and a half later, and the hottest week so far, I'm still waiting for the part to be installed. Thank god for Sam's Club and portable air conditioners."
