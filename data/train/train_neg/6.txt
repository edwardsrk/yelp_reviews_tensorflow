b"Horrible- Unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. The restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. Needless to say, I talked him into driving up the road to the other location. This one is unacceptable."
