b'Decent beer and liquor selection but the food situation is quite poor. There is absolutely nothing local about the ingredients. They serve pre-made burgers, freezer section sides, and Mrs Ts pierogies that you would have at home. The sausage gravy and biscuits was atrocious. Cake like biscuits broke apart and could not be forked. The whole dish appeared to be heavily salted prior to serving, so it overwhelmed the whole plate. No kidding, so much salt my tongue felt shriveled and rough. The corned beef hash was straight out of a can. I feel that the "local" aspect of this place is deceiving and inaccurate. Nothing fresh to be found here.'
