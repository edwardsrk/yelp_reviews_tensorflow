b'I\'m sorry but this place doesn\'t deserve its rating. When you are doing only breakfast and lunch, you had better have those Nailed. They do not. I had chicken fried steak and eggs with house cut potatoes and biscuits with gravy. Eggs were over done not over medium.The Steak was bland as was the gravy.The potatoes were under cooked in the middle, but brown and crispy outside? ( pieces were cut too large). Service was good but couldn\'t make up for poor food quality.Parking also was poor, had to park behind another restaurant and walk through a "hall" then back to front door. I Won\'t be back for more.'
