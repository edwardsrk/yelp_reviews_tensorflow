b'If I could give this Jamba Juice 0/5 stars I would. I generally like this location, however today the staff changed that. The staff was uneducated regarding their policies, unable to resolve an issue or even attempt to do so. I got the response "I just work here" Everyone I encountered looked miserable. No one smiled or seemed upbeat. The guy that poured my smoothie asked me how my day was and I told him "horrible" (considering what I had just dealt with when purchasing the smoothie) The guy respond after I said "horrible" he stayed quite and looked down as if not knowing what to say. Someone please tell me what kind of costumer service is that and who is training these kids? The smoothie itself was awful tasting. I buy the same smoothie every time and I know what it\'s supposed to taste like and what I received today was nothing close to it. It did not taste fresh or sweet. It\'s one thing to have an awful tasting smoothie and you deal with it because the staff is awesome and you leave with a smile on your face. BUT it\'s another thing when the costumer service is just as bad if not worse then that awful smoothie. Overall a horrible experience from the lack of costumer service to the disgusting so-called fresh fruit smoothie. I will not be returning to this Jamba Juice location for many reasons and will recommend my friends and family do the same.'
