b"First time at Chili's and probably my last... The food was okay but not amazing, definitely cheap prices. The service needs a lot of work as well as their management. Messed up our order multiple times and no apologies for it... You'd think as a manager you'd want to make sure people eating at your restaurant get great customer service... (not the case here). Also waited almost 25 minutes for our first refill when multiple servers passed by our table seeing 6+ empty glasses... Not impressed what so ever with this restaurant, SMH."
