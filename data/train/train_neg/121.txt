b"Pulled in for an oil change. Have no problem waiting. Dude is posted up against the wall doing nothing, sees me, does not acknowledge me. Drive around to the other side. Roll my window down. Looks at me, still nothing. See another guy who's actually working on a vehicle who I believe was on his way over to acknowledge me, but i had already started driving off. No worries, I'll spend my money elsewhere."
