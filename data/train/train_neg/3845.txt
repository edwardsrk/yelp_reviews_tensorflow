b'We just moved here from Arizona and popped in here last Saturday.  We were greeted nicely at the bar. But when my friend asked the bartender if they served tamales... And she said no, "but we have jalape\xc3\xb1os"... We should have known better and left.  We both ordered fajitas... And for $17 per person... It was a pretty sad entree.  Plus no rice or beans or sides for that price?  Disappointing.  Decent margaritas though.'
