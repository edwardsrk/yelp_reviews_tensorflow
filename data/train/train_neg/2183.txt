b"I feel so bad for the actors.  You simply can't hear a word out of their mouths.  This venue is not made to handle a show like this.  They're trying so hard, but I just couldn't help but feel for them.The hardcore fans loved it - and if you're one of them, you will probably like it.They set a good vibe for the tone of the show.  When I asked where the restroom was before the show, the cast member directed me 'around the corner'...when I went around the corner it was right in front of me.  He said 'do you see it?'  I said 'yes, thanks', he said 'F**ker' LOL.  If that exchange offends you - don't go to this show.The splatter zone, the camp....it's all good fun.  But, unless this is a top 5 cult movie for you - give it a miss."
