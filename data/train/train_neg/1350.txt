b'We have been to Millers Ale House several times.. Always great food and service, which is why we went Monday, Memorial Day..  Promptly seated..  5 mins. Go by, waitress stops at table next to us asking if everything is ok, need anything, My husband says " No" as she glances at us and passes by.. Husband speaks to manager. Expecting the manager wanting to make things correct by taking our drink order.. He returns to our table..  But NO, the manager wasn\'t interested in making things right, in fact, he didn\'t even send a waiter/ waitress to take our order.. Husband speaks to manager again - and we were told to leave!!  We will NOT return..'
