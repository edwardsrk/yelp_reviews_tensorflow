b"Disappointed. The fries were dried out. I prefer frozen crinkle fries over these. The burger was very tender and juicy. The texture reminded me of a thicker smash burger. I did not like how red it was throughout. I wish I would have known so I could have ordered it well done. There were a few bites I didn't eat because of how red they were. The bun is too soft and gets soggy from the hamburger juice. Overall I think it's overpriced for what you get."
