b"Seriously don't go here. Me and my husband went here to try it...and we left right away. Reason reason we left right away was because the sushi chef was blowing his nose, and then he rinses his hands under water without any soap and just wipe his hands on his apron dips his hands into the sushi rice and started to make a roll. How freaking disgusting is that. When the roll came in front of us we told the sushi chef about him not washing his has we left because we were so disgusted. go here if you like boogers in your sushi. totally on hygienic place to eat at"
