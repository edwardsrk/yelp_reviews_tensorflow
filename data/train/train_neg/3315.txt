b"I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?Pros:+Pizza is GOODCons:-Slow inattentive service-Slow delivery-general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons"
