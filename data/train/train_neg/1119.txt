b'This review is a bit overdue but I realized I should leave a review on how frustrating verizon makes every process. I made the huge mistake of taking my phone to the river. I had a Galaxy S3 with a Bluetooth speaker I bought online, and which was waterproof unlike my phone. I put my phone in a couple Ziploc bags, which ended up being fruitless as the bags got water in them and my phone died. I put it in a bag of rice overnight but that didn\'t fix it. I pay for the damage protection plan so I called this store since they are closest and told them my situation. They instructed me to come in so they could take a look.I arrived and per usual they were moderately busy. I put in my spot in line and waited about 15 minutes which wasn\'t a huge deal. After waiting one of the "specialist" came over and asked me for my name. Once he confirmed that I was who was waiting, he gave me a card and told me to call or go online with that. I asked him if I could do this in the store. He said no. I then asked why I was told to come in, he didn\'t know either. Waste of my time and the situation didn\'t feel like they didn\'t even care because I wasnt buying anything from them.I wish there was a 5 star verizon store.'
