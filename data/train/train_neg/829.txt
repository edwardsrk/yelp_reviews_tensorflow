b"My boyfriend and I went here together to pick up lunch... Long story short, this is probably the worst location. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and didn't get the bread or strawberry. I ordered a salad and soup and they somehow forgot to include dressing in my meal. Save your money and time by going to the location on Lake Mead. They have better service, staff, and they've never made mistakes when serving meals--even when they're overwhelmed and packed with customers! Such a shame that this location couldn't measure up... huge fan of Zupas."
