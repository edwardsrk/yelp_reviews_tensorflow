b'What\'s left to say that hasn\'t already been said?  I\'ll try. The setup really is so awkward. It\'s like they didn\'t want to do counter service but had no real interest in full service either- so they just muddled the two to all oblivion. Two employees (tried to) explain the process and we were still left confused and honestly a little frustrated before we even sat down. Order at the counter in the back middle of the place, walk backwards get your own drink and condiments, try hard to remember the table number you were told 8 minutes ago, sit down and wait. You\'re then repeatedly told that you\'re now receiving "full service" when you just did everything the same as if you were at let\'s say a Chipotle. I\'ve served for 12 years and id still never leave 20%. I FRIGGIN DID EVERYTHING. The food was decent but for $30 I\'ll go to Smashburger and have a feast, not two (smallish, super dry, and overcooked) burgers and one side of fries with a forced gratuity.'
