b'Went there yesterday with high expectations after the raving reviews but was disappointed ... Their website n online menu says they have trout fish but in real they only have cat fish !!! Food was mediocre below par ordered pad thai with tofu... V average taste n burnt fried tofu with no vegetables have to sent back .. Came back with raw not seasoned vegetables ... Hubby ordered basil fried rice with shrimp which has two shrimp n bland tasting ... Only good part was tall manager who was very nice and friendly but i guess their cook need some serious improvement !! And yes the calamari appetizer was totally tasteless like stale have to sent back ... Manager was nice and admitted all seafood is frozen .... Would not go back ..'
