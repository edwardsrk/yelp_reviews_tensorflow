b"Pretty disappointed with our experience here given that most of the other reviews for this place are so great. The food was okay. It was edible but very lacklustre. I got the pork belly plate, it looked good, but everything except the coleslaw and pineapple salsa was a bit bland. It was like the fattiest piece of thing I've ever been served at a restaurant, and that's fine but it really was really lacking in taste. The super duper small fibres of meat that I did get at the bottom of the pork belly were really tasty though. One of my friends liked his sandwich, but everyone else at the table felt like their food was just 'meh'.We felt like we weren't really welcome there. We wanted to get drinks but the server wouldn't even wait for us to finish talking before he left. This happened multiple times. He was super impatient with us and the girl behind the counter was friendly to other patrons but she pretty much rushed us out of the restaurant after we finished eating."
