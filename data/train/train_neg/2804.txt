b'I always wanted to try this place but was very dissapointed with the food. It was outrageously expensive because probably of its location but the thing I didnt like most is the the house special steak tasted like your average steak at a random bbq party. There is absolutely nothing special about this steak house I personally prefer fresh meat over aged meat and a place that knows how to marinate their steaks to make the mouth water and not just throw a piece of meat on a grill and serve it plain.. We paid $150 for 2 and drank sparkling water with our meals. The portions were large and we did take leftovers home.'
