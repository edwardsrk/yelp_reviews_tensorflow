b"WORSE LUNCH EVER... Just went to pick up a shrimp burrito bowl for lunch and it was the worse EVER! It was freezing cold, things weren't mixed, there were like 4 shrimps and soo little lettuce.  The staff didnt look like they knew what to put in... I usually love the bowl at Chipotle's and Burrito Boys'... this was a very poor version... Will never eat there again."
