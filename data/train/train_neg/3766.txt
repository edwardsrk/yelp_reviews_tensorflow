b"This was our second try. The first resulted in a token gift card to inspire us to return and try again. The service was excellent this time. Despite her broken foot our waitress returned several times before and during our meal to check on us.  The refried beans are great. The pork torta was delicious though cool compared to everything else on the plate. Sweetpotato stuffed pepper is a great idea but the sauces on top were a distraction from the yummy potato-pepper combo. The open faced tamale was bland and a waste of calories. My mom ordered teh enchalada plate. She expected the same dish she ordered a few months ago- a nice cheesy plate of enchaladas with red sauce. She instead recieved a little skillet with a layer of green sauce on the bottom, 3 cheese enchaladas ontop of that, then a bit more cheese melted on top. so much of the corn tortillas were dry. My daughter ordered a cheese crisp of the kid menu. I thougth it was delicious but she did not care for the addition of mexican cheese to the traditional cojack. The cucumber margarita was excellent again. That may be what brings us back for a third try. I recommend if you go here to ask specifically about anything on the menu that is not clarified. the menu is unclear and sometimes misleading in it's description of certain dishes. And try the cucumber margarita. It's delicious."
