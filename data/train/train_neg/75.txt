b'2 words: RIP OFFI made the mistake of booking an appointment AND paying up front for a package before reading any of the reviews. The girl who sold me the package asked me what areas i would like lasered and i told her exactly what i wanted to be done (i have done numerous laser treatments in the past) so she told me that this package would be perfect for me. Later when i go in for my appointment they tell me that i have to pay extra for this body part and that body part! Not only did they sell me the wrong package but they refuse to refund me my money and want me to pay more that i initially anticipated. They never sent me a reciept (as the purchase was made over the phone) and the laser technician literally spent 10 minutes with me for full legs and bikini and face! They are in the business to scam individuals who are new to laser treatment and have no idea what to expect. All i can say is STAY AWAY'
