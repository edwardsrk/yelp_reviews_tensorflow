b'After being stranded at Tower City for an hour while i waited for the rapid to the airport i became famished!I wanted a healthier option so i gave mixed greens a whirl. Got a chicken panini, with a side salad and a drink for $10. The sandwich was awesome BUT the side salad was a complete and utter joke. I literally got some chopped iceburg lettuce with three olives and 4 red peppers. I asked for more but the girl said "only two toppings" like what the hey!! Bland freaking salad, there was no substituting for soup or some other side. I was stuck. Okay so i got past that. There were FOUR girls working this particular afternoon, and could you believe it still took 2:10 seconds for ONE of them to acknowledge that someone was standing at their counter. They were talking about babies and baby daddys. Not professional at all. HELLO IM STARVING HEREThis place has some management issues, some pricing discrepancies, and is cheap with sides. If thats your thing then hey to each his own. but im good for now.'
