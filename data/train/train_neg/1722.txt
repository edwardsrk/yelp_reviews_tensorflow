b'i have been to this place 5 times......EVERY time i feel like i get treated differently than everyone else. Most of their clients are as we call them "gringos" I immediatly notice the differnent attention I get for being a latina...............but it still does not stop me from buying their amazing cakes. ive tried all of them best is the whitechocolate raspberry, worst is lkemon tastes like made out of a box.'
