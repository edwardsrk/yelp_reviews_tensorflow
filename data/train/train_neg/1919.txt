b"This place is by far the worst place I've been to. I paid 70 dollars for a gel mani/pedi. The price wasn't the issue but they done a rush job. I absolutely hate rush jobs because when u rush the job looks messy. And for that price and a crappy job I feel it's bad business. Especially when you don't get what you pay for."
