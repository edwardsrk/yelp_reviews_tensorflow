b"The school lacks integrity and the staff is not knowledgeable. They are only regionally accredited and cannot confer doctorate degrees that can be used in any field for specialty. If you get a doctorate degree there it is worthless. I don't even know why they keep giving them out. Many of the students cannot even transfer their credits to other schools. Most of the staff signing out doctorate degrees are signed by faculty with MBAs. The teachers are hired overseas with foreign transcripts that are not even approved by the US Department of Education."
