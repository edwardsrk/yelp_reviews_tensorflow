b'-1 $14 drinks.-1 Weak as hell.-1 Service extremely slow.Finally went to the bar. Bartender proceeded to walk away to "do something" and then came back to fill up the glass with my drink.Luckily, I ordered the best drink, the New Cable Car. Well, other than the guys that had beer. The other two cocktails were pronounced, "disgusting."We stayed maybe 20 minutes including waiting for the cocktail server, waiting at the bar and then sucking down a drink each.The crowd was older and a bit weird. I watch some cougars challenge guys to a push up contest. Women in short skirts doing push ups? Is this a reason to go?No, not really. There\'s not enough alcohol in those drinks!'
