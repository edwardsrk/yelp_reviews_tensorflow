b'This is about the only movie theater in Gastonia so even though they charge $10 for a ticket on a weekday, it still fills up fairly easily. Guess there\'s not much else to do around? Not exactly on my to go list, but as my date that night suggested we meet here to watch a movie I went with it.Walking in you\'re greeting by the smell of heavily buttered popcorn and plush purple carpet. My charming date bought a medium soda and some gummy fruits for a whopping $9. Then we saw the size of the huge cup of soda given out and balked a bit, just to give you an idea of the size of a medium. He remarked "I think this is enough for at least 5 people, maybe I\'ve been in London too long". The theater itself was serviceable, not much to say there.Expensive weekday tickets, oversized portions that may give people diabetes if they manage to finish it to justify oversized prices and being extremely out of my way make this experience two thumbs down and just as many stars. My date better be glad that he was extremely charming and lovely or I\'d have left slightly upset.'
