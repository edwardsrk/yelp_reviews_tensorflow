b"When you pay nearly 100$ per guest for a meal that is no better than Red Lobster, then something is wrong.  The appetizers were good, but you can hardly mess up shrimp cocktail, except that the price was 18$ for four pieces of shrimp.  Stingy!  We shared two appetizers, but it wasn't enough for three people.  The ravioli appetizer was excellent, and I would be raving about it had there been more than four pieces.  It wasn't worth spending money on, especially if you share appetizers.  Our lobster bisque had three small pieces of lobster, a bland cream sauce, and plenty of corn bread pieces, or whatever it was.  One of my guests hardly ate her soup at all.  My other guest did eat a good deal of his Caesar Salad, however he had to ask for more dressing, and I could certainly tell it lacked an acceptable amount of dressing.Our main dishes were fairly okay, I really enjoyed my dish, one of my guests really enjoyed his meal (however he did say there was sand in one of his scallops), however the other guest did not like her dish other than the veggies on the side.  In fact she hardly touched her food and packed it up.  The drinks were very tasty.  The service was attentive, however I thought it was slightly unprofessional the way the menus lingered on the table for so long while it was getting crowed with two appetizers and three drinks plus three waters.  In the end I wasted my money by coming here.  None of us felt full or satisfied.  We joked afterward that we should have just went to In-n-Out Burgers.  I would not recommend this establishment at all."
