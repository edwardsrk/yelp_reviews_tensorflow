b"It's been a little over 25 years since I have been to a Rally's. Last time was when I was stationed in Florida and I was pregnant with my daughter, Rally's was my favorite place to go. A Rally burger with extra pickles and Vanilla shake is what I always craved. So when I saw one here in Tempe I was excited and decided to come and get a classic. The service was fine, however shake machine was down, no worries, but the Rally burger was awful. It was cold and could not find the meat. Of course I went through drive through, my office is three blocks away. The burger was worse than a McDonalds burger. I was very saddened at my experience today with Rally's as it was one of my most favorite places back in the day. The fries were good as I remember and I settled for a smoothie because again the shake machine was down. The Mango Smoothie was pretty tasty. I give 2 stars because the Rally burger was absolutely awful. Maybe I will visit again at a different time and try again for a burger but, if I am met with another cold, unmelted cheese because so cold burger and hardly any meat, I will have to bid farewell to a place that used to be rated better than the average McDonalds. I hope Rally's looks at their review and improves their burgers to the quality I know they can be."
