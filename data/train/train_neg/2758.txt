b'Food was ok. . Sauces were sweet.  Tortillas made fresh.  Staff however was horrible. . They could care less what question you had.  Prepared multiple  meals wrong in our group of 10.  Group in dront was there firat time there staff provided no help and had no patience for questions.  Just wanted to rush people through and the place was not busy but dirty.  Tables needed to be wiped down. Drink station was a mess, lemonade fountains were empty and were never addressed for the whole time we were there.   Sad to see . . No reason to come back.  Plenty of other places right there with more to offer'
