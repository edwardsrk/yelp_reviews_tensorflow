b'The food was ok.The place is meh. Pricy and not maintained well - uneven tables, holes in walls etc. The VIP room has no room to move around - definitely no VIP experience.    Electrical outlet  chipped / dangerous looking.   Hot, fan tower barely helped.The service was horrible - we waited forever, mixed up orders, drinks took forever (I.e. Pitcher of beer on tap took 28 minutes).  Shared our experiences with staff - didn\'t even get a sorry, more like "oh ok, so you aren\'t having a good experience". Too bad because if well executed the concept has potential.'
