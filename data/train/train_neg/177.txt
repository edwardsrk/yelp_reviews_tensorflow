b'I tried the cheddar poptopia gourmet popcorn and I was disappointed to say the least. I found it to be tasteless and greasy. Normally I get regular movie popcorn with the white cheddar cheese seasoning, but the movie theatre ran out  (again). I expect at $6.50 for a 125g bag it would  taste "gourmet"...not so much. Suffice to say I will never buy this brand again.'
