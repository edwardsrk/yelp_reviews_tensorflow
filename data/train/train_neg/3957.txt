b"Bland. Tiny portions especially the sides for $4.50. The guy couldn't remember our order for the life of him and made the smallest salad and gave me the smallest amount of kale salad. The prices for the smoothies aren't posted on the board either. One side, one salad, one iced tea and a smoothie came out to be $21 and we were both hungry afterwards. Eat elsewhere !"
