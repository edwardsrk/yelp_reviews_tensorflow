b"Ordered Sushi #8 and Sushi Tsuka for two people. Bill came to $50 and change. That would be pricey in a sit down place, but this was takeout from a hole-in-the-wall. The food was fresh and the fish was pretty good, but I can get comparable quality from any number of other places for literally half the price and will do that in future. I won't go back until they lower their prices."
