b"This place was cute. The inside was adorable and would be perfect for a cute girls brunch. The cr\xc3\xaapes were good and beautiful. The portions were great. I got two minis and was more than satisfied. I was so excited to try this place and low and behold they were out of coffee!! I have no clue how this happens at a primarily breakfast spot. I was not impressed with the customer service. The lady at the register, young gal was not very friendly or welcoming. In fact there was an Uber eats guy picking up a to-go order and both young girls working the front didn't treat him very nicely. It would be great for them to understand that most people don't dine at a cr\xc3\xaape spot so explaining the menu a tad or showing any kind of cr\xc3\xaape passion would have made our experience more fun and enjoyable. Customer service is EVERYTHING in places like these. I mean if you are out of coffee and can't do coffee for us...tell us what you CAN do for us. Customer after customer came in wanting coffee and they didn't so much as offer to comp the espressos as most people want coffee when they come dine on a Saturday morning. That's the best part. Anyways, good food. Call first to make sure they have coffee and don't expect the young gals working here to be anywhere as sweet as the cr\xc3\xaapes."
