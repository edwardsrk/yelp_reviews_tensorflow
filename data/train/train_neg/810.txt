b"This is, by far, the worst Chick-fil-A that I've ever been to. My family and I love Chick-fil-A and would regularly drive to eat at one when there wasn't one nearby. First visit: Went through the drive-through. The employees were friendly, but the food was lukewarm. One of the best things about Chick-fil-A is that their food is always hot and fresh. Not so on that visit.Second visit: Dined in. Another great thing about Chick-fil-A is that their restaurants are always clean and well-maintained. Again, not so. The tables were dirty and sticky. Also, our sandwiches and fries were lukewarm. The visit was disappointing and definitely not up to the usual Chick-fil-A standard.Third visit: Went through the drive-through for breakfast. There were 3 or 4 cars ahead of us when we pulled up. For some reason, it took nearly 50 minutes to get our food. When we did get it, out of four items, one was wrong and one was burnt. In over a decade of eating at Chick-fil-A, I have never had burnt food from Chick-fil-A. I took the receipt and the two items inside to exchange them, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager refused to speak with me and told the girl to tell me that he was too busy. This all happened about 10 feet away so I was able to see and hear the whole thing. There were 2-3 employees standing around who could have taken over bagging food, but he wouldn't speak to me. We haven't been back to the Surprise location and won't go back until some major changes are made."
