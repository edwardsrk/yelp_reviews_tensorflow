b"This place took over for some Cajun seafood  restaurant and had the same feel to it. All was well at first. I ordered the coconut mojito which took forever to come out. I think because they were car I up a fresh coconut to serve it in. I hope. The food took a while to come and when it did, it was just ok. I ordered the pork belly rice bowl and my wife ordered the pork chop. Her pork chop was overcooked and dried out. My pork belly came with an undercooked egg and in a dish separate from what is anticipated. Despite this I hoped initially that the food would be ok. At the end of the meal I felt unwell. Ended up getting sick. Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend, although the servers were nice-ish."
