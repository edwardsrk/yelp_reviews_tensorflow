b'SO disappointed in this Benihana. My daughter wanted to go to a Japanese hibachi restaurant for her 16th birthday, so I made reservations for 7pm on the Benihana website. We showed up at our reserved time only to be told that our table wasn\'t ready quite yet. 15 minutes later I ask the assistant manager when we will be seated and his reply was "Well, I have to be honest with you - There are three other groups with a 7pm reservation ahead of you. Table availability depends on how many chefs we have here tonight." After 30 minutes of waiting and seeing only 1 of the \'reservation\' groups ahead of us get seated, we bailed out. The term \'reservation\' apparently means nothing to this place and I will never go back.'
