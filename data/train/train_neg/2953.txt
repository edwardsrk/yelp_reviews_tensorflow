b"Dined solo while on business. Had the Corned Beef & Cabbage and Guinness Sampler flute. Was a pretty small portion especially for the asking price. The brisket was fatty and the cabbage and potatoes very sparse. Lots of broth and diced celery. They have a very nice gas-fireplace but for some reason they didn't have it on. Even though a snow storm was going on outside. The experience gave me the impression of money woes for this establishment.  Would probably not return."
