b"Admittedly, my boyfriend and I are slight sushi snobs--we think Ginko in Tremont is hands down the best Sushi in greater cleveland, although we will go eat at cheaper places, like Sushi 86 downtown. So, after reading reviews for Nobu Tei, we decided to make the drive down to Solon. The sushi was awful--I got a sweetheart roll, one of their specialties, and while the tuna on top of the roll was pretty good, the spicy tuna on the inside was flavorless--other than a taste like wet dog. I also got a philadelphia roll and an alaskan roll, and each one was full of salmon with a ton of chewy connective tissue. The salmon in my alaskan roll also tasted really off. The avocado in my rolls was completely brown, which is still fine to eat but not appetizing. I couldn't finish any of it, which has never happened before. My boyfriend got a shrimp tempura roll, which was moderately okay. he also got a softshell crab roll, and the crab was burnt. He also got a yellowtail roll, and it was inedible because the yellowtail was freezer burnt. Sushi-grade fish should never be frozen, let alone freezer burnt, so he couldn't finish his stuff either. We were both afraid of getting sick.We got their pork gyoza, fried dumplings, and they were stellar, hence the 2-star rating over a 1-star. Perhaps their hibachi is alright, but I don't know. Their service is a bit lackluster as well, with one server in charge of the entire restaurant, which is sizeable. If anything, just don't get the sushi."
