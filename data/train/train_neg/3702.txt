b'Ditto what an earlier reviewer stated: " I really wanted to love this place but I ended up just sort of liking it."It is just a few doors down from a salon I go to so I thought it would be convenient; however the food just isn\'t that great.  I have tried several varieties of the empanadas as well as the tamales, but none of them were that "special".   The second time I came home with some tamales, my husband didn\'t even want to try them because they were so dry the first time (even steaming them to properly reheat).   I also tried a lunch plate that was an enchilada with beans and rice.  Actually it was a rather strange version of an enchilada--more like a folded over triaguilar tortilla with minimal fillings.  This place doesn\'t seem to know what it is--a take out restaurant, sit-down restaurant or caterer.  Most businesses are better if they try to excel at one thing rather than be everything.  I\'d be a bit surprised if this place makes for another year or two with the current business plan it has going.'
