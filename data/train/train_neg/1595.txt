b'Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.I was there REALLY early but there were so few "ladies" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.Then again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).This is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ... Scottsdale.'
