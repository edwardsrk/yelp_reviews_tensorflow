b"This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time."
