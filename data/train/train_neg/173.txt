b"Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. Threw them both in the trashAfter this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash"
