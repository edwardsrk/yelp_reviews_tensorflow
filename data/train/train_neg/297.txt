b"Just awful. I came here to get a daith piercing and the bead fell out 2 times. Came to get my jewelry changed after they said it'd be free and they charged me but no surprise the bead fell out of my new earring. The girl who did my earring change had no idea what she was doing she clawed at my ear with the pliers for 10 minutes. She had no idea what she was doing. I'm wiring this review as I'm waiting the get my bead back inside of my earring and the girl is helping people who walked in 5 mins after me. Employees are just sitting around when people need help. Unprofessional atmosphere, smells like smoke inside the building, no one will great you when you walk in, etc. just awful..  never get a piercing here."
