b"I have ordered from this place previously however this time around the experience was not good. I placed an order at 6:30pm and it's now almost 9:30pm and the food has not yet arrived. The delivery guy called me saying he was lost and I gave him directions but still went back to the store because he still couldn't find it. The wait time is awful and the food isn't that great to be waiting 3 hours for delivery."
