b'The course is in poor condition, the 18th green had a very large, and deep patch of sand on the front of it (so much so that you could leave footprints in it). The rest of the course was bone dry and looked like it was dying. Besides the course conditions, the interactions that I had with the staff were so bad I will not be coming back nor recommending this course.  The woman in the clubhouse was very kind, the starter was gruff but polite; the "players assistant" aka a crotchety old man on a golf cart looking for people breaking the rules was confrontational and extremely rude.I turned the golf cart around, and in the process went into the desert briefly. He drove up to us and said "You\'re in violation of the rules, do you know which rule?" I said that I did not, he said that I must know because there are signs on every hole cautioning not to drive in the desert.  Instead of asking politely, he turned this non-issue into a confrontation and made all of us very uncomfortable.  There is a reason this goat patch has almost every tee time available on a Saturday morning. Stay away from here, there are many other courses for the price that don\'t include belittling staff.'
