b'Panchero\'s Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla\'s in the big presser they have - but that\'s the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla\'s... Since they\'re freshly made, they\'re still yummy and "gooey" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben\'s rice, the steak we got seemed "boiled", the medium salsa wasn\'t as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapat\xc3\xado), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!'
