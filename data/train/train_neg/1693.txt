b'Very unhappy with dishonest service by Adrian.  I have rented cars for almost 40 years and not once have I signed up for insurance because I use premium credit cards that provide complete insurance.  This includes all prior rentals with Enterprise.  When I rented car, I had a severe of eye strain form looking at computer and from Vegas dust, making me unable to focus close up due to watery eyes.  I told Adrain that I could not read the fine print in contract and that I had full insurance coverage, so I asked to waive all coverages.  Instead, he had me initial each of the boxes, signing up for coverage, which I explicitly told him multiple times I did not need or want.When I returned car, the bill was way higher than I expected, but I could still not read fine print.  The guy at counter explained he could waive 1 day of insurance, but not the other days, when I explained that I had refused coverage verbally, but Adrain had me sign boxes that I was unable to read.  Very dishonest....'
