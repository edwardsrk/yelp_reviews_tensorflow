b'Good: 1. Elegant 2. The rooms have a nice style to it. We loved the kitchen, the bedroom and yes, even the bathroom style. It\'s very cool. 3. Nice pool 4. It doesn\'t have the smell of smoke. Bad: 1. One of our rooms smell like mold/mildew. We asked if the room can be sprayed with some scent. After 3 hours we called again because they didn\'t show up. Finally someone came but it still smell. 2. We press the clean button (room service) but they didn\'t clean our room. 3. The gym was dirty. I used the treadmill and there was some machines with people\'s sweat all over the screen. And when I turned on the fan on the treadmill it blew a cloud of dust on my face and the machine stopped working. 4. You have to pay to get an umbrella near the pool. It\'s Vegas and it is super hot are they kidding me. 5. They don\'t have rooms with two beds. The second bed is a pull out sofa. It\'s an old, uncomfortable, thin mattress. They should be embarrass that they offer this. It\'s such an elegant hotel and it doesn\'t really represent "Trump" . Or maybe it does?6. Hotel is away from the strip. You have to take a shuttle that stops running at 12pm.7. There is no casino.'
