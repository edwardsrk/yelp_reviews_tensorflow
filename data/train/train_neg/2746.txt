b'My first time there was terrible, the rolls were packed with rice and falling apart, the waitress seemed annoyed was constantly on her phone,very unprofessional. I went back a week ago to give them another shot. The rolls were still jam packed with rice the quality of the sashimi was lil better but I would not go back there.they close at 10 I was there at 9 and they were rushing me out and forcing me to order at 920 not impressed'
