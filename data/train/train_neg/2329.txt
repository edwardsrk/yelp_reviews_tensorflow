b"We went on a Saturday and it was busy with a line out of the door, which was expected. They had the door open to the store inside was extremely hot and uncomfortable. The staff was very busy and has an efficient system for taking care of customers. The reason I wasn't thrilled with my experience was I felt like they were a bit distracted when I actually ordered. I felt like I was just a number and they just weren't very helpful or friendly. The ice cream sandwich ultimately fell apart because the cookie was too hard to bite into and the ice cream was melting all over the place. I ended up eating it all separately which took away from the whole idea of being an ice cream sandwich... I might go back and give them another try once they work out the kinks."
