b'Only rated it one star because zero was not a choice.  Apparently -- and I say this in total seriousness -- customers who show up in person are the stores lowest priority.  I have watched them fill orders for 15-20 from fax or email while TOTALLY COMPLETELY 100% ignoring the people in line.  This store needs a manager who can handle a rush.  They should also tell people who are 10-15 people back in line that the wait could be as much as an hour. Ridiculous.'
