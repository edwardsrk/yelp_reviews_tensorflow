b'I walked in Malee\'s and ordered takeout totaling $40 and waited about 15 minutes. When the server brought out my order, I asked to use my Groupon that I purchase a few months back. He said I can\'t use it for takeout and said he has the documents "to prove it" from Groupon.  Very defensive in front of customers in the restaurant! I drove 20 miles to get there and checked on the Groupon website and it said nothing about not for takeout. The server said the only way I can get the food is to pay full price. I said I want to use the Groupon and he could not care less. I also asked "is this what customer service is all about"? And "what is the difference between takeout and sitting in the restaurant"? He said with takeout you won\'t spend extra on your tab. After this heated discussion in the lobby, he said he did not care and he grabbed the bag of food and steamed to the back room. Now I\'m out my original $20 I spent with Groupon, drove 40 miles, and had a very embarrassing experience in front of other patrons. I\'m not so concerned about the money, but what terrible customer service for a potential new cutomer. I also used the "contact owner" e- mail on Malee\'s website to provide feedback about this. I never got a response for them. Guess this was no surprise if this is the way they want to treat their customers..'
