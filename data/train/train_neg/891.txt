b"This place is a joke. The posted hours of operation as well as the voice mail recording says they are open on Saturdays at 7am.  I called on April 23rd at 7:05am to place an order. The recording came on. I decided to go ahead and head up there. I tried calling twice while on the way. Now the phone line was steady busy. Upon arrival 4 other people were standing outside the establishment. The lights were off and the place wasn't open. It was 7:21am. Not professional at all. I immediately left and drove over to ALFONSO'S Taco Shop. It was open and ready to serve. Also ALFONSO'S prices are lower and no extra charge for potatoes or cheese. I will not support Tacos and More again and I suggest you don't as well."
