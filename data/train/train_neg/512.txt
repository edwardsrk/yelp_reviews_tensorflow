b'This review is more for management, but they lost all their stars for one very bad decision.  After receiving my doctorate degree yesterday, and having made BRUNCH reservations 7 weeks prior as it is graduation weekend and my family is in town, we showed up for our brunch reservation only to be told that they decided to do "Dinner all day" instead.  Now my wife had called to confirm a BRUNCH reservation 3 days prior and we were not told of this, which might have left us a chance to find another option for 7 people.  Instead, their management decided to change their menu, not call people with a 10:30am brunch reservation to alert them to the decision.  I don\'t care what field or industry you\'re in, that is just not acceptable.  The host offered a pity gift certificate, by only after we had been standing on the sidewalk for 10 minutes trying to find another option. If that had been offered immediately, maybe I wouldn\'t be so sour to V.Picasso, but It was not prompt or offered easily. Be careful if you are planning anything special here, it might fall apart when you arrive.  So very disappointing.'
