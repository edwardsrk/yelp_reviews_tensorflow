b'We were so excited that Tia Rosa was opening in Chandler after eating so many times at the Tia Rosa in Mesa while we lived there for 9 years. While the decor is minimally like the Mesa one, the food is far from it. I was so disappointed with my Chicken Mole, it looked like gelatin on the top (skin of the mole sauce). My husband had the red beef burro that had no red sauce and we barley made it home in time for him to get to the restroom. The food took 5 minutes to get to our table after ordering. I have always graciously waited for the fresh cooking of Tia Rosa in Mesa, of course it will take some time it is freshly cooked and made. 5 minutes? I should have known right there. Go to the one in Mesa if you are wanting the real Tia Rosa. So sad too this was my birthday dinner. Oh husband asked me to add that the beer was warmer than the food.'
