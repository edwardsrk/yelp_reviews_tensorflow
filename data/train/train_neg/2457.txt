b"So, I almost never write bad reviews.  I review places that I like and want to promote.  But I was disappointed in the quality of the food here and I went for one specific reason. Let me be clear up front that I didn't get the bbq, or any meat.  So my review is based on extremely limited data... I went because I wanted mashed potatoes.  I ordered mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and texas toast.  The mashed potatoes were not real potatoes, they were powdered potatoes :-(  So disappointing.  And the mac and cheese was ok at first bite, but was incredibly salty.  The toast was bread with oil on it.  I will also clarify that I went through the drive through and the service was good and it was quick."
