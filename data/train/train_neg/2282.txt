b'Went here today for my yearly mammo.  There were 2 girls at the front desk, one was helping a lady and there were 3 of us in line, I was first in the line. The other girl was busy on her computer, did not look up and acknowledge me, so after standing there for 5 minutes I asked her was she doing check in also---she raised her hand and said I\'ll be with you soon.  kind of rudely.  no smile.  then when she was finished with whatever she was doing----she looked at me and said "yes?".   Her name was Stephanie Z.     She needs to learn how to greet people.  I have encountered this rudeness at the front desk at this facility every time I go.   Think I will have to find a new facilitiy.  The mammo girl in the back was wonderful.  Its always that front desk.  No smile, no personality, no facial expressions.  Come on if you\'re dealing with the public you need to be able to greet folks!!!'
