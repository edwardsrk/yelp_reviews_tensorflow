b"...They advertising everywhere, so I went to fix my iphone..But this place is so hard to find..... The service is pretty good tho.But they are little bit expensive , since all the phone store lowered their prices :(it's okay to try, but there are my cons.1) Location; it's so hard to find and that just totally irritated me. it looks like some kinds of offices instead phone store.2) price, since other phone stores has lower prices.3) lack of accessories overall, it is okay tho.But I won't recommend..."
