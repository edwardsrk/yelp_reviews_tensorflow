b"Awful awful experienceWalked in expecting a fantastic dinner.  Started off with the jelly fish and it was decent so looking forward to the rest of the meal.  That's when it went downhill.  Hot and sour soup is watered down.  Bitter soup with maw fish tasted like pickle juice and broth.  Egg plant was ok.  Meat on the ribs was tender but had no flavor.  Like I opened up a bottle of la Choy Hunan sauce and poured it on the meat. Worst part was the rude server.  I tried this restaurant using a groupon and she kept telling everybody at the table how I only paid 50$ for $80 of food.  She said this three times extremely loudly.  Purpose of the promotion is to get people to come back.  I called manger afterwards and he told me this waitress has a history of doing this.  She should be fired.  I will not be back plus I spent half my time trying to swat the bugs alway from the food Rude and bad food"
