b'Shouldn\'t even get 1 star! I\'ve never had such awful customer service and to top that it was by a Manager!!????  His name is John? Jonathan?? Hung up on my without saying goodbye after my order took 20 min past my quoted delivery. Pizza is cold, wings cold, salad warm. I asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said "find it online" ! I\'ve been in the service industry for 16 years and understand things happen, but to not even give an apology or help with the issue is unacceptable! You John are of no significance to a company with the attitude you have. This location will not succeed with management like him. I will find the correct person to contact involving this matter with or without your help.'
