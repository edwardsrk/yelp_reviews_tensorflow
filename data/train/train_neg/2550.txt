b'Great pedicure - rough salt scrub, hot stones, hot towels wrapped around my legs for $25. Then off to the nail station for a full set, gent had no clue what he was doing when attaching nail tips. Then I got to sit for 25 minutes while the woman finished another customer, even though I was there first. Royally upset and get to deal with three bloody cuticles now. Salon was somewhat clean and updated but nobody speaks even a small bit of the English language.'
