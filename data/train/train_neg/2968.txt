b"This place got such great reviews on Yelp so my son and I went to check it out. We both ordered Pho because it's our favorite. The beef and tendon was nice and soft. The broth was very average and the noodles were really sub par. Too bad. We wanted so much to find our new 'favorite' place to eat Pho. We are new to Scottsdale and will keep looking. Not good enough to go back unfortunately. :("
