b"Here are my pros about this place:- There is plenty of parking- I love that their Butcher counter is from Pavao meats, which I previously reviewed and really enjoy going toCons:- Their seafood counter is a little bit abysmal- It's in Dufferin Mall, I don't like this mall- Their fruit and vegetable selection never seems to be enough, you walk round and round and you put nothing in your basket- Their entrances are like teeny tiny, the one from the above ground parking lot and the one from the mallSo back to this butcher shop which I'd say is the only saving grace of this place. They serve great meats, reasonable prices and this time I got to try some more tasty sausages that are fantastic, one of the big reasons I go to the real shop on Dundas.And this is just for No Frills in general, I wish they took Visa or AX. Only Mastercard because of PC."
