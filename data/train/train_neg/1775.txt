b'So, this I my first review. All I\'m going to say is ship everywhere except for here. Recently, I sold an item on eBay, made a shipping label, and went to this location. Once I made it to the front desk, I asked the lady if this was were I dropped off packages, she said yes, and I hand here the box. She then looks at is for a few seconds and says "Sorry, we won\'t deliver this" and then hands it back without telling me what\'s wrong. I later realized I messed up on the packages weight (thanks for telling me), and by now it\'s been about 2 days since the buyer bought it and I still haven\'t shipped it yet. I make a new label, and dropped it off without talking to anyone, they were gonna deliver whether they like it or not. That was last Monday, the 18th, it\'s now a week later, the 25th, and I have my buyer asking me where the package is. I check online, and the people never scanned it (and possibly never shipped it). I paid for media mail which takes 2-9 days. Hopefully they secretly shipped it without telling me, or else I\'m gonna have a claim filed against me. Never coming here again.'
