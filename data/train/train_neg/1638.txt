b'Dropped my Ford Fusion off at 12:07. They even wrote the time in white marker on my window. I went inside, paid, and waited until 12:48 for my car to be finished at the other end with the drying. In the meantime, 4 cars who were 100% behind me in the line (based on the white marker on their window), finished before mine. A young man who had 2 cars there, a Cadillac and Mercedes, took about 4 guys to clean his two cars, which left one guy to man the remaining 6 cars that were in line to be dried. I then get in my car to find out the interior was still not cleaned, which I paid for on the Works package. $16.99 to get my car washed on the exterior, with a mediocre interior wipe down, and waited 41 minutes for it all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE. When I mentioned it was slow, he merely said, "Keep your receipt in case of raincheck."'
