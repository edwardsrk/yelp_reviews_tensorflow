b"First off let me say that the room wasn't all that bad, it was updated and we got an upgrade at check in. However, the pillows were so uncomfortable, they were stiff and felt like you were laying your head on a brick. The shower had really good water pressure (most hotel showers you get no water pressure), but it was too good, lol, it kind of hurt to put my face in the water. Now, the thing that knocked this place down so much was the elevators!! One of the elevators was super shaky, felt like it was going to break any minute. And they were SLOW. I would have taken the stairs but we were on the 17th floor.  I also liked the fact that we were in a central location on the strip. All in all, not that bad, however, I'll probably stay somewhere else next time."
