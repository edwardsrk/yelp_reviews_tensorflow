b'You really have to be a vegan to enjoy the food here.  Most of the "meat" dishes are made from tofu, which I love to eat, but not when it\'s made to look like something it is not.  At first, the taste isn\'t too bad, but after a few bites, you realize you are not eating meat, the texture is just not there and neither is the taste.  Well, I gave it a shot, but no way could i enjoy eating this type of food consistently.'
