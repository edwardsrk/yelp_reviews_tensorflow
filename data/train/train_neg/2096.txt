b"The craft beers are very good, but that's about it. The BBQ had been sitting under a warmer far too long, and I wasn't really clear on the seafood/BBQ connection. Might be a nice place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night drinking with friends, but the energy is lacking, the food is overpriced and not all that, and the menu doesn't make much sense. AVOID ANY OF THE FRIED ITEMS on the menu since it's pretty obvious they never change their cooking oil and everything tastes the same-- terrible-- and is WAY over-cooked. Their fries, cajun or otherwise, are like eating a mouthful of table salt. Awful! Stick with the bags and corn and you'll be OK. There's really nothing special about the place that would recommend it over other similarly-themed sports bars in the area, and the manager could use a visit from Jake Tapper at Bar Rescue. No effort is made to make the outside patio tolerable during the summer so nobody eats there. What a waste. The restaurant itself is located way in the back corner of a strip mall where the confined location guarantees it will be like an oven."
