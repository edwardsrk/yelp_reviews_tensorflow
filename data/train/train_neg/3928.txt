b'While I like this Milestone\'s more than the John&Richmond location thanks to a neat first floor bar and cool bartenders, it still gives me the same though: "dude, there\'s got to be a better place to eat/chill/drink nearby, this is a busy spot". Hence, this is yet another, "we don\'t know what we want, so let\'s just choose the most standard spot nearby" kind of spot, and frankly Toronto has a few too many.If you want more details, check the reviews for the other Milestone\'s location, it is almost a clone.'
