b"This review would of have 3 stars if there wasn't a hair in our food. The food taste great but I would not order the meat meals unless you enjoy soy products. We ordered the orange chicken, hot and sour soup, beef sizzling plate and egg rolls. The soup and egg rolls were my favorite. Their sister location VegeWay is by far my favorite vegan restaurant in the SW area! Who am I kidding it's really good but Wynn has better options. For the price, looking for fast, cheap, vegan food. It's the best!!!"
