b"These rooms are dumps!! For 200.00$ you would think they would give you a decent room. The walls are dirty, the carpet is ripped, the bedding had holes in it. I will never stay here again. Don't come here!! Oh! There are only 2 elevators working so the lines to get to your room are about 15 mins long!!!"
