b"If you want to wait thirty plus minutes for your food come here. Bask in the non-air conditioned building. To be fair, it sucks to be working in the middle of Arizona summer with no air conditioning and only a fan. I can understand why they were so slow. But the mango on their straws is not ripe at all. Don't order the boba because unlike any place that serves boba, they don't give you straws to actually drink it. You have to take off the lid of your drink at the end if you ever want some. Food is meh, go to wing stop if you want the same quality. It's a trendy place for Instagram but not much else."
