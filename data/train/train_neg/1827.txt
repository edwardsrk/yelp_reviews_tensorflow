b"I'm doing this review as I wait on hold on the phone with this UHAUL location for 34 minutes, and counting. This is unacceptable. Every time I go here to rent a truck for my business, there's only one employee doing everything, from looking up the reservation, to inspecting the vehicle, to checking the customer out. The employee leaves out to go inspect the vehicle, when there are 5 customers waiting behind in line. This place needs at least two more employees, and better customer service. They are also sometimes unreliable, as they say they have vehicles, but don't, and sometimes don't call to notify us. I know they can't control if someone brings their vehicle back on time, but please, at least give us a call to let us know if we're S.O.L. If there was another nearby location that had better service and fleet availability, I would never visit this place again."
