b"I know this is a small family owned business, so I was reluctant to provide this low of a review. However, I have been there several times, and one server in particular is extremely rude. He is a short dude with plastic rimmed glasses and spiked up hair. I don't know his name, but here are some examples of what he has said or done:1) Starts taking away your food and wiping your table without asking you if you're done and there is visibly still food on the plate in an attempt to get you to pay your bill. Mind you, I am one of those ideal diners who is considerate when others are waiting and will eat my meal reasonably fast.  I know they are trying to get people in and out.2) Throws sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle attitude at you.3) Disciplined my brother (who has special needs) for occasionally kicking the bottom of the bench.Food is decent, but because of this one server, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.  I pay good money to have a decent dining experience, not to have some stranger throw attitude at me and my family.   I hope the owners read this review and take into consideration that your employee needs some lessons on how to interact with other human beings."
