b"I was hungry for a sandwich and it was a lunch rush so I understand that you won't get the highest customer service and they try to crank people through. I got the club which was okay the bread was dry, but I can only give them two stars because when I got to the veggie section of the ordering process the sandwich wizard started just throwing things on it, luckily I noticed it was mine and I had to speak up and he grabbed the things off the sandwich which I didn't want.... always love when they just grab them off. Then the real reason I cannot give them a positive review was the manager told the man in front of me he could not get a cup for water..... and told him he would have to buy a water bottle..... come on now.... how cheap are we getting that someone can't get a glass of water with their average sandwich."
