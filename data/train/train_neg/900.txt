b'Awful place. Average facilities and very pushy annoying staff. I was called after 10pm on two different nights by someone trying to schedule and push personal training passes on me. So many people I know are fans of good life and I wish I could be as it is so convenient, but I have had nothing but terrible experiences here. They refused to cancel my membership when I asked. Do not recommend.'
