b"Worst Victoria Secret I've ever been to. I say that having visited several since in this county and others in different cities and states. Selection is limited which is expected given the location so doesn't bother me. It's the customer service that's abysmal.  I'm am avid VS shopper or was...and have vsisited this location several times. Now the service here has never been great with maybe 1 or 2 staff who knew what good customer service was. They appear to have hired new staff however who are clueless about their sales and promotions, terrified about theft so are pretty offensive in their practices. One in particular requires me to practice quite a bit of restraint. I would highly recommend you not come here."
