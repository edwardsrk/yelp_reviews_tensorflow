b"I don't get all the good reviews about this place. I came to this place too many times because all my colleagues come here because they don't want to walk outside of the building to have lunch. But if i had the choice, I'd go anywhere but here! They have a lunch menu and i tried all the plates on it in order to find something decent to eat but everything is disgusting. If you want asian food, this is NOT asian! The pad thai taste like spaghetti. Service is ok. Prices are high for the poor quality food. I don't recommend this place."
