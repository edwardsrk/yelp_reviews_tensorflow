b"I dropped my car off at fabulous Freddy's yesterday while I was getting my hair done. When I came to pick up my car I noticed the back still had some dirt on it. I wasn't going to make it a big deal and was just going to wipe it off at home but when I got home I continued to look over my car. The cup holder was never cleaned out and other parts of the car looked like they were never wiped down. I have a really nice brand new 2016 BMW and I was highly displeased :(. Save yourself the $27 and do it yourself."
