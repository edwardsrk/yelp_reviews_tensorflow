b"Upon arrival, the place was almost empty except for a large group and a couple of tables. Not what I'm used to when going for weekend brunch in Toronto. Even so, we had to wait 30 minutes for our food because they had a large table. They're not set up to accommodate a large crowd in the kitchen (even though they have the seating for it). We asked if we could get the fruit that came with our meal while we waited the 35 minutes for our poached eggs to arrive, and the waiter assured us he'd bring something out for us. Nope! He definitely didn't bring anything to tide our hunger over; even the fruit that is supposed to come with our meal. After about half an hour, out popped our stale-looking breakfasts on hot plates. Once the food arrived it was quite mediocre. The cod cakes on my Newfoundland Breakfast were good but for some reason the entire meal was nauseating. Not sure if the hollandaise was off or something. My friend noticed the poached eggs were too watery.One of the servers seemed quite inexperienced. The other was friendly and promised to bring our fruit out (and didn't). Not the best service, waitstaff or kitchen.One of the worst brunches I've ever had. My friend and I both felt nauseous afterwards even though we had different breakfasts. Only items in common were the fruit (which seemed fine), the eggs, and the hollandaise."
