b'Since I have been to other Chart Houses, I expected more. This was the worse of all I have visited. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Lets mention the good first. The fish tank was beautiful and position of the restaurant in the Casino is excellent , close to a side entrance.  The service was good but average for this grade of restaurant.  Now the bad,  the entire restaurant is tiny and looks like an add on to what was a nice aquarium bar. Because of that, the seating is terrible, everyone is right on top of one another.  Some of the seating is right at the check out in the way of the entrance and exit of customer creeping by. The entrance is hard to find, really looks like you are going to the bar. Now the food, is C-, it would be an A if you were at McDonalds, but not for the prices they charge. The lamb chops were small and underccooked and not well seasoned.  My Chilian Sea Bass was good but small and not seasoned well. Sides were separate.  Worse yet I have often bragged of the excellent Caesar salad, hand made with anchovies at the Chart House. Well not at this one!. No anchovies, no hand made, no signature dish. There are so many excellent restaurants in Las Vegas, there is no need to drop several hundred dollars at this after thought.'
