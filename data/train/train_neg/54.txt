b"I got a French manicure and pedicure done from here a week ago. When I came home, I noticed that my heels were all scratched. Moreover, the French manicure started peeling 2 days later. When I went back to show them my nails, they said they don't guarantee regular nail paint and were least interested in attending to my concern. It would have been better if I would have not paid extra money for the French manicure and painted my nails myself. Would strongly dissuade anyone from going there for the service and attitude towards their services. A customer pays for some level of satisfaction and service which seems this place is drastically lacking!"
