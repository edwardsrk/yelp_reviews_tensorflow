b"Turns out to be just as shady as uber.  They lie about being insured just like uber, the drivers are virtually all the same nasty people who drive for uber and their surge rates are almost always on even at the slowest times of day.  I'll pay more and wait longer for a cab.  At least cabs have insurance and a live person monitoring the trip from dispatch."
