b"Wow I have been here four or five times. The first couple were a few months ago and I thought the pizza and pasta was great! I'm from Chicago and appreciated having this nearby. Well I'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. Just bad. First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok ... I ate it. The garlic bread was ... Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do... I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. When I say this stuff was not cooked I mean it was not cooked. I had to break out my toaster oven which I did not appreciate. Terrible. I guess I have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment I was hungry... 3 strikes you are out."
