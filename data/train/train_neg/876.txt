b'This car rental company out of Mccarran Airport in Las Vegas NV is a RIP OFF!!!  They purposely leave out pertinent information when you book online!  I called the day of pick up to let them know to push back my pick up time & this is when I learned that I had to have an out of state license to utilize the reservation I had already made!  Apparently the reservation was for in town use!  Who does that? Who rents a care for in town use if you own a perfectly functioning vehicle?  Why would I make a reservation as such?  Now I am fighting for a refund as they charged me right on the spot for the reservation weeks back from my actual pick up date! The website is a sham as non of this was indicated on my confirmation page!!!  Dont rent your cars from this place people not unless you enjoy being scammed & RIPPED OFF!!! :-/'
