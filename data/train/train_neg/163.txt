b"Arrived at 130pm for lunch. Seated ourselves on the patio as usual. We frequent this location. But not anymore. It's 212pm and and we have received chips and salsa, and a menu but no service. No order even after my wife went in and asked for the server. Seems the place is back to the ridiculously bad service we have had some years ago!Good luck."
