b'I used to like the pizza from here. Last time I ordered it was still doughy and I had to cook longer. Today it was ice cold. Not even lukewarm. My kid was screaming for pizza so I didn\'t send it back. But, I won\'t ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. There was a piece of "garlic bred". It was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. Yum. Should have had a can of Progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. Wait, I could have saved $35. I tipped $10. I figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. I called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. My kid ate the cold thing anyway. And who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? Blah. Next time I\'ll drive my lazy self over to Bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself.'
