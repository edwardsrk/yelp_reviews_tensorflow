b"I just don't get it.  Why is this a local favorite?  The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine.  The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues."
