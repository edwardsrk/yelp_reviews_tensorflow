b"the beer is absolutely amazing. huge selection & a good happy hour. however the food is terrible, we ordered bruschetta, expecting your typical bruschetta, it was not even close to it. we ordered a burger & a brisket sandwich. when i first got the burger, i had to pick a piece of black plastic off the the bacon/burger. i ignored that & tried it anyways, it was extremely dry & had no flavor. i asked for some ketchup, thinking that would help, my boyfriend & i both believe that ketchup was bad. it was extremely sour. i told our server/bartender & she said oh well we just filled the ketchups on monday... it was sunday. again, i looked past it & asked for a side of bbq sauce, thinking that can't be bad & that would help the dryness... i was wrong not your typical bbq sauce which i wasn't expecting, again very sour/vinaigrette taste. i finally just sent the burger back after taking 2-4 bites. my boyfriends brisket sandwich was subpar, he said. i would go back for the craft beer & to support a local place/brewery, however i will never eat there again."
