b"Where do I begin. The restaurant was clean as expected given it was their 2nd or 3rd day open. The decor is lackluster and boring. It's feels like they tried to make it high end but completely missed the mark. Cheap Chinese take out menus really throw off the experience from the get go as well. Not a place to bring a date lolSitting at the bar made things rather difficult to get a servers attention, which made ordering a hassle. The menu had like 6 food items from the kitchen and the rest was alcohol. You should study up on kinds of sushi before going in or you'll spend your 45mins trying to figure out what they have. ( yep there was a 45min limit...)The quality of fish is pretty bad, even for ayce standards. The portions were too small and by the time the item I wanted got around to me, they were all gone. ( sit on the right side of the restaurant if you don't want to leave hungry)If you want good AYCE sushi go to Yama or Kaya. If you want good conveyor belt sushi go to Sapporo. I'll try them again later this week or the following to see if they got any better. Until then, 2 stars at bestQuick update: something did not sit well with me... 1 star"
