b"The server's were all nice and smiley except one who seemed grumpy when we asked for more napkins. Everything we ordered was bland! The complimentary soup was really watered down that no one wanted to finish their bowls. The best dish was probably the garlic veggies.  The crab fried rice was the most disappointing order... The rice was so plain! Even the crab legs/claws had no taste, not even a hint of salt water taste. Would unlikely come back."
