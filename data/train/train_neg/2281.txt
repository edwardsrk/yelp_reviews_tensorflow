b"This place is not keen on customer service. When you walk in, it has the feel that the only people in there are the people that come in everyday. Everything is pretty standard as it relates to a sports-bar. Food was not bad not nothing special either. The service was slow, didn't know if they had a server for my area or even if they had areas. I have to walk up to the bar to ask for the check after waiting and my plate and beer were cleaned up. I was only asked for a drink once with no refills on the water."
