b"They will over cook your burgers unless you order them rare. The food was basic af. There's nothing special or interesting on the menu. Certainly nothing justifies the prices, other than the location. My pastrami was salty and greasy and not flavorful. The chips that came with it were vaguely stale. I would have preferred kettle chips to the house made, tbh. Save yourself. Don't eat here."
