b"First off, this review is for the intercontinental suites which is a very different hotel than the intercontinental reviewed elsewhere on Yelp.  The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  On the overpriced side, they're well over $100/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 / day, plus wireless for $10 / day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.I ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  The exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.If you're looking for a nice hotel in the area, I hear the other intercontinental is much better including an enormous workout facility.  If you find this place on the cheap and just need a place to crash, it's great for that."
