b'Never again.Yes, I know never is quite a harsh word to use.  What I should probably say is never again on my dime.I got a deal through Vegas.com - I wonder if that is why I got such a horrible room?  The room was two rooms over from the elevators and it sounded like I was on top of them!  I did not even hear that much noise when I was actually in the elevator.  It was so loud, it was hard to fall asleep at night. In addition to the elevator noise, it took about 15 minutes to get some barely warm water out of the shower.  Also, the walls are way tooooo thin.'
