b"Is there a way to give these people less than one star? How about rating the manager who tries to cover for incompetency on the part of a groomer, by telling me that they only do poodle cuts in the Happy Valley store?They have a lady groomer who doesn't know an unaltered male from a female and who doesn't know her breeds. She couldn't tell that my dog was a poodle, which was really disturbing. An hour after he was left, she called me--and also my daughter- to run two differing stories past us: My story: the dog was difficultHer story: she was overbookedWe took the dog to Petsmart and he got groomed easily; they said he was excellently behaved for a six month old puppy. We thought that the management would appreciate the feedback and made time to talk to them.The weekend manager, a male, was receptive. He probably would have called and spoken to the Petsmart groomer, but it was late in the day. He also told us the woman groomer would soon be replaced by a male counterpart.The female manager, however, sought to deflect obvious criticism from customers by telling us one of the selected stories, the one that the dog was difficult. When told that I would play the phone call about overbooking--the woman obviously didn't want to groom the dog--she told us poodles could only be groomed at the Happy Valley store, which is 45 minutes from where we live.Don't expect satisfaction from management and I am beginning to think that corporate at the lower echelons is tone deaf too!Do yourself a favor. Go to Petsmart. They don't specialize in specific breeds. They just groom dogs. And don't deal with Ceeda. She doesn't care about the customer."
