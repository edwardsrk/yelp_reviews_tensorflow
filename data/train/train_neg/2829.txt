b"TOTALLY OVERPRICED!   I live within walking distance of a Panera and wish I could be satisified with their food, but I find it way overpriced and underwhelming at best.  This time I tried a new quinoa and lentil bowl.  It cost me $9.29, consisted of a funky broth that tasted anything but real and had a few kernels of guinoa and a few lentils.  With ingredients that inexpensive, how on earth do you skimp on them.  I almost laughed out loud when they brought the bowl.  I left starving.  I think I'm spoiled by eating at mom and pop shops like Pho Nam where you get a good bowl of pho with a complex and tasty broth and more food than you can eat in one seating for $8.  This time, I left Panera and walked straight to a little mom and pop Mexican joint on Odana Road and got an awesome quesadilla for $3.50.  Was filling and flavorful - the opposite of Panera.  I've learned my lesson for good."
