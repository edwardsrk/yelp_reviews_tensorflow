b"Unfortunately this banks customer service is abismal anymore, my company has been banking with Pnc for probably 30-40 years at multiple locations and up until a few months ago we never had any issues but recently it is terrible. The tellers are rude to my employees most of the time and after an error that was their fault I spoke with the teller manager I believe her name is Brittany, who was incredibly unhelpful and rude. Now when my employees go there for daily business they aren't even greeted at the door now and the tellers are consistently unfriendly. Such a shame and difference from a few months ago when the staff was lovely and competent. Very unpleasant to do business here anymore. If you notice any positive reviews are from at least 2 years ago."
