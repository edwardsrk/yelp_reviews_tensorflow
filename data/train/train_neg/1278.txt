b"On Friday I made a very big mistake by pharmacist that are usually go to at Walmart they didn't have the pills I needed so he suggested to go to this pharmacy to get what I needed when I got there I went to see the pharmacist because the pills I needed were behind the counter the only thing that pharmacist was telling me that the painkillers I needed wouldn't work and I was insistent not to give them to me so I'llLeft the pharmacy without the pills went back to my pharmacist at Walmart and we found what I needed if you want to good service don't go to this pharmacy Jean Coutu .Walmart in LaSalle The staff is there to help you and I'm top of it everything is at least 30% cheaper plus very good service . Jean Coutu gives you very bad service specially the one on Champlain"
