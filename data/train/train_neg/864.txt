b'Though the equipment is clean, $9 a kid is way too much money for what it is.  They charge the full amount for crawling babies, which is just ridiculous.  Our baby was barely old enough to crawl (and only wanted to be held anyway). We came so the older kids could play and the owner tried to charge us for the baby (in our arms). My husband said we weren\'t going to pay for an infant who wasn\'t going to use any of the equipment, and the owner replied, "Well, if he sits down on the floor at ALL you are going to have to pay the $9 for him".  Ridiculous.  The baby, of course, never left our arms, as we knew he would.  My kids enjoy this place, but now that the prices have risen to 9 bucks a pop, we won\'t be going back.  We\'ve been officially priced out.'
