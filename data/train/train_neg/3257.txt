b"I recently had my seats shampooed to get a suitcase wheel mark off the back seat. I was quoted a 1-hour wait time since I was one of the first customers of the day. After 2 hours I walked into the garage to find out what was taking so long and I was told it would be another half hour. Once completed and everything dried I discover my dashboard, center console an all 4 doors to be cover in shampoo spots. On the passenger side of the console it looked as if the shampoo was dumped on and left to run down into the mat. It took me an additional half hour of cleaning to get the shampoo out...after the $58. The partial upside was that they got the marks out of the seat. However, they couldn't get out the spot from when I had set my bike tire on the seat.The car wash was good, but they always do a pretty terrible job wiping the inside of the windows and I always have to redo them once I'm home.I then got gas and used my fabulous Freddy's card, but what do you know!..it didn't work and I didn't get the $0.20/gallon off the price. The attendant did make a note on my receipt and told me I could bring it to the counter for my next fill up to get the discount.I'll be taking my car to Terrible's from now because it's much cheaper and I always have to re-clean my own windows anyway."
