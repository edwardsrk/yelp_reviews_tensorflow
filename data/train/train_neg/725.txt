b"Just renovated my butt. New paint and wall paper done by the cheapest bidder. Hair on the bathroom floor. Crappy service. Can't believe these guys charge a resort fee on top of hotel stay. No coffee maker. No mini fridge not even a microwave. Only thing good about this hotel is there location in front of Fremont Street. Place needs to be demolished and built from the ground up."
