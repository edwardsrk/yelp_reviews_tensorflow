b'We had breakfast at the D Grill. We were all too tired to trek to another GOOD place to eat for breakfast. Plus we had to get to our convention early.How can you mess up breakfast? I mean really? overcooked eggs, burnt coffee? Hard as rock toast and cold?My over easy eggs were fully cooked hard egg yolk inside.Our party were all smiles when we finally leftWe returned the food back 2 times and it still came back horrible.They wanted to comp us for a free breakfast for the next day. We declined, nope not again!'
