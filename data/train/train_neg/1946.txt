b"ABSOLUTE DENTAL Don't go there if you like your teeth!!!! Ann location is the worst. The manager is RUDE they cracked my tooth and wanted to blame it on decay and then they are going to ask me if the DR put a note in the file about it. ARE you kidding me. I called my insurance company and they agree that I need a second opinion and to stay away from there. Here is the topper the tooth they did pull they didn't even file a claim with my insurance company and its been over week. They are the worst no accountability, unreliable, and of course the DR calls out sick and of course instead of let me talk to the DR to verify what I'm saying you go to straight to my tooth is decayed. Here's a question why would you want to cover a tooth up if its decayed?  Ask your other DR at the location of Cheyenne? None of this makes any sense, except for bad services."
