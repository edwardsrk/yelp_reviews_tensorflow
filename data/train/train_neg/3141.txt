b"Let's start with the positive. The atmosphere was like a seen from the Sopranos which made for great people watching.  Additionally, it's always great when a restaurant has live entertainment. Unfortunately the food was terrible. I literally ate an old shoe for dinner. The prosciutto tasted like a shoe tongue. The pasta tasted like shoelaces. The mozzarella tasted like a rubber soul. I'm grateful for Prilosec OTC."
