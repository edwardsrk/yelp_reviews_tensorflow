b"I came here with high expectations, I love octopus and always order Octopus whenever I see it on the menu. The octopus tacos here are $18, it's two tacos but I must say, they are generous with their portions. They give 2 big tentacle pieces per taco, and one order is enough to fill someone up. The tacos themselves however, were not good. I felt the octopus tentacle were not very fresh. The tentacles themselves tasted burnt to me, it was not cooked well. The whole taco, and what they put in it didn't match to me as well, the whole thing just tasted like a lot of burnt. I didn't like it at all. I also got the seviche, which I thought was just ok as well, the fish didn't taste very fresh to me."
