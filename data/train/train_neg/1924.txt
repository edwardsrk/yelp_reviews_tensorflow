b'Asked if the pulled pork was spicy... (I don\'t do ANY spice with heat)  the waitress said no there is no spicy in it.  I said I don\'t want ANY spicy.  It comes and is spicy.  When told it was spicy I was told "that\'s the coleslaw in top"...really?  Lemon curd is delicious. Nice concept but will not be back. My waffles using krusty\'s are much better. and the bacon was yucky'
