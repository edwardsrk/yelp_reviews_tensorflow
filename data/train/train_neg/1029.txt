b"I have had a manicure and pedicure twice at Kelly's. They are close by and always available to take a new customer. My pedicure was well done. The manicure was not. She cut my cuticles and left hang nails but the big issue was that I  got a fungal infection from the manicure tools. She put the tools in alcohol for only about 10 seconds. I've had to go to my Dr in order to be treated. I would not recommend this salon."
