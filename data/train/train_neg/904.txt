b'Had an appointment at 3:00 and waited 45 minutes with 2 animals. Not good at all! Terrible experience, and they never acknowledge the ridiculous wait time. To make things worse I feel like I was overcharged for service that were provided. Time to find a new veterinarian. Enough is enough. Been with hight way too long (10 years) each year is getting worse no need to be treated this way.'
