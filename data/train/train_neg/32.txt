b'I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted "Speak"... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry "what the hell are you talking about?" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.Why would I ever set foot in a business who can\'t even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.Update* In response to the reply.A. Of course you are " lost why I feel that way." You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting "Speak" and reply to questions with "what the hell are you talking about"\'B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California. I ONLY asked for a specific type of bond, (because not all bond companies are able to provide this specific type of bond) and your reply was "what the hell are you talking about". After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%. I only included my experience with other bail bonds companies in my REVIEW to highlight how easy it was for me to call another business and not be treated so rudely. C. Thank you for letting me know how poor your customer service is so quickly. Made the decision to go else where easy. I write this in hopes that someone else will not get stuck with your company before they get a taste of your horrible customer service.'
