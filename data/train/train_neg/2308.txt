b"I have been here a couple of times. The massage was run of the mill. The therapist didn't really ask me many questions about my problem areas, and then despite me requesting arms, he did not massage my triceps or deltoids (?!). Also, he rushed into the clinic 10 minutes late. He gave me my full time, though. No self-care prescribed.A BIG turn off for me was the POS machine prompting for a tip. Really?? This is a multi disciplinary clinic, and you're *requesting* tips?  This seems highly unprofessional for regulated health care professionals."
