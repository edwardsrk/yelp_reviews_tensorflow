b'This place is a scammers paradise.I called AAA to have my car towed and they were supposed to take me to a car repair shop.  When the tow truck arrived (ABC Towing), the guy talked me into going a different car repair shop then the one AAA suggested.  I kept asking did he have their information and he kept saying he would give it to me  in a second.  After he had my car up on the tow truck he gave me the business card and it was for ABC auto repair....the same company as the towing company.  The tow truck driver said that they would be affordable and most likely able to repair my radiator.  And not have to be replaced.Of course, when I call to tell them what happened to my car (stupid boulders in the middle of las vegas boulevard), and that my radiator was leaking....I told them I wanted to know if they could repair it).  She said they would look at it then let me know.So she tells me that it would be $400+ for them to replace my radiator, I cant afford that. So I decide to hire a mobile mechanic (very good by the way)So I go to pick up my vehicle, and have it towed away (and of course AAA assigns them again).  They hand me this $100 diagnostic fee bill.  I told the lady i never approved a diagnostic and im not paying a diagnostic fee bill.  I told THEM what was wrong with my car - why would I turn around and pay you for telling me the same thing I told you?  I had the Nevada Bureau of Automotive Repair ready to be dialed in my phone, but she just "$0\'d" out the bill, and let me go.But someone please tell me why it took over an hour for them to tow my car to a spot I probably could have pushed my car to?  You have my car, you are the tow company, why am I waiting 1+ hours to have my car towed?Save your money and avoid this place!'
