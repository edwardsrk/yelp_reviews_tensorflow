b'This place could be great! But rushed execution and somewhat not very fresh ingredients basically render it into one of the countless fast food locations where food is just "ok". Souvlaki tastes like it was cooked a couple days ago and just reheated today - chewy and almost no flavour. Veggies are stale.'
