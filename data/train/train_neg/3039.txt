b"Don't go here with high expectations and you will be fine.  Gym is good. Primarily Prime restaurant was good.  Garden Buffett not so good. Beds hard sheets crunchy but room was clean and spacious. Valet very slow and under staffed, A lot of kids and families so very crowded.  For the lack of quality at the hotel the prices were high for food and regular drinks."
