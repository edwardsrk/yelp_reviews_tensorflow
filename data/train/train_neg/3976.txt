b'Make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when Papa Johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to Johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between HERE & THERE added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a CASH tip too.... I finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  Papa Johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm NO..... a 5 year customer has been LOST ....and Hungry Howies has gained a NEW customer !'
