b"I took my folks here last weekend for dinner on a Saturday night.  They were busy but didn't seem to be at full capacity.  The service we received was absolutely awful, and it really disappointed me.They seemed to be out of glasses, so we were served two of the four waters we requested in plastic cups.  Drinks took forever.  Everything took forever.The food, which is usually good, was cold.  Rather than arriving sizzling, my fajitas arrived dead and cold.If any of the management reads this, I assure you this is a fair review.  Terrible service  and cold food.  I will not be returning until you shape up."
