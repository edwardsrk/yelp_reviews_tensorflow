b"I can only give this company 1 star based on their disappointing costumer service. Our daughter took the Saturday class and enjoyed it. However, when it comes to scheduling the driving sessions, a total disappointment!! Let me start by saying when I initially signed up I was clear that I wanted to get all 4 driving sessions in before May 9.  I even confirmed this in an email and was of course told it would not be a Problem. But as you might assume, it was a huge problem!! The woman who schedules offers all sorts of half truths to cover for the fact that it is a joke to schedule anything. She says 3-4 weeks out to schedule. And yet she could only offer dates 6- 7 weeks out. When I asked about why it was so difficult to get in the schedule, she said it was because I live so far away.  Well when I offered to drive in to their office and have her picked up from there - Guess what?? Still no drivers available.  Additionally, because they don't have driver's schedules beyond the 7 weeks or so, I wasn't even able to get on the schedule ahead of time. Instead she told me to keep calling back on the off chance that a driver turns in his schedule. When she finally got frustrated enough with me she offered two dates. I took them, scheduled the times and everything. 1 week before the first drive I checked the website and the dates were not listed. When I called to enquirer suddenly those dates were tentative. What??? Now there was no way to get 4 drives in before May 9th.  She was pleased and quick in giving me a refund, as I could tell from her cranky attitude that she was done with me. Thank goodness. I called another driving school, and was able to get all 4 dates scheduled. About 30 dollars more and those dates weren't perfect but at least I had options and a kind person to help me. Btw, their calendar is available at least 6+ months in advance. (Not done by one lady and a pencil).  Thank you Stop and Go Driving School!"
