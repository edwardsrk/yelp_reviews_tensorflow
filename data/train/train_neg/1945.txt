b"I was kicked out of the pool here by a security guard named Richard L. because he said I was dancing in the middle concrete slab. When I told him it wasn't me, then he told me to point them out. I wouldn't point them out, and he told me I had to leave. I filed a complaint with the security supervisor and was not taken seriously. I don't plan on ever coming back here again"
