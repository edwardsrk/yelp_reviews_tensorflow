b"While the store is big, bright, and clean, it just can't compare to my beloved Dollar Tree.  I suppose 99 Cent stores excel in the availability of canned goods, so if you're into off brands, this is the place for you.  I'm not.I didn't go out of my way to get here, but dashed in while on an errand in this shopping center because I needed to buy a sympathy card.  I knew my choices would be far greater at Dollar Tree, but wasn't about to shlep further, when I knew 99 Cent sold cards (at twice the price).  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  They had Valentine cards.  They had birthday cards.  And that was is.  No wedding, shower, new baby, happy retirement, Nuttin' honey.  They also don't carry sugarless sucking candy, which I get at The Other Place, so necessary because of my oral fixation.  Otherwise I'd be on a perpetual sugar high.  Sure left a sour taste in my mouth.Just remembered while writing this that a Dollar Tree opened just a bit further, on Rainbow off Lake Mead.  Duh."
