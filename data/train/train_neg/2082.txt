b'I usually give companys a break but i truly think this company needs great improvement,  the service as far as how long it took to get a burger was very poor it took 25 to 35 minutes  after the initial 15 minutes it took just to get our server to the table to receive our food the food was ok but not really very good, my friends said they had Mexican food and it was definitely better it hot on the patio no misters .'
