b"Spent 600 dollars to have a complete show room detailing and a small scratch on the rear fender buffed out. They kept my car for two days not one as promised and was very disappointed when I finally got it back. Many excuses for why the scratch wasn't removed ( Audi paints systems are different apparently) and the inside detailing was a joke. Waste of money and more importantly time. Don't go here for scratch removal the website is deceptive. Took it back so they could address the issues and they didn't fix anything. Lots of silly excuses for why they couldn't do what they advertise."
