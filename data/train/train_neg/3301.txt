b"I originally gave hefs a great review because I enjoy their food. However, I am updating my review after my last experience there. The service was absolutely terrible. My waiter (I won't name names) inattentive and when I asked for the check I wanted 15 minutes. Still no check. I finally tracked down another server and got the check. Never seeing my server again. Then with my bill which was $10.83, I gave a $2 tip. Making the total $12.83. The payment went through on my card as $17.83. They changed the tip amount!!! I am very upset over this and the fact that an employee would change the amount I tipped."
