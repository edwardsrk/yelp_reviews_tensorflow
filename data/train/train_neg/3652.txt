b"I waited 30mins just for my pork bone soup and pancake and the food is not even average, honestly I can make better one. The servants just kept us there and didn't  even have time to get us hot tea. I rly don't understand how the 4.5 stars came. Worst experience I have with a korean restaurant. This restaurant is on my blacklist."
