b'OK, so the entrees were decent but nothing to rave about. I feel sure we could have found better Italian elsewhere. As far as the baked goods...don\'t bother. Especially if you are there in the evening. One of the staff members told me by the end of the day everything " has kinda dried out."  She wasn\'t kidding. My advice, just keep walking, many other better choices available.'
