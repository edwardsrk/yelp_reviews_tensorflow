b"I previously purchased my flooring from the Chandler/Gilbert Location.  It has held up well, so I can vouch for their laminate's quality.  However, this location is understaffed, which seems to have led to a decline in customer service.They definitely need to have more people on the sales floor, preferably equipped with excellent customer service training."
