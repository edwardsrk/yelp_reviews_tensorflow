b"I used to be a regular here. The staff are organized and the mechanics do good work, so I'm disappointed to say that I got taken for a ride.Long story short, due to ownership changes, I took the same car in for an inspection to get a safety certificate twice within a few months. Safety certs are a bit ridiculous because you're basically handing the shop a blank cheque -- no cert, no vehicle permit. For unscrupulous shops, the money isn't in the $100 cert, it's in 'finding' urgent items to repair.Conveniently, both times, they found $800 of different repairs that were needed. I'm not sure they were aware that they had very recently looked at the exact same car. I know enough about cars to know that some was legit and would have been due within a few months anyways, but some was definitely not. Prime example: They told me the driver's seat bracket was badly rusted, causing it to have loosened and wobble against to the frame. I pulled out the flashlight and didn't see rust, but it did wobble, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. So a replacement seat was installed and I got my cert. Sure enough, it still wobbles. Zero difference, except that it I was $500 poorer, and apparently this invisible rust is gone. Such an insult.This place is fine for a tire change, but if you're looking for a shop you can trust, I'm sorry to say that you'll need to keep looking."
