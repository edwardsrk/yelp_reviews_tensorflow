b"Definitely an old-school greasy-spoon. While our server was very nice, the man we paid at the front counter was rude, practically tossing our change on the counter. I was very surprised to experience such a low level of customer service in Toronto which in my opinion is known for its high standard of customer service. Food-wise, the bacon seemed pre-cooked and re-heated because it was the hardest bacon I've ever had. Toronto has WAY too many restaurants cooking great food that would value your business. Don't waste your time and money here."
