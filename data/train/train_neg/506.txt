b'Signed up for Costco bulk bottle program couple years ago- been a loyal customer.  Dealt with many invoicing and billing errors and their customer service department is terrible to deal with.   Just found out that the Costco program was discontinued and my bill is literally TWICE the discounted costco amount.  They claimed to notify customers but I never received anything.  Cancelled service - not worth the price they are charging now.  Save your money and invest in a water cooler and get your bottles elsewhere!'
