b'It\'s a clean, well-stocked store but their sale items are mislabeled which is pretty misleading, and they won\'t honor the price after you\'ve waited in line for 15 min! Nor do they bother to tell you there\'s a 40% coupon for full-price items as an alternative. I was buying picture frames today, and there were sale signs ALL over the frame department (in EVERY isle!) that read "Buy 1, Get 1 Free!", but then I was told at the register the "Home" frames weren\'t included in the sale. Huh?! What\'s the difference?! Pretty lame way to lose a customer. I had to wait in line again and, thanks to fellow shoppers who clued me in, I used the coupon. Annoying.'
