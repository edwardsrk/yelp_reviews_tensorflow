b"We scheduled an appointment for an estimate to replace 2 broken windows. They were on time. The 2 guys that showed up were extremely unprofessional.  I should not even have let them in the house. They looked like the company picked them up off the corner. No uniform no ID tags, sloppy looking. When I said they either need booties to go on the carpet or remove shoes, they weren't prepared. One had to return to truck for the booties, and the other removed shoes, no socks. While they were checking out the windows, their tools, the drill bits, were not organized and took some time to find the correct one even had to return to truck. I will not even consider them for any job that I have. I received another estimate from someone else, and the were  $220 less, and came dressed professionally."
