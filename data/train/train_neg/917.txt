b"Made us wait 30 mins before even taken Our drink orders. We were there for 2 hours in total and not because we were casually enjoying coffee. Service is absolutely terrible. Not to mention we left a pair of sunglasses on the table and immediately went back to grab them and they were gone. With the staff acting like they never saw them. Will never go back. Food is very mediocre. Was very excited to take my sister there and I'm embarrassed that's where I chose."
