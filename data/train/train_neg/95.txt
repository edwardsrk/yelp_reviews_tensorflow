b"Well even though the staff was decently nice when my fianc\xc3\xa9 and I brought in his car to check why the AC was not working and have ONLY the ac checked we were told that the cabin air filter plus numerous other maintenance items needed to be done. They said as soon as the cabin air filter was taken out the ac worked beautifully! So great you found nothing wrong with the ac just do the filter and other things! Well less than 24 hours later low and behold the ac started to malfunction... Again! We take it back to check it again and get told they never checked the rest of the ac system and now we have to buy a $300 blower motor and that is before labor! We had spent every penny we had already on the other work because we trusted that the tech did his job. Boy were we wrong. Now here we are an uber driver who now can't work because it's 115 degrees out and his ac only works sometimes. How do we pay our bills? No help, no caring, no claimed responsibility on their part and we are left with nothing. Thanks for destroying us!"
