b'I was there and was NOT impressed. A friend and I paid our 10.00 cover each and bought 1 drink (7 & Coke) another 10.00 each, did not see "LEAP FROG, TUG-A-WAR & SIMON SAYS, YOUNG GOGO BOYS" as stated told on their website. Just a dark room with loud music, a few people dancing. I have been to much better clubs in other cities, with many places to go within the club, better drink prices, and better entertainment. Very disappointed!'
