b'The last time I dined here was many years ago. I recalled it being a "decent" dining experience then, but one I wasn\'t exactly enthusiastic about repeating again during a recent visit with friends. As another poster mentioned, there is a small segment of the population who is rabidly devoted to this long time Phoenix fixture. Why? I\'m not exactly sure. My most recent experience, days ago, left me wondering how this place has managed to stay open for so long.Upon entering the dark, cavernous entrance, no one was there to greet us. It took a while before someone noticed and seated us. The dining area on this very hot afternoon, was uncomfortably warm. Not exactly a respite from the heat.Then the salsa and chips arrived. Please see the photos and other reviews on this awful concoction which appears to me to be nothing more than tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce base) with a few chili pepper seeds thrown in for good measure. This stuff absolutely comes from a can. If you ask for the "other salsa", what appears next is a watery, minced pepper mixture that is horribly bland and only slightly better than the tomato sauce salsa. I wound up eating the chips by themselves.I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style. The rice was fine, the shredded chicken abundant, but not seasoned. The enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless. All in all, highly disappointing and completely non-authentic.'
