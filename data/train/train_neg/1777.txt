b'The management of this property is horrible. It was previously managed by Mark Taylor and now by Weidner. I had no problems with previous management company but this new one cant keep a resident if they tried. The worst is the current property manager. I dont think she has an ethical bone in her body or compassion for anyone but herself. You would think they would want to retain residents year after year, instead they just run people out.They like to collect money by fining residents for just about anything you do. They also let the city into the "private" garage to ticket and tow cars. Not to mention when your car is broken into they just shrug their shoulders. I could go on and on about the issues here but im currently looking for a new place to live. Try other properties in the area they are cheaper and cant be any worse than here.PS.  THey like to avoid communicating anything about the multiple suicides that have occurred in the building or jumps from the roof!  A dead body in from of your leasing office needs to be addressed people!'
