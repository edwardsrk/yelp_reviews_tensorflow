b"The salad they serve with the pasta is just a bowl of the same kind of shredded lettuce they put on sandwiches at subway. I ordered the creamy pesto pasta which was pretty good but just barely above average. I also found a what looked like a hair baked into the garlic bread they brought me. They told me it was a bristle from the brush they use to brush the butter on the bread... still gross. I was literally the only person in the whole restaurant as well. The prices were great but the food just isn't."
