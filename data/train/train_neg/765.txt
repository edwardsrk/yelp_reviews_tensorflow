b"I'd give this a 1/2 star above the Rusty Dory if it were possible, but it's not, and Jackman Inn has done little to deserve it.  Smoky to the point of suffocation, old men wearing too much cologne, and a DJ who seems to only play the bottom half Hot 100 Billboard hits are a sample of the highlights.  It's far enough out of the way that you're unlikely to see too many new faces from week to week.  For what it is--a neighborhood bar to get local yinzers drunk--I guess it works.  Best beer on tap is Yuengling."
