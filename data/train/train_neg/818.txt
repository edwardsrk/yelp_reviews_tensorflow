b'The food is ok but the service is questionnable every time. Tonight sealed the deal and I will not be going back there anymore.  When we walked in, the hostess told us there were three parties ahead of us. When it was our turn to be seated, she passed us up and seated a couple that had just walked in (who appeared to be her friends).The owner should consider hiring someone who has experience running a restaurant because as it stands, this place is unprofessional and the service is horrible.'
