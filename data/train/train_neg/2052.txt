b"Well, I've been to lots of Ardene locations but this one is my least favorite. Still cheap, but not as cheap as locations further north and I found the store to be small and cramped. They still have some really neat stuff and the staff was friendly , but it's the first time I've walked out of an Ardene's empty handed. Sorry, this location just isn't for me."
