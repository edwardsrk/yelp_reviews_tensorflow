b"I am not a fan of this location. I'd rate the location at Town Square at about a four after many visits, but my visits to this location have amounted to a two star. Maybe I'm in the minority here because their parking lot is jam packed every time I drive by here. I'm thinking the appeal may be strictly related to alcohol and TV. The food I've had here just hasn't been good, mediocre at best. I wouldn't say the food on the standard menu is expensive, but it's overpriced for the quality. On one of my visits I came here for Happy Hour with coworkers and the food for that was acceptable, but not great. It was cheap at least. This spot just isn't my type of place. I'm more of a Yard House gal if I'm going to a sports bar."
