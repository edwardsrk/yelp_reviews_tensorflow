b"What in the world is going on here. Friday night busy crowd and only 1 worker in entire store.  Took forever to get our order and it was burnt because she was trying to do cash and cook.  Never washed her hands after touching the money.  I feel bad for her she was trying her best but the management is at fault here.  She had so many orders she had to complete she wasn't even able to take new orders for over 15 mins; customers were just sitting and waiting for her to be free again.  On the plus side the worker was friendly and tried her best to serve you.  On to the food, nothing much to rave about, got the Chicken/Beef mixed Boss box and it was mostly salad and lack of meat. It could be she was running out so she made the portion smaller.  Not too impress with the meat quality so it was dry and rubbery for the beef.  Chicken was decent but they ran out so I only got a few pieces."
