b"The pros...the menu is unique and portions are large.The cons...the hostess and seating crew were a mess. The wait was nearly an hour, despite the 20 minute they suggested it would be. The people around us eating ... were complaining about being cold/not correct/etc. Management came to a couple tables to check on things. Seemed a little unorganized.  Final result: If you have a lot of time and patience...try the chicken pot pie. Its enormous and quite good. I didn't see why all the hype however."
