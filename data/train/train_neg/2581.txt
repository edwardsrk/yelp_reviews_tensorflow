b'Came here with my husband, BFF, and her boyfriend... It was crowded. The wait that was "30 minutes" ended up being an hour at least. And no one mentioned that it would be longer or anything like I don\'t know ... maybe something that would be the job of the hostess?  The employees here seem a bit... cardboard and detached from reality. Me and my best friend sat at the bar to wait (glad we did with the ridiculous wait) and the bartender never came around to ask if we wanted a drink.  My friend\'s boyfriend had to go all the way down to the other side to order a drink though the bartenders machine that he was staying at was right in front of us. The "loaded fries" were skinny tasteless luke warm fries with sour cream lightly drizzled on top of them with a dash of bacon and a pinch of chives... on top of some nasty cheese sauce that tastes like it came out of a can. Does that sound loaded to you? The burger was pink even though we asked for no pink. I found the burger to be vastly overrated and quite mediocre. Especially for the price. The egg was gooey tasting on our breakfast burger and the patty had no flavor but was juicy. The bacon added no flavor either but a slight crunch though the burger turns into a gooey, sloppy mess half way through. The bun was also basic considering the attempt of the establishment to appear \'high end\'. And everything is \'a la carte\' a fancy way of saying you are going to have to pay $7 for chintsy  "loaded" fries (because they don\'t serve fries with their $10 plus burgers) and $12.50 for the burger. The server was also not friendly and everyone who worked there had that aura of trying too hard which is never appealing. I won\'t go back here- this experience just sealed the deal.'
