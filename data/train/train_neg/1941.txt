b'There is nothing Armenian about this restaurant unless you consider Arabic food to be Armenian. Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it. As for the Arabic ( yes Arabic) food they served us, nothing special about it. Shawarma plate was tasteless, falafel was eh, barbecue was terrible. Will never be going back here again.'
