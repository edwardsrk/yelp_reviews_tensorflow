b"Sushi is really good service sucks. So the first night it was busy they were short staffed we waited over an hour for some one to even check on us after we ordered. We waited 90 minutes to get 1 set of sushi and another 30 for the second set. Both were ordered at the same time. I didn't post a review because I thought it was just that they were short staffed and really busy. So my husband and I gave it a second chance. It was the same and still not as busy. We waited over an hour for food and no one ever came to give us a refill on our drinks. My drink was empty for over 45 minutes and not one of the staff including the owner  ever stopped. I had to track the server down to get a check. We will not be returning which is sad because the food is good but service is horrible."
