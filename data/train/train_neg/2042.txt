b"My sister got married here tonight. I'll start by staying that the venue is gorgeous. There is not a lot of parking so just plan on that. I am giving this place a one star simply because the owner Betty was terrible. She was cold and unkind. At 8pm when the part still had one hour, she started going table to table dumping out drinks and cleaning up. It Made the guests uncomfortable and my sister (the bride) felt anxious and started cleaning up and asking others to do the same. I thought that was unprofessional. She was also drunk and smelled strongly of alcohol. Not that I care if you're drinking but perhaps that altered her mood."
