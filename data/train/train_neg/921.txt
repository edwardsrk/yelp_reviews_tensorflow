b"I commented on how slow the service was last August. We went last night on Taco Tuesday to meet up with friends. We were seated at 6:25pm. We left at 6:40pm after no one stopped by our table to take our drink order. Servers visited all 3 tables around us and no one seemed to notice or care. There's no excuse for servers not knowing their sections."
