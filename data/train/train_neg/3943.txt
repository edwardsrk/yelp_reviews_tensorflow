b'Went here after realizing that Kangchen is closed on Mondays, and was curious to try the "new" Indian restaurant for their lunch buffet.  Bottom line is that there\'s nothing new here that you won\'t find at any other buffet in town, and although it\'s a self-perpetuating problem, the lack of customers meant that the food was mostly sitting out rather than being refreshed and looked old and was not terribly warm.  So... is it bad?  No.  Would choose to go here for lunch buffet again?  No.'
