b"Didn't have a good experience with this restaurant.. The service was slow, the tables are too close to each other, and most importantly the food was horrible. My steak was undercooked and the waitress took it back TWICE until it got the way I ordered it which was well-done!! We waited more than 30 mins to get a table and after that another hour and a half to get our food!! Never going back againThe only good side was that the fact that they removed my order from the total bill.."
