b"Bad service, reeeally slow chefs. We were the first guests in the restaurant, and after an hour or waiting for sushi/sashimi, the waitress told us they hadn't even started our order! When did 'sushi making' start takin so long???  We told them to cancel our order and bounced. Don't even know what the food quality is like but I can't wait an hour to find out.  There are better Japanese restaurants in Henderson if you're willing to drive out of the hotel."
