b"We got great service but horrible, overpriced food. My steak was cold, my salad somehow wasn't cut up whatsoever so I had to deal with huge pieces of lettuce. My friends burger was salty and the cocktail that I got was disgusting. It's a cool enough venue but I'd redo the menu because there's so much potential. Also who only has one dessert? Like we could choose from baked Alaska to a scoop of ice cream- are you kidding me?"
