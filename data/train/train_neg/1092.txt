b"I just got back from an appointment there which never actually happened because they wanted $600 from me for an ultrasound, all of which have been covered 100% by my insurance and this place is listed as IN-NETWORK.  I called the insurance company and they informed me that it is not normal OR APPROPRIATE for the doctor's office to ask for a payment like this based on an ESTIMATE only.  The insurance company then called the billing department to check with them, and the billing department said that this is an estimate only and they do not ask for the payment up front.  I called back to let them know that I no longer would like to go to their office for services and the billing department argued with me and said that it is their policy to collect payment up front.  Sound fishy to you?? If you have gotten referred to Valley Perinatal, ask for a different referral.  They have shady and borderline FRAUDULENT business practices."
