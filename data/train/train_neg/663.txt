b"Yet another restaurant that makes you valet your car.  We parked in the large, mostly empty parking lot ajacent to the restaurant.  As we approached the front door, the valet guy tells us we will be towed if we leave our car there.  Ok, back to the car, to find a restaurant with parking.  As we were leaving, I did see some street parking but by then I was not in the mood for The Clever Koi.  Sorry, lost a customer, won't be back."
