b"I ate here a couple weekends ago while staying at HR, and had heard lots of good stuff about it. Maybe Im weird... but this place was awful.Soup was cold, tacos were soggy, hot sauce was watery. Gross.Even the coffee was shit.The service was horrible too.. Waitress was slow, forgot a bunch of stuff, never brought us silverware, or refilled water.I didnt have any alcohol here, but the food was shit, and I wont go back. I'd rather wait in a line for something else."
