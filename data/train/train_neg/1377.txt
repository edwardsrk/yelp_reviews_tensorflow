b'New image nail salon should rename themselves rushed low quality nail salon. This was my first time here. I came in with high expectations based on reviews from other Yelp users. Not sure if this was a one-off occurrence but my experience can best be summed up as terrible at best. When I arrived for my appointment on a Sunday, the owner (Wendy) was pre-occupied sorting out staffing issues, as apparently one of the girls working that day was not feeling well and had to go home. I waited probably 20 minutes before Wendy finished sorting out staffing issues and started on my nails. Everything was extremely rushed as she was the only one working on a Sunday. Even during the manicure her mind was elsewhere - constantly having to stop to pick up the phone, attending 2 other customers who were waiting the entire time I was getting my manicure. The end result, not surprisingly, was bleeding cuticles and botched, uneven coat, and poorly shaped nails. I let her know that one of my nails top coat created a drop that protruded from the polish,  and instead of filing it down and starting over she hastily filed it and applied another coat...what a joke.  To make the experience even worse, I observed the girl who was there before me come back to complain how her nails were ruined bc they had let her go before it was dry, goes to show quality is a clearly lacking aspect here. So in conclusion, the owner needs to figure out her staffing issues, focus on quality (which is quite lacking), and be less greedy (meaning not accepting more customers on the day when you don\'t have the capacity). I for one will never come back here again. P.S. Be wary, for some reason all of the negative reviews are hidden under "Not recommended" section of Yelp resulting in an inflated rating.'
