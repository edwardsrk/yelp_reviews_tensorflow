b"Mehhhhh....My dad wanted to come here because he saw the hand pulled noodles.  I must say I was excited initially because I feel like hand pulled noodles are kind of being forgotten and seldom used by restaurants.I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.My parents both got the seafood noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  I got the Zha Jiang Mein noodles with hand pulled noodles as well.  So I'll start with the semi positive, the broth was nice, clean, tasty.  Oh and the vegetables in my noodles were tasty too.  Now the bad, the huge shrimps and scallops were nice to see, but they were overcooked, a bit rubbery.  I mean they weren't super overcooked, but a bit over.  And paying what, like $16 bucks for it, the seafood better be cooked well, dang it! The Zha Jiang Mein noodles were SUPER SALTY, gah, I could barely eat it so I took a bit of the seafood broth in the noodles. Ahh, much better.It is WAY too expensive, WAY too expensive, but then again, it is Vegas.  But I just feel like Asian food should between $5-15  ($15 is on the expensive side and I'm NOT talking about Panda Express) Sighh...I was just disappointed, verryy disappointed.I don't recommend you come here, don't LET the hand pulled noodles DRAW you in, IT'S A TRAP!"
