b"2nd time here, 2nd time a disappointment!  I like my steaks medium well and both times I get steaks cooked well done that are like shoe leather.  Really?  A steak joint that doesn't know how to cook steak?  Yep!I also ordered a 16 ounce and think I was short changed a few ounces.Service was good but when I complained about the above and showed the manager the over cooked steak, I am not sure she cared.I won't be back."
