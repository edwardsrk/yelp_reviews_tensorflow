b'We went here for soup, on a day when neither of us were feeling well. We ordered one chicken noodle and one loaded baked potato soup in bread bowls. We felt like it was a little less than a small cup of soup in each because none of the bread had been carved out. It was as if soup had just been poured on top of the bread minus the top which had been cut off. Other than the quantity issue the soups themselves were okay, but the chicken noodle seemed no better than something bought in the grocery store.'
