b"I'm loathe to have my first review be a bad one, but I feel sort of compelled to write this review.On a lovely holiday Monday, after some frisbee in the park, some friends and I decided we needed some food.  The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  Well, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.Now, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  First we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  The good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.Needless to say we won't go back.  There are too many awesome restaurants and patios to waste any more time there.  We did enjoy the beautiful sunshine though : )"
