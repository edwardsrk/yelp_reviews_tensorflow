b'One Star because I can\'t give it negative stars. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This was the worst "experience" of my life. Disorganized. Pathatic. No one knew what The hell was going on. Half the electronic features weren\'t working. 3 VIP tickets and gave us nothing extra. Weak ass "hands-on activities". Wish I would\'ve have listened to the guy in ticket line telling all of us not to do it and get money back. Marvel should be ASHAMED to have their name on something so amateur and embarrassing. Save your money. Buy an action figure and play at home.'
