b"I really enjoy Thai food and after two weird carry out orders from here I'm calling it quits on malees. I really like Thai noodles and have gotten drunken noodles many places, but malees is the only one that uses overcooked, gummy, skinny egg noodles with hardly any sauce and raw chopped tomatoes (and no other vegetables, unless you count limp bean sprouts). I will suck it up and deal with the bad service at the place around the corner before coming back."
