b"I've been here 2-3 times now and the only reason I would go back is because they carried Donna Salazar papers that I haven't found anywhere else. Their clearance really is all the junk no one wants. The clearance at other stores at least normally has a few good finds, but not here. Sadly, I had the same experience with employees that many other people had. They would be off in areas that customers are obviously not supposed to be in. I like to be generally left alone when shopping, but appreciate a greeting and being asked at least once if I am looking for anything in particular. Everything was at Full MSRP and a lot of what they offered was old school scrapbooking that I'm totally not into. You guys badly need to get some products from the cutting edge scrapbooking companies."
