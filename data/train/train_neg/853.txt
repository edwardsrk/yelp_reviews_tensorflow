b"Just left this place. This is my forth time coming here around 9pm-12am since I live around here. There is an African American lady who I think is the manager at this time, and she is rude. I got to the drive thru most times and she always claim that almost every beverage machine is broken, besides the fountain drinks. EVERYTIME!!! Never fails. She only says that because she is too lazy to turn on the other machines, also when I got my burgers, they weren't wrapped. They were poorly thrown in the bag with the wrappers on top of them. WTF?!"
