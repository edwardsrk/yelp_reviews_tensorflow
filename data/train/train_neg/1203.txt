b"British Air is a joke! Our flight from Phx to LHR onto AMS was cancelled due to birds damaging the jet engine. Took us HOURS in ticketing line to try and rebook. That entire process was very frustrating and chaotic. I finally called and after holding for 40 mins I was able to book 2 seats for the following night. They did provide hotel and meal vouchers.The seats on the plane were increibly tight. I am average size and could not lean down to reach my carry on nor could I rest my head on the tray because the seat in front prevented it. It was an incredibly uncomfortable 10 hour flight.Due to the cancellation of this flight, we were charged $120 by the AMS hotel as a NO SHOW even through no fault of our own. We have been trying to reach BA since early January '14 by phone to discuss a refund for that $120 charge.  NO ONE answers the phones.  In desperation and frustration we left a voicemail.  STILL WAITING for a callback.On our return to Phx, we were unable to do the online check-in 24 hrs prior to departure.  We called ticketing in AMS and they were not only unable to tell us why we could not access the online check-in but they were unable to provide seat assignments.  We were told to go to the ticketing agent at the AMS airport.With the seating arrangements on the initial flight still fresh in our minds, getting back onto a BA plane was not something we looked forward to.In the past. We have flown KLM and we will definitely give our business to them.Thoroughly disgusted."
