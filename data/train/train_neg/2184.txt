b"Nice resort. Room internet was way to slow. I'd have to go to lobby to get access to Internet. Food was ok. Chuck the bell caption was rude and short when approached. Both times I'd have to walk behind the counter to get his attention. The hotel grounds are nice but the Service was bad. I can't see myself coming back to this place."
