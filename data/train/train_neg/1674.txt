b"The 2 hostess' was very unorganized and couldn't keep track of the people in line and when to bring more people back. We watched 2 other couples go in front of us who came after us. When we asked about it they didn't remember we were even waiting. They weren't writing down names to keep track either. Once we finally got sat, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us. We were ready to order our drinks and food by the time she got there. We got fish and steak tacos and they were ok, nothing special. Steak tacos were too spicy and the fish tacos were just bland. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that you don't get tortilla chips brought to your table either, you had to pay extra for them. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time going here."
