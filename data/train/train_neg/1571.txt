b'I\'m not usually one to write bad reviews, I honestly don\'t often review things but I had to with this one. I used to come here often, every time I needed to go grocery shopping I went to this store. It used to be so much better. When they check you out the staff often doesn\'t even greet you, not even a "hello" or ask me if I want paper or plastic, they just go automatically for plastic. The produce sucks, nothing is fresh. Bought spoiled chicken the other day. If you need a refund or special help you\'ll stand at the counter for a good 10-15 minutes before they even acknowledge you. I just joked with my friend that they don\'t have bad customer service, they just don\'t service you. I go to Hyvee  now: friendly service, fresh produce. So much better.'
