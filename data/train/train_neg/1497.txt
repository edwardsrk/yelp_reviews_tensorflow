b"Food is okay, service isn't so great. I ordered a 5 course meal and left still hungry.  In addition, my bill was $105 total and still hungry.  Waitress forgot about me so after waiting nearly an hour to pay, I had to walk my money up to the kitchen door to finish paying/transaction.  Waffle House service at a premium price."
