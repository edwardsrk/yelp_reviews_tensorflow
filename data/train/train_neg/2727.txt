b'The service here is seriously lacking. Despite there being no lineup andmany tables available, We stood at the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us, and when they did, it seemed like it was a problem.  My boyfriend commented they act like they dont want customers.The food was nothing to write home about,  but it filled us up.  The mango smoothie was the best part.'
