b"The best way to describe the food at Nirvana II is that it tastes like disappointment.Located in the bottom of 3 Wells Fargo, there's a line out the door to this carry-out only restaurant most days. I love Indian food, so I've attempted lunch from this location twice. The second time was only after I suitably convinced myself the first meal wasn't as big of a disaster as I remembered. I was wrong.They don't serve authentic naan, you just get flimsy pita bread wedges. Their version of Chicken Tikka Masala is a gritty, brownish curry mixture that doesn't resemble a quality version of the dish in any way. The chicken may have bones, or it may not, it's really a surprise by the day.I've tried another dish -  chana masala from here, and it tasted the same. (Fortunately no bones!) Flavors are just muddy.Both times I've eaten here, I've tossed my lunch out half-eaten before finishing it. I don't understand why this restaurant is popular. How hard can it be to do Indian carryout right?"
