b"Where to begin?  They said a hand wash and hand wax would take 30-45 min.  So it took over an hour.    And it was still dirty.   Water spots all over.  Under tailgate never cleaned.  Cup holders dirty. Mays not cleaned.  And then fresh new dirty fingertips on leather seats    And when I told the owner I don't have time for them to fix it and not paying because they didn't give the service promised.  The owner said don't pay and never come back.  That was the response    Go hear if u want 60-70% clean for cheap prices.  Or go somewhere else that has integrity and people skills"
