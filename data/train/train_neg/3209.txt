b'Once a month I go through this awesome experience: "Let\'s go to old town"Me: Ahhh fucking Christ [anxiety starts kicking in as I picture crowds of douche bags, annoying people everywhere, struggles with cabs, girls attempting to walk in heels that look like they are fucking handicapped, and a guaranteed $100 if not $200 spend], where are we going?""Let\'s go to Kelly\'s"Me: "FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"The only word to describe this bar is: bland.  They have a solid piece of real estate, and a nice little setup, but apart from that this place blows.Drinks? OverpricedService? SlowFood? ShittyCrowds? YESWhy the fuck do people come here?  Kelly\'s is packed with a bunch of people who don\'t really know or like each other, people who aren\'t really good friends.  Friends have stuff in common, so they can agree on a certain bar. No one wants to go to Kelly\'s, it\'s just the only place left to go when you and a group of 8 idiots can\'t agree on a place.  Don\'t believe me? Read all the reviews on here and see how many of them say: "Me and 26 of my *closest* friends decided to meet here" or something to that effect.Newsflash: You shouldn\'t be in a fucking group that big, that\'s why this place is packed.  Girls night groups of 10 wander around waiting to get molested while even more single dudes pretending to be respectable huddle around with their dicks in their hands.Go here on a Sunday afternoon. I\'ve done it, and it was decent. You\'ll have the place to yourself and everything I\'ve said above won\'t really apply, except for this shit prices of course.However, if it\'s a weekend (let\'s face it: it is) you\'ll get more bang for your buck standing in line at a port-a-potty than standing in a line to get into this joke.'
