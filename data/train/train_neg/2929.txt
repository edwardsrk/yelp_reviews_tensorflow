b"I had the more expensive membership for about a year and I never really used the benefits that came with it so I decided to downgrade to the most basic membership. I was told but they're front fest staff that I would need to come in when their GM was working because he is the only one who knows how to do it. I work and go to school full time so I have to plan my schedule around their GM hahah what a joke. Just be prepared to be charged a $30 down grade fee. No matter what time you go it's always packed! Even at 11 PM you're gonna be waiting for equipment. Also, it's annoying how the staff checking you in will ask if you have a towel. But only sometimes and those times when I was asked the person before and after me were not asked. If you don't have your towel they make you pay a $1 fee to purchase one. Honestly it's not a big deal to bring a towel it's just annoying when they are not consistent with a policy.Only giving two stars for the convenience of the location and hours. The classes are fun too but that's about it."
