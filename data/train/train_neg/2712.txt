b"Service is not one of their strong points, but the food is..If you love Korean food, you're going to like this place, but for any owners of the all you can eat concept restaurants, you can take notes on how to clear out your patrons from Woo Che.    Just seat the patrons, bring them their drinks, and leave them alone the entire visit, and don't ever check on them.     I couldn't find my waitress for a refill, and was dying for anything that looked like a liquid by the second plate.I really don't like their square grilles, because it didn't get a even heat on it, but the bugogi was good, and  they could cut the beef brisket slightly thicker, because most of it sticks to the grill.Why I'm giving this place a two star rating is due to the claim by the host that they won't accept Yelp deals for lunch, and can only be use during dinner.     There is no mention of this on Yelp deal."
