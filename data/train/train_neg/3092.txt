b"I'm annoyed that our waitress was so uninterested because otherwise I'd give a higher rating. The sushi was really good. My fiend ordered a chicken entree and asked for no veggies and a substitute for a side but he got it as listed on the menu. Drinks were good. Took at-least 5 minutes for a waitress to greet us."
