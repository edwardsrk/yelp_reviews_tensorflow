b"I have a friend who loves this place, and goes a couple of times a week, but I don't understand the hype.  For the price of a sub-par salad, I could make three salads with all the trimmings without ever sensing the presence of a sneeze guard.  My wife and I both had the Cuban panini, I ordered mine without pickles (which, of course, had the damn pickles on it) and we both were unimpressed with the fillings (though the bread was good).  Later, indigestion was the only sign that we had been there, haunting me through the next morning.  If you want a salad, make a salad, and spare yourself."
