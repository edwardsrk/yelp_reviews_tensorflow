b'Went excited to try trivia with some friends. Got there an hour early, and tables and bar were full. It took 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge my existence. Finally the bartender did, and when we asked about trivia we were told "Well everyone here is waiting for trivia so it looks like you\'re out of luck." Walked out. Will never return after service like that.'
