b"I had a really bad experience with the fillings I had this Wednesday. My appointment was at 3:40pm I didn't get called in until around 4:00pm and the dentist didn't come in until 10 minutes after. That wasn't the bad part. The bad part is  I didn't really have issues with the 2 tooth that they suggest I get a refill for (#30, 31). I was eating fine, didn't really notice any chipping and I was able to eat food much better than my other side that had crowns on. But I decided to trust their judgment and it was a big mistake.  After he drilled the hole and put in the filling, he filled it down and his drill (or whatever tool that dentist use) touched my top tooth on my upper jaw. If you're working on my bottom tooth why is your drill touching my upper tooth? I tried to open my mouth wider so it won't happen again, but it HAPPENED AGAIN! Now I can feel and see an indent on my top tooth. I feel like he did it on purpose so I would come back to and fix the top tooth and get more insurance money out of me. But after going through all of that unnecessary procedure my teeth are not any better, it's super sensitive now and I can't eat anything hard or crunchy. The filling on one tooth even looks lopsided. It looks like he filled down too much on one end.  Now it really looks like it's chipped. Trust your gut, don't always go with your dentist recommendations if you feel like you don't need it. I've been going to for a few years now but after this, I'll be looking for a new dentist.Updates:The dentist called after he saw the review and explained that the reason why he filled my top tooth was because it's a canine tooth and he filled it down to fit my bite line. But I thought #30 and 31 is a molar, not a canine tooth.  If that was the case, I would have been nice if he told me before he did it because I was very worried. He did offer to fix it at no charge. I was waiting to see if the tooth will settle and it has been a week and my bite is still sensitive."
