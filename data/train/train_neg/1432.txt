b'Totally rudeee the lady who answered the phone didn\'t say thank you for calling frenzy how can I assist you, she just answers the phone saying "hello" in a harsh Tone. I then asked her is this frenzy?? She says yes, I said OK where are you guys located and she says in Las Vegas. Rather then her giving me the actual address that is what she  answered. She Saw an out of town number and obviously thought that I wasn\'t in town... she then says I\'m placing you on hold, so I told her don\'t bother!! Her service was completely rude and very unprofessional. If you were trying to run a boutique and actually get sales I think your customer service skills need to be highly corrected. Service in Las Vegas sucks!!!'
