b"Upon entering the office you notice the chairs are broken & the office is older. The front staff is rude & unfriendly. They don't acknowledge the patients as they sign in. The back staff is kind & dr. Gardner is ok and the examine rooms is a bit outdated. They really need a full revamp of the office & possibly a whole crew of front office staff!!! I'll definitely be looking for another doctors office"
