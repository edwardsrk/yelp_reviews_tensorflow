b"Pros: coffee is absolutely amazing Cons: service is terrible with hipster attitude, like they don't even want to serve you.  Watched a cockroaches climb all over the counter where the espresso machine is, if that's during the day, can't imagine what's it's like at night . Employee was very Blaise about it. Oh, came up from the basement. Their ordering system from the baked goods is whack. More often nothing available and then only really stocked for sat and Sunday. Honestly, the cockroaches were gross but it's a restaurant but the service is terrible.  Never a smile, kind of grumpy ."
