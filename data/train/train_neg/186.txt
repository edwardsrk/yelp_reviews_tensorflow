b'Needed some batteries replaced for a couple watches and I live close so I walked down. I showed up 5:20 (40 minutes before closing tim)e. Their open sign was on but the door was locked with a sign on it that read "Out to lunch. Back at 5:30." I thought that was weird to take a lunch right before closing time, but it was only a 10 minute wait, so not really a big deal. I waited until 5:55 and no one ever showed up. A few other people also came by but, just like me, were unable to get service. One of the people said they came by much earlier and said the same sign was up then too. Can\'t be good for a small business to turn away so many customers.'
