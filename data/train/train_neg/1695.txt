b'Very bad service. The girl at reception desk is confused and lazy.  The waitress was very rude and acted as if she owned the place. She gave us wrong info about their specials. She did not know the menu! The place is VERY old and did not look like it was updated in years however it does have a nice view. Workers do not smile. The salad was not fresh. It was kinda soggy and tasteless. $2 extra for some blue cheese on my salad ?!! The steak and lamb chops tasted good. The food is definitely overpriced. Overall, i do not recommend this restaurant.'
