b'Bad Contact phone Number! Both on the Receipt and listed online,so no other way to contact this Store.They screwed up my order and we wound up throwing half of it away. I would have called the store to make them aware,but again Bad Phone Number.The number printed on their receipt sounds like an "Old School" Fax machine pinging away!It\'s 106* outside and I don\'t want to drive back down there in 5:00 Traffic.I hope the Owner/Manager actually reads this and updates their Contact info!'
