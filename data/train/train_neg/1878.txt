b"I have to say I have never been met with such awful customer service ever. When I called to schedule an appointment for a groupon that I had purchased not only did they tell me basically I was lying about it and that it didn't exist. Instead of being polite and trying to book a service at a discount that I would have gladly paid for I was met with rude responses. So basically thanks for turning away a potential customer. That's not a good way to run a business. I would give 0 stars. Yet that's not an option"
