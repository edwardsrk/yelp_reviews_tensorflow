b'I don\'t even know where to begin...We had been here before and the first time around the food was amazing! Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how we had requested so we were excited to be back. We live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. We walked into this restaurant around 9pm for dinner with my parents and grandparents. We ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani, Chicken tikka masala, Tandoori chicken, a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It\'s really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so we always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived it was bland, and I mean like completely bland to the point where we were drowning it in mint chutney. We asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. It was bland! We asked the server whether he had changed the spice level in the kitchen and we didn\'t quite get a clear answer. My grandmother tasted the Dal and she almost spit it back out on her plate and stated that it tasted old like it had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and it was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and my dad told him that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the dal and make it spicier. We quietly finished our "dinner" and made it very clear to the server that we wouldn\'t be back he didn\'t seem to care. My grandfather hated it so much that he actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would\'ve been a better dinner. Needless to say I wouldn\'t return to this place ever again. If you\'re looking for good, fresh Indian food I suggest Taj Palace on Eastern and Richmar.'
