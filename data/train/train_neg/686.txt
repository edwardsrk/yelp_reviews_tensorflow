b'I wish I could give 0 stars. Came back for happy hour again and this time the service was god awful! Someone sent me a "compliment" saying the pull their tips together bunny I\'m a server and I know how that works but you\'d think 3 servers and 2 hostesses would be able to get me water without having to wait 10 mins bf the another 20 before I ever see the server again. NEVER COMING BACK!'
