b"The quality of food been going down hill in the last few months.  I ordered the lettuce wraps and a chicken dish take out.  When I got home the lettuce was slimy and soft.  I ended up throwing it away and ate the meat portion by itself.  The previous time I ordered lettuce wraps\xe2\x80\x8b, the lettuce we're too small to wrap the meat in.  Also the entries seems to have more rice and less meat.  Like I said earlier, quality is get worst.   I'll give Pei Wei another chance in a year, that will give the chain chance to fire the cooks or whomever prepares the lettuce.  Maybe management will change also."
