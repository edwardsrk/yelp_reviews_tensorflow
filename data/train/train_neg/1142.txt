b'Absolutely worst customer service I have ever seen it any fast food location. Apparently has never heard of the word please or thank you. When told so order was abruptly stopped with "just a minute". Once I finished ordering was told to "pull forward" very rudely. Maybe she was having a bad day but that\'s still no way to talk to customers. Will not be visiting this establishment again!Part 2: after getting home and opening up the box of chicken, was once again disappointed. The chicken was soggy and dripping oil. If no stars was an option, they would have zero!'
