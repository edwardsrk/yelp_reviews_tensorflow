b'Walked in here on a Sat evening and saw a pretty packed house. Great vibes, loved the interior, and hostess was quick to find us a place to sit. Once we sat down, we realized this was a really trendy place. Honestly the menu was hard to understand and nothing really stood out. Waiter barely knew English so we had to repeatedly ask twice for the same thing. Overall portions are quite small but tasty. This is a place more for starters and to have a beer. Would not recommend this place for dinner.'
