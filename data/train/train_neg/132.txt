b"Frightful experience. The front staff was very unhelpful and gave me the wrong results and when I pointed out that I was given the results for the wrong hip, they gave me the run around and insisted they had done the reading on the correct side.  Absolutely no concern for the patient and told me to drag myself over to my primary care and have them sort it out.  My primary care doctor was appalled and promptly had the receptionist call them to insist they re-process the results on the correct hip STAT!  If you have any work done at this place, make sure you double check the results. Good thing they're not surgeons - gulp!"
