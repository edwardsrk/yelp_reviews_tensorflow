b'I went to the Fragrance department to pick up a bottle of Versace cologne and the sales lady rang my $50 gift card up as 50 cents. She couldn\'t back out of the charge on one computer, so then we went to another one, where she couldn\'t get the gift card to go back to the original amount. She called someone on the phone and when she got off she said, "They said our system is down and you\'ll have to wait for 30 minutes." She asked if I had other shopping to do and I indicated that I didn\'t. My son and I then had to walk around the mall for 30 minutes, with other errands to run that day. When I returned, the card went through. NEVER did this employee take responsibility for her error, and NEVER did she once apologize for the inconvenience! If she had only done that, I would not be writing this review. Pathetic customer service, especially when I am buying an $82 bottle of cologne!'
