b"This was our first and last time here. We made reservations. We had to wait fifteen min to be seated. Another 20 for drinks. We were there for tapoyaki. There was children running and screaming between the table.  My favorite part of dinner was the soup. The salad dressing was gross. Almost looked half frozen So I didn't touch it. The sauces were not good and very watery.  The fried rice was not flavorful. The shrimp was good. The calamari was over cooked and chewy. The chicken was so over done even the sauce didn't help it.  Also didn't eat it.  The onions were undercooked."
