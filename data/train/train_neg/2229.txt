b'I went to the restaurant I order the "Rib Dinner" through the drive through. The ribs were over cooked had a burnt taste, and the ribs was very salty. The "Rib Dinner" comes with 1/2 slab of ribs and Texas Toast and choice of 2 sides. I had chosen the coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy. The coleslaw had no flavor, not sweet like coleslaw supposed to taste. However the mash potatoes and gravy was okay.  I ended up throwing the Whole $15 "Rib Dinner" away. This is my opinion and first experience with the restaurant food.'
