b"So disappointed in the service. They have teenagers running the shop. When I went in to look for a cake for my husband and they had no suggestions.  When I asked to sample the cake I wanted to purchase she told me they could not. How do you expect to have customers spend 40 bucks on a cake but can not sample it. I'll stick with kreative cupcakes from now on!!!"
