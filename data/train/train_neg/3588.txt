b"We've been to the Tempe location twice before, long time ago, and we loved their food. However, today's take out was a disappointment. The curry dish was RELATIVELY good (though it had few veggies in it), but the spicy rice noodles were very not good. They tasted somewhat old and lacked flavor, and there were 4 pieces of broccoli, a few pieces of meat, and 3 slices of carrot. This made me not want to come back to this location any more. I'm sorry, I don't like leaving a bad review, but it is not alright to serve something like this to customers."
