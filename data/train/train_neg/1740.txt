b'I have never written a poor review in my life, but I felt compelled to say something. During my time of service, everything was great. Water was delivered on time, they called ahead, I had zero complaints. I was needing to move with my job from AZ to CA, so I cancelled the service.First off I have never called into Customer Service without waiting at least 15 minutes on hold.  Secondly, the rude customer service agent told me I had 10 bottles missing that I was going to get charged for. I told her this is impossible as I only get 2 bottles every two weeks (and always put them out front). She was very combative and rude and said she would work to resolve the problem. I said thank you, and then the next day she charged me for all 10 bottles. I waited another 27 minutes on hold when I had the charge, and they were still insistent. Please be sure you keep up to date on your bottles as they will screw you if their accounting system is off.'
