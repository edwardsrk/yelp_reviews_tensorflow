b'I\'m writing this as I sit here. I got here at 7:50pm and ordered food at around 8:00pm.  We ordered two appetizers, one soup, two entrees, and one drink. It is now 8:27pm and one appetizer came out. We ate our appetizer pretty fast because we were famished. It is now 8:31pm and nothing else has come. The second appetizer came out at 8:35. We received the rest of our food at 8:43pm. We finished our meal, paid the bill, and left promptly at 9:01pm. Generally, I am a very patient person. However, tonight, I was irritated. I do not understand how it took almost half an hour to receive two fried appetizers and a cup of soup. I was also annoyed that they forgot the drink. I also felt bad because the couple next to us was receiving the same level of "service" and their child was really hungry. I have worked as a waiter in a similar restaurant of size and cuisine with the same number of staff members. Our average time from order to appetizer to entree was 5 minutes and 10 minutes. This restaurant somehow managed 27 minutes to appetizer and 16 minutes to entrees. I\'m not placing the full blame on the waiter. I\'m placing blame on the entire establishment. I will give credit that the food was good (note two stars instead of one) but it was accompanied by poor logistics, timing, and service. It was very disappointing and I have to say that I will not return.'
