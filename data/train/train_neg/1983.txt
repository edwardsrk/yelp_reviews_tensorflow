b"If this was the LAST moving company in the world I'd move all my stuff on a tricycle first!!!!!No furniture pads were used unless I asked. Numerous nicks, scratches and gouges in furniture and apartment fridge (I use for drinks). I finally told my husband to have them drop everything in the garage. When it came time to pay they only take cash. No credit cards NO debit cards NO checks (understandable). BUYER BEWARE."
