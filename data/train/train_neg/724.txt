b"Dinning at the Red Room is an experience I hope to never repeat.Three of us arrived slightly later than our party, and right off the bat we were told that separate bills were not possible. He came back five minutes later to remind us again that we could NOT have separate bills (we hadn't even asked for them). Its a cash only, which is fine, but in this modern day and age, options are always appreciated. The food was awful. A lot of the food is very clearly brought in already-made, and then fried. They have a very large, very mismatched menu. We saw dishes from Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, German and numerous other cultures. I ordered Edamame (over boiled and under salted) and Shrimp Spring Rolls to snack on. One of my shrimp rolls did not have anything in it. It was a hollow, deep friend, roll. My party ordered a variety of different plates, no one was thrilled. The waiter seemed to be the only server in the entire restaurant, so I appreciate that he was busy, and might not have been having the best day of his life, so we'll assume the best there.  And yes....the bathrooms are gross."
