b"Just about as bad of an experience as you can get.  Horrible female barber (if you can call any of them barbers) who pretty much place a bowl over your head and cut around it in layers.  No idea how to fade (blend) your hair from shorter to longer.  Then after your horrible haircut they want to wash and dry your hair like a female hair salon.  When I said no thanks she informed it was part of the fee.  I asked what the fee and my mouth dropped.  With a decent tip you'll be paying $40 for a haircut your wife would do a better job with.The woman I got pretty much tells me how she hates men, union county, and pretty much life in general.  To sum it up this is pretty much a typical chop shop (no pun intended) corporate run barber shop.  Gentlemen, run from this place!"
