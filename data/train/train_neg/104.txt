b"I'm disappointed to see so many Yelpers give this place any more than one star. I would take Panda Express any day over this joint.I ordered to-go from their lunch menu: sweet and sour chicken with vegetable lo mein and rice ($8).It took nearly 30 minutes for it to arrive so now I'm rushing back to my office to chow it down. It's a good thing I didn't have to rush because the food was so bland I didn't even bother finishing it. I should have known it was going to be gross when my server pulled the lo mein out of a giant rice steamer. The noodles were not seasoned (btw- where were the vegetables in my vegetable lo mein?!) and way over cook. Maybe it was because the noodles have been sitting in the rice steamer all day!The sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. There were some chunks of green peppers too but I couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.The best part of the meal were the fortune cookies. Mine said-- Next time, drive a bit east and you will find Pei Wei... or maybe that Chicago Hamburger Company across the street will do too!Don't waste your money folks. Judging from the 4 people eating there during rush lunch hour, this place will be closed soon."
