b'Second night living in Charlotte, and I was craving wings. I was excited to see a Wild Wing Cafe close to where we were because I was craving the Colorado Copper sauce (my fav) and the house made chips. The moment I walked in my eyes were drawn to the filthy floor. I let it slide because I was ready for some wings! My husband and I went to the bar to sit, and we both noticed that the bar top wasn\'t very clean either. I needed to use the restroom, and the restrooms weren\'t clean either. The stall had toilet paper hanging from the coat hook on the back of the door, another roll on top of the dispenser, but none in the actual dispenser. I sat back down with my husband before we decided to order, and pulled up yelp. I saw similar reviews to the one that I am writing. After my husband used the bathroom as well he came back and said, "okay, not sure if we should eat here." I agreed with him, and we left. This is so disappointing because I was excited to have a Wild Wings Cafe close by. In our old city we were there many Saturdays for lunch. I hate to say that we probably won\'t be back unless there is a change. Giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the bartender seemed to be nice.Ashley C - thank you for commenting on my post. However, for some reason yelp is not allowing me to message the restaurant or you. Could You please send me a message (if you see this) so that I can send you my info? Thanks!'
