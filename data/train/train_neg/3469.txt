b"I go there because it is open 24 hours however there is an issue with homeless people sleeping in the group rooms, handicap bathroom, men's locker room and even in chairs in open areas of the gym. Since LA Fitness took over from 24 Hour Fitness the club is not as clean.  Not sure if they are all open 24 hours or not."
