b"My girlfriend and I just finished having lunch at Clever Koi Phoenix. The food was delicious but took a long time to come out. Guests who had arrived and were seated 5-10 min after we ordered, received their meals before we did. That could have been overlooked but the service we received was absolutely awful. It seemed like a battle to get more water while we were waiting for our food. The bartender filled up our waters half way and then never returned to fill them back up. It's hot outside and water should be the one thing that never stays empty at a table. Overall the food was decent but the service is what will keep us away."
