b'2.25 starsfrom the outside this place looks ghetto... especially since there is a 168 attached to it ... some sort of ghetto pool hall downstairs with wanksters and a tiny convenient store to the right...  its located upstairs inbetween both of these places... once up the stairs,  its not as bad as i thought it would be..  service was poor, the tea throughout my stay remained empty.  i saw endless amount of people try to pour tea but was never refilled.  luckily i sat next to all the food.. i saw when the "good stuff" came out.. such as lobster.. but guess what.. it rarely ever gets filled and they put the nastiest garbage pieces.. im talking pure shell and no meat pieces at all.. no exaggeration.. they put the head and just shells... i dont know if that is because people want the flavor for their broth .. or people like to eat boiled lobster shells... maybe its just for looks.all the meats were really frozen to the point its in one big clump.  and i see this old guy who keeps bringing things to the back.. and bringing it back out with maybe one or two more items added to the bin.. which makes me think they are recycling the food..   wilted vegetables.. and they kept advertising icecream all over the walls and flyers.. but guess what.. NO ICECREAM.. in fact no dessert.. only dessert you will get is a sour orange if you want.i had to chase for service... beef had 0 fat .... 0% marbling.. therefore it was chewy.. stick to the lamb.  18.99 on reg day dinners and extra 2 dollars for weekend ... i rather go sushi ayce'
