b"I was excited to have fish and chips when I drove by Chippy's but unfortunately it wasn't what I thought it would be.I got the cod and chips and it was OK.   The fries were good but the fish batter was somewhat to hard/crunchy to bite into. The fish portions were good but that's all. The tartar sauce is homemade but it wasn't tart enough it still tasted more like mayo."
