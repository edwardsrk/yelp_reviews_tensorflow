b'I walked in this place with my daughter, after a few years having not eaten here in a while. Needless to say the place is still the same which is something one can appreciate in a small joint like this. However one thing we noticed as soon as we walked in, was a foul odour. This was very off-putting and it was combined with the odour from the sickly looking goldfish on the counter. Poor little fella. Lol. So we casually looked at each other and gave our "code nod" with our heads, to exit. We opted not to order from here. This place does not appear to be very clean. With all that said the food could very well be tasty. Take your chances.'
