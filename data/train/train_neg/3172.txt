b"Ambience is great, location and decor on point! Quality of food goes hand in hand with the qualities aforementioned.Sadly, the 2 stars review will be based on customer service. This will be the first and last time we visit this place. We love trying new food and don't mind waiting if the quality of the food and service are up to par. Waited for over 40 minutes for food and it never arrived!The 3 waiters did not check on you (Avoid the table next to the hostess podium, seems to be invisible to them) After we asked for our food to go, it still took 20 extra minutes. The attitude of the personnel was extremely poor at the end after asking for a simple mistake to be corrected. We felt ignored most of the time and as such, cannot recommend this establishment."
