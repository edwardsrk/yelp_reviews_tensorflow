b"Had the sugar skull drink with a pineapple and rum drink. Too strong! Nonetheless I drank it after adding more pineapple in it. My daughter had the French toast. It was delicious with French baguettes and caramelized bananas and yummy cinnamon syrup sauce. I ordered the Steak Tomahawk platter with grilled veggies and guacamole. We were very excited but it was too rare and half the steak was pure fat and gristle. NOT HAPPY. We were too starved to send it back to cook a bit  more. Not worth the $80.00. The service was very slow. We loved the restaurant itself. It's beautiful and very artistic with the beautiful Mexican inspired murals. My daughter and I really enjoyed it."
