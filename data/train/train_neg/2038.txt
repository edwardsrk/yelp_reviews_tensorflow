b"I come here every so often with friends to get a quick sushi lunch fix, however that is all. I will never come here for dinner or for any other occasion. Service is terrible, although we write everything down in the menu they give us, we receive only half of what was asked. They'll mix up our orders with another table more than once. I was watching one of the waitresses as they had food in their hands, and they looked so lost as to where the food was supposed to be served. Honestly if you do plan to come here, just come for some quick sushi and that's it, otherwise don't waste your time."
