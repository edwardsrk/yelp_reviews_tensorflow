b'Went here during the Monday $15/dozen special. Oysters were good however each oyster had tiny shell fragments inside. Whoever shucked the oysters probably rushed them since we only waited a few minutes to receive an order of two dozen oysters.I would have given this place four stars, but after eating each oyster my friend and I spent a few seconds picking pieces of shells out of our mouths.'
