b'Went to a friends birthday dinner at this restaurant. It\'s a beautiful place but the service was poor. We arrived 8:30pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn\'t very busy. After we placed our order, it took 45 mins to get our meals, by that time we were very hungry and he didn\'t even offer us bread at the table, but everyone else was being served. Our waiter spoke little to no English, and I feel like the language barrier was a part of the issue. All he kept saying we "it\'s good, it\'s good."Some of us got our dinner, and when my friend asked what kind of meat was on her plate it, he said it was horse meat. I\'d suggest no one eat here, it\'s not worth the money and the service sucks.'
