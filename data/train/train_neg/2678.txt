b'Mixed thoughts on this hotel.The room was nice and electric black-out curtains were awesome. That was a nice luxury for the tired/drunk/lazy. The customer service I felt was condescending whenever I called the front desk, or one of the multiple concierges.  I booked on Expedia/Hotels.com and each time I called or spoke to the folks in the lobby, because I booked on a "Third Party," they treated me like some cheap coupon guy.  Womp.  WIFI is charged $10/day if you book for though a third party, also, I was told.  Rules are rules, but again, no need to be condescending.  HHonors members get allowed a code to get wifi, depending on who you talk to.  The cleaning team and security were all nice-Thank you to you guys!The parking.  Sucked.  Very difficult to find a space, with multiple cars "parked" waiting like hawks.  Long walk to hotel as well.  Not a good hotel if you want to drive anywhere else.The pool/jacuzzi is beautiful, however closes at 6PM.  Yes, closes at 6PM.  So after work I was unable to swim laps, or just sit and bake in the bubbles like a fat happy bastard.The lobby is beautiful, however, its bland and boring, even for older folks.  Waste of space.  All in all, I\'d rather be treated as a guest, then just a number visiting Vegas.'
