b"This place gone down in last 5 years. Steaks are not up to par anymore, certainly not in this price range. Regular, okay steak. Expectations not met at all. Presentation is slaking.  Take your dollars somewhere else. There are plenty much better steak houses with much better in the same price range. The only good things that are still left: Bread basket and wine list. But these will not make me come back anymore. It's not that I did not like it, the place is just not good anymore."
