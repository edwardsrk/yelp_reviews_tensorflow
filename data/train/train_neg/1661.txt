b'not true at all. you have to authorize the credit card company to give me a credit.. you refused.  you say you own a business.. we all know you are the one to call them and put through a credit.. so stop lying and put through the credit.. i dont know how you can continue to lie to people..its a simple process. call the company and say i want to credit this cc number.. stop lying to peopleyou say you refunded your fee?? not true at all..there is no refund..your service still is just absolutely terrible. full of untruths.. not only cant you find leaks but you lie about giving me the refund on your service fee. how bad is that?????do not deal with a company like this.. misinformation about their work and more information about sending a refund for their non service..terrible people'
