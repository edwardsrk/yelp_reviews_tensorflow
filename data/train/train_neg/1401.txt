b'Update: Updating my original review because I had rave reviews about this place, but after tonight I have to seriously downgrade my rating. The service was awful, our server "Brian" started off the evening with a superb and arrogant display of his English knowledge and proceeded to tell us that their wine "special" for the night was cheap crap when I inquired.... Then why is it on the menu??? Then, I ordered my favorite dish - the mussels and there was a spoiled one in there. Have you ever tasted a spoiled mussel? I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant. It tastes like rotten eggs, but you can taste it in your mouth for hours to come... and hopefully you won\'t puke it up later. NASTY!!!  The server barely acknowledged this and the manager stated that "that\'s mother nature for you". Excuse me? I understand the risks of eating seafood, but you should never handle a complaint like that... an "I\'m so sorry," would have been the minimal acceptable response. Finally, everyone was getting free mini desserts (some chocolate cake thing) and our server never brought ours.. very obviously... and never comped us for the mussels... not even a 10% discount... If they treat their loyal customers in such a manner, especially on their first anniversary, then I think there are other restaurants where I can become loyal instead. ***********************************************************************   Original review:   Addicting! Roasted mussels are to die for!!! I keep getting this. The appetizer menu could use some work, but the desserts make up for it. Chocolate bacon s\'mores and the pint of Guiness desserts are fascinating. Service is excellent and atmosphere is inviting. It\'s really busy though, so you better have a reservation. Nice addition to the hood!!! Finally.'
