b'Let me tell you about this place.  Not only am i 2 hours still waiting for my delivery.  when i called i got pretty much yelled at for asking the eta for my food. i mean its two hours. i hope my food doesnt come cold. The male that i talked to didnt even look up my name, instead bluntly yelled out "yea" many of times then hung up. I called like 5 more times and no one answered.  Now to talk about when the delivery actually showed.  The driver was very sketching. I was paying cash and he didnt even know my total.  He was standing there saying "ahh umm hmm. 17 18.. eh how about you just give me 20 bucks."  I was givin no receipt.  I been in the food industry for a long time now to know that he probably pocketed the money.  I was also missing the chips and salsa that i ordered.  The food is like miniatures. 1 Little rolled taco the size of my finger. 1 tostada the size of my palm.  The most itty bitty taco i have ever seen and the chicken meat in the middle was so over cooked it was like plastic. The pepes platter was like 9 bucks for all that waste.  No offense but the food was so bad, i didnt even bother calling to complain. because trust me i do not want to eat there food ever again.My whole entire experience here was the worst ive ever had.  LOL  Your whole resturant should just close down.  Its so pathedic. I got pictures. can i post pictures on here?At least you hit my number one place NEVER to go to again. Is there a 0 star button?#ElMolinoMexicanCafe You make scottsdale look bad...'
