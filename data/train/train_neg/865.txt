b'I went there for lunch, the restaurant was empty. We waited for 10 minutes for a cook to wonder out and see us and ask us what we wanted. Then we were sat in the very back corner of the EMPTY restaurant. Waited 30 minutes, then the waiter came out. The food was not Mexican food. The food tasted like it was made in a drunken stupor by a culinary drop out who visited Tijuana for 1 day and now thinks they can cook Mexican.'
