b"If I could give this place negative stars, I would.  It Sucked!  My girlfriends and I were given free entrance and we were promised free champagne if we showed up between 11:00 and 12:00.  We showed up at 11:40 and they were out of champagne, and didn't offer us any other free drinks as compensation.  That sucked since the free champagne was the only reason we were going.  Then I asked for a water, and they tried to charge me $5 for a bottle of water.  They wouldn't give me tap water until I lied to them and told them I would vomit if they didn't give it to me.  Seriously - what kind of a place hands out free champagne until it's gone, but won't give out free water?  It's like they want people to get out-of-control drunk.  And to top it off the bouncers were jerks.  Please don't go there - it's a waste of resources."
