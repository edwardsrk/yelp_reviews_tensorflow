b'Advertised specials are in very short supply. All the advertised products I wanted were out. This was not the first time. A Coke promotion of a 24 can purchase gave a free 1.75 liter simply orange juice. As no 24 can package was available, I picked up 2 - 12  packs of soda. No manager or supervisor would honor the promotion. As these disappointments happen too often, I have finally made up my mind NEVER to shop here again.'
