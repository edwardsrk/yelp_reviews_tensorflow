b"I have never written a yelp review. Ever. This establishment forced me to. I honestly don't have high expectations about ordering food at 11:30, but when it comes two hours later, and after a shakedown by the delivery guy by phone after calling justeat to get a refund, I feel like the only Greek I got had nothing to do with food."
