b"Horrible! Had to leave as soon as we saw the room. Dead roaches on the bench/couch by window. Made a face when we told them we didn't wanna stay and wanted our money back. They were rude. Unorganized. And filthy rooms. I strongly suggest to not even think about staying there. Deserves no stars because it's really a crappy place."
