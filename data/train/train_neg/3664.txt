b'I had a disappointing experience, but the food was good enough for me to try again.FOOD:I had the eggs benedict and was thoroughly satisfied.  The fresh biscuit the eggs were placed on were the perfect texture and the hollandaise had a great twist of cinnamon that made the whole dish come together.  The menu is small, so check before hand if you want to make sure they have something you like. ATMOSPHEREThe restaurant is small, but takes reservations via Open Table which is a god-send for me.  The restaurant had a smell to it.  It could have been the frog legs, I have never smelt them, but the smell was like mildew or a wet towel.  It came in waves and permeated the room.SERVICE:Unfortunately, the service was slow and not much attention was paid to us.  Though when we caught there attention they were responsive.  I saw people that ordered after me get their meal before me, which never feels good.OVERALL:As mentioned above, these few bumps I experienced that day were over-shadowed by the food, as I am craving those eggs benedict again and will probably make a reservation soon.'
