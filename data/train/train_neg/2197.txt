b'Had to use up my 2 free nights for September and when I was checking in I had the most horrible girl at the front desk. I told her I had a toddler and would love a room close to the elevator..did she give me one? NO it was literally the last room down a long ass hallway. It also overlooked the backside of the hotel where they were doing construction at 6am..woke to the sound of beep-beep-beep of trucks doing their thing.Thank god the inlaws are coming in from MIchigan and going to use the free rooms for October cuz I dont think I can handle staying here anymore..even for free.'
