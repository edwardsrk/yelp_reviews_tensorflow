b"Ehhhhhh....when I walked in..it smelt like a mix of a sewer smell and pho...red flag. I ordered steak and meatball pho...and the noodles were so hard! Broth was whatever...overall I think it could of been cleaner..I had to look at all my spoons and little dish to see if they were dirty..which yes they were...won't be coming back. The meat also was way too thick and dry."
