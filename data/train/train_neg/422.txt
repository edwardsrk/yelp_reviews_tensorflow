b"I wish I could give zero stars this place is awful and the staff is incredibly rude. I ordered food got the wrong order but didn't have time to wait another 20 minutes for a new grilled cheese so I ate it and they threw a fit that we complained that the food didn't come as ordered but we still ate it. They argued with us and then threw us out. Needless to say we won't be returning. Thumbs definitely down for this spot."
