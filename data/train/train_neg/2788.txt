b"Food is good here but the staff and policies are out of control.We sat down for 65 mins and were told it was last call for alcohol. Reason being, 1 member of out party showed up 15 mins early and they changed out reservation to 6:45 instead of 7 and have a strict 2 hour policy. Anyways, if you want to go to a bar, don't go here cus you get 1 hour to order and eat. Lame"
