b'One star is a major exaggeration--the service and quality of the food was much worse than this. The food is wretched--I mean, when you take an 11-year old, and he says the food is disgusting, you know you\'ve hit the culinary bottom. We asked for nutrition information, and the answer we received was, "no, we don\'t have that, and we cannot guarantee what\'s in the food." Is that even legal in this day and age? The server seemed overwhelmed with the many (3) tables he had, and sighed and shambled about any time we asked for anything (like, lemons and plates). Save yourself the trip and the tip--eat a Lean Cuisine. Those are terrible as well, but at least your expectation is low going in. And for the cost, the food should\'ve been at least edible.'
