b"Ok Beijing Peking duck in the area . Service was decent , the food was a little bland . Nothing too special overall ... prices were fair i suppose but make sure you check your bill - they calculated my bill wrong twice and then after finally getting the bill right , they gave me back way less change than what it should've been ...if they hadn't don't that I would've given them 3 stars"
