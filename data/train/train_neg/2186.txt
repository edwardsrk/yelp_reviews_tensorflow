b"Well I have to tell you I am a little disappointed after giving them 2 try's. trip 1- served me uncooked chicken (approx 4 years ago)trip 2- just a couple of days ago... And let me begin by saying I love a great steak house and I gave this one a second try and passed up on trying a couple of others I hadn't yet. Usually I go to the same place but I was in the mood for something different...Anyways... I agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like USDA at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not)Bottom line. Potato and Ambiance okay, meat not great especially for a total ticket of $230 for 2!"
