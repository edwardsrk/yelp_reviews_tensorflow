b'Just left here. Came to pick up an online order with my work colleague.  Servers were friendly but did not have good organization. You could tell it was very chaotic. The pick up time was for 12:15 pm, but food wasn\'t ready, so they asked us to sit at the bar.  We were offered water, but got it at the end of waiting...  Then a tall server with nose rings came with our orders to go in two bags. He READ the order out from the receipt correctly and handed them to us.  I checked my bag once I walked out and of course food was missing from the order! Wow, after reading it??? He\'s like oh sorry! That\'s what happens when you don\'t do things yourself.." Then when he brought the rest of my order, the truffle fries were cold and hard.  Food taste wasn\'t bad (the burger), but food should be served hot especially if the order was already incorrect.Wont be back!  Yikes, what a surprise.'
