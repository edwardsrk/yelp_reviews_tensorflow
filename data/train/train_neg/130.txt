b"I'm surprise this place stays open, I assume it does good business since it's conveniently located on the strip.take my advice and save yourself and eat somewhere else.-they charged ridiculous prices for Mexican food. Expect $10-15 per person for a small plate. I order the 2 combo with rice, beans, chicken soft taco and tamale. It was not filling, and definitely not tasty. -chips and salsa was below par. -the guacamole was $10!!! for a small serving. The waitress did not bother telling us how much it was. -incompetent workers. Seriously, how hard is it get hot water? first time, you brought out cold water. We asked for hot water.-Don't bother asking for suggestions, their not at all familiar with their menu!"
