b"My wife and I visited East West Pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area.Our meal here was mediocre. We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West. I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers."
