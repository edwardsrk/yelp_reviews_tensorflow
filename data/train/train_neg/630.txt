b"Renting from here is like the episode of Seinfeld.  You can take the reservation, but don't know how to hold the reservation.reserved a compact, they wanted to give me a two seater truck for three people and luggage... Umm, no thanks.They had one with snow tires which the said was $15 more...  Fine...... Until the price comes up- it's $15 a *day* more...  For the rental period, I can buy a set of four snow tires for that...  Totally ridonkulous.  No thanks...Then they had a Cadillac suv, normally $30/day more, but they're willing to give it to me for $15/day more.  No thanks... You could give it to me for no extra charge...  They had nothing else.  Total bait and switch.So they went over to Avis, which actually had something for $10 less (total)...  I would have booked with Avis in the first place but they said they were closed when my flight arrived...Yup, worst car rental place ever."
