b'I ordered my Bleu cheese burger medium. It was way overdone, dry & chewy. The flavor was ok, but nothing great. The tomatoes were half green & mealy. I sat in the bar are for a late lunch. The older bartender was nice enough, but he never came back to check on me once the food was delivered. He did bring me another iced tea after awhile. I was definitely not impressed. At least the steak fries were good.'
