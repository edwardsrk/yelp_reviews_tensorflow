b"The food lacked flavor and was really bland!!!  I had the tandoori chicken and my wife had some type of masala. Both dishes didn't look the right and didn't have the right seasoning or taste. It's was a big disappointment, especially since she is pregnant and craves good Indian food.  My wife and I have been very fortunate to have Indian friends in LA show us great food, so we think we can tell what is good and what isn't. The only nice thing is the service was good. I should have known something was wrong when there were on four people ( two couples) including my wife and I."
