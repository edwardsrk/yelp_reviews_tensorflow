b"I'm sad that I have to write a poor review about this place. My sister had gone in looking for a wedding dress before and the service was great. This post is meant for the manager of the store. I was really disappointed with how she handled our particular problem. We had purchased some shoe accessories (sole mates) these items are meant to be put on your heel so that they don't dig into the grass. We followed the instructions and put them on correctly, they fit well. However they didn't work, we sank into the grass continually and by the end of the wedding photo shoot (30 minutes) the sole mates had worked their way up our heels and had to be yanked off scraping the finishes off our shoes.When I spoke to an associate about this she told me she would speak to a manager about it. No one ever got back to me. I followed up a few days later and spoke to a manager, I explained my situation. Instead of offering helpful solutions she instantly became defensive and told me I didn't buy the right size, I put them on wrong, and I am the one liable for my ruined shoes because I assumed the risk when I bought the sole mates. She told me to bring in my shoes in so she could look at them. When I asked if we would be reimbursed she snarled and said refunds were against store policy. I've been in the service industry for over 2 decades. I've never seen a manager deal with a situation in such a rude and unhelpful way. I will definitely be sending my brides-to-be elsewhere."
