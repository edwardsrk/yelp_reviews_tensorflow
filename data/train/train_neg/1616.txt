b"Unfortunately they did the worst service to my dum sum lunch. ..The day after backed from China, HK and Japan for one and half month trip, I was so exited to have a lunch at Yu restaurant. Since their fish mart is very high quality in GTA, who gonna doubt its food quality. We order a plain congee and several dim sum. It was a busy Sunday lunch time so most of table is occupied by the family with small children. Then big surprise. There was a chunk of metal sponge in the congee. I was busy in chatting so almost swallow the piece of metal if my family did not stop my spoon. We called restaurant manager immediately. And another surprise. He grabbed the congee plate quickly and said ' oh, cancel it' and left our table without apology nor follow up. We asked him again what happened inside the food but he kept saying that today is my last day (so what ?)I can't do anything. !!!! After that I do not remember what I ate. The new manager came and said sorry to us. However, I have a trauma now. Just imagine what happened in the kitchen. Hygiene management is the basic of restaurant business. No matter how they cook fancy dim sum, I may not go back there again. It's a metal contained dim sum not edible at all."
