b'Cox is among the worst customer service providers I\'ve ever met in my life. If you have the opportunity to select anyone else to provide cable do so. There is no "customer service." Rather they will give you a series of excuses why they can\'t help you -- or quote a ridiculous fee associated with what should be routine service.Cox Cable would go out of business were it not a regulated monopoly in the region.'
