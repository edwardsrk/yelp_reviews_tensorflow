b"How unfortunate. I recently moved into the neighborhood and was pretty stoked that there were several food establishments on Coventry. A few weeks ago I had finished up at the gym that left me with a handsome appetite and ordered carry-out from Hunan Convetry - first and last time.  I ordered crab rangoons, shrimp with honey walnut, Kung Pao beef, and pork chow fun ... (I was a little *hungry* :-P). It was a carry out order, and they were promptly ready for pick-up. I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce. I don't think my palate is salt-biased, but this was the first time (in a long time) that I ADDED salt, among other things, to my shrimp and pork entrees. Chow fun ranks pretty high on my list of comfort foods - the broad doughy noodles full of flavor I expected were nothing more than tasteless oil-laden folds of pasta. I have my food issues, always cleaning my plate, always keeping leftovers, and never wasting (there are too many hungry people out there for me to be cavalier). Well, these two entrees ended up in the trash (did I mention I was STARVING when I ordered?). As for the beef, I tried my best to salvage my $$$ by re-purposing it the next day.I would have done better picking up a frozen entree by Ina Garten or Trader Joe's."
