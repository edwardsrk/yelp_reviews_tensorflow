b"So we got a room Wed for Fri the 17th. Less than 50 bucks after tax and all. Get there check in is pretty quick. Ended up having to go to back of casino take the elevator to the fifth floor walk across an Open Sky Way and stay in room that was more like a motel room. Didn't even know this part of the hotel existed. Have to say the Linens were clean the towels are clean the pillows were in good shape the tile was clean the furniture was a little bit dated unfortunately the heat was broken for the whole row and we nearly froze to death, they brought us extra blankets at 2 in the morning or were going to move us it was a huge pain in the ass and freezing. If the ice machine hadnt been broken and the heat had worked in our room it would have been fine but otherwise it was kind of a drag."
