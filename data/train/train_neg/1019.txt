b"They will rip you off your hard earned money. $450 for a key replacement is INSANE!!! Its unfortunate that i was left with no option but to go with them as i don't have a spare key to drive to the dealer and they knew it. The dealer quoted $180 for the same job. Do yourself a favour and take your car somewhere else. You will thank me later."
