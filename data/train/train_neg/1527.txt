b"So my wife and went to your establishment tonight and had a great time till we got our bill.... when we asked for our tab our bartender snapped at us and gave us so much attitude that I will never come here again... she got mad because she heard us talking about our tab, the only reason we talked about it was because we had 2 creepy guys follow us from 3 different bars, trying to order drinks on our tab so we wanted to make sure their drinks were not on our tab... needless to say this girl blew up on us for no reason, getting mad because we only ordered 3 drinks,it was 1:30 in the morning by the way.....so  we wanted to make sure our tab was right, I work in a high pace bar in North scottsdale called the village tavern and if I acted like that and treated a guest in this manner I would have been fired... I felt so disrespected in this place I will never go back, nor in courage others to go there.. don't come to this place the bartenders aweful"
