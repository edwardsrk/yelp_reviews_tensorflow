b'Liars and Crooks in disguise here.  Grabbed me on my way to pick up my rental from another company.  Offered me a car for $20/day.  Talked me into the insurance after I declined.  I told them I may be a little late returning, they said not to worry as there is a 59 minute grace period, it\'s only $7/hour for the first 3 hours, then a full day charge.  The total when I walked away from the counter was $63.I returned the car about 25 minutes late, and expected to pay an extra hour.  On the contrary, the guy who processed my return said "no extra charges, have a nice day".  I walked away feeling good, and happy I found a new place to rent from.I got an email of my bill a couple of hours later.  $115.  I called to ask why, and like a robot, the manager Kayla just protected her staff and the charges.  This is bad business and they know it.  Never again, stay away!'
