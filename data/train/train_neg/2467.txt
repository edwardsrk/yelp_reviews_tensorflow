b"Place was new/clean.  Sushi NOT good.  Your ingredient choices are very limited and low quality, the rice gets kind of hard because it sits around in pre-prepped sheets.  There is no artistry (or Asians), as they use a machine to make your sushi, which I'm skeptical about based on principal, but also because it's on the counter all day at room temp cutting raw fish.  No music and empty, so kind of eerie while eating, and more of a subway feel than asian.  People are commenting on how they get to customize the sushi here... but you can do that at any sushi place.  Anyway, for me.. High prices for low quality sushi = not worth going back."
