b'Low end chain Mexican food, coupled with bad service and cold "sizzling" fajitas earns this place one star.  Salsa is usually the first indication if a Mexican restaurant is going to be any good - the salsa was very bland and it just went downhill from there. We should have known when we went in and the place was mostly empty but we were really craving Mexican.  A real shame because it is in a super location.'
