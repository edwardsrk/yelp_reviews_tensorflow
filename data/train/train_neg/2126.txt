b"Met a friend for lunch today as he wanted to try this place. We sat inside the restaurant as opposed to the food court. The server was very attentive and got our meals out quickly. The bean soup was okay, nothing special with very few beans. The laffa bread left on the table was very tasty.Interestingly and strange is that we were told that they didn't have any chef salads with only vegetables but had these salads were available if meat were added to them!  Odd.. Ordered the  tabouli salad which was fresh and tasty. Odd that coffee refills aren't free. Lots of mishegas!My experience over the years with kosher restaurants has lead me to avoid them. This one wasn't as bad as most but not good enough to bring me back."
