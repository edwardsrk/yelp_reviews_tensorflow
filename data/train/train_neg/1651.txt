b'Avoid the strip at all costs. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.Every time I go there, I regret it.And now that paid parking is approaching, it\'s even more unappealing.The strip is absurdly expensive due to revenue-sharing between the businesses and the casinos (about 1/3 of what you pay goes to the casinos), and it\'s full of mostly trailer-trash in shorts and flip-flops, and overweight Taylor Swift wannabes awkwardly walking around with what seems like concrete blocks for shoes, all pretending to "live the dream".For those who have a brain, that "dream" is nothing short of a nightmare.There are so many wonderful restaurants, shops, and forms of entertainment off-the-strip that are more worthwhile....especially in Chinatown....just do a little research....starting here on Yelp.'
