b'Do yourself a favor and go with any other cleaning service. The maids are all sweet BUT the owner is a terrible business man and does not communicate with his houses.  This week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on Tuesday.  The maids show up at 11:30ish and had no clue they were suppose to be here at 10. So I asked to reschedule for the following day and they were booked up (okay that\'s fine) so then they say they will come on Thursday.  Well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.  We had to contact the owner and he said one of the maids was fired "due to her personal issues" okay that\'s fine but let people paying you know.  So they FINALLY come on Saturday they "clean" the house in about 1.5 hours (it\'s about 2000 square feet) so they do an average job.  The cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged. TRUST ME when I say it is not worth the hassle of dealing with this place.'
