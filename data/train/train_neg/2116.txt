b"My favorite thing to eat is onion rings and mine were way over cooked and dried out. They were nasty. The burger was good but it is pretty hard to mess up onion rings so I was very disappointed. Not sure if I'll go back. Deep fried foods are one of the easiest things to make and a lot of the food on the menu there is deep fried."
