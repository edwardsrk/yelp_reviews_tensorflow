b"Really filthy silverware asked for new set  just as bad  asked for ketchup Disgusting!!! See photo. Italian beef so-so. Fries were good. But fries don't make a restaurant. Where ever this chain started they need to go back.  Hate to see the kitchen if what they bring out is this bad. There's so many restaurants that take pride in cleanliness,this was certainly Doesn't!!! If you go don't say I didn't warn you."
