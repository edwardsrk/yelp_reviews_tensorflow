b'While in Vegas, we tried this new (new for us) Gastropub. It was close to our hotel and was a nice change from the buffets.  It was odd to order and pay for the meal before being seated. It was equally odd that no one was really available to describe the menu.  So, we ordered the deviled eggs, tempura beans, and sushi du jour.  The eggs had a dried crust on the top which looked as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp. Additionally, there was a glob of mustard under each piece (to keep from sliding) that sort or "shocked" the taste buds (didn\'t like it). The beans were good, but I think serving the chipotle mayo on the side would be better to allow customers to \'dip\' as needed; however, I repeat, the beans were done nicely.  The sushi was presented nicely, but no chopsticks to eat with; when asked if chopsticks were available, the server seemed confused with my question.  We may go back to try other items next time we visit but we were a bit nonplussed by our first experience. Oh yeah, please ask if we are done eating BEFORE pulling the plate and utensils from us.  Thank you.'
