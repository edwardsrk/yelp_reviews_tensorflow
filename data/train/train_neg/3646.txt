b"One of the few places in town you can view work from renowned artists and this place charges like its the Met. Maybe that's a bit much. But then again so is $19 for a two room exhibition no bigger than your local Starbucks. That's like paying $50 to go to Coachella to see ONE band play ONE song. It's bullshit, right? It is not worth the admission for most of the exhibitions they show. If you're a local, $10 on Wednesdays is a bit more reasonable... but discounts are only 5-8pm which doesn't really make much sense."
