b"Wet burrito was bland and tastelessChips and salsa were like eating half cooked chips and pace picante...I don't reccomend this place to anyoneMy lunch was a burrito which said it was grilled chicken when it was braised and shredded instead, chips and salsa, and a soda and was $15It really didn't taste fresh and when you use products that come from a can instead of fresh products - we can tell and it's not cool man.AlsoI smelled like a dirty deep fryer when I leftMy shirt and beard smelled like nasty old fryer grease.  I went home and had to do laundry.Try again Boca Loca!I won't be back."
