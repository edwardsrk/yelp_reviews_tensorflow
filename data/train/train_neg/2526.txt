b"Ehhhhh I think Joe's has gone downhill in the last few years. I don't think I have had a great experience at a Joe's in a long while and by a while I mean at least 3 years maybe even longer and it used to be great. Well first off the food was not fresh or hot like it should be. They have a great selection but it just isn't good food at all. I think you can get fresher fish at a Long John silvers. The steam pots ate good, I have had better though! Prices are high considering the quality. The drinks tasted watered down and are way over priced. Service was OK had to wait at times for way to long. They were polite but just not attentive. Won't be back unless I hear they make some changes!"
