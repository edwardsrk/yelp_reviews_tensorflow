b"This nail spa is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by homes.. at first I was very excited to find a place so close to my house that wasn't crazy busy.. the inside was super dated and everything looked old.. when i walked in, there were two elderly ladies being attended to.. the owner (at least I think she was) was free and told me to pick a nail colour for my pedi and then had me wait until 1 of the other girls was done when she could've started on me.. parking was tight.. the nail job was pretty decent.. lasted a while.. BUT after a couple of days of getting my pedi done, I experienced an excruciating pain in my toe on one foot.. i couldn't put my feet down or walk without pain for a couple of days. I don't know if it was related but it;s likely that it is. Place just didnt feel clean to me. Won't be returning."
