b"I know it is common for Filipino restaurants to have a cafeteria style setting, but sometimes this is cause for disaster. For this particular restaurant, it was a total disaster. This place is new and popular, so everyone is going there. There are whole families waiting in line, so employees are unsure who to serve next and it makes the entire experience disorganized. The food is expensive for what it is: I could probably make the same thing at home for half the price. There was nothing special on the menu. I ordered chicken BBQ sticks and they throw them in a to go bag and it's very messy. My mom ordered mussels and they were stingy, only serving three while they served other customers double the amount. There's just no consistency here and like I said, it really is nothing special: just another mediocre Filipino fast food joint. I won't be going back."
