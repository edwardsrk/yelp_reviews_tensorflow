b"I understand it was New when I went. So they were still getting their stuff organized. But the manager/owner  was yelling at employees in front of customers. Our food ended up being cold. It was also not fast. And I didn't think the price was worth the product. The udon at all you can eat sushi places taste better. The broth was bland... They told us to come back. I'll wait a while maybe it'll be better. We ended up spending almost 50$ on 3 people. That's a decent meal somewhere else."
