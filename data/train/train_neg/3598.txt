b"Advice:  don't buy a Restaurant.com coupon for Caf\xc3\xa9 Maria's - not a good deal!  Most give you twice the value of the voucher (pay $10 for $20 value).  There's was different; must spend $20 before the $10 discount, which cost $5.  Kind of deceptive but I should have read the small print as this is not the normal type voucher.  The breakfast was good - not large portions, nothing special.  Prices are fair but most likely will go to other cafes in Sun City."
