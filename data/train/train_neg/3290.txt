b".I went here because it's close to my home at Spadina and Front. I have said this before sushi places are hit and miss and unfortunately this place was a miss for me.Prices are a little high for what you get and the sashimi just didn't have the fresh or wow factor for. Service was below average and I think the only reason this place stays in business is because of the Rogers Centre.If you are craving sushi or more importantly sashimi, avoid this place."
