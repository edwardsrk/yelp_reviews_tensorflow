b"Of all the places I had eaten at while visiting Toronto for work, it was probably by far the least enjoyable. Slow service, mediocre westernized fast comfort food. They try to be healthy and service salmon salad and sides, however it took over 20 minutes for the waitress to get back to us saying they don't have any salmon. Meal was disappointing to say the least. If I could give a 1/2 star I'd do it"
