b'This place is under new management and goes by the name "Scully\'s" now. Which is unfortunate, because Scully\'s is a far cry from the good ol\' Lucky Break I used to know and love.I went in here for a Saturday afternoon college game. The crowd was decent; not overwhelming but not dead either. I go to the bar and grab a menu. The items are mostly the same. There\'re a few new dishes I didn\'t recognize from the Lucky Break of old. I ordered the chili cheese tots; definitely won\'t be doing that again. They were God-awful. Just a big, sloppy, greasy mess.The bartender was a guy whose name I forget. He was nice enough. Got my drinks fairly quickly, but didn\'t seem too personable. Maybe it was a weird day for him, who knows?The waitress didn\'t seem any better. I wasn\'t served by her, but every time she\'d pass there was a dead look in her eyes and she never smiled. Geez, at least pretend you wanna be there.Overall, I don\'t think I\'ll be back. The place is weird compared to the Lucky Break I\'m used to. Time to find a new watering hole.'
