b'The food was great. The service was why I gave this experience a 2 star rating. I had ordered a chopped salad which was supposed to come with grilled chicken. I didn\'t notice the chicken was missing until I was half done but once I could get the attention of our server, I informed him and told him I was almost done so I didn\'t want the chicken. He advised he would "pass it along to management". I guess I was expecting to see the manager, or a discount on my tab or some sort of adjustment. But nothing. Not a sorry about that, not a nothing. I\'m not even sure he mentioned it to his manager. In hindsight, I guess I should have docked his tip, but I didn\'t. Maybe my standards are too high and I expect too much but I would have liked to have seen better customer service in some way or another.'
