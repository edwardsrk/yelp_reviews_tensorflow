b'I really wanted to like this place. Born and raised in the country of NC I grew up on good bbq. I will say the bbq itself is good. Negatives: portions are smallNo hush puppies on the menu (that is a southern staple at a bbq joint) I would also recommend adding French fries. Service was horribly slow and there were two tables  seated that night . Our server had no idea about the menu. I asked him a question about a side and he looked at the menu himself to see. Also when I asked about beers (bc there is no list of beers) all I got was "sycamore beers" not being from Charlotte I had no idea what sycamore beers are . I can give them the benefit of the doubt being new, however being new- I would expect the service to be top notch. This place needs major work to keep them open. Maybe just stick to being a food truck .'
