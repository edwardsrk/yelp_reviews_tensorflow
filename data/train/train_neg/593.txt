b'The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was "That\'s not possible." Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack.'
