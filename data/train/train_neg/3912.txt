b'Well...Chipotle u have disappointed me for the last time. You used to be such a money spot for me for years. I see why your losing 10 percent of your sales every year now. Why so chincy on the portions? Why cold food? Is it really that hard? The only reason why your not getting one star instead of two is I still like the taste. I spent almost 12 bucks on a cold burrito and chips and guacamole.  I could have went to red lobster! Lol never again'
