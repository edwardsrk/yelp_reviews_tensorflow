b'Used to come all the time and it was great. Went again About 6-7 months ago and the wait was about an hour. Food came out Burned. Ppl who came after us got their meals before us and I was very annoyed. The waitress came to the table and said "you look mad, are u mad it took so long".  In an u apologetic way. I said I\'m fine. She said 2 more times that I looked mad, very rude. SO on to today. Went again thinking it was a fluke visit. No. Got there at noon. Got MY food at 1:50pm. The person I was with didn\'t get her food for another 15 mins after me. Cheese wasn\'t melted and the potato pancakes were undercooked like raw rubber slabs. Cooks walking around listening to music like it wasn\'t busy. The owner manager whoever... Same lady that was asking if I was mad was out of the kitchen just talking to a friend for like 30 mins. No apologies for the wait time. No one came back to ask how our food was. We had to wave a waitress down to ask for a drink. We were both so mad we just had to go up and pay without waiting another hour for our checks to get the hell out of there. Will never go back ever. Terrible service. Mediocre food u can make at home.'
