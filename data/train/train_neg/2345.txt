b"I'm just in the area for the day... Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria... But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge... The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap... Oh! Need to show houses... I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4.38Um I went to the bathroom before leaving,.. The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... Hopefully they get that fixed!"
