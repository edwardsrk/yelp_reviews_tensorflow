b"When I tell you somebody needs to come and in a hurry save this Benihana's!!!!!! The bad part about it they know the service sucks, food is mediocre, and the place needs a really good cleaning. I placed a order for sauce and rice and I have to say the sauce was HORRIBLE- COME ON..... That sauce have been around for years other places try but it was a staple at Benihana's you knew you were going to get aleast good sauce but not anymore. I'm sad because the one in Columbus is excellent...... Please get new owners that care, because we do!!!"
