b'I flew from Portland to get a medical check that required an x-Ray. This place assured me over the phone that there is rarely a wait. Wen I arrived they cautioned that it would be approximately 1/2 hour wait. I waited over an hour and a half to see anyone. If you are in a hurry or expect good service, this is not the place for you.'
