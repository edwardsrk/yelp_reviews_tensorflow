b'!!WARNING!! One of the worst hotels to stay in! We came here for my aunts wedding and experienced mold and chipping paint in the bathroom, dirty drain water coming from the sink, no amenities in the room what so ever! Staff is slow and unfriendly, room had food from previous guests. The casino and some rooms flooded from the rain and not to mention the resort fees they charge when there is no pool and half of the casino was blocked off due to flooding.'
