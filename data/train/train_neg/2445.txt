b"Frequent slow/inaccurate orders.  This is not one of the better valley locations.  Metro center is the one to beat.  On my two of my three visits here, its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order.  One of those two visits they did it incorrectly, and I had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake.  Another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar.  It ran like it was vinagerette.  I've mentioned the services issues to their manager.  First time they only apologized, never gave me reason to come back.  After three tries with this location, I'll stick with Metro center."
