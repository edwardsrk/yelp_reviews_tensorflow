b"The chain of a necklace we bought from here breaks every 2-3 months, so we bring it in on a regular basis. Even though the item and warranty are under both my boyfriend's name as well as my own, whoever drops it off has to pick it up. Which is extremely difficult with our busy schedules. It's also very hard to get any service here when you are standing at the pickup counter and not looking into the display cases, looking like a new $ALE. They also NEVER answer their phone. I hate this location."
