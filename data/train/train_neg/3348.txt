b"Went to see a band and have dinner. Sat in the back, in a corner where it was impossible to see the band. Had reservations and told there were no other seats, yet tables were open.On to the food. Ordered a chicken burger. It is not a chicken breast, but ground chicken and didn't taste of anything. Fries are pretty standard.  Being called Drums n'Flats, you would think the wings are where it's at, but no. I've ordered them a few times and find them very average. I asked for some hot sauce, and when I got the bill, I was charged $1.00 for it!!!!!They also charge a cover, even if you're eating, and arrived before the band starts. Overall, very mediocre food, and policies that are focused on getting a few extra bucks from everyone. I'll avoid this place in the future. Plenty of other options."
