b"If I could I could give 0 stars I would. So we show up around 5:30pm on a Monday. Place is pretty empty. Ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. Ice was already melted in my drink. Ordered apps and meals. We did not get out food until 7:30. We waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. BTW my pizza was cold. And there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. Also I ordered a Calzone which was not a Calzone. Crust Chandler Simply Italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. What a rip off. Just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. I was with 4 people. That's 50 people in day. I think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good Italian is. It sad that so many people accept this."
