b'I thought this place would be super good & a new sushi spot to come to but I\'m going to pass. Our server was great, very nice & attentive although we were the only customers for a whole hour. The ambience was a little "weird" arriving. No music just silence. I had shumai, nigiri, tempura,  fried noodles and oyster shooters. The food wasn\'t anything special I feel like it lacked taste. The side of fried noodles was just.... fried noodles, no veggies or meat in there. After having tempura I had to take benedryl on the ride home because I was having an allergic reaction to the shrimp which is caused by being undercooked. That was my first and last oyster shooter I\'ll just say that. I was really optimistic coming here but left with an allergic reaction. Sorry bonzai.'
