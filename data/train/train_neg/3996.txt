b"Came here on a Sunday expecting to have a decent breakfast. Twice baked croissant was soggy and texture was not right. Espresso drinks were not hot and there was a bunch of sweet syrupy stuff in the bottom of the cup that left a bad aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Waitress couldn't find our table since we sat outside and food never came. I expected more from the uptown Amelie's. I've been to all there locations and enjoyed the noda spot the most, however I think it's time to stop frequenting this chain. Still liking mama's in pineville for good coffee and sandwiches."
