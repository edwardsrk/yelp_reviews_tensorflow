b"I just noticed this place popped up the other day and was interested to try. There are no good yogurt places in my area and I can't say that has changed after trying Yo Fresh.I only got a small amount of yogurt and with some fresh fruit and nuts and my fella got the same. Grand total you might ask? $9.13!?! Yikes. 39 cents an ounce adds up fast, I guess. I've never spent this much at any of the other Yogurt places around town unless I overloaded my cup with gummy bears and circus cookies. Too overpriced, not a lot of flavor options and not as many fresh ingredients as I would like. A lot of the toppings looked like they'd been picked over quite a bit and were either mooshy or messy looking. I probably won't be back."
