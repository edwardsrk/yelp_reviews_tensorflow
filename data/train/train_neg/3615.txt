b'Just sayin\'...I use the "..." quite often. I like it.But, Saturday night we finally visited the new Park Rd. Shpg. Ctr. (Charlotte) located business,  ... (Dot, dot, dot.) We had paid our membership months ago (only $10!) and had patiently awaited the opening of this private establishment that billed itself as a sort of "Speakeasy" atmosphere specializing in classic mixed drinks and tapa-like dishes.Our excitement was extinguished as we were first told that we would have a 20-30 minute wait (outside), but were then escorted inside immediately to find an extremely LOUD atmosphere. There were 4 of us, so we tried different "Classic" drinks. Overpriced for the quality, some were good, but a couple were really bad! (That is their specialty?) We ordered almost every item on the food menu: Arrancini, Tempura veggies, Pork skewers, Charcuterie and Shrimp. Quantities were very small (and we KNOW tapas) and just average flavors. I WILL say that they did a good job with the decor; rich colors, nice lamps, pretty bar and attractive ceiling and wall designs, but our corner booth was too warm and the noise overwhelming. I was expecting white tablecloths, candles, "Crooner" music and good food/drinks....Been there, done that, won\'t be back!P.S. Dessert at nearby Amelie\'s...Excellent!!!'
