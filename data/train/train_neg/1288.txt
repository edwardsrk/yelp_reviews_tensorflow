b'I was very disappointed in the overall appearance and cleanliness of this location. I\'ve never seen a "dirty" Chipotle. The store was not overly busy and the food bar was dirty with excess food spread everywhere. The guacamole had a brown film over it to make you think it was not prepared fresh that day. When I went to sit down the booths had food all over them and I had to wipe it off prior to sitting. The food was good, no complaints there until 4 hours later when my husband and I both are wondering if we have food poisoning. With the cleanliness issues I witnessed, I would definitely not be surprised because things are just not "kosher" with the digestive system right now. I\'ll give the Chipotle chain a chance again, once I break the association from getting sick, but I\'ll never visit this location again!'
