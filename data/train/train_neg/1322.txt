b"So in March (30th) of this year we had Maricopa AC come service 3 AC units (2 personal and a rental property).  The owner Steve did the service.  My personal unit was shot but I had a home warranty (which was a whole different nightmare).  The other 2 Steve said were in great shape.  Fast forward to 9/26 when our renter texted her air wasn't working.  We called Maricopa again as they would be most familiar since they had looked at it exactly 6 months prior.  This time another guy came out, Brian.  He looked at it, charged us $500 for a capacitor and relay (those parts are about $50 on Amazon.com and take less than 15 mins to install), $500 for a can of stop leak (again $50 online) as he said the coils were corroded and had holes in them, and $300 for 5 lbs of R22 (this is actually in range seeing as how the EPA requires a license to put freon in).  We said why does this AC unit have a leaking coil it was installed new in 6/2012?  He said it wasn't serviced well and cleaned.  We said we just had that done in March.  He said most guys don't do a good job of inspecting that is why, you should purchase our service package for $1700 for 5 yrs.  We said YOUR company did service it in March, Steve the owner did it.  His excuse then was Steve is too busy to do a thorough job.  I am not disputing this could have gone bad anyway but Steve could have warned us in March had he actually looked at it apparently.  Well after this $1300 repair to fix it....I should more say band aid it as it stopped working again on 9/30 less than 5 days later.  We called them again.  Brian came out and put another stop leak in it and more freon saying it probably will not work the coil is shot... it didn't, 10/6 it was done again.  We called asked what a replacement coil would cost (seeing them online for $300-500) and hoping they would give us a break since their $1300 repair did squat for us.  They said they would get us a price on it but acted as though a coil would be more than a new unit.  10/7 no call back with pricing.  10/10 we decided just to get a new unit as our renter was in 90+ degree place complaining as she should, so we called for price on that hoping again to get a break....no break, no call back even.   Thanks Maricopa Air Conditioning & Heating for charging us $1300 for 10 days of cool air, phenomenal prices lol.  I'm sure they would respond that the 2nd time they didn't charge us, but when you charge 10x what the parts cost (and considering they were up there no more than 1.5-2 hrs total, no labor is not $400 an hr) you shouldn't charge to come back; and you should have offered us $800-1000 off a new unit.  Worst part was when we called Steve for a price on a coil noticeably upset...he acted as though we shouldn't be mad we just wasted $1300?!?!"
