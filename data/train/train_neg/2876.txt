b"Cute bakery/eatery in beautiful old Montreal. Opt for the pastries instead of the savoury meal options. I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.  I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comt\xc3\xa9 cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs. I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that."
