b"Tried to rip me off!!!!!!! Told me I needed new rotors and new brakes! $370 total. Took a blow hearing that. Called brakes plus down the street, told me that could be done for $275. Dropped it off at Brakes Plus just to find out I don't need those things, only my rotors to be resurfaced. AND there was a customer in Brakes Plus getting a second opinion after being told the same thing from Fletcher!! $120 total. $250 in savings. Thanks for nothing Fletcher's!"
