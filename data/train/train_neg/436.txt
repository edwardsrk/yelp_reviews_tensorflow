b"Solo diners beware: You will be ignored. I showed up this evening to a mostly empty restaurant with loud pumping club music and a deejay talking to himself (?!). The greeters were very nice and seated me right away at a completely empty sushi bar (?!). After five minutes of neither the sushi chefs nor a server so much as acknowledging my presence, I left. Clearly they're not interested in my business."
