b"Stay away from this company. They are rude and unprofessional. I saw their ad on Craigslist. Mandy responded and set up the appointment. The worker she sent was nice but did not do a good thorough job. We paid for a deep cleaning of our home but we were left disappointed. When we expressed our displeasure to Mandy, she wrote a series of nasty text messages. They are so appalling I can't even repeat them here. She threatened us and we had to call the police to have her worker remove her car from our property. This is a lesson to always check Yelp reviews before hiring anyone to clean your home, especially off of craigslist. If I had read the reviews and tips off this page I would have hired somebody else."
