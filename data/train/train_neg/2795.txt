b"There are so many better options close by for ayce sushi. The quality here was at best average, as was the service. The entire time we felt as though we were inconveniencing them by being there. It was several hrs before they closed and I don't believe we were being rude. With Jjanga, Umiya, and Goyaman up the street in either direction you can easily pass this place up and be happy with your decision. These guys simply can't compete."
