b"Warning - don't come on a busy weekday if you are in a hurry.  We came in right at noon and were seated immediately.  The server brought our drinks, chips and salsa pretty quickly.  Good start.  However, after we placed our orders, we waited and waited and waited... 40 minutes later, and still no entrees in sight! Jeez, this is standard Tex-Mex fare, not a 7 course gourmet meal people! So, when we finally got our food, we had less than 15 minutes to scarf down our food, pay our bill and get back to our meeting down the street.  Not exactly an enjoyable lunch - we had to gobble our food down so quickly, I can't remember if I even enjoyed it."
