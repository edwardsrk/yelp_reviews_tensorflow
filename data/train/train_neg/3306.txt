b'This buffet was kind of a let down for me.  I was really exited to go to a buffet that had all of my favorites.  Pho, a coffee station and I\'ve heard from my Yelpers that they had cotton candy too. I\'ll start with the pho, it was horrible.  I don\'t see how they can even get away with calling it that.  The so called tendon was actually huge fatty chunks of beef most people use for pot roasts.  They had no hoisen sauce, hot sauce or sprouts.  The noodles were super small and tasted funny.  I can\'t even be certain they were rice noodles.  Two bites in and I was done.I found the coffee station but the machine was broken.  A little screen informed me only hot water was available.  That\'s okay, I was allowed to have two whole iced teas before the waiter pulled a dissapearing act.  The dessert bar is the best one I have seen at a buffet.  Chocolate covered strawberries, fresh made baby doughnuts, hand scooped ice cream are just a few of the treats here.  I asked about the cotton candy but was told the machine was broken.  Not two minutes later the kids at the next table come bouncing over with their purple cotton candy on a stick.  I guess it was only "broken" for me.  My husband enjoyed the food and said it was well worth the seventeen dollar lunch price based on the sushi alone.  I\'m sure the pasta bar is great too, but I didn\'t want to wait when the line was ten deep.  Not all the food was bad, but even the good stuff is not worth the drive.'
