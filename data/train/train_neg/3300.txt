b"The casino is great here. The hotel is just gross. The rooms are straight out of the late 70's. The carpeting is so gross I don't think they ever clean it. The elevators are so busy you can wait up to10 minutes to catch one. There is nothing luxury at all about this place. The toilet in our one bathroom barely worked. Harrahs really needs to update this stale and just gross place. It's a definite value hotel if you can't afford anything better"
