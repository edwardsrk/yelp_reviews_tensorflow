b'I\'ve always appreciated how fun this place is. Great food and drinks, but dining here during the day is another experience. A little too laid-back for those of us who have a limited lunch hour. Why is it always the "other table" has the fun waiter that is attentive to service? Food was delicious (when it finally arrived), and as always, the fish tacos were great. Be careful of filling up on the fresh, warm bread and cinnamon butter while you wait for the main course.  Obviously this practically became our meal while we waited for our waiter to stroll over with our lunch.If you truly want to experience this place at its best, try the late afternoon, early evening when the sun dips and people are darting in and out of the various stores close by. Great place to meet with friends and sip mojitos.'
