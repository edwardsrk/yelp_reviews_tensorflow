b"This is supposed to be an albacore tuna sandwich, really what I received when I came home was a bread sandwich with a lot of lettuce, A LOT of onions, the cheese and bacon that I paid extra for but I literally had to scrape away these Toppings to try and find the tuna fish which is supposed to be most of the sandwich.  Very poor especially for an $11 sandwich.  Tasted like bread and onions.  Further, the cashier (as sweet as she seemed to be) didn't really know what she was doing, had a lot of trouble ringing it up, and then gave me a WARNING that next time she was going to have to charge me for bacon and cheese, even though my Total included these extras which I was expecting to pay for.  Overall, you shouldn't be even making a tuna sandwich if you cant actually put tuna on it."
