b"The flavor was off, hard to describe but it tasted weird. I had the thai tea and my friend had a milk tea, both tasted weird and we've been to dozens of boba shops. The boba was old and very hard, when I asked about it the staff said that's the way it is and he implied I really didn't know what I was talking about. In addition, staff was abrasive and frankly kinda rude."
