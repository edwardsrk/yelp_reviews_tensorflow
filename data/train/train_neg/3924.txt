b"Heist has very good beer. The only reason I gave them 2 stars. Went for a double date there over the weekend and the wait was a hour and 20 minutes. So we decided to wait and have a few beers before we were sat. (Wild Bois is my favorite.) We finally got sat and our server was okay. They were pretty busy so we were forgiving for the lengthy periods of not coming to our table. We ordered 4 appetizers to share..they all came out at different times. The wings arrived first and were ice cold. Next we received the fried macaroni and cheese balls but they had no flavor..though the sauce they serve with it on the side was good. 20 minutes later we received the pork belly tacos..the flavor was good but the pork was so dry it made it hard to chew. Lastly we had the edamame, no complaints there, they're pretty tasty! I'll return for a beer or two but definitely not for the food."
