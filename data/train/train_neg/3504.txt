b'I have been there. I believe more than once. I was not in awe by this gallery.It was Ok.I thought it would be bigger and have more art, and flair.I guess not.I am glad it exists, I guess its good to have a touch of historical fine art in a casino, since the city of Las Vegas has very few fine art museums.'
