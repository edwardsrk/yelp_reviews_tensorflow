b'Service is not consistent. First time we went, service was acceptable and food was great. Second time was 7:30pm on a Thursday. We walked in and it took a full 2 minutes for the hostess to finish her conversation of gossip with a waitress before even acknowledging us. Then proceeds to tell my husband and I the wait is 35 minutes.   That kind of wait at 7:30 on a Thursday tells me they are not efficient. Not sure if I will return'
