b'Cannot complain about the food but the service needs to improve markedly to obtain a better review. Had reservations and had to mail almost 20 minutes before being seated. During that time I was asked my name several times as well as being asked if I had reservations. Several people who arrived after us were seated immediately, makes me wonder. Once we were seated it took 45 minutes to have the appetizer served, half dozen oysters? Later the waitress left the desert menu while my wife was still on her main course, leaving an impression like your taking to long. We originally had planned to go to the Hard Rock but wanted to try this instead and was very sorry that we did, no comparison as to service and quality. I would give them another chance in a few months hopefully they can address their problems.'
