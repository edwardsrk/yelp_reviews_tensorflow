b"Waited over two hours for my order. I called and they told me the order had left the shop and should be delivered any minute. After another 25mins I called back to cancel the order. What really upset me was they made no attempt to apologize and seemed bothered by the fact I called to check on my order. Probably wouldn't have been so upset if they wouldn't have charged my credit card. I love Antonios Pizza but I'll never use this location again."
