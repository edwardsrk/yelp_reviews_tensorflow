b"SO DISAPPOINTED!  I had been a regular at this restaurant because of the delicious food and the servers.  I went back today after a couple months away to find that they have changed owners, changed personnel, and CHANGED THEIR FOOD!  First of all, the took the professional looking menus and changed them into printed ones with spelling mistakes.  Then, they raised the prices.  The food was not as flavorful and did not have the same taste.  They got rid of my favorite mustard sauce and replaced it with shrimp sauce...not nearly as good.  Service was S..L..O..W..I almost got up and left.  The server was nice enough, but new and didn't know much..I didn't see any of the servers that used to be there.  The only plus is that they now have happy hour until 10pm throughout the restaurant...For the cost and the raised prices, I can definitely do better.  And that makes me sad."
