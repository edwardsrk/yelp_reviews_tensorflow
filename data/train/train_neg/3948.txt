b'Very Disappointed! Not only was the bread somewhat stale, the crackers were past the expiration date.  Brought out the salad with no dressing on it or on the side.  The Shrimp/Vegetable pasta dish had a weird taste and way too much sauce and consisted most of Broccoli and mushrooms with about 6 Shrimp.  All for $24.00!! What a rip off.  Will not have dinner there again.  Way too expensive for the quality of food.'
