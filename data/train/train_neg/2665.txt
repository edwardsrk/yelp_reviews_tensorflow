First I was the only one in line instead of greeting me he takes a phone call, not a quick one.I tried the lobster tacos at 13.18 for the very small portions I was expecting high quality tasting food, it was only average taste and too high price point for serving size.  The food wasn't horrible , but I wouldn't repeat."
