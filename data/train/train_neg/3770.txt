b"Look, it's Mastro's, we all know that it's expensive going in but when you want good oysters you don't want to skimp.We ordered a dozen assorted that were on special.  4 kumamotos, 4 fanny bay and 4 blue points.Of the 6 oysters I ate, only 1 was good.  The others were fishy and mealy.  Just not fresh.  Very disappointing for the price.2 stars for the very nice and accommodating bar tender."
