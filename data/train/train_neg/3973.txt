b"The restaurant seemed a little dirty to me but bathrooms were clean.  Service was ok. The food just wasn't good.  Although I do have to say my sister liked her enchiladas.  My daughter and I felt sick later in the day. Don't think we'll be back.   Especially since there's a new Mexican restaurant in Avondale I really like."
