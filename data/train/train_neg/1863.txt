b'An update on Peoria Ford. 01/27/17Not two days after I wrote my critique, a manager called me, (unfortunately I can\'t remember his name) but he called me not to apologize, or see what he could do to make me happy. He called me to defend Peoria Fords position!! I mentioned that Peoria Ford has 2.5 stars, which is not very good or flattering. His comment was, "Yelp customers just comment on the bad experiences, not the good. So he expects this sort of rating."I am here to tell you, the only thing he offered me was a free cup of coffee the next time I\'m in, and a deal on my next purchase.What the heck was that?  I won\'t be in, EVER to purchase another vehicle or for that free cup of coffee.My advice to anyone, is to stay far away from Peoria Ford as possible!!'
