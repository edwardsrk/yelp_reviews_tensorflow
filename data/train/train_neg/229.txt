b"I like the food here. They are not American Chinese food and really delicious. However, the service is not good. I ask for less spicy several times and the waiter always promise but the food is the same as before. Another issue is that it is always full of people and you might end up sitting with strangers together. Since the business is so good, I think they don't really care about customers. For example, if you ask for some drinks before the meal, they always forgot and you need to push them several times. I hope they could increase the number of tables or rent another bigger place, so I don't need to wait every time. Hire more waiters. Work on customer service."
