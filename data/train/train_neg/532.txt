b"I do not like this airport. They do not have designated lanes for shuttles to drop off compared to regular traffic. When I came to depart at the nearest security checkpoint was closed and the did not provide any signage for directions on where to go. After paying extra for my baggage and showing my id, Ithen had to carry my bag to a different location so it could go through an xRay. It is such a poor set up. The TSA is worst on average with people without communication skills and no empathy. Even people who should know their job with titles like 'lead officer' seemed lazy and like they hate their jobs as such it has made for a poor travel experience."
