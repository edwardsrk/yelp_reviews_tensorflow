b"My friend and I were excited to check out the burger that's rated #1 in Charlotte and couldn't wait to take our first bite of this juicy delight.  Well I hate to admit it but, I was very disappointed once the order hit the table.  We both looked at each other and asked the same question...is that it?We ordered the Cowboy burger and if I had to describe it in one word, I'd have to say it was BLAH!  No flavor at all, dry bun, tiny flat burger that looks like I cooked it at home and barbecue sauce was on the side in a little cup.  The only thing that saved this meal were the French fries and the free refill of beverage to wash the burger down.As far as I'm concerned, I won't be going back to that establishment for a $13 burger, fries and a drink."
