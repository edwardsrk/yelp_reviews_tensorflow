b"I've been a long time customer here every time I'm in Las Vegas. Unhappy they started charged me delivery fee without notice and did not give me my fish sauce and jalape\xc3\xb1os as requested upon delivery. That could really ruin a foodie's meal. Wish I looked thru the order BEFORE I tipped. Very unhappy."
