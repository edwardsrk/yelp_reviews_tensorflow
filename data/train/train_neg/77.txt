b'After hearing about people rave about this place I decided to try it out for myself he other day. Went online and saw the menu, saw the "famous Sonoran dogs" and immediately wanted that to try. Saw that they had an option to order and pay online to avoid the line and pick up quickly. Heck yeah I\'ll take it! Ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. Put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. Another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. Luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. The employee at the counter didn\'t have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup. Luckily I printed out my "invoice" as they call it and sent it with him. Had it not been for him having that paper they wouldn\'t have taken the order. I get it, sometimes technology doesn\'t work right and you get missed. They realized and said sorry and made the order quickly. Now for the food.. we were all excited to try this place as it was new for us all. Every single item we ordered was made incorrectly. Whether it was missing an item that was checked off on the invoice and paid for or just the wrong ingredient. There was absolutely no flavor in any of the food. It was literally bland from the tacos, to the burritos, even the "salsa" was bad. If you don\'t have taste buds then this place might be good for you. I on the other hand don\'t wanna do it again.'
