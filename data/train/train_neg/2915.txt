b'What a bizarre experience.  How many stores of the same kind can you house in close proximity?  This is full of small shops for chinese herbs, small electronics (i.e. cell phone accessories,) beauty salons (i.e. facials,) foot massage/acupuncturists.The only thing they\'ve got going for it here is a bubble tea shop that sells fresh fruit juice and non-poweder based bubble teas with tasty fishball snacks.What\'s worse is that parking can be difficult despite the lack of patrons inside.Oh yeah, there is no "tower" at the Splendid China Tower.  I guess they are just being optimistic that someone will want to launder their money *ahem*...invest further in this place.'
