b'I DO NOT recommend moving into this place!!!!Moved in last November and they enticed us with a "brand new" club house and new amenities. The clubhouse hasn\'t been finished and it\'s almost a year gone by!They also said they would replace our washer and dryer since it takes 3 hours to do one load and it\'s from the 70s. Never replaced after a few calls and messages.Said they would fix our outside storage door and fix our carpeting since it was installed horribly and is coming up with nails sticking out. Nothing.We have to renew our lease since budget is tight, and they tried to raise it on us. Keep in mind the downstairs apt and a few others by me have been vacant for 2 months atleast.Probably going to renew the lease..but that\'s cause of the location and the hassle of moving to a new place.DONT MOVE HEREThis is an update..front office said maintenance will come Tuesday August 4th between 9-11am. And would come over the next couple days to fix things.NO ONE showed and it is already Friday!! They said someone would come first thing in the AM 8/7. Let\'s see if they come.'
