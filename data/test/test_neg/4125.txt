b"This restaurant not with the times. Yes, this is a seafood/steak higher end restaurant but if you are a vegetarian/vegan guest you don't really have an option for an entree other than a pile of vegetables that lack any creativity or unique flavor. The main irritant is there is no substantial protein source, just a bowl of carbs in the fried rice to make it seem like a traditional entree. More health conscious omnivores who desire a flavorful cut of beef are forced to purchase a giant portion at 16 ounces - no adjustment can be made...we asked. All desserts contain dairy and/or gluten, so no treats for those with specific food allergies. When we walked out the door, we felt highly disappointed. If this restaurant hadn't had a nice ambiance, this place would have earned one star."
