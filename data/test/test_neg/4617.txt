b'Well...I work close by, and on Monday I finally decided to go in for lunch.Half of the menu was missing (and is it so hard to erase the missing items from the board?!).The guy serving us was extremely annoying, and would not shut up for a single second, and despite the fact we stated we are not doing a takeout, the food was still stuffed into a carton boxes, followed by a statement that "there is no other way". Really?!So, for $35 we got a very mediocre fish and chips...I can name at least 20 places that do it better AND cheaper.I suggest you take a big pass on that place. They are closed in Annex, and if they will continue the same way - Queen West location will be gone very soon as well.'
