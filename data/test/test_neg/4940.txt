b"My boyfriend and I wanted to give Georges a try for Queen's Feast since we've heard good things. Our reservation was for 7:30 on Monday. We got there and saw that there were maybe 7 other tables seated. The menu looked awesome and the Queen's Feast options seemed like good bang for your buck.The service started out great. Our server was personable and made some recommendations. I decided to order from the regular menu since I wasn't feeling the need to have three courses. I ordered the one rosemary and fig cocktail, escargot and the duck breast, and my boyfriend ordered the ruby bulleit cocktail, oysters, seafood stew, and the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. Both of our cocktails were delicious, but I must say that the one rosemary and fig was outstanding. Very well balanced and not too sweet. Our hors d'oeuvres came out probably in about 10-15 minute after we ordered, but they brought me mussels instead of the escargot. The server was very apologetic, but we waited at least another 15 minutes for my escargot to come out. My boyfriend had 2 oysters that tasted dirty, and the escargot was lacking flavor. Not a lot of garlic and just under seasoned overall. We got our entrees after being there for over an hour. While I was enjoying the company, the restaurant only had maybe 7 other tables seated. During Queen's Feast I feel like they should be putting in extra effort to make a good impression, yet it was taking a noticeably long time for us to get our food after they already messed up my escargot order.The food itself was good, not great. The duck was cooked well, but was over salted. The 2 huge scallion dumplings it came with were good, but they took up space in the skillet that would have been better filled with more Swiss chard and roasted carrots. My boyfriend's seafood stew was tasty. The sauce was good, but there were two pieces of each type of seafood, so the portion was a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if that was the normal portion or specific for the Queen's Feast menu.We shared the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e for dessert. I have nothing to say about that other than that it was creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e. Overall, we were pretty disappointed by the service given that they weren't that busy and that the whole point of Queen's Feast is to draw in patrons who they hope will return during the slow post-holiday months. The food was mostly good, but for a meal that was a special treat for us, I didn't feel that it was worth the price point. We probably won't be going back."
