b"First let me start off by saying that the people here are SUPER nice, super attentive service, and very helpful in suggesting something for me to try that's new.  If you order water, you'll find they give you a tiny glass, but no worries- you'll never see the bottom of your glass.  Someone will always come by to make sure it's full no matter how thirsty you are.  That alone is kind of entertaining to see!  But my review is for the food and it is not that great, I've given this place two shots and both times they have disappointed me.  The tastes here are very bland and boring.  It's too expensive to try it again for a third time regardless that I come to Caesars a lot for their spa and shopping.  On a more positive note, the goldfish are really cool.  There's something about watching fish swim that's relaxing. :-)  It's silly but the fish are the only reason I came back to give this place a second try, atmosphere is important, the taste of the food is more important.  Blah."
