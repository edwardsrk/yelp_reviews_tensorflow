b"NO. Do you wonder why they're giving 2-for-1 vouchers out left and right? We did. But we went anyway. The food looked unappetizing as soon as I stepped out with an expectant empty plate. I got food anyway. It was unappetizing to eat.The only thing that was slightly decent was the dessert, but when you've already lost your appetite from trying to eat the main food, even those redeeming qualities are small in comparison.Save your money and head over to a more reputable buffet in Vegas!If this was my first Vegas buffet experience, I would never want to try any of the others."
