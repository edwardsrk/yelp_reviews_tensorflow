b"We came here for the 2nd time last week after the first two restaurants we tried were closed on Mondays. I was pretty disappointed with my meal here both times.Our first visit, we had the Thai chicken rolls which I remember being good but nothing that will forever stand out in my memory or compel me to order them again. My husband ordered ribs which were really, really good and I had the one potato, two potato grouper which was greasy and pretty flavorless. The fries were good, coleslaw not so much. Overall an ok experience since we both liked the beer. This time around, we both got burgers (mine was the blue cheese, husband got the bacon barbeque one). We ordered both medium and they came out WAY past well done. Just like the burgers I remember my dad burning, err....grilling as a child (not a pleasant memory). Fries were good (standard for a bar/grill). Really, the only saving grace for this meal was the chicken queso appetizer we ordered which was SO good!! No drinks this time so I can't speak to that but overall we have had about a 25% success rate with our entrees. Probably won't be back unless it's for appetizers and/or ribs and a drink."
