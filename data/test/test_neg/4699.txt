b'I\'m giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they\'ve proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I\'ve seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  Another time our white wine was room temperature.  We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn\'t have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn\'t expect him to kiss our feet, didn\'t receive much more than a, "uh, ya, thanks." then printed us a new bill.  There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty "QSA" isn\'t what St. Clair West needs.'
