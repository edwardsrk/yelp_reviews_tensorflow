b'i\'m really hoping i can update this to a better review. i dropped off my phone at around 2 pm today. I was told someone would contact me by 7 pm. i sent a text at 6:50 and didn\'t hear anything. Update : I ended up going in the next day. They told me my phone was fixed, but when I put my SIM card in my phone had no signal. Wookie told me that is was $120 which I just couldn\'t pay to say that I would have to go to the phone store and buy a new phone on top of that since mine still didn\'t work. I understand that not everything can be repaired. But I specifically told wookie I don\'t want to pay unless my phone can be fixed and he agreed when I dropped the phone off.  I tried to see if Wookie would work something out with me because after talking to other stores they told me that paying $120 for a phone that still says "searching for signal" is pretty ridiculous. Wookie kept telling me it\'s $120 and thats it. Nothing else to it. So I ended up going to att and getting a brand new phone. I went to another phone store later on in the day as I also have an iPad mini 4 that needed some work done. I told them what happened and they advised me that it was illegal and that I should ask for my phone to be put back with the broken parts and returned to me if it cannot be fixed. I asked Wookie for that to be done which he reluctantly did do "when he got the time to do it". Long story short. I spent quite a lot of time sitting in desert wireless. From what I gathered some people have a great experience. Some people have a horrific one like I did. I\'m glad I read the reviews before I picked up my phone and saw how many people had problems with their devices and had to bring them back because that\'s what got me to look at my phone and see that I got no signal before I paid. It was previous people that ended up paying for a broken device back or their device running slow that saved me from doing the same. Be very careful. Desert wireless is the cheapest place I found but then again you do get what you pay for. In the end I did get my phone back and I took my iPad mini 4 to a different company which treated me very respectfully ( an issue I won\'t even get into because I got my phone back from Wookie so whatever) but that goes to show you that I can\'t even say my thoughts or I wouldn\'t of got my phone back. Be very careful! Sometimes it\'s better to pay the extra $20 and get a quality repair than the absolute cheapest thing. Most of these reviews were written for a free phone case or screen protector. Let\'s just say I did not receive a screen protector or case. But I did get my broken phone back and saved $120. I hope your experience is better than mine. I\'m just super glad I looked at my phone before I paid or I would of been VERY upset.'
