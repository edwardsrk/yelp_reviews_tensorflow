b'Wow...  this one was an experience.  We went on one of the days it was raining in town and very cold.  It is never a good sign when you go into a restaurant and the employees are all wearing their jackets.  We were slow to get attention from anyone.  Once we did, they were quite pleasant, but continued to be slow.  We ordered the veggie plate and a beef dish.  The odd bread did not satisfy either of us.  It was moist and spongy, and to us, did not go with the food.  The beef was good.  There were a couple of good curry dishes on the veggie platter as was the salad.  We asked for the bill several times with only the owner coming over to talk.  (We are eat and run folks)  When we finally got the bill, he asked us if we wanted fresh roasted coffee which we declined.  Truly, there was nothing wrong with the food, just a strange atmosphere in a sketchy building.  This is another one in town we will not be back to.'
