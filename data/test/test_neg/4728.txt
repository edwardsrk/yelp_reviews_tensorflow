b"This food court, consisting of 7-8 primarily stir fry stalls, is a complete nightmare for an indecisive person.  The main reason is because with the exception of Arigato (Korean/Japanese) & Pho Tai Loi (Viet/Thai), & Dynasty BBQ (more Chinese-BBQ dishes) stalls, they're all the damn same.  Most of the stalls offer Fried noodles, rice, rice with pork chop, spicy fried pieces of fish, etc.  Customers either have their go-to place OR they try a different place each time.  I suspect that some stalls are owned by the same person.I came because I wanted to order from Pho Tai Loi, but by 6pm on a Monday evening, it was closed.  Arigato & Lemongrass were both also closed.  Maybe they're all closed on Mondays.  There are also a coupla places that serve BBT.Food court is clean because there is some sad looking senior who is mopping, wiping down tables, whatnot.I think what would make this food court better is 1) more variety and 2) an iota of being environmental.  When I went to toss my used napkin into the garbage bin, all I saw was a bunch of styro containers.  Not surprising as my people don't really give an eff about recycling.  :S  Frankly, I find this place a bit depressing."
