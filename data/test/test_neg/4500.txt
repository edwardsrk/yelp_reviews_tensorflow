b'Moved here and needed to get my hair highlighted, after calling several places this place seemed to be the cheapest.  Hair stylist was okay, nothing spectacular.  My color came out ok, once again nothing spectacular.  At check out the price I was told over the phone was doubled and the girl had the nerve to ask for tip. It wasnt worth what I paid and i wont go back.'
