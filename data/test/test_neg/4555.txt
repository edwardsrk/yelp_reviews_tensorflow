b"We loved HH's in Anthem years ago so we were excited to have it again when we came back to AZ. No, never, not again. I don't know if the recipe changed or is different per location, but this is not anything anyone would ever crave, want, look forward to eating. This is a notch above Little Caesar's. Overpriced considering the taste."
