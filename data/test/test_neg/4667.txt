b'I\'m giving this bar/club a 2-star bc of the intense amount of country music that was played in the first part of the night. True, I am not a Charlotte resident and I was there with a group of friends, just visiting for the weekend and might have made a mistake in going to a country bar. But nonetheless, I thought at least they\'d play a mix of country and contemporary. Sadly, the contemporary dance music did not kick in until the dance floor was too packed to dance. Drinks are reasonable ($3.50 for a bottle of Miller Lite, $6 for mixed drinks) and there is a mechanical bull in the back near the exit, which makes for good people-watching.On the Sat. night we visited, there was some kind of fire drill which took out the whole place. One minute we were drinking and having fun, the next all the lights went on and we were ushered out into the bar for no reason. Or, at least not a reason my group could figure out. The group of bars in the area where Whisky River is located seem like fun, but the plaza is still under construction and it was a little hard to tell where things were located. We popped into Blackfinn too but it was v. v. crowded. Whisky River is prob. more geared towards the "just out of college, just want to drink and dance" crowd, and if that\'s your scene you\'ll enjoy it. If it\'s not, go somewhere else.'
