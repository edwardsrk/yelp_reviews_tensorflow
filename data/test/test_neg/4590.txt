b'We came here with a group as part of our cultural experience in Montreal, hoping it would be representative of the city\'s historically vibrant Jewish community. Instead, it was a series of cliches stitched together with mediocre food and lackluster service. When we arrived, our table was not quite ready, so we waited in the dimly-lit vestibule filled with artifacts from years past. The old menus and photographs were charming and helped explain some of the restaurant\'s success: clearly they are coasting on a longtime reputation for quality, although they are not upholding it today.Upon being seated, we were presented with bread and pickles, both huge dill pickles and a mayonnaise-free cole slaw. I know this is their trademark and they won\'t ever change it, but I don\'t think a giant pickle is an appropriate amuse-bouche for a steak dinner, and the coleslaw was much too sweet to be enjoyable (the caraway seeds were a nice touch, though.) The waiter answered our questions with as few words and as much condescension as possible: when we asked what made the Special Chicken "Special" he rattled off a list of ingredients, and when my husband asked for a wine list he brought him an iPad with the reserve list (hundreds or thousands of dollars per bottle) instead of pointing out that the normal-priced selections were on a different page of the menu. He opted for a cocktail instead.Our appetizers came: the salmon tartare was very small, the cesar salad overdressed and the house salad uneventful. A long wait for our main courses. The Special Chicken was decent, but overly sweet (a pinch of sugar in the dry rub is nice, but this was practically caramelized!) The steaks were decent as well, though one was underdone and when my friend sent it back it arrived overdone. The best steak restaurants I have visited will confirm your preference so that you know what to expect (medium will have a warm pink center, etc.) but as I mentioned, our waiter couldn\'t be bothered. Sides are not included, but my husband and I shared a monte carlo potato for $5, which passable but not wonderful. We skipped dessert, and as we were waiting for our check, we heard two separate disagreements over bills at neighboring tables (not shouting matches, but loud enough to be heard.) It didn\'t bode well, but thankfully everything was in order.Moishe\'s idea of an after-9 menu with lower prices is an excellent one, but I imagine their goal is to whet our tastebuds for the finery we can expect at other hours. Instead, it cut every possible corner, from portions to service. We had a great time at dinner because we\'re all good friends and took the missteps in stride, but I didn\'t experience anything that would make me want to return even for a bargain meal, let alone a full-priced one. Good food is easy to find in Montreal at any price point, but not here!'
