b'The service is terrible. We waited for 28 minutes for our breakfast which was eggs and bacon. Another guest who walked in after us and sat down behind our table was half way through eating his meal when we finally asked if our food was going to make it to us. 32 minutes later our food had arrived. We were so hungry that anything would have tasted good at that point. The food was decent but I much prefer Sunshine Spot.'
