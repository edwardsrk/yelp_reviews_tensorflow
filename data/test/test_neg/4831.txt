b'Ok so we always drive by Jordan\'s and wonder if it is any good. The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the "Salsa". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let\'s just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that. Well actually it was only a half star and you added a star but since I can\'t give a one and a half stars, you get two. Fellow Yelpers you have been warned. Check Yelp first, no matter how good a deal it seems.'
