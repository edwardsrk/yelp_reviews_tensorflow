b'Food was decent. Waiter was attentive. Music was a bit loud and I did not appreciate the people smoking cigars while I ate. I am sure its because they were "making it rain" on the band performing. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it weren\'t for the cigar and cigarette smoke, which I think is against health code now. Probably won\'t go back unless it is to-go.'
