b"My wife and I came here on our wedding anniversary. There was a live country band playing and lots of people line dancing and having a great time.  Great drink specials and a good western vibe. We couldn't help but notice the excessive number of bouncers that walks back and forth on the dance floor as if they were making sure everyone is on their best behavior.  It almost seems like something is about to go down. I mean these muscle head bouncers had necks starting at the top of their ears. Hey Toby, Its a bar dude not downtown Beirut"
