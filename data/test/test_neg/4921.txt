b"This was the one thing I was really looking forward to in Vegas so my expectations were very high.  Three of us went for dinner with reservations at 5:45pm. I was the only one in our party that knew who Bobby Flay was.  I consider myself a foodie but the others not so much. The dinner menu was somewhat limited but to be expected if the food is done well. All en tree's were $35-$48 with the sides about $8 each (yeah, entree' does not come with sides.) OK, paying for a big name but not super expensive a la Robuchon. I wanted to try several different tastes from the menu so I ordered 3 appetizers at about $15-$18 each.  The bbq duck on blue corn cake was fantastic in a really sweet bbq way, however it was more like a tapa in that it was tiny and not enough to share a taste with my companions.  All the appetizers were really, really tiny - tapas style.  The mushroom quesedilla was unremarkable and so salty, I had to send it back.  I love salt so for me to send back a salty dish, it has to be nearly inedible. I have no idea how this could have happened. My companions had the salmon and she felt underwhelmed with the dish. The other had the rough cut tuna nachos which was basically like Hawaiian poke' served with a side of chips...tasted this and nothing remarkable in any way.  The bread was fantastic and interesting. The sauces were good.  The staff was attentive and professional. I left hungry and annoyed that I payed so much for unimpressive food. I think my companions were a bit annoyed with me for forcing them to go to Mesa.  Apparently, some folks here have had a good experience so maybe my expectations were too high.  Given this, I highly recommend having lunch or brunch here first as the prices are more reasonable."
