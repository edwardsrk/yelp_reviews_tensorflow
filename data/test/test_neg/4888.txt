b"No free intenet at a hotel of this caliber??? Now I know why I choose Hilton...I typically stay at Hilton Hotels when travelling for work as I like taking advantage of my Honors rewards.  When I learned that a recent meeting I would be attending would be taking place at a Marriott I was a bit disappointed as I have been Hilton-spoiled.  I decided to check in early and called to ask about their policy on early check in.  I was told that even though it was still a bit early in the morning that I could still check and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't get any pushback on this.  When I arrived a short time later I approached the check in desk and explained I was checking in early for my reservation for that night.  The front desk clerk had either pulled an all nighter or just wasn't very bright as she kept asking me how my stay was and referring to my check out.  I had to interrupt a few times and re-explain that I was checking in.  When she finally realized she processed my form of payment and got me my keys, etc.  I had made sure when placing my reservation they had my Marriott Rewards # on file as well.  Even though I don't stay at Marriott properties often, I wanted to ensure I credited my account for future purposes.  After she finished my check in, I proceeded to ask her where the meeting rooms for this hotel were as it was my first time here and I wasn't familiar with the property.  I don't think she understood again what I was asking as she walked around to the front of the check in desk to point out where the elevators to the rooms were.  Again, I had to clarify I was asking about the meeting/conference rooms, not my actual room.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the room and furnishings.  As I tried to log in and work off my laptop, much to my dismay, I found out that there is only free wi-fi if you are a Gold Marriott Rewards member or above.  I was shocked as Hilton properties don't put this stipulation on any of its guests, regardless of their Honors level.  As it was a work visit I didn't give it much thought as it would be expensed, but had I been staying here for personal reasons, I would have been livid at having to pay $9.95 plus taxes/fees per day for Internet.  Not that I don't have $10 to spare, but for the sheer principle.  This wasn't a cheap hotel.  The meeting facilities were spacious and accomodating.  My company had managed to reserve every room for the various meetings and breakout sessions that were occurring.  The quality of the food prepared by their banquet facilities was also pretty good for a mass production deal.  Another issue I experienced was that two weeks after my stay, I noticed I had not been credited for my stay through the Marriott Rewards program.  Odd I thought as they had the number upon reservation and check in.  I had to submit my receipt to them again in order to have it credited to my account.  My overall rating for this property was based mainly on the lack of customer service.  I guess I am spoiled by how much Hilton values their guests, which really shouldn't be a feat given that you are a paying guest."
