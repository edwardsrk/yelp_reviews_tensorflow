b"We went here for our wedding anniversary after it being highly recommended... upon sitting down we had rose petals and a special card and the ambiance was warm and inviting-- unfortunately, this was the high point of the evening (and between that and the food-- the only reason why this exp. got 2 stars)... while the food was incredible, the service was not. We had 4 courses in just over an hour... which is fast paced to say the least (we were left with horrible stomach aches at the pace dinner was served). We spent time researching the best place to spend our wedding anniversary because every special occasion is important. Our experience was not what we were hoping for. Our server (lizette) was curt and cold and rushed us through dinner (it seemed as if we were inconveniencing her with our presence). It was relatively slow when we went through, yet -- we were seated right by the kitchen  and could hear their jostling and banter from our table and our experience felt like we were being pushed out of there ... what was meant to be a special celebration turned into a supreme disappointment. To note:: the 70 minutes we spent dining-- not a single manager visited and asked about our food and experience... on a slow evening, the entire experience was a large disappointment. We will not be returning. My advice:: if you are going for food, while good, the experience tarnishes it in a way that it can't recover. I'd spend your money elsewhere on a place that places value in their customers (since this place clearly did not)."
