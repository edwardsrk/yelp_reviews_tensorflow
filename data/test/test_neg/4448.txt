b"This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner."
