b"Good service but that's about it.Food was generally flavorless and in this case, more does not equal better. Too many things going on with the burgers that the meal becomes an unwieldy, sloppy mess. Just because food can be deep fried, doesn't mean that it should nor stacked on top of a burger. Peanuts on table is good but not an excuse to let the floor get trashed. Visited restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. With only 5 tables in the place, the floor looked like it had been bombed.Attempt to offer local and quality products was a plus however the entire experience fell short."
