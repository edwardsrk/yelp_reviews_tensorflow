b'Would not recommend. The room is small and  they claim remodeling took place recently, but all furniture is old. The walls are very thin so you can hear everything. Also make sure you not next to the train tracks you hear all night from your room. It used to be an old train station we found out l ol. It is also very far from the main attractions on the strip. Expect a $50 cab ride from the airport.Will not stay here again.'
