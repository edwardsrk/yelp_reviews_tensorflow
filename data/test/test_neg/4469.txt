b'Sometimes I question my commitment to my own well being.  Not putting on my seat belt right away.  Getting too close to the edge.  Eating food that I think is probably past its prime, but "smells okay."  Driving too fast.  Trying to get my boyfriend to do what I want. Eating at airport sports bars.All Stars is one of those small airport sports bars where folks go because they have no other options.  The service is meh (although, I must say the woman tending the bar was quite quick and capable, and even a bit friendly), they\'re out of most of the things they "offer" and the food. . . well.  Ballpark food is better.  Why I thought this would be a better option than Round Table I\'m not sure.  I had a bratwurst and everything on the plate but the pickle, maybe the bun, was clearly frozen.  The brat itself was that awful white color that screams, "I came preboiled!  Won\'t I be delicious?!", the veggies were the watery, tasteless, came in a mix and were left out to thaw variety, and the fries were room temperature seasoned fries.  The pickle was sad and flaccid, and the bun was, well, it was just a bun.Yeah, it was food, yeah I ate it, but WHY?  Gross.Furthermore, either this article (http://living.health.com/2008/11/24/americas-healthiest-airports/2/) is a crock, or it\'s another terminal of the airport because I saw nary a "healthful dining option" anywhere in the area.'
