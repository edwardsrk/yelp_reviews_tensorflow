b'Been here twice -- one time for dinner at the sushi bar and the second time for take out and both has been a very mediocre experience.The location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It\'s the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away.My dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was.  I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings.The restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn\'t feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I\'ve found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn\'t seem to be actually hamachi and I found their "hamachi" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy.The two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV.  The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer\'s comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting.The cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish.I decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn\'t have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed).Next time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen\'s Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well.'
