b"Well, correction to my previous review. I did go back there but they did not have the creamy rice soup I liked. The BBQ rips was not great. My hubby's BBQ is way better. My husband had a chili soup and he didn't like it either. Like the previous reviewer said this is the kind of place to you go for experience, not for the food. After a long water play, my kids usually eat anything but the didn't even finish half their order and came home still hungry.It was a disappointment but  I would go back there for their rice soup if they ever make it again"
