b"I purchased a $10 groupon that turned out to be broken into 4 uses... Shoulda read the fine print! I went once and they are supper nice and have great bread but when I returned today I found them closed with a sign stating they will only be open Saturday 9 till they run out. I'm not sure if business is just so good they can afford to do this or if they are ready to shut it down? Either way that was the proverbial nail in the coffin for me, just bummed I wasted my money on the groupon. I would have given them four stars easy if not for the let down."
