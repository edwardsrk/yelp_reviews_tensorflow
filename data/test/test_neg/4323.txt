b"I'm writing this as an update to my last review.  Since my last update,  they brought back karaoke and the drink specials, for which I am happy and grateful. They have also allowed smoking on the back patio again. The bar is still bland, however,  and the only thing on the menu that excites me are the fish tacos. They are the bar tender's personal recipe (kudos to the owners for putting an employee's recipe on the menu) and fantastic.  The wings are also rather good with fries but thats about it. This place still feels like its rolling further and further downhill and I can't help but to think the owners didn't know what they were doing when they bought it. I was there this past Sunday and spent the evening with a whole 6 people,  3 of which came with me and one I believe worked there but was off the clock. Rumor has it that this place won't survive a few more months and that saddens me but its not the same place it was as RTOs and probably shouldn't stick around.  Hopefully whatever goes there next is more successful and better managed. PS.: Calling Restaurant Impossible like another person said is actually a good idea. Maybe try it."
