b'Supper disappointed by " jetlag therapy " + scalp massage as an extra service . The premise itself is super nice , clean , stuffs super polite is the only reason why I gave 2 stars and not minus .The therapy itself was a waste of time . Over 300$ for a super poor therapy really . The therapist didn\'t really knew what she was doing , she didn\'t apply any pressure on the points , I asked her to use  more pressure but didn\'t help though . She was just going back around using same movement for literally 1 hour .The purpose of this therapy it was to have back , neck and shoulders massage mostly , she didn\'t touch my neck or shoulders , but instead she massaged my front chest for 20 min with same rotating movement .  The scalp massage was a JOKE . I get a 10times  better one with any hair wash in a cheap hair shop . She just managed to put me oil in the hair and that was it . Scalp is just the front part and that was it . I would doubt she have a massage qualification because honestly she didn\'t knew what she was doing . Supposed to be a 90 minute therapy ; but was a 70 min . I feel it was rip off and didn\'t worth the time even if it was free .'
