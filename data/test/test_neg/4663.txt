b'Meh.  The good..................- Free parking.  Not sure if we scored it or what, but we drove up right to the front of the gates, drove in, and found a spot about 500 feet from the entrance.  It looked like a "valet" area, but we were able to score a spot, and nobody was there collecting money for parking. - Nice entrance up to the stadium with the stairs and cool sign out front.- Decent smattering of Angel fans who really like baseball.- Right off the freeway, very easy to get to.The bad...................- Clusterf#*#* of a "promenade".  Right when you walk in, you are bombarded with nowhere to walk.  Their "standing room only" section behind home plate and along the baselines are literally right in the area where people walk.  They have a painted line on the ground stating where you can/can\'t stand.  People buck up to that line to watch the game, thus leaving only a small area to actually walk by.  If you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy walking into this stadium.- Ticket prices.  Technically, I got these for "free" through a work rewards program, but even then, they were more costly than other stadiums.  SRO tickets were $21.00 I believe, and that is pretty steep.- Minimal shade.  For most of the game, we hung out under the beer tent just for the shade.  The last 2 innings we went down to our "seats" and even then, still in the sun.Overall, meh.  Too much of a cluster, too hot, too expensive.  Glad I saw the stadium once, but I am not coming back.'
