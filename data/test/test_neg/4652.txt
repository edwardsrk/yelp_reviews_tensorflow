b"Floors were covered in the winter-y salty grime and it didn't seem like anyone was interested in cleaning it up.The lunch specials were small in portion size for typical 'fake' Chinese food (eg. sweet and sour pork, general tsao chicken, etc). The meat had too much batter and there was too much celery and onions acting as fillers on the meat side. The vegetable side of the lunch special had the same celery and onions this time with trace amounts of baby corn and broccoli. Rice was generous.The dumplings were ok. At $4 for 6, I thought they were pricey especially since they didn't taste particularly special.The view from the window is spectacular. The waitress was friendly, but the restaurant was empty when I went in for lunch (?). They play Cantonese and Mandarin music in the background but the waitress doesn't speak Cantonese (?). Free wifi from the pub across the street (FnF). They recommend using debit/cash if the bill is under $15 according to a sticker on the bill sleeve but not sure if any extra charge exists."
