b'Ok so, I\'ve been here once when it wasn\'t a "concert night". The dancing was ok, but there was zero etiquette controlled by the security so people had drinks & didn\'t know how to not bump into others. Tonight, (4/29) when there was a concert here... the fact that they were clearly understaffed to handle the cleaning, is ridiculous. There tables that had 10-12 empty beer bottles, plus cups and shot shooters. No one cleaning, no one as a server, etc. if you\'re going to have a concert night, have it maintained. Make it WORTH the $20 cover charge to get in. $20 to a) not dance because the floor isn\'t controlled b) barely drink because people don\'t know where to go c) not have a place to drink because the tables are disgusting - is awful. How dare you be a country bar to host a country artist and be as disgusting and unprofessional as you are. Be the country bar that maintains the expectations and look of that bar. Be a country bar people want to go to and stay at! The bar service is not only terrible but consistently messy!!!!! Hire bar backs! Hire servers or people who can buss your establishment! It shouldn\'t take 10 min to get a drink at the bar!!!'
