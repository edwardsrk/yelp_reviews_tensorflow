b'We were out in north Scottsdale early on a Saturday and this was the only breakfast place open for miles.Coffee was a bit weak but good. I ordered the chorizo skillet and it came with scrambled eggs on top.I thought it should have over easy eggs but, ok.  It was tasty but a bit dry. It came with a buttermilk biscuit which tasted like Bisquick mix. Love Bisquick but expected an independent cafe to have homemade ones. I also thought it was odd to have a biscuit with a southwestern chorizo skillet.My friend had the blueberry pancakes which were huge (3) and tasty but way too much food. Giant portions of average food. Made me sad because the place was so cute.'
