b'I have done business with Buddy Stubbs for the past several years, but unfortunately my experiences are a mixed bag. In a nut shell: The good, the bad, and the ugly. First the good. The rental department has always been a joy to deal with. I\'ve rented seven different bikes from them and the guys behind the counter are great. If you would like to try out a new model of Harley, rent one here, you\'ll be glad you did. Also the guys at the parts counter, all cool, good to deal with. And yes, the museum inside is awesome. If you have an interest in vintage bikes, do take the tour.  Now for the bad. Walked in one day and they had the model and color of bike that I wanted on the floor. The salesman suggested that I take it for a test ride. After a quick ride, I hinted that he might throw in a couple of goodies to seal the deal, which he agreed to.But then while reviewing the purchase contract I see that he added on an extra 600 dollars to the freight and prep. I said, wait a minute, I see what is going on here. You\'re trying to stick me for an extra 600 to pay for those goodies. Well, he looked like a kid that got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. I said look, I really don\'t need those goodies right now, just keep \'um but put the freight and prep charges back where they are supposed to be. After that, they acted like they couldn\'t wait to get me and my new bike out of the store. Never even thanked me for just spending 15 grand at their store.I have been back several times to purchase oil and filters etc. and when that salesmansees me come in he goes the other direction. Even walked right by him  a few times. Never a, " Hi, how is the new bike?" or anything. Nice way to treat a good customer.   Now for the ugly. My model of Harley had a recall on the gas tank filler neck. Recall notice said that the cap could leak gas unless the dealer ran a tool down the neck to straighten out the threads. OK, no biggie, took it in to their service dept. to get it done.The first thing that I notice about the service dept. is a bit of an attitude amongst the employees. Kind of like: we know it all and you are a dumb ass. Maybe because I had the audacity to ask them not to let any paint chips or dirt go down into my gas tank.As they rolled my bike away the alarm went off. Seems the know-it- all\'s forgot to askfor my proximity key. I hand my key to the guy at the counter and he throws them tomechanic who misses letting them hit the floor(remember it\'s an electronic device).Anyway, about 20 minutes later they roll my bike back out and tell me it\'s done. Well,the first thing I do is unscrew the cap and wipe my finger around the filler neck. There was a lot of paint chips and crud that came off on my finger. Theydidn\'t even have the sense to wipe the inside of the neck clean. No telling how much crud went down into the gas tank. I thought to my self, \' I wouldn\'t have these monkeys work on my kid\'s tricycle.\''
