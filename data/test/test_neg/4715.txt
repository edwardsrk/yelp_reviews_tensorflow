b"Wouldn't recommend this if you're in a rush. Very slow service. We waited over 30 minutes for eggs and the people next to us had to leave before their food arrived because they were going to miss their flight. Also, warning: the omelet are made from a pre-mixed egg formula and are completely disgusting. We sent ours back. All in all, I would not recommend."
