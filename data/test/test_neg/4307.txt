b"They're usually good for quick service and great meals but are TOTALLY not a good deal for holidays. I know tourist are usually not as picky about seating but some are so obnoxious and inconsiderate of those other diners waiting. Also, while there were PLENTY of seats, the host did the WORST job of seating EVER! If the table is clean and has enough room for the customer's party amount, SEAT THEM! PROBLEM SOLVED! Sorry, no tip today!"
