b"Wasn't totally impressed here.   Went in for a gel pedicure.  Was greeting right away and asked to pick a color.  I picked my color and showed it to my nail technician (Lan).  She asked another technician to get her the color.   After some back and forth in another language, the other technician gave her 2 different polishes.   Lan and/or the other technician never told me they didn't have the color I wanted.   I had picked a coral/pink with glitter.   Lan put 2 coats of a coral/pink plain polish and topped it with red with glitters.  Maybe they thought that would work, but not my toes are a dark red with glitter - not what I asked for.    Additionally, I was surrounded by other patrons getting pedicures and they were all offered a beverage (water, wine, etc).   I was never asked about wanting a beverage or anything else.   Was not impressed!"
