b"This place is over rated for sure. The waitress drops 2 tap waters on the table (super chlorine), I say UMMM we dont want water ( Saving LAKE MEAD water ) She said OH! So its 815pm and the entire Korean staff is filling the soy sauce bottles. I'm like wow they don't close till 11 p.m. how about some customer service. AYCE is only 60 minutes! Haha... She finally comes over I say do you speak Japanese ? She says no!  I say do you speak Korean she says yes then I start speaking Korean and she is stunned! JKKUHL bomb dropper! lol  Funny stuff...   Great news our waitress left at 830pm Haha....  more coming as we are waiting for our cooked food seems it takes a lifetime to cook.  THE CRAZY THING IS NO ONE IS HERE!"
