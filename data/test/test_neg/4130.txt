b"This is our second trip to this place. Had combination platter. The shrimps are wrapped with thick flour, chicken barbecue & ribs no taste. The whole platter hardly have any flavors. General Tsos chicken practically soaked in water. Singapore noodle fairly dry. On our first trip, we thought we found a nice restaurant where we can visit once in while. Soup was great. General Tsos chicken, which is my favorite was good as well. But after this second visit, I don't think I'll ever be back. Sorry, they could have made some delicious meals for our dinner."
