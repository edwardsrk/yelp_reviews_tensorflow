b"Fun and good value happy hour. But there are just too many places within a half mile that are doing the same thing and doing it better. Makes me think of the divey old pookies... A place where you don't go for food, but good company and tasty beverages.  ...and a drag show (if that's your thing).## the scrambled egg special with jalape\xc3\xb1os and peppers was dead and overlooked. DEAD. Think: chafing dish, serving spoon and steam table. Ugh. Small details missing, reflected everywhere including the kitchen. Stop trying so hard, just get good at a few things and let the booze do the rest. # water glass chipped# bits of dried food on the silverware# gents' door sticky enough that somebody might think it's occupied# seating upholstery is worn, cracked and tattered# wall to wall kitsch not dusted recently# staff congregates at the host stand chatting and leaningI'm not supposed to care because you don't.  But I do. It means you don't care about my food. And it shows. ## open face tamale is not a tamale, it's a hot mess. Stop calling that mushy pile of barely-cooked masa a tamale. # queso sauce is a wet mess (I'm always wary when the menu has to change languages from English to convey the description). Glad I asked for it to be left off. # nothing made to order. It's just a lazy kitchen with squirt bottles and chafing dishes doing nothing well. MEH!!What a shame. Maybe if they add a drag show I'd be back sooner than later. So far it'll be later."
