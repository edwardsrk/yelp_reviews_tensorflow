b'The $5 burgers are GREAT! but the service is terrible. This is my second time at this location and I got the worst service yet again. Greeting your customer, "How can I serve you?" in a rude tone, forgetting our water&coke, and waiting on our food for 37mins and not checking up on us before or after the food arrived is not how to serve. Of course, the burgers make up for everything, but it does not hurt to be a little nice and give your customers an update on the food if it\'s been more than 30mins.'
