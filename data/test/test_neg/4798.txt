b"I've been practicing yoga for 5 years. I've been going to Aum for about 3 months, also on a voucher, and my experience has been up and down. I finally felt compelled to write a review because I genuinely want them to do well, and just hope that they really listen to the feedback to make some positive changes - not get defensive. They opened up too early and unfortunately because the space wasn't ready and they had a few terrible instructors, this was the first impression people got and as a result, they've lost a lot of potential customers. I've witnessed them get better though - the space has cleared up, the instructors have gotten better and the equipment selection is out of this world. From the free tea and popcorn, to the organic fruit to purchase, you can feel they are genuinely trying to create a welcoming atmosphere - and it is. This is a no frills studio, but there is also no pretentiousness, so it's great for beginners.... that is if you get one of the good instructors. Unfortunately, this is what compelled me to post feedback. I go to this studio for Marta and will continue to do so as long as she is there. There are a few of us who go on Tuesdays & Saturdays religiously because she is outstanding. When she is not there, the owner Wally-j takes over and what unfolds is 60 minutes of chaos and bewilderment. I've been to a few of his classes and they are to put it mildly - excruciating, simply for the fact that he should not be teaching yoga. This is not a personal dig or meant to be an insult - he's a nice person and clearly passionate about yoga, but he does not know how to instruct, plain and simple and sadly, half of the classes are with him. I've never seen a class so consistently confused, frustrated and exasperated. I feel terrible expressing this, but I feel even worse for those trying yoga for the first time and this being their only experience. My hope for Aum is that they continue to hire great instructors and that they truly listen to customer feedback so that they can continue to encourage the community to move toward the many benefits of a positive yoga practice."
