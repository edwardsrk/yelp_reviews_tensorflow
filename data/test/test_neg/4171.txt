b'Got my lashes done here a few times. Ellie does ok but not the best. Wendy a temp did once and I really liked her only to find out she was a temp and doesn\'t do lashes at any other salon. Katie did my lashes the last time when Ellie was gone- and I\'ll never go back! She clumped together several lashes, I had clumps of glue in my lashes and they literally hurt! Tried to make appointment with owner, Tammie and when making the appointment he said "ok have you with Ellie at..." NO I said Tammie. Nice trying to pull fast one. Only 1 or 2 of the girls are nice that do nails and do a good job but they are too hard on my nails and they started to be super thin. So had to stop getting my nails done there too. Nice place though, clean and decent prices- oh be careful they will over charge you if you aren\'t paying attention. My friend got a fill and they had been charging her for a full new set for months till I was standing there and questioned it!'
