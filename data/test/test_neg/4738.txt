b'The front desk girl took our name and said it would be 10 mins, she suggested we wait at the bar. 45 minutes later and 4 margaraitas later, we noticed so many more people were being seated. As I walked up to her to see what the deal was, she said she was just coming to get us. Yeah right. Anyway, our waitress was great. Food was typical American Mexican....tacos, burritos, etc. Nothing too fancy, and nothing worth noting here. We were in a hurry so we chose this place on a whim...we will plan better next time.'
