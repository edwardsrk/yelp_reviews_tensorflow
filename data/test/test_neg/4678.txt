b"Last night my wife and I watched a show on lobster rolls in Maine. We were craving lobster and thought it would be awesome to go to Cousin's Maine Lobster truck. We drove the 12 miles to get to it and we're simply excited. I ordered the Maine lobster roll, she ordered the lobster grilled cheese and we ordered the lobster tots and a whoopie pie to share. $60 later we got our food and hurried home to eat it. We got home and to my disappointment got a 2 bite roll with about the same amount of meat in it as 3 crawdads. You can see the length of it is about 4 inches. Now the lobster in it was good, don't get me wrong, but from the pictures and the just shy cost of $20, it was a major disappointment. The same went for my wive's grilled cheese. There was a small speed bump of lobster in the middle of the bread and that's it. One bite of lobster and the rest cheese. So the lobster tots were awesome. Crispy tots with a pico and lobster topping. That's about all I can get behind. Unfortunately I was hoping this was going to be a weekly stop since they are right by us every Saturday night. But oh well."
