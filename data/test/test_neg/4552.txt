b'We used Foodie Call for food delivery a couple of times while in Charlotte and the experience definitely could have been better. For one of the deliveries, items were missing and sauce had leaked all over the inside of a bag. The delivery person was unable to address the issues without a ton of hassle. She did leave to go get the forgotten item, but addressing the damaged item was out of her hands without placing a phone call to Foodie Call. The whole reason we used Foodie Call was for convenience. Having to place a lengthy customer service phone call while managing a 2 year old and newborn is not convenient so we let it go, but we were not happy. With the other delivery, we placed an order around 6 PM and it did not arrive until after 9 PM. After calling Foodie Call to ask them for a status of the order, they were very vague and could not give us a delivery window. We love the idea of this service, and we were happy to get food, but they need to step up their customer service game. Give your employees power to address issues on the spot. Have employees compare the receipt to the items purchased at the restaurant, and have them look at the items for any damage, leaking, etc.'
