b"I gave this place 2 stars only because the server was really nice. Other then that i wouldn't recommend it. They have an all you can eat which the price is great but it speaks for itself. The all you can eat didn't have a lot to choose from. My son ordered an order of chicken wings they had on the all you can eat menu and they were burnt. Also asked for no cucumbers for my niece and they never got the order right."
