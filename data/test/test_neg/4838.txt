b'We went there for lunch June 7. My relatives live there and don\'t have much money, so they like this place because it\'s cheap. If you join their slot club (which is free), you get a discount at the buffet. Also, we got the senior discount, so it was less than $9 per person.  They all liked it better than the Circus Circus buffet. I think I liked the Circus Circus one slightly better, but that one was way more expensive.The chicken is really good. The ham was so not so great. I loved their "no sugar added" chocolate pie.  Nothing was marked as gluten free, so I was taking a risk eating there. They had some pretty good salad options. There wasn\'t much there that wasn\'t breaded and fried.The waitress was very nice.  She told us about some other food we could order that was not obvious. I probably wouldn\'t go there again since it\'s so out of the way.'
