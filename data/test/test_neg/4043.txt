b"Don't come here when you are hungry because the food didn't come 40 minutes later. Wasn't busy and only  few customers in the restaurant and I still don't understand why the food took so long???We came 6 people for lunch at 1:30 and we were waiting and waiting for our food, oh man I wish I brought my own food to Munchies while we were waiting.The waitress forgot to bring a glass of water for my husband and he was afraid to ask maybe will take another half an hour.The food was OK, it wasn't our good day that day."
