b"Comfortable bed is the only good thing I can say. They said the rooms were recently renovated but they need to call the show catch a contractor because they didn't finish the job. 2 elevators were out so I could have either walked 4 flights up and down the stairs or wait 10 minutes for the elevator. Cold showers. Water is too hot then too cold. Something was wrong with my heating unit. Every 10 minutes it would start up and make an annoying loud sound for about 15 seconds. I refused to have my room cleaned because I felt the floor maids were unprofessional. As I was waiting for the elevator about 3 of them were cleaning rooms and talking loud about the guest who recently stayed in the room using vulgar language and so on. Coming in from a night at the bar you are hungry. They have no small store or anything to grab a quick snack and the 24hr room service is just sandwiches. The people st the font desk were hit or miss. Some people were friendly and helpful others acted as if you were bothering them. It was about 1 AM and a group of front desk people were standing around and I asked them about room service and they looked at me like I said something crazy. And didn't ask if I needed a menu for anything else or my options in the area. At the end of the day. I would NEVER stay here again.. I would rather stay in a Red Roof inn to be honest with you."
