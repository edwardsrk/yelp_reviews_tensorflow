b'We walked in for lunch, and ordered each of the classic tacos listed on the menu along with a side of guacamole. The service was friendly, the food was okay, with the flavor falling flat. You are provided with 3 bottles of sauce, one habanero, one jalapeno medium and one they dubbed "the mexican ketchup". The venue was dark and dimly lit. Though we won\'t be returning for the food, we might come back to try the drinks at the bar.'
