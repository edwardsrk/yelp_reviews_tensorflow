b"1/27 I always Tip the takeout person but, WHY WHY WHY should I, if you are going to keep during a half a.. job. Yes, I believe I was crazy to spend this type of money on takeout, when my own cooking taste better. They did not give me any lemons or any melted butter for my lobster plate and my order of crab legs, as well as no utensils ect... I WANT MY TIP MONEY BACK because you really didn't earned it."
