b"Awful service, we sat ourselves down and ordered our own food on the table screens. That was the only way that we received our food. Our waiter didn't introduce himself, seemed like he didn't want to be there, and looked awful when we asked for some time to look at the menu. We waited 45 minutes to find out he forgot to put our order in. The only reason I'm giving an additional star is because manager Tiffany came by to check on our table and formally apologized for the inconvenience. Awful experience."
