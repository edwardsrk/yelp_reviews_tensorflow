b'I came in today for a gel removal on my feet, replacing it with a regular spa pedi/nail polish. It cost $5 for the gel removal and $25 for the spa pedicure. The actual pedicure was fine and came out how I expected, so that was nice. Now, let me get into the nitty gritty... When I walked in, I asked for a gel removal and a pedicure, and was directed to the pedicure chairs in the back. My nail tech started soaking my feet and then started to remove my polish as if it were regular polish. I told her they were gels, and she sort of huffed and rolled her eyes. I did not appreciate that; it made me feel like MY gels were a burden to her, even though I had said from the beginning I needed a gel removal. It ruined my mood, even though she did try to keep up conversation after that. As I said, the pedicure turned out fine. Here\'s the kicker! When I was done and went to the front to pay, I asked the owner if I could add tip to my total. He looked perturbed, and pointed to an ATM machine in the corner of the foyer and said that I needed to withdraw the cash for the entire payment. There were no signs that said "Cash Only" and I\'m pretty sure they do take credit cards, so I was really annoyed that I had to withdraw cash and pay a withdrawal fee on their behalf. I would have liked to have known this beforehand somehow, and even Yelp says they accept credit cards! Overall, it was a decent pedicure, but I would not go out of my way to visit this salon again due to the poor service. My quest for the right nail salon continues...'
