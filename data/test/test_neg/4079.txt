b'We had some issues with this particular Embassy Suites Hotel in Coraopolis. First, while the accommodations are fine, there is a $10 per day charge for wifi. That is crazy. I would not have booked the room knowing this.Then I took a shower. Five minutes later I got a phonecall from the front desk. Apparently, my shower had caused a waterfall in the room below. The maintenance man was in and out of our room probably five times to fix the problem and he gave us...a bag of popcorn. I would have preferred free wifi.The final straw: there was a rowdy group of high school students(?) outside in the shared courtyard for hours and into the wee hours. I was shocked that no one asked them to quiet down. It was beyond rude and I felt like I was at summer camp on my little tiny vacation to Pittsburgh in the winter.While this hotel is close to the airport, I will not be back.'
