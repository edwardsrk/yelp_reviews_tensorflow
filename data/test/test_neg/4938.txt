b"$30 for two cheeseburgers, two draft beers , a bottle of coors and a rum/ coke is too much.In these hard times, it's ridiculous to not mention to the customer that fries are extra and will cost $6 on top of the $6 each for a burger. The burger was real good, but not worth $6 and it has shrunk. The order of fries was $6 and not worth it at all. I shouldn't have stopped, even though traffic was bad, I could have taken my wife to The Armadillo Grill for 5 star food / experience at this price, just across the street or gone to Aunt Chilladas and spent it on drinks and had free happy hour Mexican food.The girl didn't even mention the fries were an extra $6  !!! Come on ! I feel raped !"
