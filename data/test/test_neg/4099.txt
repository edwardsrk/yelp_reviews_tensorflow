b'My parents were in town for the Christmas holiday and since I have been to Sapori twice before and had a great experience, I thought I\'d take them there for a nice Italian dinner. I was pretty disappointed this visit. It seemed like they were short staffed, but when you looked around there were 4+ servers running around, plus the owner bussing tables. Our server was friendly, but I think he was also waiting on the patrons sitting at the bar as well as waiting tables. We didn\'t see him much... My mother ordered the Chicken Parm and got Veal Parm served to her by mistake. The "bread" was served in ceramic soup bowls?? It was oddly shaped really small rolls..? The last time I was there we were served oven baked flat bread and it was delicious. We waited and waited for our check when we were finished and our server walked by a few times and never stopped when we were clearly sitting there after our empty plates had been removed. We ended up walking to the front desk and asking for our check there. I was pretty bummed that we had this experience, I talked so highly of this restaurant to my parents and walked out of there feeling kind of embarrassed. I wish I could give a better review for this visit, maybe the next time I stop in there it will be more organized.'
