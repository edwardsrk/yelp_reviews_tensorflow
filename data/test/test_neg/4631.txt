b"Sleepy restaurant near Shadyside. I've been for lunch several times while visiting family in Pittsburgh and it is always filled with retirees around that time. The place is nice and clean with some formal touches (white tablecloths for example). The decor is a bit odd though, with many paintings of partially nude people including a large voluptuous topless woman on the door of the ladies restroom.The food is just okay. I split the swordfish sandwich and crab cake sandwich with my cousin. The swordfish was not good at all, basically a white bun with a small and flavorless piece of fish in between. The crab cake was better (large pan-fried piece of fish with some good garnish). My cousin got fries with his sandwich and they were kind of bland. The beets in my beet salad were flavorful, though I had an up charge for getting that salad instead of greens. In general this place is pricey for the so-so food.The desserts were the best part of my meal last time I went. We got a nice cheese plate, an ice cream sandwich on peanut butter cookies, and a delicious chocolate bread pudding. See photos below. These were again pricey, but at least they were worth it based on taste."
