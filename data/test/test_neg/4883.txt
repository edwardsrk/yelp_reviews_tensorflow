b"I honestly can't believe that McMahon has gotten 4 stars when it honestly looks like it is about to crumble to the ground.  Is this really the best that a world-class city like Calgary can do?  I grew up with Taylor Field (ie. Mosaic Stadium) - it's a sad state of affairs when Saskatchewan is ahead of Alberta in the infrastructure game.  Or Edmonton for that matter when you compare Commonwealth Stadium to McMahon.Why I dislike coming here (and this has nothing to do with the general atmosphere at a Stamps game...which are usually pretty fun):- Limited to no parking at the stadium itself (Pro: Easy access to the C-Train), and I have no idea how one would ever get a parking or tailgating spot.  If you do drive, it is a gong show getting to or from the general area during sporting events.- Chairs with no backs.  Seriously, it's 2013 - I'm sure we could spend a little money getting proper chairs that aren't wooden backless benches.- Limited space in the concourses.  I went to the Stamps/Riders game this summer - it was an absolute nightmare trying to get from your seats to get drinks or to the washroom.  I can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was ever an emergency during a game.  This lack of space is especially evident at half-time, where line-ups for food and booze are very long.  Service for drinks is VERY slow!- Washrooms - I will give them a point for at least having decent washrooms that are generally clean.- Stairs - If you ever have the misfortune of sitting in the cheap seats amongst the riffraff that tends to frequent Stamps games, not only can you expect to leave with a sore back and bum, but also expect to fear for your life walking up and down slippery metal stairs.All in all, McMahon has limited redeeming features.  Time to tear it down and start over again."
