b'I\'ve been to numerous Chatime locations, and this one is definitely the slowest, but as other Yelpers have mentioned it could be that the staff are still new.  My main concern is that all the drinks seem to be more diluted.  They\'re starting to taste quite bland and you can only taste the sweetness from the flavoured powder or flavoured syrup and only with a slight hint of tea.   If you watch the staff making your drink, you\'ll notice they\'ll start filling half of the cocktail shakers from one of the drink dispensers labeled as "ICE WATER".   So I\'m not quite sure, how much tea actually goes into the bubble tea anymore. Maybe they\'re trying hard to stretch out the tea and sell more drinks made with more water, since water is a lot cheaper than tea.'
