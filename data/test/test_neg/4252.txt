b'I have no idea what kind of crack people are smoking in Phoenix. This was the most vile meal I\'ve had in a long time, and without a doubt the worst "Thai" restaurant I\'ve ever been too.In all my life I\'ve never sent a dish back to the kitchen, but my "drunken dragon" noodles were so beyond recognizable as food, they had to go back. I have no idea if the kitchen staff accidentally dumped a box of cleaning detergent on it or what, but everyone at my table agreed that it was not edible.My aforementioned dining partners, luckily, didn\'t have quite as bad an experience as me. However, they certainly didn\'t seem to enjoy their dinners and commented on how bland the food was.As for me, I wish my food was bland. It sure beats the taste of bitter, burnt plastic that overwhelmed my poor noodles.2 stars because the server was super nice and didn\'t charge me for my dinner without me having to ask. And he offered a free beer as an apology. However, it came in a glass that had lipstick all over it.Gross.'
