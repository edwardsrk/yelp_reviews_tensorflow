b'Was a spur of the moment decision to see this, they had some "VIP" seats left for same day and they gave us a bit of a discount (matching some online coupons that we didn\'t possess at the time). VIP seats are assigned and the first 10 or so rows, the rest are first come first serve. First, an "8:30" show that we were told to arrive by 8:20 for to be seated. At 8:50, as we were on our 30th minute of being crammed together with a couple hundred of our new closest friends in the undersized bar/waiting area, I wasn\'t feeling too VIPish, and my mood was pre-soured.Once finally allowed into the theatre, it was like "wow". They clearly spared no expense in constructing this modern masterpiece that could easily make Shakesphere feel at home. Wait, no, sorry got confused. I could replicate the entire theatre, seats, stage, and all, with a $100 Home Depot gift card. It clearly was shoehorned into a spare room. Maybe that was the point, but as others have said, the entire seating area is at the same level, so even with decent VIP 5th row seats it was hard to see everything, back of the theatre to me would be unwatchable.The show itself was fairly entertaining. Not memorable but not bad. The performers were enthusiastic.I\'d say worth it if you can get decent seats at a discount and drink ahead of time so you aren\'t perturbed by the shortcomings of the theatre and process to get in, and zombies are your thing.For our performance there wasn\'t any racial jokes as others have said, and certainly nothing offensive for an adult crowd in Vegas.'
