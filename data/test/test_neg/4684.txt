b'Came in to return some items that didn\'t fit my daughter that were a gift from my mother in law down in Pismo Beach, CA. The guy checking us out at the register was very friendly and helpful. When I called after I left I found out his name was Cj... Anyway we didn\'t have the receipts because my mother in law gifted them without it and like we\'ve done in the past, we just go in and give them our ID and they exchange it. Well a few of the tshirts were "Guess" brand and they couldn\'t locate similar shirts so they couldn\'t exchange them, totally fine no big deal because they were able to find two other matches and were able to exchange them. The reason why I\'m writing this review is because the lady Diane or Diana was a total BITCH! I hope I have her name right because when I called the store after we left to find out her name, I\'m almost positive it was her who answered because she had the same annoyed attitude that she had in the store... she was a shorter, thicker, woman possible in her late 40\'s with brown hair and glasses... what happened was when Cj had paged her in to come up to the front to ask for some help regarding the clothes, she came up and didn\'t say hello to us or anything (which is fine) but came up and was already bothered or in a hurry to run off and do something else... after hearing what I said and what Cj told her she walked off and said call "Tyler" (I think that\'s his name?... he was a tall, younger African American man who I believe was the manager)... he was great! Came up and greeted my husband and I and took the time to go look for a dress and came back and was able to exchange it... EASY PEEZY... anyway although I love marshals I will never be back at this location again and will drive 25 minutes out of my way to go to another one because of how rude Diane/Diana was... The impression I got from her was that it looked like because we didn\'t have the receipt or the Marshalls tag on the clothes that my mother in law must of gotten it from somewhere else... The clothes did have tags on them (Guess tags) just not the Marshalls tag... anyway like I said I will not be coming back here ... she\'s not a good example for her co workers under her because the way I was raised to work is you always put your feelings aside and if you have to pretend to be happy because you\'re having a bad day, well then you better put a smile on and represent the company the way the company would want you to represent them.'
