b"Half the items we tried to order on the menu wasn't available. The conversation essentially went like this: Table (of 9 people): places orderWaitress comes back: Sorry we are out of the sous vide sirloin beef and rib eyeTable: okay we will have ox tongue skewers and lamb skewersWaitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we ran out of lamb skewers and Ox tongueTable: okay we will have the panini Waitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we don't have that either.Table: What do you have??Oddly the sous vide sirloin and rib eye beef ended coming out, which was delicious. However, because of all the ordering and re-ordering, we had ended up ordering additional friend chicken thinking we wouldn't have the beef..so 3 chickens instead of the 2 we originally ordered.The fried chicken wasn't great either, the basket i got had too much batter and i had to use my napkin to soak up some of the gross excess oil - I'd say the Fry or even Kokoya is better. I dont think i'd come back here, maybe only for the sous-vide sirloin or rib eye."
