b'We were invited to come here for a time share pitch. Went to first room and it had a dreadful smell. We asked for a new room and staff was very nice and said they would get a new room in a few hours and to check our bags.  Waited 20 minutes with no line just to check the bags.Came back a few hours later room was ready and called to get my luggage and no one picked up at bell desk for 25 minutes just rang and rang. Had to call the manager.That night needed some foam pillows and had to call four times and it didnt come  for 1.5 hours.The hotel itself was fine but the service was worst I have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world. Why anyone would buy a timeshare here is baffling'
