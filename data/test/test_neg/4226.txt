b"I really wanted to like this place and I had it bookmarked for quite some time now. However, after we sampled a few things on the menu we just were not big fans of this place. We ordered some XLB, steamed pork dumplings, shrimp dumpling, lo menu, and fried rice. As you can see, we ordered a lot. Unfortunately, none of it was very good. I would say the best things were the streamed dumplings. It's hard to mess up fried rice but theirs just really didn't have much flavor. This almost sums up the whole meal. Nothing truly had a lot of flavor. It was all kind of bland and dull. Probably won't return. Service was really nice though."
