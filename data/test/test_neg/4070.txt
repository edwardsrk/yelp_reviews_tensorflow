b"This place is not as good as people make it seem. I'm not into sushi places with all the frills, just gimmie some great sushi and I'm all for the hole in the wall spots as I find them to be more genuine. This place has chewy sushi and all in all I won't ever go back. Save the ambiance and improve your FOOD, Kofusion. You are better off spending a little more at Sakanaya."
