b'I just had lunch at the restaurant; they make good food and the prices are fair; the waitress started pressuring us to leave after 45 minutes indirectly; finally the hostess came over and asked us to leave.We were there a total of 1 hour and had already tipped over 20%.  Good lesson in business---your lack of space became my problem; also, if you had asked rather than bully us out of the place, you would probably have a customer willing to return.  Instead, you will get the opposite. First time I have ever been asked to leave a restaurant.  It was weird!'
