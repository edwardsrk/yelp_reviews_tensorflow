b"Subways is Subways, and they generally all taste the same consistently and have pretty decent quality ingredients. The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. Not sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. He also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt."
