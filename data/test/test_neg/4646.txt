b'I love breakfast. I love eggs. This place has probably the lowest quality mass-production factory eggs Ive ever had.  I ordered the "portuguese sausage" plate & it definitely was not portuguese sausage. Very low quality, super greasy & tastes nothing like the real thing.  The couple stars are only because our waitress was very nice & timely, and their potatoes are seasoned & cooked pretty well.'
