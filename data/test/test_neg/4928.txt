b"I used to come here late at night to order a munchie meal and to my surprise this Jack in the Box location has never messed up my order. I guess I would just arrive at the right time. LolOther than that the reason why I give this place two stars is for their location, there's so much sketchy things going on in the parking lot and in the drive-thru lane. It's not the employee's fault but it's a warning to those who are night foodies looking for a fast food restaurant, this location is not entirely safe for you. If you do visit this location go during the day, you'll still see sketchy people but the area is more publicly busy.Their food is bomb, even though I know it's totally bad for you. However, I always order their tacos or their jalape\xc3\xb1o burger munchie meal. Employee's are chill, they aren't rude but they aren't go happy."
