b'Went on Saturday and got their all you can eat taco special "this weekend only" limited to: chicken, shredded beef or ground beef.I can best compare the quality of the tacos to that which you can find and make for yourself at a lower end casino buffet (think $10 station casinos or silver sevens). Tons of shredded lettuce, bagged cheese, very little meat, huge soft taco shell. Wasn\'t great.We also got a half dozen wings to try since they were 35 cents at the time and they were the smallest wings I\'ve ever eaten...typical buffalo with Frank\'s red hot /butter mix. I hope they don\'t serve these sized wings at regular times.We also ordered a weak frozen margarita pitcher.Service was actually pretty good and the fresh chips and salsa weren\'t bad. Was gonna shoot this one a 3-star but that "A-Ok" rating wouldn\'t be accurate.'
