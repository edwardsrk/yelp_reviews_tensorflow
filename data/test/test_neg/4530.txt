b"Friday late afternoon and they did not have the Samuel Adams beer I ordered. I changed to Corona, again, on the menu, and of course, they did not have any! I ate the wedge salad - great taste, fresh and crisp lettuce. Hubby had their regular burger. No condiments on this at all - no mayo, no ketchup, nothing. Service was less than average; server not engaged. Went back 7 am breakfast on Monday. Server was Kendra and she was awesome! Breakfast was good; nothing special, though.  Kendra was friendly, engaged and attentive. Great decor, lots of memorabilia, music videos playing on all screens. I wouldn't seek this restaurant out and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, but if you're staying at Circus Circus, 7.99 steak and egg breakfast with server, Kendra, sounds good and maybe just wander around and look at the pictures!"
