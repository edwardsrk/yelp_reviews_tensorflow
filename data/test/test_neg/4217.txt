b"What to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that I had I was not impressed at all Italian beef that's horrible I think I could have got better sandwich at Arby's the Greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager I will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while"
