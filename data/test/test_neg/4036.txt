b'Was looking for a taco shop and found this place on yelp and stopped by to check it out.  The staff there was very polite and super friendly, the only bad thing was once we got our food the waitress did not really come to check if we needed anything else.  My boyfriend had to get up a few times to let them know what we needed.  I just think they should be a little more attentive to the customers, also since we were the only ones there.  In regards to the food I did not think it was that great. The beans taste like can beans and not like authentic mexican beans and the rice was a little too dry, it did not really taste fresh.  I got a few tacos and the meat was not that good, it seemed to be overcooked and to dry. It almost tasted as if it had been there all day just kept warm and they just keep reheating it up. The salsas did not really have any flavor and overall I was not so satisfied with my food. I probably will not be returning, and I just think the quality of the food really needs improvement.'
