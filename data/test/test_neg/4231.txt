b"I only gave two stars because their tea is quite tasty and they always have new, interesting blends. Unfortunately, their sales people are extremely pushy to the point of making the shopping experience uncomfortable. This Teavana location is the closest one to me so I've been here several times to get refills on my favorites. Every single time they have aggressively tried to sell me more tea, tea tins, rock sugar, etc. What finally pushed me to write this negative review was the experience I had this past weekend which left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. On the clearance rack, they have some teas marked as 75% off and sold in larger quantities. A friend and I were curious about one of those teas. I remarked to my friend that I was interested in trying that flavor since it was 75% off but I didn't want to be left with 8 oz if I didn't like it. The sales person told us we could get that flavor in a smaller size. I decided to get 2 oz. It was only later when I checked the receipt that I realized I had been charged full price for those 2 oz. If she had let me know upfront that the 2oz size wasn't eligible for the sale, I wouldn't have purchased it. The whole event felt kinda slimy because I know the sales person (who was hovering the whole time) heard me say that the 75% off offer was one of the reasons I wanted to try that tea. During that same visit, the same sales person asked me 5 separate times (yes, I was counting) if I wanted to buy another 8 oz to get to the 16 oz required for their 20% discount. I figured after I declined the first two times she would stop asking."
