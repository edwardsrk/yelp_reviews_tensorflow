b"I went there last night to celebrate my cousin's birthday. With a party of 4 plus 3 children. I came to this Olive Garden first time like 3 months ago, I come here like once a month. After tonight I might think twice before returning to that place. I am personally surprised that one dining trip would make me dislike a place so much.First, one salad was brought out for 7 people, we asked for another, has that simply not enough. The second salad arrived with entries, the order of one of the party was pretty late. I ordered herbal chicken, it was not cooked right and did not taste good. We had 2 waitresses since it is a large party and still could not get a good service.Then comes time to pay and everyone's ticket is messed up. People were paying for things they never ordered and our credit cards were late like 30 min. In summery it was a bad experience."
