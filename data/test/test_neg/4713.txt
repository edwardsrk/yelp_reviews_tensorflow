b'I grabbed the 2 for $20 to go from this location earlier this week.  We ordered the queso blanco dip as the appetizer.  The bourbon street chicken and shrimp and the three cheese chicken penne were the entrees.The to go woman was very friendly and the food was carried out to us within a three minutes of us pulling into the designated parking space.When we got home and looked at the food we were dissapointed.  The portions were very small and since when does "cajun" mean burnt and shriveled?  The queso blanco was okay but a little salty.  Luckily they put the jalepnos on the side and gave us a good portion of chips.The three cheese chicken penne was DRY.  There was barely any sauce on the pasta and the portion was small.The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was a joke.  A miniscule burnt dry chicken breast next to some dry ass potato chunks that were so salty that you could see the grains of salt on the potato skin and about 5 burnt shriveled up sliced mushrooms.One star for the price and one star for the to go woman.  Thats it.'
