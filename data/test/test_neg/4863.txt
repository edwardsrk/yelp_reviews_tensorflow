b"I frequent HK cafes quite often, and my first impression of this place is that it is quite expensive in comparison to similar places around the area. I like how spacious the restaurant is, and how there is a lot of variety of dishes. They also have an ambiance with their romantic 2 set dinner specials catering towards a cute date night.Each dish order comes with either Russian Borsche/Cream Soup with dinner rolls. Bread is rarely served these days so it was a pleasant surprise! Also there is a tea to drink (the lemon tea is really bitter) as well as dessert (lychee jelly with condensed milk) Linguini Bolognese (~$8) - i like how they changed it up from spaghetti. Generous portion of cheddar.Chicken Sizzling Steak (~$15)-  served with veggies and onions. I've had better though.Probably won't come back unless it's for afternoon tea. It's overpriced!"
