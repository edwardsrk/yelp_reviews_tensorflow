b"I went to see Cynthia S. Payne to get a renewal on my contact lens prescription. My regular optometrist moved her office to Henderson so I thought it would not be a big deal to go somewhere closer to get my annual prescription.  I explained very clearly at the beginning that I was NOT interested  in LASIK  and was simply there for an eye exam to get a renewed prescription.  From the time I walked in, until the time I left, the entire staff did their part to try to and sell me the LASIK  procedure. They had me do an unnecessary test which later I learned was used to determine if I would be a good candidate for LASIK.  Finally after my exam was completed, they had me sit with a LASIK  consultant/coordinator to go over prices for LASIK!  Cynthia Payne did an adequate job on my exam, but I don't appreciate the sales pitch, unnessary test, and the waste of my time for their own agenda. I was there much longer then necessary due to all of the sales pitch nonsense.  I will not return."
