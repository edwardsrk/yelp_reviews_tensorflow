b"Here's the breakdown:Food - 5 starsCoffee - 5 starsAmbience - 5 starsService - 0 starsCame to get coffee and brunch one day, ordered the tree of life pita and the turkey club, both were amazing!! Fresh ingredients, healthy organic options, flavorful sauces, and beautiful presentation. The ice coffee was very good too, they brew ice coffee with the proper apparatus and the taste is perfect.My complaint is on one female staff. While we were standing in line ordering we were disagreeing about the drinks option and this staff started to join in and started to reprimand me for my choice and lecturing me. That's extremely inappropriate and not any of her business. Then after we ordered, she was forcing me to write a tip. I'm ordering a togo order, where there's no service involved therefore I do not tip. She gave me an extreme hard time about not leaving a tip and continue to say that I can leave a cash tip. Wow! Talk about hustling! I'm not at the strip club!I'm not sure if I wanted to come back to be hustled again no matter how good the food is."
