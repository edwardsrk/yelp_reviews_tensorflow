b"I was really happy with the massage however Heidi called me 3 times before my appointment while I was driving around looking for the place. Then she texted me also and told me she was checking to see if I needed help finding them because my appointment was now!! Ok so I stop get my phone out to see who is blowing up my phone and try to call her back to find the correct location and she didn't answer the phone. I find the place and I go in to the paperwork and someone comes in the door with kids and a big dog not on a leash. They walk out n and I made a comment to let them know I wasn't comfortable with the dog sniffing me while they walked away! Wow I asked who had the dog. I was told it belonged to the dr. And they had nothing to do with the dog. Just a bad experience! I was more stressed when I left then when I got there.been to this place before was in a different location but I won't be going back!"
