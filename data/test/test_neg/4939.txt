b"This place is god to hang out for the fact that it has a dance floor and for its proximity of being in downtown. We were there just for drinks. The most awful experience was they took cover charge from us, gave us a wrist band and when I had to step out for a phone call and step back in within 15 min, the woman at the front charged me another 5$ saying I didn't get a stamp on my hand. Neither was there anyone at the exit to stamp nor anyone informed that we have to get a stamp on our hand. It's not about paying 5$ but the desperation to make that money when they could see the band on my hand and understand that I was admitted. Neither she or her bouncer was willing to listen. I could have thrown 10$ for their desperation."
