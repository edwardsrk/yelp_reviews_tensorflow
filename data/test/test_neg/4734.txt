b"Let me start off by saying that I love to shop at Smith's Food, just NOT THIS LOCATION.  I live very close to this store but will drive several miles out of my way just to avoid this store. I will only go to this store if I am in desperate need of something quick. There are always tons of beggars and homeless people in front of the store and in the parking lot. You cannot get into the store or out of the store without being approached. I have told the security guards this is annoying and disturbing all the time but they always say there is nothing they can do about it.  It is very annoying and can be scary, but once you get into the store, the employees are very nice and very accommodating in helping find things and they do have good prices and good selections.  Going into the store is like a game, thinking ok once I get out of my car, which way should I attempt to get into the store quickly. No one should have to shop like this. They are not just begging for money, they are also rude. They asked my husband for money and he ignored them and they called him very bad names one time he went there. He refuses to ever go there again. He said he doesnt care if he has to pay double at another store but will not step foot in that area ever again."
