b"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple years, they've changed some things.  I was okay with some changes, until it got to the recipes.  The lobster cabenara was a family favorite, but they switched out the angel hair (or thin spaghetti) for regular spaghetti, and instead of chunks of roasted garlic, they now use some kind of garlic sauce or minced garlic.  For me it took away that homemade flavor away and made it more of a pre-packaged Nesley's special.  Either way, the change was not an improvement, and made me feel as though it was a way to cut corners while charging the same prices.  I'm not a fan of noticeable changes to menu items when it's not in the interest of improving on them.  I went from visiting at least 9 to 10 times a year to not even being a customer at all."
