b'I\'m going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You\'re kidding, right?!"+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I\'m sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There\'s no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I\'ve had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I\'ve stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? Enough said.'
