b'I have been to 168 Sushi Buffet several times and most recently a few weeks ago. The restaurant is a standard iPad order setup as many other AYCE Sushi places, however they added a buffet bar for items like the salads, desserts and also where you get your wasabi.  I am not a big fan of the mix of iPad and buffet bar, and would rather have everything ordered by iPad and delivered to the table.  This restaurant has gone downhill a bit over the past couple years and there is also a lot of other options in the AYCE Sushi market right now.'
