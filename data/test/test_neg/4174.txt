b"The food is amazing, just like every other time that I have been here. The service on the other hand, not good. I love going to OG because I get my money's worth, but the waitress we had today refused to give us another order of soup and said we couldn't take any breadsticks to go (after telling her other OGs have let us, she gave in). In addition, there was a point in time when she didn't come check on us for 30-40 minutes. I would understand if there was a bunch of people in the restaurant, but we were one of the very, very few tables she was serving. Disappointed but will come back again. Hopefully service will be different."
