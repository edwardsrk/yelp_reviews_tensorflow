b"This review is based on my lunch experience at Li's House 1988. The lunch menu is quite extensive with entree, noodles, dim sum and more. We ordered a few items to share so we can have a taste of what they offers before we come back for dinner.\xe8\x92\x99\xe5\x8f\xa4\xe7\xbe\x8a\xe8\x82\x89\xe9\x9d\xa2 ($7.99) Mongolian Lamb Noodle Soup - tasted homemade in a bad way\xe5\xb0\x8f\xe7\xb1\xa0\xe5\x8c\x85 ($4.50) Steamed Soup Dumpling - doughy and heavyVeggie Pancake ($2.50) - hardly have any filling\xe8\xb1\x86\xe6\xb2\x99\xe9\x8d\x8b\xe9\xa4\x85 ($2.50) Red Bean Pancake I found most of the dish we ordered were mediocre at best.
