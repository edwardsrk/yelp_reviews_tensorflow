b"We may have come during a really bad day here. We came here for a Father's Day brunch and we were probably the 5th party in the restaurant (there were 6 of us including 2 children). They had 2 servers for the restaurant and they both appeared to be struggling to keep up with their customers. We were seated and roughly a little over 20 minutes later they came to take our order (they served 2 parties that came in after us before they served our party). Our food arrived 33 minutes later and the serving of eggs both on my husbands plate as well as the side of eggs had hair in both. I did however order the French toast and it tasted good. While the food I had may have tasted good, the experience was overshadowed by poor service. I hope things get better here."
