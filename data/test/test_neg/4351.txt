b"Expensive and not yummy Chinese food. If you are Asian, this is NOT the Chinese restaurant for you. Everything is very salty. The price for the food (dim sum or order dishes) is more like $$$. The waiter /waitress here doesn't speak fluent Mandarin, or Cantonese or English. So be prepare to be able to say 3 different language when order food or ask for drinks. They also don't smile and seems very inpatient. Good luck trying to wave them down."
