b"Jackie Bee's has the prime setup; located next door (with a connecting door and all) to a gamer's paradise, PVP Zone, a 24-hour Internet and video gaming cafe and it's also right across the street from the College of Southern Nevada. I peeped a lot of World of Warcraft action happening in the back. Good work nerds. Great location for students to post up, do homework, level up and bleed all of their allowances.However, high hopes can't save you when the boba fails at all of your (reasonable) expectations. The menu is way too large for their own good and I can guarantee you, in a sea of mediocre, you will only find one decent item on the menu (cough: Thai iced tea- minus the boba.) Pricing is competitive: ranging from $3.50 for a medium - $5 for a large. However, they really messed up the art of milk tea and even the potted plant (plantation) tea; it tastes like dirt and water for real. The tea flavor is nonexistent; I really just tasted water, the crushed Oreos do not enhance the drink, just makes it gritty and taste dirty. Even when sending the drink back for improvement, the drink comes back tasting the same. What in the world? The boba here is legit nasty. Like, I was actually offended with the 2 drinks we ordered. I had a look of pure disgust on my face as my drink was delivered to me with thick syrup and black mush on the bottom of my milk tea. Yeah, you guys, that's the boba. It is shockingly overcooked and gooey. Honey boba you say? Ha! Even Honey BooBoo would be offended.The only reason why I will be nice and not give them a 1 star rating is because the kids working the counter are young and sweet, but man, they need help! Someone seriously needs to step up the leadership game. Please fix what's broken: drink flavor, quality, and dear lord - THE BOBA!"
