b'I had my reservations about going to an upscale Mexican restaurant because we all know the best Mexican food can be found in Da Hood at a real dive!  However, against my better judgment, I decided to give this place a try!  NOTE TO SELF: TRUST YOUR DAMN GUT!  The atmosphere is lovely but the food is quite marginal!!  The food is a bit too busy with too many ingredients because they are trying to be upscale and different!  I ordeed the enchilada veracruz,.which was supposed to be a chicken and spinach enchilada with jack cheese and tomatillo sauce! There was little to no cheese, I could barely see the sauce and it had no flavor!! The only saving grace was the wonderful bartender who exchange my dish for tacos!   Will trust my gut next time!'
