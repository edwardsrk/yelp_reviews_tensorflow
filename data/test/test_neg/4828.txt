b"Food was amazing! The service lacked so bad. So so so so bad. To the point where I almost got up from our party and ordered from the bar. The drinks were very watery but no waitress to say anything to. We were there for 2 hours and seen her only twice and one of them was bc she was told she could go home so she wanted to give our party of 11 all of our checks. Were in the middle of eating when this all happened. We said fine as long as another server came by. She brought the check and it was completely wrong. Once we paid we did not see another server until asking for one. Thankfully the second server was nice but holy moly! We wanted to make sure this would be the place to celebrate 5 birthdays this month but more than likely not if a server couldn't handle 11 people I cannot imagine our party of 20-25 being taken care of."
