b"Atmosphere was great and people were nice, but those were the only things I enjoyed. The staff was very unprofessional. They bickered with each other, the manager complained frequently about no-shows, and the bartender talked my ear off about strip clubs. The bartenders also had disgusting habits that lead to contamination, such as coughing on their hands before grabbing the rim of my drink and putting tickets on top of glasses. The food was subpar for the price. I ordered the club, which comes with a chicken breast on it. The chicken was fully cooked, but very cold...this was at 11AM so it had to have been cooked the night before and put in the fridge.I will not be returning to this place...I don't want to get sick."
