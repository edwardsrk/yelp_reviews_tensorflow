b'Waited to be seated despite having a reservation and then waited 15 minutes to meet our waiter. 65 minutes after our reservation time was when we got steaks. Steaks were not trimmed properly (1/2" ring of fat around mine), were underseasoned, and weren\'t charred in the way I\'d expect for something in the $50 range. The second star is because it\'s entirely possible that my experience was just bad luck based on the other reviews.'
