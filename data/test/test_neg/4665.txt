b'We were in South Pointe a little bit ago and when we walked in we immediately felt a weird vibe. Instant paranoia and had a "look over your shoulder" type feeling. We went there for a little gambling and a dinner special they were having and due to their limited availability we did not get the special. We decided to just gamble a bit. After finally looking for someone we ordered a coffee at the bar.  It was 11pm at night and we were told the kitchen was closed. They actually told us its too late for coffee. We gambled a little more and this place just gave us the creeps. Here is the thing... We came up with friends recently (a few weeks after our  original encounter). We never said anything about our experience and our friends asked if we could go to another casino because they didn\'t like the "feel" of the casino. It was then we told our story and took off.'
