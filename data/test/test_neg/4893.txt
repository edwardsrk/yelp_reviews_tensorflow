b"Returned there again to give it another shot.   Inattentive wait staff and very slow service sort of highlighted this visit.  The food was okay but to watch ticked off people sitting around waiting for their food and drinks didn't create much of an atmosphere.  Lunch crowd was very light and still the service was pretty slow."
