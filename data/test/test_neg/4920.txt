b"I was craving Pad Thai really bad one time so I tried this place out.  I was hormonal and I actually cried because the Pad Thai was so bad. The noodles were over cooked and it had a weird aftertaste almost like a cockroach. It's hard to explain but I never came back. The Thai tea was good though. I was just so disappointed that they can mess a Pad Thai up."
