b"We went here on a fluke as the place we wanted to go had a long wait.  This place didn't have one and now we know why.   The owner or manager was rude to us from the start. We were seated then ignored for about 10 mins.  We started to look at yelp and looking for other options as we were ready to just leave since we weren't being served.  The manager picked up on our conversation and proceeded to tell his wait staff to get over to us NOW.  We finally got a waitress, and proceeded to order.  First of all they charge for bread.  Regular or garlic.  Which is fine. But they offer it like it's free and then there is the fact that it is stale and awful.  The portions were small.  The flavor was eh.  And the service was bad.  I also noticed the manager cleaning a table, putting his fingers in the dirty glasses, then going over and making roll ups of silver ware.  I watched as he touched the tongs on the forks with his dirty hands.  That alone is reason enough for me to NEVER go back.  Basically just an awful experience.  And no wonder there was no wait at 7:30pm on a Friday night."
