b'The restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating to our large group, but I found the food to be very mediocre for a Mexican restaurant. When I asked the waiter for some hot salsa to literally spice up my very plain vegetarian quesadilla (cheese, spinach, and mushrooms in a bleached white flour tortilla), I was given two small bottles of hot sauce, rather than a small cup of fresh salsa or fresh jalapenos. This was very disappointing to me. I expect fresh salsa when I ask for some salsa in a Mexican restaurant. I can buy hot sauce to use at home. I want FRESH ingredients when I\'m at a restaurant. When I tried both bottles, and they still weren\'t very hot, I asked if there was anything else I could add to my food because, I explained, "I like hot and spicy food." Then, he brought me two more bottles of hot sauce, and a very small container of a green salsa. It was OK, but the flavor was nothing special. The bottles of hot sauce were also just OK. (Although, one bottle of hot sauce WAS highly entertaining for its name, "One Fucking Drop at a Time!" Seriously. I\'ll post pics when I have time. That was really funny!)The quesadilla was edible, but nothing special, and nothing that I would go out of my way to eat again. There really wasn\'t any seasoning or spices used. It tasted very plain, which is why I wanted some hot salsa. Maybe their meat dishes are better, but I\'ve become a vegetarian and haven\'t eaten meat since Jan. 1, 2014. There were very few options for vegetarian meals.The highlight of the meal was the guacamole, which was very good on my plate, but not so much on my head! One of the waiters (while clearing the table) had overloaded a tray with plates and accidentally dropped one of the plates with leftover food RIGHT ON MY HEAD! I felt the plate (and food) land on me from behind, and then it fell over my shoulder, onto my lap, and onto the floor! I ended up with guacamole in my hair! I wish someone had recorded a video of the dish falling on my head because I\'m sure it would be hilarious to watch, and I missed my opportunity to become a YouTube sensation! LOL. Fortunately, I sustained no damage, and I\'ll bet my hair will be extra shiny this week due to the guacamole conditioning treatment that I received at no extra charge. I would go back to Casa Reyna if I was with a group that wanted to go, but I would not seek it out myself. The selection is kind of slim pickings for vegetarians. But, the staff is very nice. I have no bad feelings about the dropped plate. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. I was a waitress in college, and my nickname was "Crash!" LOL. But, I never dropped food on anyone\'s head. I just dropped a tray full of glasses on the floor once at C.J. Barney\'s in Oakland...about 32 years ago. Damn, I\'m old. :-)'
