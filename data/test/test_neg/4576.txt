b'Place was empty on Friday afternoon at 2pm. I had the Burrito with carnitas. Lots of pork, but it was dry. Chipotle burritos are better. Wife had pink tacos and they were good, but she had to vut them up, impossible to pick  up with all the stuff in it. Service was mediocre. I downed my soda pretty quickly and was never offered a refill until we were leaving...my fault for being a camel, but we were sitting outside in the desert.'
