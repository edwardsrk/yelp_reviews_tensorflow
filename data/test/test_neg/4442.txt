b'Overall not a bad Hotel, got a decent price online, a convenient location, but the maintenance of the room was really lacking. Small rooms compared to other places I stayed. Bed squeeked, NO firm pillows so bring your own, my window shade was broken so I had no view, the bathroom shower had no door and a stupid hole in the one section of glass to allow you to turn the faucet on and adjust temp-Ive seen this concept executed more efficiently in other similar showers where the controls are on an oposing or side wall relative to the shower head so you can set the temp before getting in. A neat but unpractical design-the water spilled right out of the hole onto the floor and water everywhere. I was also freezing while showering since there was no door. Coffee maker was broken and filthy and why is it they never give you enough cream packets? Very average soaps and shampoos the kind you leave behind.  The staff was pleasant, breakfast was ok but overpriced for what it was. $10.00 for 2 slices of French toast with a few berries, presentation was amateur...not a good hotel for long term stays, one or two days at most, for a little more money finer places are available. Parking was easy but weird, I just parked on the street it was easier.  If you are overly discriminating this hotel is not for you. No bellmen, and the front desk is on the second floor so you have to do your own shlepping up the elevators with doors that scrape the floor and sound like finger nails running over a blackboard.'
