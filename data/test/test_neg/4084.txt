b"Well, on the one hand it's just Starbucks.  On the other hand it's close and open later than any other coffee-serving place in a 2-block area.  So it gets a lot of credit for being there and being available.  But they also play a lot of Christmas music; more than anything else on the planet I hate Christmas music.  So during the next month if I want to come here (or any Starbucks) I have to have upbeat music blaring in my ears to drown it out.  That's not convenient. That level of inconvenience for over 1/12 of the year definitely costs them a star."
