b"Terminal 2 is where United is and I have been here a few times. Easy to navigate, but really disgusted with the tsa security. They check through my belongings with dirty gloves that they use to check others bags and touch other luggages. This is the most gross I've ever experienced because people typically change or get new gloves for each bag. Disgusting .. now I need to wash al my clean clothes over because of those dirty gloves with brown stains on it."
