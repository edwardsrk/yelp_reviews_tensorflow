b"The view is fantastic, and the steak was ok.  My colleagues had terrible food.  The Buffalo calamari was so salty it could not be eaten by two of the people with me.  The coconut shrimp was burnt and cold.  The service was absolutely terrible, and I don't know why, because they weren't that crowded.  Will I come back?  Yes, because I want to give them another chance. I was here a couple of years ago, and had a much better experience."
