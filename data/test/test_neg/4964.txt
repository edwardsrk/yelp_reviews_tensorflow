b"Walked in on a Thursday night to be told they've ran out of chicken at 5:30pm. Okay fine... understandable, stuff happens. 15 min wait? No problem I'll wait. Lady walks in behind me gets told the same thing, she looks a little upset but whatever, gotta wait just like me.  What bothers me is when I come back 20 min later expecting my order to be ready and chicken is nowhere near cooked, and the lady that was behind me already got her order and left!!! Did you just give away my food? Ended up waiting 35minutes for some 'fast food chicken.' Sure was fast. Staff/Service: The cashier at the front seemed nice and seemed to care but the rest of the staff seemed absent minded. Whats worse, David Adjey was around and nobody even seemed to be working hard at all to push out orders.Food: You'd think the long wait for the freshly roasted chicken would of been worth it? Not at all. Chicken was dry, underseasoned.... bland....The only thing worth getting here is the potato salad, which tasted pretty good. But a takeout chicken restaurant with bad chicken???? Gimme a break. 1.5stars/5 but I'll give it a 2 just because of the potato salad. Conclusion: Not coming back again for sure and would not recommend. Whole chicken + 2 sides for 24 bucks... If it had been amazing or even half good, I would pay that price, but not for this crap. Rather buy a roasted chicken at Whole Foods or Longos or something. Service was terrible too.... ridic."
