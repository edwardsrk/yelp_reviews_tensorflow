b"I'll echo Katie S. in saying BOGO rolls everyday are enticing. Unfortunately that's where Akahana's appeal ends for me. The restaurant smells funny when you walk in. I think they try to use a fragrance or deodorizer, but I always smell chlorine/bleach undertones. I've been a couple times when friends have tried to sell me on it and I've never been impressed with the food or the service. Edamame was over steamed and mushy. The waitress on our last visit was admittedly new, but couldn't speak to the menu and messed up our payments when closing our tabs. While I paid with a credit card and left a cash tip, she ran my friend's meal and tip on my card, and mine on his. Of course she returned the right receipts afterwards, so I only caught it when reviewing my credit card statement a few weeks later. Rather than processing a refund to my card I had to return to the restaurant when a manager was working and get a cash refund. Not impressed."
