b"This location's prices are absolutely absurd.  Just 2 hours ago, I paid $6.98 for a medium Original yogurt with 2 toppings.  That's $7 dollars for a cup of frozen yogurt.  Mind you, the medium cup looks quite large, but with this being Pinkberry, they filled about 60% of it with actual yogurt.  (This, however, tends to be a fault with all Pinkberry locations.)  The flavor and quality is not that spectacular that it warrants such incredibly premium pricing.I blame this on Charlotte.  It's a good town, but there is absolutely no competition in frozen yogurt.  Explains how Pinkberry can get away with $7 for a medium cup of yogurt - same goes for the location in Southpark Mall.  I found it shocking and appalling, truthfully.  Shocking & appalling.  Red Mango (along with independent business owners), please jump on this and teach Pinkberry a lesson.  Thank you.2 stars instead of 1 because of fairly good Pinkberry froyo consistency, quality & having the staple toppings (specifically mochi - also try lemon cookie crisp, actually very good)."
