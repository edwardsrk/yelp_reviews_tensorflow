b'Eh. It was okay. The pork chop was interesting. Lots of different flavors I didn\'t expect. As for the desserts, take a pass. I really wanted sweet or at least good chocolate. The "choc" cake was spicy and the dessert I got with the caramel cake tasted sour. Not what I was expecting at all for an $80 bill. The ambiance inside was awesome though despite the beggars outside.'
