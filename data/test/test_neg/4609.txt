b'Our group of 3 decided to eat here after a long day of walking in the city. We thought we would try this little joint for some dinner.We ordered a pretzel which was really good. It came out warm and soft and was served with what I assume is homemade Dijon mustard. The schnitzel was also good but not memorable. The outside had the perfect crunch and crisp but I would have preferred it served with a sauce rather than butter. My biggest issue with this restaurant is the service. When my table ordered waters to start (which after the day of walking we had, we could not get enough water) and as our waiter was walking away he made a comment that made me feel awkward for the remainder of my meal. I am not a walking dollar sign and I appreciate not being treated as such. Considering the place was almost completely empty when we sat down, this little hipster gastro pub was lucky to get our business. Though the food was good, this is a place I will not be returning to.'
