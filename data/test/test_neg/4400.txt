b"My friends and I decided to go to Vegas on one of the hottest weekends of the summer.  We had grand plans to party at Wet Republic during the day, but were defeated by the prospect of traveling to another hotel just to be hot against a different background.  We settled on hitting the pool at the Palazzo, where we were staying.  We decided to check out Azure while we were there, in case we wanted a bit more party with our pool time.We would've been mad if we'd paid money to get in.  Since we were a group of girls, we got in free, and we were able to scope the place out without paying cover.  What we found was a smaller version of the normal hotel pool, with loud music and more people.  There was no atmosphere - the Palazzo pool is one of the more standard Vegas pools anyway, and the Azure version was maybe even blander.  It was, in other words, worse than the free hotel pool in every possible way.We ended up spending the afternoon in the Palazzo pool, and the few scattered children didn't bother us at all.  It was a relaxing day, and not too hot despite the rather intense temperatures.  If you're curious about Azure, I'd say check it out if you don't have to pay.  If you have to give up a dime, don't even bother."
