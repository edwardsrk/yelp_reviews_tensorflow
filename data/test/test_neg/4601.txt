b"First off, the service is fantastic and our waiter was the perfect amount of attentive. The prices are very reasonable and it's really cool that they include soup or salad with every entree. That being said, I honestly have no idea where these other reviewers have eaten Italian food because that's where Chicago Joe's fails miserably. The pasta is not homemade no matter what you read (and I would know because my wife makes homemade pasta at least once per week). Both my wife and I ordered the Linguine with white clam sauce. It was as if some Campbell's soup was poured on top of bad boxed pasta, and it wasn't even tossed together. Let's put it this way, I hadn't eaten anything all day and that's the only reason I was able to get through it. Yuck!The other couple we were with ordered two different types of pasta dishes. One was like a red sauce with some sort of tiny chopped up scallops and the other was a penne with escargot. Let's just say neither one ate very much. If you're looking for the real deal Italian homemade restaurant look elsewhere. If you don't mind very mediocre food backed by great service and a wonderful attitude, Chicago Joe's is your place."
