b"UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt.  Theirs is soggy.  I first went in during the evening.  This time I went in at lunch time.  There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  This is where they are falling down.  Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.=====================================================================It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  It is very nice inside.  The seating is comfortable and well decorated. However, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  Pretty standard.  Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  I took it back and asked for a re-do.  The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop."
