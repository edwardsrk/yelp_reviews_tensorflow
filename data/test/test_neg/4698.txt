b"The review of this seafood place is for dinner that we experienced as a group. 2 times within a month. So I think I can have my say in this place now...First time, when I called for Father's Day dinner. Booked more than 2 weeks in advance. Was advised in advance that we would only have the table for 2 hours, which is totally fine. We were somewhat expecting the dishes to be like Fishman Lobster House in Scarborough where the seafood is topped up and we would be stuffed...from our previous numerous experiences...so we ordered a 5 person set dinner for 7 ppl.. The food dishes were particularly small,  in comparision, the ambience and seating area was better than Fishman Lobster House...(1 star)...nothing was Wow or spectacular in terms of taste...lobster deep fried, fish had a muddy taste, steamed king crab was the best thing perhaps... Around 7:15, when all the dishes arrived and we started eating maybe a quarter thru, they kept on asking us if they can take it and pack it away...I'm like is it time for us to give the table back? They said no. So why were they rushing us leave? They claim 2 hours but they want you to leave before 1.5 hours..epic fail....( minus 2 stars) I want to enjoy my food and company, not gobble down and leave....this is not a hk cafe... please...The second time, same thing, rushing us to leave and realizing after the fact they didn't provide all the dishes on the menu..So that's their business strategy..sit down, order the most expensive from the menu and rush you to leave so you won't have time to enjoy and figure out what was missing from the set...I have way better places to spend my $600-1000 dollars please  with way better service and food.... not coming back..."
