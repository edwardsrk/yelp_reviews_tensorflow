b"Just spent $45 (not including tip) for food that was just alright, not cooked the way I asked, and I'm still starving.  Service was great though.Edamame with kimchi butter was good.Asked for the teriyaki salmon to be rare, a quick sear, but was more medium well.  It wasn't a bad dish, but for $30 you expect your socks to be blown off, or at least somewhat sate your appetite.Just went to another restaurant to get another meal."
