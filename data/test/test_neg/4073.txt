b'Working in area for a week so visited four out of five days for lunch Two days at no later than 1:30 they had no food (provisions)Last day (not going back) I had to wait 30 mins for food that was sitting ready right in front of me and they substituted white rice in for my rice and peas; I wanted food in the first place so ended up throwing out the nasty riceUpsetting that they could have made more rice in the time they made me wait but so it goesSnapper was a good 3/5Service 2/5Food availability 3/5Would have got a 3 on Third visit but not worth more than a 2 after seeing its downside'
