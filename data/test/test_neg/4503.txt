b"Worst service through the drive-through today. The gal didn't even acknowledge me when I drove up. She looked and got my drink, then just handed it to me and told me how much it was. Didn't tell me what my drink was or ask if it  was correct.  Took my debit card swiped it and then just handed it to me and didn't even look at me. She was way too busy having a conversation with him ever was there with her working. This is one reason why I don't like going to Starbucks the customer service pretty much sucks."
