b'Pizzas are salty. All the time every time. I don\'t know why My kids think it\'s gonna be better next time. No matter what kinda of pizza it\'s going to be salty. They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times.  The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have "light ice" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to "compensate" for the "light ice".  This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it.'
