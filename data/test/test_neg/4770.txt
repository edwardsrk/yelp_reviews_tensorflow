b'This is about the chicken noodle soup.  I just paid $4.00 for a bowl of thin, salty, and what tasted like packaged base to which they may have added a few plump noodles, several pieces merely of diced carrot and ONE half-inch shred of chicken.  (Well, there was also a 1/4 inch shred of chicken in the bowl).  RIP-OFF!  What nerve.  I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote that the chicken noodle soup is mediocre.  That was being kind.'
