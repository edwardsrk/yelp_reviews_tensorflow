b"Me and the lovely went here on a Groupon buy and I so wanted to love it. Sorry to say we did not. We were seated by a very friendly host, next to a map of Thailand painted on the wall and the bar opposite. I felt a little like I'd been put in the back 40. Waiter was nice but a little clueless; I asked for a reco on what the house did best. He totally stammered and stared at his feet and finally said 'a lot of people get the whole fish'. Not wowed. A nice wine list helped but I have had better Thai food elsewhere. No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely. To top it off, stammering waiter man/boy brings the check and says did you want anything for desert? Um. No thanks. It would have been a pricey meal had we not had the Groupon [$40 food for $20]. $52 plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere? I say, meh."
