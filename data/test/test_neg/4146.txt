b"I took a couple clients here for lunch today.I ordered a burger with bacon and mozzarella cheese and mashed potatoes instead of fries.My order arrived and instead of mashed potatoes, there were sweet potatoes.  I hate sweet potatoes so brought it to the person who brought our food's attention right away (it wasn't our server).  As I was eating my burger, I realized that there was no cheese or bacon on my burger but didn't make a fuss about it.  The burger and mashed potatoes were delicious.Two in our group ordered a brie and lobster sandwich and they said it was greasy (it's made like a grilled cheese sandwich) so they used utensils to eat it.Just before our server brought the bill we'd asked for, he came over to apologize (it's the first time he acknowledged the lack of mozz and bacon) and said that I was getting a free dessert because of the mix-ups. I didn't want dessert so passed on it."
