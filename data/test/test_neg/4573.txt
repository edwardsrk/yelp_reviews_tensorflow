b'Never thought we need to pay to print boarding passes here been in most of the hotel elsewhere where the printing service is free.  hotel room looks ok. Newly renovated but the bathroom needs a major upgrade. price is very resonable for what your going to get so dont expect to much. I would recomend the hotel if your traveling in a budget. And not looking for much. Front desk staff looks very serious and are not very welcoming. Except for brian who checks us in Very sencere and polite. Over all my experience with the hotel was ok.'
