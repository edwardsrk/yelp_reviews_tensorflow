b'Poor service, fair food and airport ambience. Houstons was recommended by the ticketing agent. The place was packed when we arrived, necessitating a 5- to 10-minute wait to be seated (luckily, we were not in a hurry). After a semi-reasonable wait our server arrived, but the drinks didn\'t come in a reasonable time. Our appetizer was calamari, the best part of our dining exerience and the chardonnay from California was nice and buttery. Our entrees arrived 2 minutes into our appetizer; the server mumbled that it was the kitchen\'s fault, served it anyway, and apologized repeatedly. We thought our food could be worse. My ribs tasted like it was water infused and the fries had good taste, the "seasonal side" never arrived. The salmon was slightly over-cooked and rice was "ehhh." Broccoli and green beans were al dente--good!Due to the full house (we suppose), our service was lacking. Our water was never refilled, the waiter never checked in,  and it took forever to pay our bill.My advice--consider a different place to eat if there\'s a line (we were there at 3pm on  Monday). If you eat here, ask for your check when the meal arrives.'
