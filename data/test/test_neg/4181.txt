b"They have added some vegetarian options to their menu, but it's still seriously lacking vegan options. The veggie burger is so bland... Play-doh has more flavor. However, my carnivorous family loved their Jamaican Jerk wings & onion rings. Also, they had happy hour specials on some of their food items, so it was 1/2 off the wings & onion rings. Nice atmosphere, lovely decor. They have live music some nights. I wish they'd offer more vegan options."
