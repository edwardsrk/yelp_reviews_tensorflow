b"Utterly disappointed, I know this place has bad reviews but this is very infuriating that I drove 30 minutes to have some late night desert and they advertise they close at 1 but got denied any service and it wasn't even past 12:30am. Are the workers here being lazy? You're suppose to be serving up until you're closed. Not until how you feel like it. Only giving this place a 2 star because of sympathy. I've been here before desert isn't the greatest but it'll satisfy your cravings if you can even eat it... Maybe not."
