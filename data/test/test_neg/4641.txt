b'Seated right away.  Seats were not cleaned.  I had to brush off food remnants from bench seats.  Ordered calamari which took FOREVER.  Not bad taste, but not great.  Wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Meatballs were not too bad.  But spaghetti sauce was like it was out of a can or Ragu.  Not impressed.  I had linguine with clams.  Pasta not cooked right and the sauce lacked salt.  I had to salt it myself.  Overall:  2 stars.  Mediocre service from staff.  Very slow kitchen.  Mediocre food quality.  Contrary to other positive reviews, I would not recommend this place nor would I come here again.'
