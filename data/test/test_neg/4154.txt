b"Seriously dude? This place is Nasty!  This might be the grossest casino I've ever been to in Vegas.I'd give it no stars if that were possible except for the fact that they have recently redone their restrooms!  In fact, the restroom in this place is the nicest thing going for it!!!!It smells like cigs covered up with air freshener, covered up with vomit, covered up with floor powder, covered up with B.O, covered up with plug-ins.  The smell is so strange and not good!  How about some air purifiers? That would help!  Some open windows maybe???Onto the gambling 1) they have some really old machines that still spit out quarters  2) they have some new machines that just take your dollars 3) they have table games that are like $5 min but really should be like $2 min 4) some of the machines are in such bad shape they've just duck taped them together [I saw this on a couple of instances] they have like old tube TV screens and everything 5) the people that go here...how do you explain...just WOW  6) valet was very nice I'll give them that 7) there's like a baseball game concession stand by the sports book that I found very comicalMy friend did win $45 on Craps-hooray!"
