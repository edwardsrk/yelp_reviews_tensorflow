b"Got the red bean boba slush, it wasn't what I expected. My wife got her favorite taro, her's was better. I should listen to my wife when it comes to getting bobas.Back to the red bean boba, wish someone told me there would be actual red beans in my drink, I added boba to the slush so it was a hot mess at the bottom of my drink. I threw it out and drank my wifes taro. She's nice to me.I've had better boba."
