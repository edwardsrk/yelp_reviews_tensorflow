b"The Nudo counter in Eaton Center turns out a wonderful, amazing, superlative bowl of noodles.The Nudo restaurant in Chinatown does not.Craving the sesame chicken dry noodles I had had a few times downtown, I stopped by Nudo in Chinatown and ordered the same thing.The broth was not very tasty and definitely not as complex as what I'm used to. The chicken was a bit dry, with not enough sesame sauce to cover for that.But the worst is the noodles. They were overcooked (!!!) and not as fresh as usual. Even after adding the broth and stirring a lot they were one mass. Much like noodles become at home after they've been put in the fridge for a while...So basically skip this place and go to Eaton Center counter."
