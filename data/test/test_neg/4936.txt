b"Wish I would have read the reviews first.got the ribeye stake medium...$30.it was raw...sent it back...took forever... Couple beers....bottle of wine for the misses$30...+ her meal$30.... Finally finished it was good but I've had better...waited for the check for 30 minutes... got tired of waiting...went up front and paid my $100 Bill+20 tip....they gave us a wallgreens bag to put the wine in....when I pay this kind of money I would like to be wowed....the only thing that wowed me was the bad service and prices...if you feel like you have to much money in your pocket buy all means visit"
