b"This is my second time here. The first time there were moments of brilliance so I went back for more. The salad was the best ever on the first visit- so fresh and wonderful combination of tastes and textures. Tonight the salad was wilted. The tikka grilled cheese and tomato soup was also a real downer. The soup was first serve and not even warm. They took it back and it came back curdled and bland. The grilled cheese was more like grilled farm bread with a piece of cheese that stayed for a minute. I could go on but why bother. If it is a change of chefs then it doesn't bode well. All I know it will be sometime before I consider going back and spending my hard earned cash"
