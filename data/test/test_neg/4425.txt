b"Got a flyer in the mail for this place. Says it under new management.  It also says they are opened 7 days a week with an exclamation mark. I called today (Saturday) and they were just about to close - called around 4 p.m.. The guy asked if I wanted to come on Monday.  When I asked him about Saturday, he asked someone and then told me that they don't always work on Sundays.  Apparently they only work occasional Sundays if there is someone who wants to work that day.  WHA??!!  Why advertise on a flyer AND website that you are opened 7 days a week when you really aren't.  Can't comment about the actual place but that as is wasn't a great starting point for them."
