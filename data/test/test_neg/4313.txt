b'Foodwise no complaints as it is excellent.  The service is less than desirable.  My family arrived  few minutes before me and ordered food.  I attempted to add to our order but they would not take at register.  They said to wait for server.  Server came when she brought food to table for rest of party. Even then, she did not take order. And insisted on getting manager.  This experience put a damper on our Friday night out.The manager was very apologetic and did good job with service recovery.'
