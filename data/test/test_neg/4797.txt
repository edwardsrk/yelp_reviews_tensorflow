b'Came pretty late after dinner. They do take Credit Card which was good since we had run out of CAD and most places in Chinatown only take Debit or Cash. The cute little older woman who was sitting at the cashier informed us we couldn\'t order any of the "food" items since she only knows how to make the desserts and the bubble teas lol.I got an Herbal Jelly dessert and she literally messed up all my toppings, but I was too lazy and disappointed to correct her. The toppings I did get were good though, albeit very very sparse. In the pictures, it looks like you\'ll get a ton of boba I probably got like 20 boba balls total.Disappointing. Don\'t come here unless you need to go somewhere that takes credit card.'
