b"I have been eating a Malee's for years and never had a bad experience until tonight. My wife and I went in to have our usual fire wraps followed by basil chicken and were surprised that the waitress was covered in tattoos from shoulder to wrist, if appeared we were in a high class motorcycle bar than an old favorite restaurant. If you want to disfigure your body by covering it in tattoos that is your business but you should cover them up at work so you don't disgust your customers by shoving them in their faces. I know that this might not be popular to a some people, but customers of Malee's deserve better than having to look at the wait staffs tacky tattoos. What next, nose rings and pierced eyebrows!"
