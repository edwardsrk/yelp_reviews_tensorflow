b"Brake line holding bracket in rear was bent, and brake line was off. Rubbed against tire all the way home. Took them 5 hours to tell me that the caliper was bad, and then the next day another 6 hours to complete the installation of another caliper I had extra. Front bumper was also detached, and hanging loose when I picked the car up. Also nice size black mark on the driver side paint. I trusted this place, after the reviews where awful....big mistake. Never hear bad things, about a good honest shop. Should have trusted this app. Manager was super nice, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I should at least get a free oil change out my awful experience! Lol good luck!"
