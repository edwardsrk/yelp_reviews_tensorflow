b"I came into Toni and Guy wanting to get partial highlights and because my sister recommended them. Mind you, I have been to several different, great hairdressers who have done a fantastic job with my hair. I only came here because they have a reasonable price for what I wanted. After arriving, I was approached by Jen, my colorist, and she took me back to get started. Long story short, the highlights came out okay. She quickly foiled me and I was waiting for probably a good 45 minutes before she washed them out. Not to mention, I have never seen employees push their product on their customers as much as these people! Every minute, she was trying to sell me something and wanted me to come back in another 8 weeks for a full highlight. My hair was already damaged enough as is and a good hairstylist would've recommended a break and a good product to repair my breakage. The highlights are some of the worst I have had. Very patchy and some parts of my hair aren't toned, which is very upsetting. I will definitely not be returning. They are such a franchised salon that the quality and individuality have disappeared."
