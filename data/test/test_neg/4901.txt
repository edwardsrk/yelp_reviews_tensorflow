b"I've been here a couple of times but I still don't see all of the hype, the cupcakes are just okay. On my 1st visit I had a red velvet cupcake, which was not good at all. The frosting only made it worse. Once you've had red velvet done right, there's no going back. This is just another example of a failed attempt at red velvet since it's become one of the popular kids in the dessert world.On my second visit I had the Pink Cadillac, which started out good but then a few more bites became too much. Yes the cupcakes are big but the amount of frosting is unbearable. I will not risk visiting again unless I feel the urge of setting my money on fire."
