b'"To him who has nothing it is forbidden not to relish filth."alright, so i\'m off transit because turnstiles make me nervous, not in a life is a traffic jam, \'down with turnstiles\' hippie sort of way, but i\'m actually too incompetent to operate a turnstile and no longer trust myself not making a complete ass/ fool of myself while some transit lady (bless her, she\'s trying) shouts out instructions that i don\'t understand, and i  end up feeling like an infant/subterranean homesick alien. i could never perform two tasks at once, and i haven\'t had much experience with modern technology, coming from a city that was previously stile -free (unfortunately, style free as well), and so i can\'t insert the card (then grab the card) and turn the stile all at once, i\'m always too late..   or at least i\'m 0 for 3 since getting here, which is enough of a sample size for me, along with my neurosis, to walk everywhere for the rest of my life.'
