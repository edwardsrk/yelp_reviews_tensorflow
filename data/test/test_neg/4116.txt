b'Beware of false advertising! You get a view of the strip with 2 balconies but both balconies are LOCKED. What\'s the point in having them??? Furniture is outdated and tattered. Surfaces were not cleaned and you could see the marks on them. The bathtub has a huge mark on the outside, toilet didn\'t seem clean and you have to pay for wifi for each device. My room was a SUITE! Light fixture didn\'t have a cover, sofa has stains, the AC is so outdated for such a "modern" decor, you cannot put it on "auto," because there\'s no feature! Bathroom doesn\'t have a fan and television and outlets are not user friendly. There was a lamp that was not plugged with no socket to plug so we had to move it. My side of the bed lamp has no cover, which is BLINDING and there are no outlets bedside to charge my phone!!! I should have looked at the recent reviews before reserving. Highly disappointed. Won\'t be coming back to palms place. I couldn\'t even take more pictures because of the reflections. Save your money!'
