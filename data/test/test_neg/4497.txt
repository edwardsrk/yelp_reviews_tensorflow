b"I'm not from cleveland but feel like I've been to this chain enough to get the gist.  I just don't think it's very good.  It's basically a diner, yet the food takes very long to make it out of the kitchen.  Service is spotty and forgetful.  The menu is big, but not really a lot of variety.  Just the same stuff repackaged as different items.  I legitimately think Bob Evans is a better breakfast"
