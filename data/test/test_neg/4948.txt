b"I thought being a privately owned pizza restaurant they'd have a good recipe. Sadly I was very disappointed. Paid $25 for a medium pizza and wings and that was with the special. The wings were in this kind of breading which was soggy and unfavorable. The pizza lacked much flavor and wasn't very good. Delivery was fairly timely, about 30 mins but then again it was also early Thursday evening. I probably won't be back. For that kind of money I'd rather go elsewhere and get more quality for my dollar."
