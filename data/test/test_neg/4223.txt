b"The first and second time my gel nails and pedicure turned out ok, but the last time it was the worst job I've ever gotten. I went in on a Tuesday and my nails were chipping the next day. By Thursday it was worse. I went in so they could fix it, and they did it without a problem but the next day they were chipping again. They rush with their services and just do a bad job overall."
