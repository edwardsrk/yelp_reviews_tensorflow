b'My most recent visit was the opposite of the amazing first visit.  My meatloaf entree on this visit had incredibly shrunk.   Like shrunk by half size.  The mashed potatoes were tasteless.  The meatloaf was so dry I got choked.  The fried okra was so tough that a human being would find it impossible to bite through.  We asked the waitress if management or cooks had changed.  She said no.  But portions were smaller, less tasty, and prices remained the same.'
