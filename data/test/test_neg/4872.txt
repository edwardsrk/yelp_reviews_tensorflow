b'The reason that I did not make this rating one star is because they have several specialties which I did not try. We went and only had sushi, which was enough to scare us away. Very poor quality in both the rolls and sashimi. It looked like they did very well with the hibachi grills, but I would not recommend the sushi to anyone.On the plus side, the atmosphere and decorations were very nice and the server was very helpful.'
