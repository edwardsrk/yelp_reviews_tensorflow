b'Came here for my cousins birthday...OK first its in the Mandalay bay hotel so its pretty loud out there. Next the place is really nice, it has a pretty cool decor that reminded me of little italy. So first off the waiter sucked so that means that our service sucked big time. We ordered ice teas and he brought it out like 15 minutes after we ordered it. I had to remind the waiter about our ice teas!!!Food was bleh, it was not that good, OK the pizza sauce was really sweet and it felt like i was eating pizza sauce with sugar. Oh and that huge chunk of mozzarella cheese in the middle made it perfect, ewww the cheese was just in one place. Ever thought of spreading it out????? The only thing good here is the bread and butter and the tiramisu. I do not think that I will be back  to this place.'
