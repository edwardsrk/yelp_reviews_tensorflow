b'NO TOWELS!I wish I had known this beforehand.  I am a fan of waking up early and hitting the gym hard before work, getting ready at the Y, and then heading straight to work without going home.  I live in the Northlake area, and work uptown, so I frequent the University City, Childress Klein, and Dowd YMCA\'s daily.  This morning I had an appointment in Ballantyne, so I decided to try out the Morrison YMCA since it was 5 minutes away from my appointment.I walk into the first locker room I see, which is very small and doesn\'t have any towels.  I reason that this must be one of the smaller locker rooms and that there\'s a larger main one somewhere else.  Two locker rooms later, I realize that that\'s all there is, and no towels in sight.  I wander out to the pool deck to see if there are any towels there, and there are none.I asked the woman at the front desk if they have any towels, and she shakes her head and said they do not.  I ask if there is a place I can purchase one (the Dowd Y has a shop that sells various workout equipment), and with a blank stare she answers, "Bi-Lo."  She then suggests that I use my current sweaty clothes as a towel replacement.  I ended up using a ton of paper towels.I just can\'t fathom that a YMCA of such size would not have towels for it\'s members.  So, the purpose of this review is to just inform others that if you are working out here and want to shower after, it\'s BYOT.'
