b"Ok Brian came out and showed me that the balister was in fact not broke it just simply needed to be screwed in tighter.  It's good that Brian stands behind his product and will come out to fix it...... eventually. Last year I hired him to replace stair railing in my home. The contract stated 4 to 7 days. The job took over 6 weeks. This was largely due to the fact that he would stop in now and then work an hour or two then go to another job, thus dragging mine out way longer. Fortunately I had yet to move in my house I purchased but Brian demanded the A.C. left on low 70s so that he could work in comfort. I asked him could he please turn the A.C. off when he left since sometimes he wouldn't come back for 4 plus days and he said no, I like it to be cool in the house when I walk in and I don't want to wait for it to kick on and have to cool the house down. I thought this was terrible since I knew he was only staying there most days for an hour or two and at the end of the month I had a $400 utility bill  even though I didn't even live in the house just from keeping the air conditioner running for him to stay in comfort.  Not cool.Next was the trash that was left around the house constantly there was candy bar wrappers potato-chip chip bags fast food bags  left scattered around. His price was $200 cheaper then Titan stairs and offered a couple designs beyond what they could provide. The finished product looks good but it was irritating to go over and see my new house that I just purchase littered with trash and paying to cool a home for whenever he decided to show up. In short I am satisfied with the finished product but business needs to be done in a much more professional manner."
