b"Fish and chips is usually a safe bet in Toronto.  Not here.  Looked ok when it arrived but then quickly became soggy.  So did the fries.  No idea why that happened.  Were they frozen and then fried too wet?  And the tablespoon of accompanying coleslaw wasn't very good.  While the servers tried to be friendly, I noted that my water glass remained empty; they didn't check and didn't refill.  I just wanted to leave."
