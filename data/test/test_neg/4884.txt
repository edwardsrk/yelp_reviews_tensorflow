b"Food is okay, but very bland for Thai food. I've had the Panang curry and pad Thai. Both were small portion sizes for the cost. I got the pad Thai to go and it smelled fishy when I opened it up, plus it was almost dry from not enough sauce (luckily I had extra pad Thai sauce in the fridge). Service was good, but there are better Thai restaurants in the area that have better fotos for a similar price."
