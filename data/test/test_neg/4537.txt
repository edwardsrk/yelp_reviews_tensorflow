b'Thiis place is what its reviews say it is.   In no way does this compare to non-airport Pei-Wei locations.   I had Mongolian beef and despite the long wait - which duped me into thinking my dish would be made to order - the beef was definitely dry, barely warm, and judging by the beef jerky like consistency, quite possibly from the Jurassic era.  So if you enjoy arthritis of the mandible, this is the place for you.'
