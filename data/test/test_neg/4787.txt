b"I came here to get new glasses and contacts the office is beautiful and they have a great collection of glasses! But they didn't add up my payment correctly! Thankfully I had a record of it or I would of been overcharged! Than once I received my glasses they didn't even give me a case that correctly fit my glasses! I will not being coming back here I was very disappointed, I have never had this many problems at any other optometrists office!"
