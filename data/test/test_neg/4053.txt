b"I was really excited to get services started. The offer was brought to my attention as part of a special event at Costco. The services are set up under your Costco account, so it makes it easier to find your customer information when you have to call the delivery company. Our delivery driver gave me his personal cell phone in case we needed anything right after we got services set up. I wound up using the drivers number asking for a text once the first delivery was completed. This review reflects the customer service you get when you have to call the delivery company itself. We had a bottle with a crack in it & didn't even know until it was too late. Unfortunately, the water leaked all over my carpet & kitchen (due to placement of machine). This happened right at our second delivery & as we were down to the very last bottle of water. I called to cancel services due to this issue. Customer service was happy to cancel, but never offered any credits to the bill from this cracked bottle. They told me to call back about my final bill, as a credit would be issued for returning all empty bottles we received once they were picked up by the driver along with our machine. Upon calling back, the customer service agent had to manually input the bottle credit."
