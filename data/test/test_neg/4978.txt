b"20 mins for a milkshake when there's nobody here. The wait staff seemed to be having fun taking pics of the other drinks they made (for themselves). I asked if there was butter or jam for my scone and was totally ignored while they were talking. Pretty expensive & the staff could use a dose of customer service training."
