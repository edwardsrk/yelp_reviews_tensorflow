b'We were seated for 30 minutes before we were even asked what we want to drink. The food was just bad.. we had the french toast sandwich and the California omelet. I asked about the corned beef hash and the waitress told me that it is made from a can. After dropping the food off we never saw her again until she brought the bill (I needed hot sauce but just ate without it)...my husband was NOT happy with it. I can say that this restaurant is definitely a drunk no other place is open spot to go to. Nothing else.  Dennys and ihop would have tasted better. The servers were all polite just slow moving to help.'
