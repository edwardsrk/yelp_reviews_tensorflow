b'I just finished eating the blandest, most boring pad Thai I have ever had.  This dish consisted of noodles, a bland sauce, a smattering of peanuts, and some plain bean sprouts.  That\'s it. No spice or flavor whatsoever.  I realize now that this is partially my fault, as I did not read the inside of the menu, which said I had to request spice and flavor.  The server didn\'t ask either though...and she had plenty of time to, since I was the only person there.  Well, almost the only person.  There was an employee or family member sleeping at a table in the corner.  I\'m not sure if that counts or not.  The server was pleasant and all, but she clearly was in "no one is here" mode.  After bringing me my meal, she sat at the table with sleeping guy and played with her phone.  She didn\'t look up again until I was done with my meal and had an empty water glass.  The other thing I noticed is that staff drank bottled water, rather than water from the pitchers they serve guests.  I was not offered anything other than water and drank the whole glass before I picked on that little tidbit.  Overall, I can\'t say anything about the experience would prompt me to return...'
