b'This place is good for a "quick fix" sushi/schezuan meal. It\'s not pricey however don\'t expect great service or getting what you\'ve actually ordered. I have been several times and the service seems to be getting worse and worse. Some things that are on the menu, they don\'t even serve!! You would usually expect the staff to tell you what was available and what was not, but it\'s not a the case here. It\'s a guessing game.I\'ll be honest with you, the bathrooms are not a very pretty sight. At all. Kind of makes your stomach turn to be quite frank. If the resto\'s bathroom is that dirty, do you really want to imagine the kitchen??Like i said, for a quick fix, if you aren\'t scared of a nasty bathroom, it\'s fine; "fine" being the key word.'
