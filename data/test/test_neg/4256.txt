b"We decided to try this place out because of all the good reviews. However, we were extremely disappointed because of the ***VERY*** small sandwiches and the fact we had to go to another place just after eating here to eat lunch again because their portions are more like an appetizer. And, I am 150 lbs and my wife, 120 lbs so we are small people with a normal appetite.I don't know how places get by with a $ sign on Yelp when this could not be further from the truth. Their sandwiches are more like 1/2 of a typical sandwich and very stingy on the additional items like lettuce and tomato (micro bits and pieces). I told one of the owners we were disappointed and he blamed it on the baguette company not being consistent with their bread sizes. Come on, if the bread comes in too small,  you don't just rip off your customer,  you let them know up front and give a discount or something extra.This place is so tight and out of touch with reality that they give you just a few tiny pieces of lettuce on the plate which they called a small salad but it wasn't enough for a new born rabbit. Seriously, to see it was to believe it...they had to try hard to tear the lettuce that small. So, if you want to spend $16 on one whole sandwich (two of their sandwiches x $8) to get full go ahead. But this place is off the list!! Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but the the prices per portion would make this place easily $$$ restaurant!  And, the people were nice but I'm not in the habit of donating to the success of restaurants without something in return.  No thanks!And, this is a legitimate review by an engineer and his wife with no ax-to-grind against this establishment or owners. There was another couple that came in with us at the same time. It was their first time too and they left with the same disappointment as us, and we both questioned whether or not the owners may be better at generating false Yelp reviews than they are at running a fair establishment."
