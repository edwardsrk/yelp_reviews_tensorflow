b"So I went back again today at 8:30am. Got the Freddy Special, and when he asked about the dressing for the dash and console and doors, etc, I said yes but last time it was pretty obvious that they just did a quick swipe over the glove box and that was it and he made sure they would look over it. Sooo I just recently bought a used car about a month ago and she definitely needed some love. Annnnd she is due for an inspection today and I'm hoping they don't look too close. This time, I have pictures. I guess it's time to find a new car wash place.  I would however like to say that all of the employees there are extremely friendly, which makes it hard to have to be negative about the job they do."
