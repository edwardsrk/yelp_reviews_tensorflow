b"I have been to Erin's a few times.  Rhonda always suggests it and I say no.  After about a year between visits I forgot how bad it was and said yes.  The food is not awful, it is greasy and low in flavor.  The prices are high.  Rhonda had the fried bluegills and they were greasy and left a film in your mouth.  I had a couple of bites and wished I hadn't.  It took a few hours before the film and taste went away.I had Mediterranean pasta with chicken.  I know, you don't go to a Irish Pub for pasta.  I thought it would be easy for them to make but I was wrong.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  I thought having kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes would make it flavorful but I was wrong.Hopefully this review will remind me not to go back and drop $60 on food I don't like."
