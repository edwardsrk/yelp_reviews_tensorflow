b"Thought it would be a good idea to try NYE here because we had concert tickets at the Events Center. The food was ok, but not worth the price. A much better on- line presence than the actual payoff. Drink menu was actually fairly small...just overall not anything that would bring me back. With so many other options and better food and drink at better prices...I'll be moving on from the RX Boiler Room."
