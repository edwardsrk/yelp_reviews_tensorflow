b"If you want a nice atmosphere, decent food, and to spend a lot of money but still leave hungry, this is the place for you. My husband and I had the shrimp appetizer. There were three shrimp on the plate, so I let my husband have two of them. We ordered our meals. He got the veal something or other and said it was ok. I got a half portion of the ravioli. When my plate came, I was disappointed to see THREE small sand dollar sized raviolis. THREE. For $13! Even if I had known the half portion was that small, I couldn't have brought myself to get 6 of them for $25. Nurp. My husband did order two drinks that were fine. But for $84 dollars, I would have appreciated leaving without feeling like all I did was take a deep breath for dinner. My stomach was growling just as much as when I walked in. All that to say, our server was awesome."
