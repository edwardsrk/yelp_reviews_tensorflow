b'I wish I could give this place a separate review for experience and results. I went for the aquadermabrasion facial (which was on special) last month, and at the time I thought it was the best facial I\'d ever had. The massage I got was great, the facial treatment was very relaxing, and the products she used didn\'t irritate my allergies or asthma. But, the results? Not good. I\'m not sure if my skin is just too sensitive for this treatment, but I\'ve been peeling in certain places (namely around my mouth and chin) since. It truly seems like a chemical burn - the skin is red, inflamed, and peeling and nothing has seemed to soothe it. I\'ve had to go out and buy special (and expensive) moisturizer because the rest of the products that I normally used without issue now burn when I put them on. I\'m disappointed, because I really did enjoy the experience quite a bit and the location is convenient. I typically visit the 10 Spot, but once in awhile it is nice to get the full "spa" experience. Alas, the search continues!'
