b"There so many falafel plate places in this town, I decided to try this one since it has good reviews. I have no clue why. I am so unimpressed. I ordered the falafel plate with taboulleh, baba ghanouj, and rice and salad. Nothing tasted authentic, the rice was a bit lumpy and not fresh tasting. The falafel's were probably the best thing in this combo, and they were mediocre at best. Taboulleh was a bit soggy and nowhere near lemony enough. Baba G was not smoky, just bland. I'm pretty disappointed, although I do think for something so simple... I have eaten at so many places that screw this meal up. Add this to that list.The prices are reasonable,and the service is decent. But the food certainly doesn't warrant any reason to return. Cest la vie, Parsley..."
