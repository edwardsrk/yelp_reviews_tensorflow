b'Server was wonderful. I think there is an identity crisis as the entire decor is rustic western yet the Beatles,, Van Morrison and such are the background music. The  turkey melt was so so. Turkey tasted old.. Not a good grill. Bland taste despite the jack cheese. ( which I did not really see much of).  A lot of turkey but it was all bland. Fries were run of the mill under cooked frozen crinkle cut.Salad was plain iceberg with ONE thinly sliced grape tomato and toooooo many fake fried onion rings. Just a disappointment. from the looks of the place I was hoping for cowboy fair: fresh, tasty juicy burgers. pulled pork, beans....hearty salads. Such a let down.Pricey for the so so food, .'
