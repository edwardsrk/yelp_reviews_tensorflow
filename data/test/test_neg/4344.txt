b"Thai Spoon, what can I say?  Definitely not as good as Nicky's in the North Side.  The crab rangoons were not good, no crab at all and a super sweet cream cheese in an over fried wrapper. I ordered green curry, I like a little spice, I ordered a 6, but could barelyTaste the heat.  The broth was watery and the vegetables were absent.  I did get a lot of bamboo shoots.  We also tried the pad Thai whichWas acceptable. Dinner for two including one appetizer, two entrees and water to drink was $29.00.  Interestingly they print a tip calculator on your bill!"
