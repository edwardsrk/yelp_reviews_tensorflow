b'Came to Vegas with my Boyfriend and his family for his twenty first birthday, you know the whole "turning twenty one go to Vegas thing" well the first thing when you walk into the hotel to check in you get a big smack in the face of cigaret smell, the smell is soooo bad it feels like you smoked a pack every time you walk through the casino, your hair and clothes absorb it and your left walking around smelling like a ash tray. The securities are very rude wanna be rent a cops. Here\'s what happened, first of let me just say that I\'m only 20 (but I look like I\'m 16) and I know I\'m not supposed to be on the casino floor or anywhere near the slots and tables but it was my boyfriends first time here and he got on a slot and I was taking a picture, for memories you know and  I was gonna go up to our room after the picture, two big fat security women come up to me like if they were trying to intimidate me, chest out hands on hips all on my face, they asked me if I\'m 21, obviously I said no, and they begin to scold me that I\'m not allowed anywhere near the slots or tables or else I will get fined of get sent to prison, chill out rent a cop I was already on my way upstairs, they were very rude and could\'ve handled that in a different way. The rooms are okay outdated, needs some updating, the bed was comfy, though I was really scared to sleep in the bed due to the reviews of bed bugs but I was really tired our first night and slept really well. The second night though I woke up in the middle of the night with my legs sooooo itchy, I couldn\'t stop scratching, I had little bumps all over both my legs. On our last night there my boyfriend was down stairs gambling and drinking and when he tried to get a drink at the bar the bar tender was being ass hole with him, he asked for my boyfriends ID he hands it to him and my boyfriend said that he kept looking at the picture on the ID and back at him lifted into the light inspected it and told my boyfriend if he had another proof of identification, my boyfriend said no and the bartender told him that he couldn\'t serve him liquor, very rude and u fortunate for my boyfriend seeing that he only wanted one more drink before going up to the room being it was our last night there The parking was a hassle because they were cleaning the parking garage. The hotel is very old and could use a major upgrade all around. Would I stay here again, hhhmmm maybe not because of the really bad smell of cigaret downstairs, it is a very affordable hotel though so let\'s see on my next trip to Vegas.'
