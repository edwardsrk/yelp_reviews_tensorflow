b"I have wrestled with writing this....We went in for Valentines day. The reviews were off the chart and my son and his wife had eaten here previously and liked it.  We were stoked coming in.  Our server (Brian) had been highly recommended in other reviews...we were first in line so we could be in his section.  Unfortunately, he ended up being the only bright spot in our dinner and the reason that I gave 2 stars vs. 1 for the food.  Food-wise, we were extremely disappointed on every single item served.  I ordered the bone in rib eye. When it came out it looked fantastic...I ordered it medium.  it came out medium rare.  The taste was bland and was tough....really for prime beef? I also ordered the lobster tail....it was by far the worst one that I have ever had.  It was cold, very tough and had a very odd sauce on it. It is my belief that  due to being fully booked for VD that they precooked it and warmed it when ordered. I saw another review that mentioned the same deal and when they replaced it....it was the same.  My wife had the crispy chicken.  It was tough and had an odd sweet sauce on it.  The mashed potatoes again tasted precooked previously and re-warmed....watery if you know what I mean. She really did not eat it...just picked at it.  For desert, I had the coffee cr\xc3\xa8me brulee which I love and have really never had a bad one....except for now....it really was not good.  Having read other reviews like this...I dismissed them as outliers.....It is distressing to have to write this after my high expectations, but it was a $150 learning. I am going to stick with Anthony's at the M Resort."
