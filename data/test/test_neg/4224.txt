b"Drinks and food look great, colorful and different from anywhere else but honestly the quality is not that great! I'm not sure if it's because they just opened up and they were busy but it took a while for food and drinks to get ready and then they forgot to add veggies to our food box. Drinks were kind of tasteless!"
