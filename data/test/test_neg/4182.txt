b"Mom and I stopped in for lunch today to try Bowl of Pho in hopes that we would find a new favorite. Unfortunately we were not impressed at all with our meals nor the service. When we walked in, we stood at the door for about 10 minutes to be greeted and seated. It was not overly busy, but being that it was 12:30pm, there were several tables occupied by business casually dressed people so it must be a popular lunch spot for nearby businesses. I ordered the deluxe beef pho. They brought out a large plate of bean sprouts, basil and jalape\xc3\xb1os so I was initially excited that the pho was going to be great. But then it came out and it was not steaming hot. The noodles were all caked up into a patty shape, like they had been heated and just set into the bowl, all stuck together, and the broth wasn't hot enough to finish cooking them. The beef was disgusting. The meatballs being the grossest, rubbery, inedible things. All of the other beef was all fat, and there was only 1 or 2 small pieces of each kind. The broth was tasty, but there wasn't enough of it for all the bean sprouts and noodles. I can usually never finish a bowl of pho, but I ate all of the broth and was left dissatisfied.  She had the chicken and cabbage salad. She said it was tasty, but way too salty, and not as good as any other Vietnamese cabbage salad - and we've tried a lot. That's how I felt about the pho, too. Pho Thang Cafe downtown is much better. Go there instead for authentic and quality Vietnamese food."
