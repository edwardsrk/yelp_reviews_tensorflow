b'LIke other reviewers, I also tried Oxi Fresh because I saw their promotions in Clipper Magazine, a coupon mailer thing we recently received. I had my beige colored microfiber sofa and love seat cleaned, and three wool rugs. On my upholstery, the only stain issues were some small black dirt scuff marks that our movers got on ALL of the corners of both pieces due to poor wrapping I guess. Also one of the wool rugs had pet stains. Other than that, all of these items had very little visible soiling--I wasn\'t looking for much stain removal, but general dirt and allergen removal. Pros:-Supposedly more environmentally friendly, etc (However, there is definitely a fragrance involved, see "Con" below)-Fast process-Dries quickly, although it has now been over an hour and my upholstery is still pretty wet (despite having the AC and ceiling fan on)--too wet to sit on--and the rugs are also still very damp. Cons:-The dry time is so fast because they use very little water. It\'s obvious on all of my rugs that the cleaning didn\'t reach anywhere near the depth that I was looking for to remove dirt and allergens. This is what I am most disappointed about because I really wanted a good deep cleaning to help my allergies, and this cleaning seemed to just be very surface-level. -Fragrance, which makes me highly suspicious that it\'s not really less toxic for indoor air/children/pets than traditional steam cleaning. I have allergies, and the fragrance is actually WORSE for me to breathe than the dust and pet dander I was trying to have removed!-Did not remove pet vomit stains from wool rug... In fact, it turned the yellowish stains a strangely bright yellow color, almost like bleach stains, that look just as bad as the original stains. -Did not remove the stains on the corners of my upholstery--they are just faded a TINY bit -Did not remove  some typical "traffic" stains (like Brian, I expected this to help my rugs\' colors brighten up a lot more)--I think a steam cleaning would have gone deeper and gotten them out.Payment is cash or check only.Bottom line: They didn\'t come anywhere close to delivering what I was looking for, which was a deep cleaning to remove deep dirt and allergens, and it didn\'t remove any of the stains I had either. I\'m definitely going with steam cleaners next time!'
