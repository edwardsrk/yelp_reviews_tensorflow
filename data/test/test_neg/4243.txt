b"Great selection for seating, fun location, cool vibe, yet lacking in more ways than one. Strangely slow service even when there was little traffic, servers were noticeably uneducated on the menu items, and our meal was totally different than what we expected. No ingredients are listed on the menu. At all. Sure they're pretty simple dishes, but who really likes a surprise when you've been waiting for your food? Not planning to return."
