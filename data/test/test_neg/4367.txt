b'For an expensive restaurant like this, I expected much better. The service, although pleasant, was slow. The French Onion Soup was literally disgusting; we had 3 people at our table order it and they all sent it back. The Foie Gras was pretty good. The lamb was cooked as I ordered it, but was pretty tasteless. A lot of us ended up not finishing our meals because we were pretty disappointed and did not find the food appealing. On the other hand, I do have to say the restaurant did look nice and had a nice ambiance. Other than that, I was very surprised at how (unfortunately) "undeservingly" expensive this was for unappetizing food.'
