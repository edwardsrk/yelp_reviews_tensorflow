b'Disclaimer: I ordered take out and have not yet eaten in the restaurant. That said, my experience was not appetizing at all. The fish was beyond oily (see picture) and was quite smelly (fresh fish should not have a "fishy" scent). There was clearly no seasoning on the fish, nor in the batter, as it was entirely bland. The fries were also unseasoned... Always salt fries when they come out of the fryer - that\'s basic technique. Overall, a highly disappointing meal. I\'d say I\'d give this place another try, but my colleagues say they\'ve eaten in the restaurant and had the very same experience. I blame them for not warning me ahead of time. Folks, this is my warning to all of you!!! P.S.: check out the picture of the new menu.'
