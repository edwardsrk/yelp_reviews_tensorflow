b"My husband and I decided to try this place on a Friday night while I was in town for business.  We could have gone to the scores of other restaurants around this area, but decided to try a this place since we don't have one in the area that we live in.  As I was hungry for ribs it sounded like a good place to go.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was after 6 pm.  We ordered cocktails, which mine was extremely weak.  After finally placing our food order, we waited 40 minutes for it to be served.  The waitress was not very interested in the fact that we hadn't been served yet although all her other tables who were seated after us already had their meals.  We asked to speak to the manager who seemed bored by the fact that his customers were still waiting after the length of time.  He offered us another cocktail, but when we refused didn't offer anything else and was not compensated on our bills.  The food was average, but I think I was so hungry I would have eaten anything at that point.  I don't believe that we will be returning unless it's at another location."
