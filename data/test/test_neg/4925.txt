b'Had sunday brunch here as the ending of vegas trip because the restaurant was highly reviewed. The food was okay but the service was very disappointing. The waiter took a long time to take our order. Then, it was long waiting before we got the food. We asked if the server can help us check if our dishes were coming. The server did not even apologize but had a huge attitude, saying that "you see that we do have an entire restaurant inside to hold"(we were sitting at the patio). When we finally got the tiny plates of food, the waiter forgot who ordered  what. For the entire period of time, the waiter disappeared and did not refill the water.  Lastly, the bill. The server took our cards but charged 15 dollars more on each card. When we asked, he said that he did it wrong but no apology again. Overall, a over-rated place. Don\'t think I will ever come back again, as there are way better choice in vegas.'
