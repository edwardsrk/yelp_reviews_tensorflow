b'Still looking for a reasonably priced, good fish and chips place.  I went here yesterday and was somewhat disappointed.  I ordered enough food for my family of 4 and this is what I can say about this place -- service was efficient and friendly.  Food was so-so:  Chicken fingers were good.  Fish was pressed, square processed fish junk; not very tasty or good.  Fries were soggy but onion rings were good.  Cole slaw was good.  Their "special sauce" is not good at all -- they really need to add catsup and some tartar sauce options for their customers.'
