b'I ordered a polish dog and fries and was not impressed by either, especially the fries. The cook asked me if I wanted fries and I said yes and when I got to the cashier and paid for my food, my food came out with a large fry. Apparently there are different sizes to the fries and no one bothered to check with me what size and charged me the largest. No big deal if the fries were delicious, but they were far from. The hotdog was just ok. I love the concept but wish they executed it better.'
