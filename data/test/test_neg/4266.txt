b'Hit or miss. The first time I went the food was AMAZING so much so I I went back for a second time in a week. The first time I got a \'build your own pizza\' with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The second time I ordered the same thing and they forgot the Alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn\'t have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don\'t understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) I picked up the food and brought it home and the "Alfredo" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom LITERALLY! Needless to say, I\'m beyond angry. The quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, I won\'t be returning.'
