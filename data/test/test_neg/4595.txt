b"The morning muffin was a sourdough muffin with a baked egg. Not bad, but the first one we had had a fly in it.The almond croissant was delicious - flaky and the filling was flavorful and didn't have any of that artificial marzipan taste.The bakery had no air conditioning when we visited though. It was sooooo hot! I was sweating while waiting on line for only a few minutes.The service was pretty bad too. They were not friendly and had nasty attitudes.I would go back to grab the almond croissant though."
