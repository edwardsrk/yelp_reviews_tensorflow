b"They get worse every time I come to this location!  Not only do they skimp on portions, but...where's the flipping meat?!? Seriously???? Where.is.the.meat!? When I order string bean chicken, I expect string beans AND chicken, not just string beans, and ONE piece of chicken. I asked for mixed vegetables, not just broccoli. So sick of the lower quality, lower service,  and they raise their prices after cutting portions. I'm sick of it! Go to New Asian Star on 99th ave and Lower Buckeye instead, better quality, cheaper, amd free egg rolls with yelp check-in!"
