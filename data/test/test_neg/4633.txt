b"This place was, yes, was great when I first moved to Anthem. As I start to get along with the staffs, I get up-charged for my regular iced coffee. I usually have the 16 oz but recently they charge me with the 24 oz price, plus tax it's gonna be 2 dollars for a 16 oz-cup of iced coffee?! Well, it doesn't seem that much but if you don't have much money then this would be a trouble (I'm saving for my tuition). Gotta say goodbye to my favorite iced coffee then."
