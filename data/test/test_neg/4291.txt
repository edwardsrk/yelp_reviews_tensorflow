b'I\'m sure this salon has amazing stylists, but their receptionist unfortunately doesn\'t seem interested in booking clients. I called asking if the salon is open Monday, the receptionist said no, but sometimes. I asked if there was a stylist available this Monday for a cut and style and was met with silence. "Hello?". "Ummmm maybe one moment". Moments go by and I\'m told Amy is available at 1030am for a cut. Great! How much is the cost? "Umm...." more silence. "Probably around 70, but I\'m not sure". Okay well I\'m not comfortable with booking the appointment without knowing the cost. My regular stylist is on maternity leave so I thought I\'d try some place new - however this won\'t be the place.'
