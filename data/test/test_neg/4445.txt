b'I only wish I knew the managers name....This Tommy Bahama restaurant needs a professional to run this business.  So sad that a customer needs to tell the manager that the music (the singer and group were great) sound system was so off that not one word was understood.  The group was great...SOUND SYSTEM NOT ADJUSTED.FOOD OKAY...Service.  The worst ....I think the staff is unhappy...   NEW MANAGEMENT ...IS NEEDED...Wait...this is Tommy Bahama...Management...Do,you think a Tommy Bahama dress theme may help...Or someone that LOOKS like a manager...We have visited MANY. Tommy Bahama Restaurants...This..by far is the worst..Keep in mind.  The food was fine...the service poor...only because...of attitude of staff...Bottom line...entertainment was great...Sound system poor.  Staff seemed unhappy.  Manager unprofessional.  Food was average.'
