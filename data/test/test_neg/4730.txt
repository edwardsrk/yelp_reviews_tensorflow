b'This is a real typical fast-food chain place.  Strips are ok, drink is ok, fries are pretty bad and the toast is ok.  Not so sure why there are so many good reviews for this chain.  Maybe compared to other fast-food places?  I don\'t know.  But compared to a real southern-style restaurant that serves fried chicken?  Not even close.  Just completely pass on this.  Especially in Vegas as there are a ton of great places to eat in this town.  I only went  \'cause it was late at night and I didn\'t feel like dealing with the "hip" crowd that night.'
