b"Looks promising from the outside.  But was largely disappointed by the overall experience.  Beer was good and cold - best thing about the night. Got the nachos since they were on special.  Bland at best - even with the jalapenos. Little flavor. That was followed by probably the worst Caesar salad I've had (wasn't sure if it was just lettuce and cheese without dressing).  And I tried the french onion soup which was at best average.Service was OK (a little slow, but he was nice enough).  Beer was cold.  And good beer selection.  But doubtful I make it back there.  Plenty of other pubs to try out nearby.  Which is too bad, I was expecting better. I probably should have read the other reviews first..."
