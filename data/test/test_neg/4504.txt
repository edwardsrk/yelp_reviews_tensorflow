b"I usually like this place, but today was very disappointing. I give 2 stars because our waiter was very nice. My husband's chicken picatta was bland. He did like his onion soup. I ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta. I thought that is what I ordered. I showed the waiter on a particular page. I showed him shrimp with angel hair pasta but when I was served my lunch, it looked odd. It was soggy breaded shrimp on the side in little sauce, burnt sauce pieces and whole garlic cloves and a Luke warm ball of the pasta. The shrimp coating was pasty/soggy and had a weird flavor. I flagged the waiter and we reviewed the ordering/food quality situation. We decided I ordered the Scampi which has the breaded shrimp and whole garlic cloves. Whatever. He brought me 6 nicely sauteed shrimp which was brought after I ate the slightly warm ball of pasta. I didn't want to complain too much as to not further make my husband uncomfortable. It is hard enough that he needs gluten free so I was clear and took blame for the wording of my order though what I was pointing to and reading from the menu was not the item I was served. Even though I told our waiter the pasta was not hot, he did not offer to fix that.They were also out of soup spoons and offered my husband a tea spoon or a pasta (large spoon). Very weird. That happened when I had soup there 3 months ago. The ladies restroom was dirty and trash can over flowing with trash on the sink and floor. I let them know the ladies room needed attention as I was leaving. The waiter was very nice and 80% attentive. It was an expensive lunch. Not sure if we will go back. I am a former restaurant professional instructor and shopper. I try and not be too critical."
