b"We wanted to like Luigi's.  Had been looking forward to trying it out. We felt all but forgotten while there. With small kids, we order our food fast so ordered the drinks, appetizers and pizza at once. They were out of 2 of their 5 appetizers. Appetizer came out just fine but then didn't see the waiter for 30+ minutes until he came with the dessert menu.  This is when we realized our pizza had not been made. After an hour of waiting, got our pizza and drinks refilled once (by then they were half full of water from the ice melting).  Pizza was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service."
