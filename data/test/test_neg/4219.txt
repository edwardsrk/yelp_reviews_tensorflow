b"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. I love wings so I was excited to try it out. They were out of the flavors we wanted so we settled for something else. I ordered the Garlic Parmesan and one other flavor. They didn't look too appetizing and tasted okay. Needless to say, I probably won't be returning."
