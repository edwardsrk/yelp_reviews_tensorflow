b"As a harris teeter customer, I know I shop here for great service and great selection. However, my last 5 visits are all disappointments at checkout. There are over 13 checkout lanes but only two cashier's working to take care of the customers after 6pm. This is unacceptable for a Harris teeter. Please see my photo of the unmanned checkout lanes. I pay more to shop at Harris teeter and I hope in the future changes are made to have more cashiers. This wasn't a one time issue, it has happened at least 5 times."
