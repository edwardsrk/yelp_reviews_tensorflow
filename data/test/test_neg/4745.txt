b'I think I expected more from this place because its supposed to be "New York" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very New York-ish.  But I guess it is New York style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window... but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  The couple times I ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom.  The cannolis were just OK and smaller than others I\'ve had.  Maybe I\'m just comparing it too much to the "real thing" and being biased.  Word of advice:  Less than a mile down the road is Rocco\'s NY Pizza... definitely go there instead!!!'
