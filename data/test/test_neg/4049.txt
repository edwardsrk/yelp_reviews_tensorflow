b'I am sorry to have to write this, for I wanted a place to have a good meal (sandwich) like I have gotten at the Carnegie Deli in New York - this was so far from that - the corned beef sandwich - I wanted something simple and hard to mess up - it was not only messed up it was not what any new York Jew would have recognized as a corned beef sandwich. It was dried up sandpaper like meat.  This is what a corned beef sandwich should look like - http://dzakinsdeli.com/gfx/pics/corned_beef_sandwich.jpg-  I am glad I only got the half a sandwich with the soup - I brought most of the half even home so my wife could try (I did not want to say anything till I had someone I trust taste this drek too) she spit it out in disgust.   Matzoh-ball soup was like my mother\'s - the problem is my mother cannot cook either - when we visit her she makes me cook -   The Matzoh-balls were a nice size but hard and seemingly undercooked and without flavor.  The soup itself was not that bad and had the crap at the bottom you would expect with homemade soup. Overall if someone reads this with any power to do so "Bring a good Jewish deli to Pittsburgh PLEASE!!"  I gave the stars for the egg cream -'
