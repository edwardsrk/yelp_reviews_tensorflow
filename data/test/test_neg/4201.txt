b'UGH. My birthday dinner experience was NOT what I wanted it to be this year at Famous Dave\'s. Been here quite a few times and have always had great service/food. The bar was totally empty when our party of 4 sat down and Matt, the bartender took his sweet time getting our initial drink order. Food arrived and was tasty as usual, but even if something had been wrong, Matt never even really checked back to see how things were. We had a bday coupon that was visible on the table and he ran hubby\'s credit card without even acknowledging the coupon. When confronted he had a crappy attitude about it saying "well, I can fix it but it\'ll take like two days for it to be credited back, yadda yadda yadda." Okay, so fix it. That\'s 16 bucks off of our $85 tab, buddy. And guess what? It ain\'t going towards your tip. Had to go chase down a manager to take care of it, which took him all of 4 minutes. Being a server myself, I know how easy it is to reverse a transaction... and I also know how to leave the shitty attitude at the door when I show up for work.This won\'t stop us from going back to this location but if Matt\'s tending bar we\'re sitting in the dining room from now on.'
