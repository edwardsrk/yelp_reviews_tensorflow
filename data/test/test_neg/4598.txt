b"I've been here 5 times and don't think I want to come back again.There are so many good thali places in GTA, I am surprised why this place is popular.Food: 3/5 too oily, nothing special, ordinary and sadly tastes like it's been out for days and days.Service: 1/5 a lot of shouting from servers and no greetings/manners Ambience and location: 0/5 way too cramped, floors are sticky and dirty, tables are dirty, it sort of kills the appetite. And it's been this way during all of my visits. So I doubt it was a one time thing.Price: 5/5 it's very reasonably priced, but quality is what matters. I would rather pay a couple of dollars more for better food. And in all honesty in the same price range you can get better Thalis in other GTA locations."
