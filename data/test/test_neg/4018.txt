b'This review is for the casino only.It is a very sad place with very sad drinks.We saw tweakers with the face scabs darting around (yes, IN the casino) and heroin addicts nodding out at the slots. Gave the place the feeling of scuzzy and unsafe.There was a live "band" playing of two guys who were amazingly talented singers singing some of the worst cover classic rock cover songs from the \'70s one could cover and they were loud. I hope those guys have other gigs because they were good on guitar and voice. Also other gigs might keep them from playing these horrible covers.We spent two hours on blackjack, and the server and dealer were nice and pleasant. For the addicts running around the bathrooms were clean too. I would hope to never come back here again tho.'
