b'I came here for my friends birthday. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice too. However, the beers just f*cking sucked. Three of my friends and I got flights and we did not like any of the beers we collectively tried. "Very average at best", says my bf... at one point a friend asked us "which beer do you recommend?" My bf replied "I\'m not comfortable recommending any of them." Later in the evening someone asked the birthday boy, "Which one in your flight did you like most?", he replied -- "No."'
