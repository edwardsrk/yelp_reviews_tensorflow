b"My sister and I were very excited to try this restaurant as per the Yelp reviews and also looking for a gluten free Italian meal.Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. The server started off by telling us that we would have to wait 25 minutes for our food once we ordered. We were ok with that but as time went on, we ended up waiting 20 minutes for the menu, water and utensils.The male waiter could tell we were getting impatient and took our order and promised us ten minutes.Both of our dishes came in ten minutes but my sister ordered the bolognese pasta, not the rapini. They took both of our pastas back to the kitchen without apologizing or really saying anything to us at all. When they brought them back out, they still said nothing!  No apologies or explanation. The two customers who came in after us were served immediately and well taken care of.We went up to the bar to pay the bill, and once the bill was paid, they did not say a word. No thank you, no 'Goodbye! Have a good night!' And no apologies for any of the delay.To conclude, the food would have been a lot better if the service was better."
