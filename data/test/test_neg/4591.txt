b'This was my second time at Prime and I was really looking forward to the same wonderful experience I had the first time a few years back. To start with, this was a Monday night at about 9:00pm. My wife and I took our 2 friends there after bragging about our last experience. We did not have reservations but we were easily seated, unfortunately in the very back part of the restaurant as far away from the fountain as can be. The evening began pleasantly enough with our drink order from the bar. My wife ordered a very dirty martini and absolutely loved it. Our friend ordered a Lemon Drop and unfortunately it tasted more like syrup than anything else. She refused to send it back and made the best of it. After placing our complete order we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some bread (like we noticed the other tables were having almost immediately after being seated, not us) and the response was a bit stiff with "I\'ll be there as soon as I can." We were eventually served some delicious sourdough bread and pretzel bread. The bread was delicious and we made quick work of it. As it was taking a while for our food to be prepared (no complaint here as good food should take some time) we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some more of the pretzel bread. His response this time was "we are out of pretzel bread because it is so late, that is also why you didn\'t get any raisin bread." Let me state that 9:00pm in Las Vegas is not late. I am also not sure what the point was to tell us what we didn\'t get. My wife then asked for more sourdough and his response was "Are you sure? You have a lot of food coming." After making it clear that we would still like to have the bread it was brought out without any further comment. We took it with a grain of salt and let it go.The rest of the entrees were eventually brought out and the food was fabulous. Paying a premium at a nice restaurant is a treat for most people, like us. We absolutely do not mind doing it but when the experience falls short, then it makes it so not worth it. As much as I enjoy the food at Prime, I feel that this may have been my last visit there. I will happily try one of the many other Steakhouses with excellent Yelp reviews the next time I am in Vegas.'
