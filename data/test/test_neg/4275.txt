b'Khoury\'s used to be my favorite restaurant but ever since they relocated and hired a new staff, THEY SUCK!!! The quality of the food is still ok but the service is super slow and when I left I forgot my to-go bag, i called once I realized it was gone which was maybe 10 min later and they had already disposed of it, could you imagine if I had a full meal for my husband...which I usually do, I would\'ve lost my crap. I almost did with the retarded girl on the phone. Once I told her I left my to go bag her immediate response was, "I don\'t see anything on the tables", instead of saying, let me check with the other server to see if he set it aside. Let\'s not forget that my server never once filled my water cup and took forever just to check back with me every so often. I was a party of 1 and it literally took me over an hour to get out of that place because the service is so slow. Oh and the restaurant was practically empty with 2 SERVERS! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER KHOURY\'s!! Needless to say, I won\'t be recommending this place to anyone and will only go at my own risk when I crave grape leaves. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT'
