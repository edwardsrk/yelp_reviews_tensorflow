b"It's not true one reviewer said there's no bad seats in the house. Try sitting for the entire show in the nose bleed section on the top level. We went for the Andrea Bocelli show on Dec 7th and bought those seats because someone wrote on yelp there's no bad seats in the house!! Big mistake! Pay a little more to get better seats, it's worth it."
