b'Nothing a good "electrical fire" won\'t cure.The 2 stars are for the Pet Valu and the LCBO (both of which, it should be noted, don\'t actually require you to enter the mall. This is a good thing.) The LCBO looks horrible at first glance, but actually has a good selection of Italian and Portuguese wines and Port. Just don\'t come in looking for French or Californian wine. The Pet Value isn\'t my favourite pet supply store (there are a few independents in the Junction that I like better), but they\'re well-stocked and friendly.The inside of the mall itself is dark and dingy. There are a couple of marginally useful dollar/electronics/miscellaneous stuff stores. The place where you can get both a stainless-steel off-brand toaster oven AND a plaster statue of Jesus covered in blood is a special favourite. I wouldn\'t buy clothes in this mall; they all look flammable. The PharmaPlus is a decent drugstore for its size. The Price Chopper is dismal; dirty, wilted produce, and stocking is apparently done by poorly trained members of one of the lower orders of primates. They are constantly out of staples, especially if they go on sale.Good luck finding what they do have. The Zellers is just awful. Stock is hard to find, the prices are often MUCH higher than Canadian Tire or WalMart, and they will make things extremely difficult if you try to get them to honour their price match policy.The parking lot is huge, virtually empty, and if you are walking through it at night, kind of terrifying.Basically, it\'s a handy place to pick up wine or cat litter if you live in the neighbourhood. For almost anything else, you\'re likely better off walking south to Dufferin Mall or West to the Junction.It will be interesting to see what happens once Target takes over Zellers. That could  make the mall a place worth going.'
