b"there are no managers around when you want to complain. The first room had a mildew smell. second room had problem with the A/C. Coffee costs $3.50...not free. a jr suite is just two rooms with a connecting door. Don't opt for that upgrade. Furniture was just left in the hallway. water is not hot. get the north tower. east tower is not as good."
