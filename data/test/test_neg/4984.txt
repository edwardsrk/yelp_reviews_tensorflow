b'We tried Georges for Charlotte Restaurant Week since we hadn\'t had a chance to get there and thought this to be an opportune time to try and share multiple courses. Upon arrival, we were told that they were running a bit behind and they recommended that we sit at the bar while we waited. Our reservation was for 7:30pm and, after enjoying a glass of wine, we checked back with the hostess at 8pm to get a status. She let us know that it would only be a bit longer and that they knew where we were sitting at the bar and would come fetch our party when our table was ready. After another 30 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again at 830pm only to be told that they gave our table to another party in error and would work to get a table cleared for us asap. Once seated, the manager came over and offered us a bottle of champagne to make up for the mix-up. We understood that it was a busy night and that sometimes Restaurant Week can result in diminished service/food quality due to higher volumes of guests than usual. That being said, it was a nice touch to have the management attempt to rectify our wait time.Our waiter came by the table to take our order soon after we were seated--we each ordered off of the Queen\'s Feast menu and also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Within 10 minutes of ordering, runners were at our table with their arms full of plated entrees. After telling them that we hadn\'t yet received our first course, so they must be for another table, they walked back to the kitchen--only to return a second time 60 seconds later. With the plates in their hands, they informed us that there was a mix-up and they had fired our entrees prior to starters and asked what we wanted them to do, rather than just taking the plates back and either trashing them or bringing them to another table (during restaurant week, we assumed there were multiple others waiting on the same dishes). When we asked if they could bring our starters and start over, they informed us that they would be putting our entrees under a heat lamp in the back--something even less desirable than just eating them early, so we ended up taking them without the first course having been served. They then asked if we even wanted our starters, which we did since we were paying for them regardless. A manager was sent out after the starters were delivered (now each of us had 2 courses at once and no chance of preserving the heat in both at the same time) who offered us no apologies, just the statement that they were "doing the best they could" and offering to cover the cost of our bottle of wine. This was certainly a pleasant gesture but, being raised in the restaurant industry, not a replacement for a proper apology. The server avoided us for the most part after these mix-ups and, when he returned to clear plates, he cleared some dishes that we were still in the process of finishing without asking or staying for long enough for us to ask for them to be left. Restaurant weeks are typically a time for diners to try places for the first time and, hopefully, enjoy the experience enough to return. We eat out at restaurants at and above the level of Georges on a regular basis including casual weeknight dinners out, we were there to test out the restaurant, not to get a deal or look for handouts. That being said, the service was appalling and the manner in which the night was handled (avoidance, no apologies, and general lack of professionalism) was inexcusable. We will not be returning to Georges any time soon and hope that they use this as a moment to coach their staff on customer service and respect especially since the food was decent, but tainted by the generally unacceptable experience.'
