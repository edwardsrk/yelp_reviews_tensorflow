b"I wanted to like this place.  It smelled awesome and we don't have many southern food concepts here. The service was sloooowwwwww.  Was seated and it took 20 minutes to get a drink. Not many patrons dining  on a Thursday night at 7pm, which can be a bad sign. Literally only 4 tables filled and few people at the bar. Staff seems inexperienced. Friendly, but not with it. Received the wrong starter. Fried chicken was ok and overpriced for sure. After all, it's fried chicken. Grits were disappointing and needed hot sauce. I lived in the south and this pales in comparison to the worst places I've been. I suggest the chefs go back and gain inspiration to update their recipes or improve kitchen quality. You're missing a lot of opportunity."
