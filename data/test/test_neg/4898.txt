b"I love Hobby Lobby stores but this one is slipping downhill. Aside from it being messy and having a lot of broken items here and there, the bathrooms are disgusting. The floors in and around look like they haven't been cleaned with effort in a long time. There was toilet paper and toilet seat covers everywhere. I understand customers do all of these things but staff should be about and continually checking the bathrooms. I don't see the need to go to this location when there are others that are hopefully cleaner."
