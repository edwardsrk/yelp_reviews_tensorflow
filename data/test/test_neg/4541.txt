b"My dad and I have come here for a cup of gumbo all the time since this location opened, but we probably wont be coming back. Since opening, the quality of this restaurant and its service had declined significantly. Tonight we came in to super sticky floors everywhere we walked and it took is 10 minutes to even get an order put in, though our waitress kept coming by to help the table next to us and making eye contact with us. It took extra long for my dad's beer to come out and when we reminded them, they dropped off a beer can on the table (no glass, and they didnt say a word) and ran off to help someone else. The bread they bring out always tastes lukewarm and stale, as though they quickly microwaved the loaf. It's hard to pull apart and hasnt tasted fresh since we first came in around opening. The gumbo tonight wasnt the best quality either- as avid fans of it, we were both seriously disappointed. Neither of us could finish because the taste was dull and unappetizing. We are both super bummed because this was our favorite place to stop for a quick, delicious dinner, but after tonight, we've decided we'll be taking our gumbo needs elsewhere.Update: Since posting this review, we still haven't gotten our check and its been about 20 minutes since we finished eating. The restaurant is only about half full, so I dont know what the slow service is due to. There are waiters checking on everyone else... When we first came here, the service was the fastest we've ever seen, so now we're just disappointed and confused."
