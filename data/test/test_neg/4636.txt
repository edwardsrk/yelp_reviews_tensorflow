b"Ok, I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan. I had to go here, so I dragged all my friends along because it was for my 21st bday. We ordered an appetitzer and it was ok. My friend ordered a margarita and it wasn't to our liking.  Service was good, but not great. The food was OK, i already got tired of my dish after the 3rd bite.  It was maybe too sweet? Too many flavors combining and its not concentrating on one flavor. When Bobby cooks on Food Network, your mouth waters, but at Mesa Grill...I didn't.  I tried Emerils before Mesa Grill, and loved Emerils. But to mention we could order off the BRUNCH menu only.  I looked at the pics from the dinner menu, and they look very good. And I had the spicy chicken potato hash....way too sweeet, and too much."
