b"Went for brunch and enjoyed the view from the back patio.  Our server was very nice.  However nobody enjoyed their meal and our drinks came out with our meal 20 minutes after ordering.  Chaquilas came out with a fried egg over soggy chips and the avocado toast should be called cilantro with avocado mash on cold French bread.  Don't go here for the food but enjoy the view from the back patio!"
