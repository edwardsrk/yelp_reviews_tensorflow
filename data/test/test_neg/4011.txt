b"We waited for seats for twenty minutes at which point they started shutting down tables. We asked what was going on and were given a song and a dance about how that section was being shut down. Eventually they told us that the bathroom was broken and they were closing but that we were welcome to take our expensive hot chocolate to go. Waiting for a purpose is fine, waiting for no reason is not. I usually don't give two stars without multiple trips, but this was a little too absurd to not comment. Based on others reviews, it sounds like management has a huge customer service issue to address with their staff."
