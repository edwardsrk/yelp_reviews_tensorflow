b"Not a very clean place. This is the first impression when you walk in here. Staff aren't friendly either. Very hard to get their attention when you need them. Food is average. The only thing that I like on the menu is Satay Beef vermicelli. Never expected much every time I come here. Only come here when it's a friend's request or when we ran out of option."
