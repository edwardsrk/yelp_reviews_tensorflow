b"I went two weekends ago with girlfriends and the wait was 20 mins at 11 am. But then it took 1 hour and 15 mins to get out food. They had warned us it would take 1 hour once seating us. I don't think the coffee is worth $3 but it is free refills and they have cream and milk. Also seems like a ploy to almost force you to get coffee while you wait so long for your food. The new waitress did being out a delicious banana chocolate crumble muffing to tide us over. My chicken and waffle was good! Not great but good. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The single piece of crispy fried chicken was tasty with a mild spice that went wellWith the syrup. I sampled the poutine and it was decent but I'm not a huge poutine fan to begin with. Not sure I would go back between the hours of 10:30-1 pm. The people who got their before 11  am were still waiting for their food!Something needs to change. The $25 brunch + tax and tip isn't worth the wait unless you're purposefully fasting until noon. Ha."
