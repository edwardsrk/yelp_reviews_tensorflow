b'Well I would not recommend this place. I am currently here and my table of 5 were the first customers of the day. Initially our server came with waters. Then we ordered sodas and it literally took 15 minutes to get them with only 1 other table of 2 in the restaurant. We ordered our food with the drinks and it took 25 minutes for a salad and 4 burgers. Seriously with 7 total customers?  Then one burger was not done properly. I asked for my salad dressing on the side but it came fully dressed with my lettuce doing the back stroke in the bowl. If it is like this with 7 customers how do they handle crowds??? I would not recommend this place!'
