b'I ordered "PS3 EyePet" for $9.99 plus taxes ($11.29 total) for one of their Deal of The Day promotions on March 23. The payment went thru on March 26. Purchasing the game on the web site was not possible since it was a Daily Deal, so I had to phone in and place the order. I spoke to a man who took my VISA information as well as my e-mail and phone number. He told me it would take some time for the game to come in from BC. I stopped into the store nearly two weeks later and the game had not come in yet, but the man at the desk told me he remembered that he was the one who took my order by phone, and that the game would be in next week. I received no order number by e-mail, so he looked it up and found my order by phone number. I stopped in again a few days ago to pick up the game, the same man was working there but was busy, so I went to another employee. He could not find my order associated with my phone number, though it did show my name. No info under my e-mail either. I see on my VISA bill that NCIX did charge me for the game, but I can\'t get it. I would now like for these charges to be reversed, I no longer want to purchase the game. Too much hassle and confusion.'
