b"I've heard that their tamarind soup is phenomenal but I wanted to be adventurous and get something different and you know what, this was one of the times I wish I hadn't.  I had the V6 (one of the vermicelli salad noodle bowls with an eggroll and garlic pork) cause somebody had uploaded a picture of it on Yelp and it looked so delicious.  Or maybe I just thought it looked delicious cause I was starving, so that's what I got.  It was bland.  And I was disappointed.  I don't really have much else to say about this place cause I was just so upset at how bland my food was.  If I ever go back, I will try their tamarind soup, but I'm sorry, nothing else."
