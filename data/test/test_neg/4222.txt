b'Had a massage with Ericka. Although the massage she provided was skilled and effective, I was unimpressed with her ability to connect with me as a client. I feel it is important to provide a great massage as well as make your client feel comfortable, which she was unable to do. At the end, she asked me to pay for a 90 min massage even though I had a 60 min massage. I had to correct her and her response was that "I needed a 90 min massage".  I\'m giving my experience two stars because the massage itself was good and I was able to schedule on short notice.'
