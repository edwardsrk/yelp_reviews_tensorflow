b"Mediocre at best.  If Red Lobster is your pinnacle of taste, then you may enjoy it.  The lunches we've had there over the years, however - as a favor to my elderly Dad - were consistenly sub-Olive Garden in quality.   Its really a shame that the follow-through on the WWII era decor was so impressive and yet they care so little about the quality of food.   Also they are not exactly attracting the most gung-ho wait staff.   Its all a bit sad, really.Finally, if anyone gives this place a 4 or 5 star review, you should be very, very suspect."
