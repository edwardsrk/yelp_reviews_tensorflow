b"Came here after reading the BlogTO article. Restaurant is located in a corner of a Plaza, difficult to spot from the street. Service was really slow even though the restaurant was empty. The dips were ok. Falafel and Shawarma were alright. The pita was warmed up not baked fresh. Lighting wasn't great either. The slow service is what really got to me."
