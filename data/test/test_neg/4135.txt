b"This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time."
