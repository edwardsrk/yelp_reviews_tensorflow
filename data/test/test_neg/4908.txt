b"I only rated it two stars because I have no idea how the food is since they only deliver to businesses with orders in excess of $40. I don't think this qualifies a business to advertise delivery services on Yelp, they're a carry out or dine-in establishment for the average consumer. Due to the poor business model and my personal eating habits, It's pretty likely that I will never end up spending any money here. And that sucks, as I like to support local when I can. I will mention that the guy who answered the phone was nice. He seemed genuinely apologetic about the owners crap business model. That's the only positive I have for this place, thus far. His professionalism earned these guys the second star."
