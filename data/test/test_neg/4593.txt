b"So we were there as part of a large party. We arrived earlier than most of the party and bellied up to the bar whipe waiting for the table to be ready. Bartender was fantastic!! I got a couple samples and decided on their TentCity IPA. Table got ready and we went into this back room and that's where the evening turned to bad. The room we were in still looked to be under construction a bit. The chair around this table were in bad shape like the screws were loose on them I do not mean 1 or 2 chairs either very wobbly as well. So we had to chase some one down to replace a few chairs.  We finally got to meet our waiter who showed up to work in basketball shorts and a tee shirt seriously basketball ball shorts really.. So he gets our food order and our next round of beers and we wait and wait, finally you guessed it SOME of our food came out agian large party of course not all the food can come out at once  but dam half the people were done eating before some us got our food while still waiting on our beers WTF is going on 48.. It should state 48 minutes in between food and drink!!! So now the food and beer finally shows up now we are eating while people are finished completely ridiculous.. So as we all finish 2 people in my party order another beer and wait after 10 minutes the come back and give them 2 different beers and say they ran out of the kind of beer ordered so they picked the closest beer to what they ordered agian WTF why would you choose someone else's drink. I mean you have basketball shorts on run back to the table and ask if there is something else you may like or maybe bring a sample but don't pour a pint and guess what I want.... Food was barely above dive bar food. Not sure what's going on at 48 but there is alot of room for improvements... I have read alot of the reviews and see the owners/management reads and responds to Yelp community so it's up in the air whether they will do anything but we can warn other Yelpers.. My beer was good, wife's beer was good.  I will give another shot if I am out that way only for the beer if you belly up to the bar.. Seems that only the bartender's gave any care. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars because the bartender's were great but I only dealt with them for 5 minutes or so."
