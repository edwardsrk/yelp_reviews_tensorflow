b'Whoohoo! 100th review on Yelp! Sad it\'s not a five star though. I read reviews. Looked at pictures and was excited to try this place.We ordered a few apps and sushi rolls from the HH menu and it was all just okay. Chicken wings had a great crispiness and there was a delish garlic sauce just on halfThe chicken wing. I wish it came with more sauce. Calamari was disappointing. It was just random cut up sticks that were overcooked and dipping sauce was sour.  Husband enjoyed his shrimp tempura roll and bulgogi. The bulgogi was burnt and had that burnt bitter flavor and came out last. I had the 6 piece sashimi special. Fish was cold but the cuts were a joke. They literally took one normal slice of tuna and cut it in half. The salmon was two whole slices and the "white fish" ended up being red snapper. At least they were whole slices. I also had the jalape\xc3\xb1o roll. Which was literally a jalape\xc3\xb1o popper in a sushi roll. It was pretty good surprisingly and had the volcano roll. Presentation was cool because they lit it on fire. Service was a bit much. The girl we had was the onlyOne working until just before we left. She constantlyKept asking if we were ready to order. But when you give me a book of rolls. It\'s gonna take time for me to read them. Lol. In the end. Food was just okay. Edible. Service was okay. There are just other better places. I guess a plus is they offer a large happy hour menu compared to others.'
