b"My wife and I moved to the area in July and have been to Marcello's a handful of times over the last few months. Our experiences have been interesting to say the least, however they have been improving.The first time we ate here was around August, and the food was okay, but a little overpriced. The bartenders are very friendly, and it seems they are finally getting some decent beers on draft. We have always received fantastic service, the girls are always delightful and efficient. Which is why I find this confusing and upsetting. On multiple occasions, my wife and I have unfortunately overheard the owner or manager talking down to and yelling at his employees (and not very discretely, I might add). I have managed restaurants for the last 16 years, and the service here is great.I have had some dishes that were delicious, and some that were mediocre. The music on the weekends is nice, but can be a bit loud if you're trying to have a quiet meal.We come back from time to time for the atmosphere, great service, and the specials on the board are usually very tasty. However, it seems like there is much room for improvement in the management. I wouldn't stand for my managers being consistently condescending and disrespectful to the staff."
