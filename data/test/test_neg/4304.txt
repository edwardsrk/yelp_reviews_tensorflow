b"Casbah was more than a little disappointing.. I came to celebrate a family member's birthday and we were seating in the basement room. The whole dinner was 3 hours long. It was just too long. They didn't check up on us anywhere near enough. They were friendly of course, but it wasn't enough! 3 hours for 3 courses just didn't feel good!The menu had two vegetarian options. I have noticed that many of these more upscale places tend to have risotto or pasta as their fallback vegetarian option, and it was certainly the case here. I ordered the pasta and it was $20 and one of the tiniest portions I've seen. The problem is, for that price, every bite should have been exciting and new. It should have been heaven. It wasn't. It was plain and there were more onions than pieces of rigatoni. I saw many of my meat eating relatives seemed to enjoy their meals. They ordered scallops and short ribs and huge chickens. But my pasta was so horribly disappointing. I'm not coming back!"
