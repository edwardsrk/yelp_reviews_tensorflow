b"I'm so sad that I'm writing this review. I had high hopes for this place. The inside is super cute, the boutique-style stuff they sell is darling, and the bakery goods were absolutely delicious looking. Most of the food we ordered was good. The service, not so much. Our order was wrong and the employee fought with me about it, saying I didn't order what I said I did. She was rude and unhelpful, and then said that we didn't pay for something that we had ordered and paid for. So I went inside to pay for it so my husband could eat, even though I KNOW I paid for it on the original receipt. I wasn't going to fight about it, and I wasn't going to let my husband sit there with no food while the rest of our group ate. Oh well. We won't be back. There are plenty of breakfast and bakery options in the vicinity."
