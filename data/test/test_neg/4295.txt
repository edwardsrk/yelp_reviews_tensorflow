b'I do not normally give reviews. I just keep returning to the establishment often if I like it. So good reviews from me would never be seen. So for me to give a review I have to be angry and feel a need to address the grievance. So I have been coming often to Times Square Italian Restaurant and honestly I have liked every dish I have tried Pasta Emilano, Past Giovanni, Scampi Fraviche? or something like that and La Princepesa. I liked the dish this time also it was great. My friend had a problem with his dish and they promptly corrected it with no fuss to more than what I expected service at this point would be good. Being that was the case and I had to wait for my friends meal to come out I mentioned at that time I would just get a dessert when the meal came however the server Julie C. never came back or asked or checked in if there was anything else. Finally came by and when I asked if I could get a dessert said they closed at 10 pm it was a few minutes after 10 and I had been waiting for her to come by and take my dessert order. For this incident I took the liberty to express my dissatisfaction with a low tip of 1.00 as I never not leave a tip. I like the food, my friend likes the place so i will probably come back but I expect at least a reasonable attempt to be made that I have gotten everything I wanted to order. The most effective way to have avoided this was to come by and ask it we wanted dessert as the kitchen was going to close and needed to know so they could have it prepared. I have has better service at a chain establishment that I would rate their food much lesser but I go back there as I am not mistreated customer even if it is close to closing time.Edited review as email listed on their web site is: Undeliverable: Notice Poor customer service - negative Yelp review...
