b'My Fianc\xc3\xa9e and her family had booked 3 suites and a room at the Elara Hilton, an expensive and extravagant treat as my Fianc\xc3\xa9e and I were in town to get married.Surprised to see that upon our arrival at the Elara, there had been a flood affecting the main guest elevators and condemning them to being out of action. The staff made provisions and employed the service elevators for guests, for which on our arrival there was a horrendous queue to use. Still, this couldn\'t be helped as there was a fault.My now wife went to the desk, concerned the next day to ask how long the elevators were likely to be out of action, and if they were out of action on our wedding day, could some provision be made to be escorted in the service elevator so that it was occupied (for one journey only) only by the bridal party, to avoid being crammed in like we were on our initial use of the elevators, to avoid anyone trampling on her wedding dress. A reasonable request, one might think.To be responded by the staff on the desk that "they would not hold an elevator even for the POTUS" was down right rude and disrespectful, and certainly not the attitude one would expect from a HILTON.This was the first in a line of poor customer service encounters that both myself and my wife encountered during our stay at the Elara.Our room was not turned around despite having the sign set to "please make up" and we were not supplied clean towels or toilet roll for multiple days until we had to request them.The rooms were of course magnificent, as we had 3 suites between us these we\'re amazing and worth the treat to ourselves, but what should have been a magnificent week at a prestigious hotel such as the Elara during our wedding getaway will forever be marred with the poor customer service of the staff.Luckily the guest elevators were working again by the time of our wedding, at least to the 3rd floor, from which we could take a secondary elevator, or escalators to the 2nd (lobby) or 1st (valet). As one final kick in the teeth as we left however, the escalators also decided to give-up-the-ghost and left us cramming into the only 1-3 floor elevator with all of our luggage at the end of the stay.Given the circumstances the staff could have handled themselves a lot better and made the bad situation of mechanical failures a little more palatable to us as we were patient customers, instead they decided to be hostile and arrogant. Poor Form.Would not recommend.'
