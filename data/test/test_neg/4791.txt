b"It's a sad, sad day when a truly tasty burger bar fails terribly in providing basic service! [I used to stop in frequently when I lived close by but sometimes things change and not always for the better]Waited a good 15 min to get a menu after taking a seat at a nearly empty bar around 4:30p on the weekend, then another 10 min to get my drink. I gave my order to the bartender, but she completely forgot to put it into the kitchen. Meanwhile I witnessed others who ordered after me get their food. The bartender never made so much as eye contact with me even though I was trying to catch her attention about my beloved burger lol... So I flagged down a server to ask about my meal and it got walked directly to the kitchen.Eventually the burger double stack came out and it was every bit as flavorful as the wait was long. As good as I remembered. It was topped with 3 slices of applewood bacon and side of pickles ($12). Oh happy belly!! The sweet potato fries on the other hand were small in proportion, dry, and didn't have much taste until I salted them on my own ($5). Maybe in a rush they forgot to season them? Oh well.At no time did anyone ask how my meal was and at the end, not even an apology or concession for the lack of service/order mishap."
