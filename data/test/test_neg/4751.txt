b"For the friendliness of the staff do the store, I'd give 5 stars. However, the quality of their furniture is the reason I'm rating them so low.  I purchased a living room set for $1,990. 3 months down the road, the couch broke. Then a month further the loveseat broke as well. I returned it under manufacturer warranty and got a completely different set. Guess what? It broke only after one month. Just over it."
