b"I have been to wok of fame a few times now... I do think it is slightly better then madarine (food wise), but I must say the customer service is just horrible, especially by the girll station where the steaks and fish is served. Those guys are just rude!!! They make it uncomfortable for my family and I to even ask for a piece of steak like I'm bothering them or something. Maybe they should retrain their staff because good customer service will retain customer."
