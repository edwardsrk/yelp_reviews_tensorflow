b'This store is way overpriced, but it\'s in a convenient location if you\'re in a pinch.  I used to stop in every week for my guinea pig\'s Carefresh bedding, but they\'ve recently stopped carrying the natural version I prefer.  They also used to have pretty ok sales on the bedding, but I haven\'t seen any in months.  It just got too expensive.  Plus the staff at the Pet Co in Westgate seem much more established, happier with their jobs.  This Pet Supplies Plus is really weird -- the manager\'s "office" is a whole looming 5 feet above the cash registers, and is basically like an open cubicle meant as a place for the manager to survey the store and employees.  A little too Big Brother/King of the Castle to really boost employee morale, I think.It appears I\'m chained to this store, though, at least in the timothy hay department.  They carry the OxBow brand of timothy hay, which my pig much prefers to the Katee brand -- the only other place I\'ve seen it is at my vet\'s, which is down in Brunswick.  It does take a little digging to find a bag that\'s not dried out or brown.  So as soon as I find another retailer that sells the OxBow...see ya, Pet Supplies Plus.'
