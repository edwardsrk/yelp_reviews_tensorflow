b"Food was good, server did a good job, but the place is not managed well. I know they don't pick their customers but we ate  next to a table that had a screaming kid and a kid throwing food everywhere and after they left it was 20 minutes before they cleaned the area. There was some confusion concerning the next customers to be seated as they were brought to the table that had not been cleaned yet and stood by or table waiting for their table to be cleanedfor a long time.  As they were final being seated another table was being seated behind us with another screaming toddler that also was jumping up and down on the seat common with mine. Her brother was playing a game machine with the volume loud enough it disturbed our ability to converse with each other."
