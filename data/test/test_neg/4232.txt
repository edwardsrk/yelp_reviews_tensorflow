b'The food is always good but I spent 20 minutes placing a pick up order using the app and it wouldn\'t let me pick a pickup time for today. so I phoned and the choice for talking to a manager just took me back to the main menu. Finally got a manager and was cut off. Finally got the manager back who would take my order but had no interest in fixing the app. "I don\'t know anything about that but J can take you order over the phone."'
