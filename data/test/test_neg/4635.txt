b"*****update below Food is delicious. Absolutely have to stop in and try. Service was slow, it took forever to get a refill on water. Maybe because we sat outside. Updated****Today we visited again, they weren't on top of things. Dirty tables sit around us during the entire time we were there. I requested hummus which the waitress brought out long after I ate my pita-bread. Speaking of pita, I had one that was more like a pita chip and one that was still doughy. The Pepsi was flat tasting and we had empty glasses for longer than we should have. The food wasn't the best today either. Lastly, they got my husbands order wrong.  Even after having to come back and ask him a second time what it was he had ordered.  Smh."
