b'Located a few venues west of Jilly\'s, dim lighting, the decor was interesting, & the bar had lots of character.Me & Yvonne T. went here for the Winterlicious menu.For appetizers: "P\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 Br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e" & "Mini Haute Poutine".  The P\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9  was excellent in flavour & texture, however, not enough crostinis were provided as there were lots of the chicken liver left after the the last crostini was eaten.The Poutine, fries were prepared in duck lard so I was expecting crisp robust fries, the duck toppings were not as flavorful as I remembered a duck confit to be. The dish portions were lacking, duck was not the best & the fries were soggy.25 minutes passed after we finished our appetizers before our mains came to the table.For mains:"Lamb Shank" & "Mac et Fromage"Lamb Shank was tender, however it came out cold & there was no juice or sauce which could have easily made the dish significantly better.  The scalloped taters were soft & had no flavor. The dish could have very easily been better.Mac et Fromage was good, nice flavor & the cheese\'s texture was enjoyable. I would not have minded if there was a little more of it to go around.For dessert: "Eton Mess" & "Triple Layer Brownie Cake"The brownie in the brownie cake was not really brownie at all, more like supermarket cake. The Eton mess was interesting, like a lump of macaron at the bottom of some whipped cream like substance.At the end of it all the bill came but also included gratuity, 18% gratuity, most uncharacteristic of western restaurants. I do not think I will revisit.'
