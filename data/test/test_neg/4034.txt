b"Took 30-45 mins for a pretty sad looking ramen.  Broth was extra salty, took forever and it wasn't even hot... The Japanese soft boiled egg had a center that was way over cooked.. Seriously I can do better with a packaged ramen. Even when getting the check took extra long with barely any customers.   Maybe my waiter just sucked.  He took a break, came back and still didn't have our food.  What a joke!"
