b"This was a very out of body experience for my husband and I the other night. We arrived without a reservation and were given the option to wait 30 minutes or sit at the community table. We chose the community table. We also paid a little attention to the incoming crowd, but probably saw around 2 whole tables come in after us with a plush amount of open seating getting cold in the dining room. The staff was a little scripted. A lot scripted. I felt like I was on a Lord of the Rings ride at Universal Studios or something. Okay, I don't even know if that's a ride. I guess if you really don't pay attention to the whole price/ food equation, then you don't realize how much you are getting ripped off. Sure, I love the down home local farm food just as much as the next gal. That's pretty much all I make at home. I was raised in the South. But my $9 salad consisted of a few sheaths of bib lettuce, and a sprinkle of other things. I wasn't expecting gold nuggets in the thing, but come on. The dinner was so-so. Again, if you take the price out of the equation it was enjoyable to eat. Then reality sinks in when you get the bill and realize you are sitting at a community table surrounded by guys on internet dates with fair that you find at a country diner and a bill that rivals that one you would get at Domminck's. Next time I think we will save the whole dressing up thing and just eat at home. Hey, I can make a mean grilled cheese, too, Beckett."
