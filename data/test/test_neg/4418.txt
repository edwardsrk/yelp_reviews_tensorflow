b"This review is based my latest experience. I have always ordered from Magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later.  So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while."
