b"If you LOVE Lou Malnatis like I do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. The pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! Wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! Won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to Lou's!"
