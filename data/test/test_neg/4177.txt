b'I used to come here almost weekly but the prices keep going up and the past few times the tortillas have consistently been hard and chewy, I got tired of asking for fresh ones... The salsa is inconsistent also, hot one day then like tomato sauce the next, too bad because this was one of my favorites restaurants....'
