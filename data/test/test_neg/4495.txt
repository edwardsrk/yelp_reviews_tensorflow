b'Ate here with my wife for what I figured was going to be dinner, but wasn\'t really.  We had been to the Hash House a Go Go at the M Resort before that location closed and were pleased with the meal we had then, so we figured we\'d try the Henderson location as it\'s the closest to where we live.  We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be about a 10 minute wait, even though there were tables available on both sides of the restaurant . After only about 5 minutes we were seated.  I always find it strange when a couple is seated at a table for four, when there are tables for two available.  It seems like poor planning.  Anyway, after we were seated we waited several more minutes for our server to take our drink orders.  While we waited, we scanned the menu to find that there were no dinner options, only breakfast and brunch.  We asked our server where the dinner menus were but this location is only serving brunch until they "get up to speed" - kind of strange to me, as they\'ve been open for 10 days, and have multiple locations in town.  Since dinner was out, and that\'s what my wife and I had planned for we really had to struggle to find what we wanted to eat.  We had both read the online menu before leaving the house, so we had our minds set on certain meals, only to have to change ideas at the last moment.  I\'d had their stuffed burger at their M Resort location and thought it was pretty good, though lacking seasoning, so I figured I\'d try one again.  Although my wife and I debated about getting the chicken pot pie we each went with the stuffed burger.She selected the Swiss and mushroom burger, while I wanted the Cheddar burger, but I also wanted bacon on it.  When I asked the server if they could add bacon, he said he would add a side of bacon.  At the M Resort location every meal came with a biscuit, and their biscuits were about the size of a saucer.  When I asked our server if our meals came with a biscuit, he said they didn\'t, but he would add one, so I said we\'d each want one.It took quite a while for us to get our food, I had ordered the biscuits in hopes they would come first as a sort of appetizer as we were both very hungry, however they came with the meal - sort of.  My burger came out first, without bacon.  Then after a few minutes I got my biscuit, when I asked where my wife\'s biscuit was the waiter said he thought we had only wanted one, and would send out another.  My wife received her burger next, then finally my bacon and our second biscuit.  The burgers are large - 2 1/2 pound patties, but it\'s almost as if they don\'t season them when they\'re being fried, there\'s very little flavor.  My wife\'s Swiss and mushroom burger had only one detectable mushroom, but so much Swiss it was sliding off the burger - that\'s a good thing about the Swiss though!  My burger had a nicely flavored cheddar, but it wasn\'t oozing out like my wife\'s Swiss was.  I also find that the bun which is very bland also takes flavor from the burger.  The fries are very plain, with little flavor as well.  The Mac-n-Cheese is not what I had expected - it\'s thin, with an artificial cheese flavor - lacking substance and just not satisfying.  And then there were the biscuits - The one\'s at M Resort were large, soft and fluffy, flaky, and full of flavor.  My first biscuit was so hard, I couldn\'t cut it in half.  When I asked the server if this is how the biscuit was supposed to be, she said she didn\'t know, she had never had their biscuits.  So we got two more that were fresh out of the oven - they were better, but still hard and very dry and very small.  We were also given some sort of jam (?) with the biscuits - we were never told what it was, even though we got 4 containers of them, and the butter that came with the jam was only about 1/4 of the container.  I had to ask twice more for more butter - and each time only got 1/4 of a container - butter shortage?  Won\'t be back to this location for a while - might stop in again if they start serving dinner - but can\'t see ever getting the burger again.  They\'ve got a long way to go, and staff needs to be educated much better (have to ask for everything, ask for refills of drinks, remind servers that you need certain items, etc.) before this location can really carry the Hash House a Go Go name.'
