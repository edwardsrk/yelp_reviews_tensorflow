b"Myself and some work colleagues have gone to this restaurant several times and every time we leave, we always leave saying that we will not return, not because of the food, but the service. The food is always great!Today was a perfect example. There were four of us and we all received our food in stages. With 5 to 10 minutes in between each us. Today I was the last person to get my lunch. Then we wanted to get separate checks and were told no. I would understand this being an issue if the place was packed, but it's not the case.I will not be going back!"
