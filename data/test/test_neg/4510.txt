b"First off... know that you will be charged another $10 dollars just to PARK!. Basic ticket price is $37.50 per person (everyone over 12 yrs). Is it worth it? a reluctant yea.. there are a lot of inter-active games and displays. I bought tickets 4-5 weeks ago, and was so excited that it was opening here, just a mile away! If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now it's off my bucket list, i'm not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, it's cold throughout. Bring the kids, it's more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lack-lustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food on-site, which we didn't try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside (outside) available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the 'Holo-Blaster Training Simulator' and the 'Black Widow Agility Maze'. There was an 'Avengers Encounter' that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed 'hokey', good-hearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a $10 per car fee since you're already spending money at my place? That is sooo retarded, shame on you for not putting that in your website, or with ticketmaster. I carry just credit cards anymore... you need to bring cold hard cash and lots of it."
