b"Decided to give this place a try. Party of 3, one ordered the Shanghai Lumpia, barbeque pork skewers and I ordered the pancit malabon.  Order took awhile, my companions were almost done with their meal. My order of pancit malabon arrives, I give it a taste and smell and it tasted and smelled a bit funny. Took 2 more bites and decided that I wasn't going to eat it.  I informed the waitstaff that it smelled and tasted spoiled.  They offered to replace it with a to -go ordered. Went against it. Didn't want to take my chances of getting sick."
