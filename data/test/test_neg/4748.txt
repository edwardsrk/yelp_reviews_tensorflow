b"The food here is always good but 4 of 5 times we come here at least one order is wrong. If the waiter would write our orders down that might improve. It's frustrating to have limited time for a lunch break and get the wrong order. Today, 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong and they gave a 30% discount. So, we basically got to eat what they decided to serve us for $2.00 off menu price.I also believe it is obscene to charge $1.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream or 1/4 cup of cheese in a Mexican restaurant."
