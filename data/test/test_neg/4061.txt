b"I've eaten here once, for lunch, and it was decidedly meh.  We were seated promptly, but it took far too long for the food to come out.  I ordered a club sammich, which should be pretty much idiot proof to make.  There wasn't anything in particular wrong with it.  It just wasn't very good.  It was almost too huge to eat, and I could only get through half of it.  The accompanying fries were so so.The rub is the sammich was nearly $15.00.  OK, it's Vegas, and lots of things are overpriced, but Planet Hollywood is no Cosmo, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore, etc."
