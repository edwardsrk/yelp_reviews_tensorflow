b'Maybe it\'s just me but Dressler\'s didn\'t live up to the hype. Me and the boyfriend spent a date night here and while we\'ve been wanting to come here for a while now, it was a really disappointing experience. The good: We made a reservation so wait time wasn\'t bad at all. We sat outside and the view was as amazing as people have commented. There was a band playing outside so the intimacy was pretty much gone at that point but they were pretty good and made the ambience less "stuffy". The drinks weren\'t bad at all. If you\'re concerned about prices, don\'t get a cocktail and do a beer instead. Cocktails average around $13 but it was good nonetheless. We got a free dessert, the Apple crisp. The boyfriend loved it, I wasn\'t a fan but to no fault of the dessert. The best part of the meal was the appetizer. We got the Cajun scrimp and baguette and it was delicious- they should make this into an entree. The bad: The entrees were just bad. The boyfriend got the New York strip steak with fries and asparagus and I ordered the ribeye with asparagus and herb potatoes. We also got the macaroni and cheese side dish. Both of our steaks were over cooked. I ordered my steak medium and the boyfriend requested medium to medium well. Worst steak I\'ve ever had in my life. It was dry, too charred, and we didn\'t see any pink until the middle of the steaks. I\'ve had better steaks off my George Foreman grill. I didn\'t finish my steak and the boyfriend didn\'t either and we always clean our plates. I literally had 3 asparagus spears on my plate. 3. I\'m not sure why they would list asparagus to come with an entree if it\'s going to be a garnish. On the other hand, the boyfriend got a normal amount of asparagus. It was just like WTF. The macaroni was bad. It had basically no cheese and was not creamy. It got eaten because we were hungry. Our server was okay, just a little odd to me. He wasn\'t very accommodating and was very nonchalant. I could tell that he either had plans that night that he was missing out on or just didn\'t want to be working.  The ugly: Turn around time is horrendous! We ordered the appetizer and entree at the same time and we were left waiting what felt ages and it wasn\'t even busy. I was at the point of becoming hangry. We didn\'t send our steaks back because we didn\'t feel like waiting another 20 minutes and it was getting too late for heavy foods. The food is most definitely overpriced for the poor quality. Glad I came to say that I went but I will definitely not be returning.'
