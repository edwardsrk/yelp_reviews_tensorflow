b"Came here for the Super Bowl weekend . I stayed for 4 days! I didn't know what to expect cause it was the first time staying at a resort hotel . I got a corner suite with 2 bed room on the 3x floor ! First impress was amazing when I opener the blind and saw the view. The decor was okay and felt kind of cheap . Wasn't impress compared to the other hotels that I stayed at on the strip. The drawer where hard to push back in when you open it . Biggest complaint that if you really wanted to stay up late and party after u get back from the club it wasn't  a ideal place to do so! There are mostly older people who wake up early and to go sleep early ! So if you want to be loud at night your most likely get a complaint from the Neighboor s.The security would come by and give u a warning letter ! Then they wait 1 more hour before they come back to escort the people  who are not on your guest list out. This would be a good place for a family that doesn't party. If you turn the tv on loud in the living room then you can hear it in the hall way cause of the design of the place. Overall it's okay ! Don't think I would stay here again unless i get the 4 bed room suite where there wouldn't be any Neighbor's ! There was never a line to get a taxi which was a plus ."
