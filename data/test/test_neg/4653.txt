b'Could you pick a more horrible location? Limited parking and extremely dangerous to pull out of the lot onto hwy 74 with cars going 60MPH. Building was small and dirty however the staffs were well dressed and professional. Anyway, I booked my reservation online. On the day of pickup, I arrived 45 minutes early. They had no cars and so we waited for a customer who was schedule to drop off the car. Half an hour went by and one was dropped off. The staff processed the transaction and quoted me an amount higher than I had reserved. He stated it was because I\'m early. What the hell? I\'ll wait the friggin 15 minutes then. They "refreshed" the car for me. It still smelled and was dirty inside. Car ran fine though and we dropped it off a few days later without issues. Hertz, please send some money to this branch so they could fix up the place.'
