b"I had good intentions going here.  Naturally with the recent disaster in Vegas I wanted to make my contribution to donate blood.Made an appointment and completed Fast Track with hopes of decreasing my wait time.  I arrived, checked in, provided my paperwork and took my seat fully expecting a little delay before giving blood.  An hour passed and so I approached the desk to inquire how much longer it'd be before I'd be seen.  To my disappointment I was curtly told that they're behind.  After a little further probing I was able to get the desired response.  I patiently waited another 30 minutes and was finally called in to interview!  I had run out of time as I had to pick up my children from school.  I know the men and women at these facilities are working hard and extremely busy.  Their service to the community is tremendous.  The only suggestion I have to improve business is to display or simply communicate wait times so donors can make good use of time.  I will be scheduling another appointment to fulfill my commitment but perhaps at another location or even American Red Cross instead."
