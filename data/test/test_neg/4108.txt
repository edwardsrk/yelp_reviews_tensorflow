b'ALWAYS trying to upsell me on a number of services...high pressure too. I usually point out something that needs special attention (dog hair in the back seat, crumbs on the floor, etc) and they consistently proceed to do a half ass vacuum job. Two stars because the outside of the car usually looks nice and the inside is wiped down pretty well.. Overall, however, these guys need to step up their game. I used to bring my car here when it was under previous ownership and was always pleased with the service. Now I would prefer to drive 10-15 miles further to get a superior car wash.'
