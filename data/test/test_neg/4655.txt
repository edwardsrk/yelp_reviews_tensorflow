b"The food here is always good as you watch them cook your food to order.  Better selections as of lately as it seems they've changed their menu a bit since my last visit this past summer.  They reserve seating apparently.  I saw several tables reserved the entire time we were there (1:20) and they were never used.   It posed a challenge for my party of 3 to be able to find a seat.  They need to do that better.  The big issue on this Friday even was the noise level.  It caused my family and I to have to raise our voices quite a bit to talk to each other at the table we did find.  Not a pleasurable experience in the least."
