b"Red Lobsters around the country have gone through a recent renovation of both their decor and their menus that you may have missed. The move has made the restaurant into more of an upscale offering, with concordant higher prices. It is the act of offering that is now more upscale, however, and not necessarily what is offered to you.The change results in an additional menu section where you can choose any of a selection of fresh fish and then choose how you want it cooked (oven, pan or broil). Then you get a couple of their standard sides for $13-20. The rest of the menu, other than the big crustaceans, is cheaper than this. Its not a bad deal if the fish is good and fresh and then cooked skillfully. In my limited recent experience, (one recent trip to this location and two recent trips to other Red Lobsters) their cooking is hit or miss. I was very happy with my broiled salmon in terms of size, flavor and doneness. Others have been less enthusiastic, with classic fish complaints (size/strong smell/consistency). Don't worry, they still have their stupendous cheddar biscuits and the coconut fried shrimp with rum sauce that are even better. These shrimp are so good, I think of them as the crab rangoons of the Red Lobster and get them every time.The rest is pretty much the same, but with slightly different (less?) stuff on the walls and probably higher prices than you may remember. They have a decent variety of beers and booze and a chain restaurant's expected  bevy of froofy drinks. But is it worth it? If you go for one of the shrimp or lobster fests, or you have a coupon or gift card to soften the blow, its definitely worth it. I am a pretty frugal guy, and even though I love fish, there are many places I would rather spend this kind of money at, like Yellowfin. If somebody spruces up Seaboat into a nice take a date joint though, its over."
