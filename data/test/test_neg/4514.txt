b"I'll make this to the pointthe bad:1. There are much better restaurants in this price range, SW being one.2. The food is overpriced for what you get.3. Don't sit on the couches on the wall, they're way over used. The table was at my chest and had to ask to be moved.4. The busser did the server's job, besides take orders.5. The server didn't introduce herself nor welcome us to the restaurant (not being picky, but many patrons expect this when you're paying $130 per person.)6. The hostess had to take our dessert order because the waitress was nowhere to be found, which is extremely irritating.7. I had to send back the scotch I wanted because they gave it to me with cocktail ice. This is completely unacceptable for a $22 scotch.The good:1. The decor was very nice and not too bright or dark.2. They give out free appetizers, french fries, which are pretty good.3. The hostesses are very accommodating.4. Decent beers and excellent wines."
