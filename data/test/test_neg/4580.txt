b"I made on line reservation at the Flamingo.  Remembering the last time I walked through the casino (10 years ago) and their online pic's of the rooms it looked OK so locked it in for 3 night mid week business trip.  The rates were fantastic, I paid $29 a night (when I checked a week earlier the rates were in the $50's).  The rooms were OLD.  Carpet stained and worn, they had an old beat up chair at the computer desk, the windows were dirty, the elevators were scared with graffiti that was removed, the elevator coming up from the valet had tiles broken and exposed plywood. For the money, a good deal. For Las Vegas strip, outdated and tired.  Wouldn't had been so bad if they maintained the place better."
