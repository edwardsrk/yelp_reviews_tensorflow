b"I've been going to this gas station for years because it's clean and the service is fine.  But not anymore.  I recently discovered that their prices are much higher than other gas stations a little further north on Yonge St. and nearby gas stations on Hwy 7.  I thought the air miles promotion that saves you 4 cents per litre was amazing until I discovered their prices are 4 to 6 cents higher than their competitors.  Shame on you Shell for raising your prices 4 cents and making us think we're saving 4 cents!  Also, they only give you 1 air mile no matter how much you spend.  When I asked about this, they said it's during the 4 cents off promo.  I don't think they are following the Air Miles rules.There is now a Starbucks at this location."
