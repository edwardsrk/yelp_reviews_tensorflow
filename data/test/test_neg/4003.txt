b"had a groupon for this place and came here for lunch with my parents.. MISTAKE LOL I guess it was for lunch so it was ok but this is definitely a party bar and so i should have expected the food to not be on par....The portions are huge but everything was too salty - we ordered some type of pasta dish i dont even remember. Even their coffee which was was suppose to hawaiian authentic was watered down according to my parents. yeah i wouldn't go here for food - just for drinks which was buy one get one free with the yelp check in deal. That is the only thing worth it!"
