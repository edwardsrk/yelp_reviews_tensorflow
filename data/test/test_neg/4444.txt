b"I have not had a great experience with this company . Jennifer was very nice and tried to help right away but then I was forwarded to James in Tucson because I was told he worked with that employer in Phoenix . He was nice too but the odd part was I was told I was interviewing for either front desk or mailroom then I get to the interview and was told no it would just be a special project lasting about a month . I never heard any feedback from James . Then I got a call from Melanie ( who I see on a previous post wasn't great with someone else either ) regarding an interview . I had to stop her and tell her she was trying to send me on an interview that I already went on ! No communication here- none ! I never heard back from her either and I had to email Jennifer again and all I was told was she was out on PTO and she'd have Melanie call me next week . No apologies or anything ! I'm very aware they work with a large amount of clients and believe me I don't feel like I'm the only one on earth but still, come on, you tell us to be professional on our Interviews yet I saw many people lacking professionalism in communication . I actually was able to get more interviews off craigslist since now employers have to pay to post them so they are legitimate postings . Maybe I caught this business on a bad month or something but I cannot say I had the best experience with Acclivity  whatsoever."
