b'Not a basic burger joint.  This middle eastern establishment is more a sandwich shop.  Some unique sandwich items such as lamb tongue.  I got a burger, which was made fresh, but not sure on the cut of beef, had a gamey taste to it, maybe I got tongue.Not cheap either.  $8.50 for just the burger.  Another $3 if you want fries, which I did not partake.'
