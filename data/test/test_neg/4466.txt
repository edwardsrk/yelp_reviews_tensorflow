b"I don't usually write reviews for fast food but when I do it'll be for fried chicken. Let me start off by confessing I'm a recent Popeyes convert. I've told some of my friends but everybody doesn't know yet. The chicken is definitely more crispy and the spicy seasoning more pronounced. You don't need Cajun sprinkle but Texas Pete's hits the spot. You may be thinking why I give you this location two stars? At least three of my last five visits something is missing or messed up on the order. To top it off they never seem to have apple pies ready to go. Those things are like crack and on this corner I dont see how they couldnt be selling them like crazy. I can smell it in the air when I'm nearby and it just draws me in. Why can't they have em cookin or keeping them warm under hot lamps. The frost icing on top is literally the icing on the cake. Mickey d's doesnt do that and I dont even know if Popeyes or KFC has apple pies but these are memorable and its sad when they dont have it. Yes I know its empty calories carbs and it nots good for you but its not like I was expecting a healthy meal from Churchs right?"
