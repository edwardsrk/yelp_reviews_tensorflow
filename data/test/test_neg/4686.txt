b"2/5 stars, a blatant waste of money. Where do I start. Let's get the good things out of the way first. The decoration is appealing and the service is ok. If only the same could be said about the food.  The portions were very small for the amount paid. Almost 6bucks for a fistful of tempura fish cakes that weren't evenly seasoned. Some pieces were much saltier than the others (at one point it felt like I ate a spoonful of salt).10 bucks for a fried chicken bento that comes with rice, UNseasoned broccoli, half a cutlet of chicken, HALF an egg and HALF a meatball. I get that meat could be expensive but half a meatball?! Half an egg?! I also ordered Tainan braised pork rice and my oh my. The pork was less than a fistful and was very dry (tasted like it was microwaved) and there was no gravy or sauce to add moisture to the meal. It was overall unsatisfying. I was really excited for this place to open at first because I really like Taiwanese style street snacks. But after giving this place a try twice, I would say that I am utterly disappointed."
