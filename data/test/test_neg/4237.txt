b'I love that this place is a hold out from times passed, but it needs attention. The elevator was missing buttons, tape covering holes in the floor, light fixtures missing pieces, etc. In addition 4 of us were playing video poker at a couple of bars. They were both very dirty and the bartender at the first was argumentative with all of the patrons including us. Sad.'
