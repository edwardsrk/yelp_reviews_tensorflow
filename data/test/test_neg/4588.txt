b"Service was great. Food tasted great. Now the bad... the happy hour margarita tasted like sour sugar syrup. I mentioned this to the server and asked for a re-pour and the bartender made it the exact same way. I eventually diluted it in about 30oz of water and it tasted like a cheap margarita... a massive improvement, but this should not be necessary, and is far stretch from how you make a margarita. Also, my girlfriend and I both had serious stomach pain the rest of the night. Don't know the culprit there, but it was something. I have great experiences with other locations, but I can't in good conscience advocate this place"
