b"We got very lucky as far as insurance coverage goes for new glasses, but without it, the prices here would've been absolutely absurd. On top of that, the quality of service here is pathetic. The employees are severely lacking in any sense of professionalism, courtesy, and even general knowledge of their own products.Eventually we left with what we wanted, but it took some effort to fight past all the stupidity to get to it. I wouldn't come here again."
