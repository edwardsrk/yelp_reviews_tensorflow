b"Gotta say I'm very disappointed in our experience tonight.  It was if they didn't want customers, as the tables on the potion were dirty, seat cushions were up to the customer to go find for their chair and they didn't even bother to turn on the musters to help us enjoy our experience.The waiter was very nice but it was if they didn't want to be open on a Friday evening."
