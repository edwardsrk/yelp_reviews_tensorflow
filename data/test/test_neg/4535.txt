b'Well, i went there with a bunch of friends during out Thanksgiving break. I have to say i am quite disappointed with the overall experience. First of, the food took forever to come. It was a Friday night, but the restaurant was no where being full. We had a relatively big party(11 of us) but it\'s not like they were waiting for all of the food to be prepared in order to serve us. The foods arrived at different time with 10 minutes of gap in between. I am not sure how it could possibily take so long to prepare dishes like Steak and Frites. Afterall, it\'s just a Brasserie not some a tradtional French Cuisine. I ordered a special, which is a Braised Veal\'s Shoulder which was nothing like what the waiter has described. And i quote " it\'s crispy on the outside and tender in the inside". The meat is relatively dry and hard to chew. The rest of the party ordered Steak and Frites which is again mediocre for a French restaurant.  Lastly, it\'s pretty pricy considered that the food was nothing special. If you decide to go, just don\'t hold too much expectations as i did, or you will be disappointed.'
