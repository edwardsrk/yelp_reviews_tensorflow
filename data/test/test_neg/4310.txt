b"This place is like a grown up arcade. Only things that I didn't like was that I had to go up to the counter and order a daiquiri. We sat at the gaming machines for a minute before we realized that the bartender don't come around and ask if you want drinks. Also, the tokens for the arcade games were high. We might try this place one more time. Crossing our fingers for next time."
