b'I\'ve shopped in this particular Vape Land twice - both times purchasing pricey vapes, along with a fair amount of spare atomizers and liquid.Each time I\'ve shopped, the staff has been helpful and knowledgeable.  BUT, in both instances, the (expensive) vapes (after less than 45 days) have simply died.  As I live a long ways away, I cannot "bring it in".  Their only other advice is to send it in for warranty work.  The staff refused to help me troubleshoot over the phone - which was what I was hoping for.I live in a remote area and do not appreciate products which regularly fail - leaving you with nothing.  I would recommend NOT buying their products unless you live close to one of their stores.  They are simply not reliable.'
