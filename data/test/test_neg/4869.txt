b"The Ritz may be a 5-star hotel, but DEQ is not the place to go for a 5-star high tea experience.There was a nice selection of teas, and the food was good. Quite good, but nothing I was really impressed by. My favourite part was actually the passionfruit cake that was provided as a birthday treat. The coldness of the cake added a refreshing texture that made it taste just perfect. I would go again for that cake, but the food in the high tea set was only average good.The service was what left me unsatisfied. The servers were polite, but we had slight troubles grabbing their attention. A spoon was not provided to eat the panna cotta, and we were told to use the same spoon we used to stir our tea. It wasn't a problem but I found it strange, especially for such a nice place. Here's my biggest irk, and the reason I'm taking away a star. We asked to have our leftovers packed up, and we were given only a takeout box. For some reason, other customers were given fancy bags for their leftovers. We weren't even given a plastic bag, and left awkwardly holding onto a takeout box. I guess we could have asked for a bag, but we didn't want to bother trying to get a server's attention for something that should be standard. In short, food was good but there are better options for a better price. Service needs improvement. And say it's your birthday so you get a nice cake."
