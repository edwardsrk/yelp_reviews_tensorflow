b'This is a Chinese restaurant that offers "Chinese-nized" version of well known dishes from around southeast Asia.The good thing is that food is fresh and tastes alright as long as you expect to get Chinese food.  If it is Thai or Vietnamese you are craving, there are better places in TO to get the real deal.'
