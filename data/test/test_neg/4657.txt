b"Wow! God forbid any of the folks paid to assist customers here actually ASSIST CUSTOMERS! I could stand back here at the flooring and blinds counter for days and probably not see one associate who wants to help set up an appointment for getting estimates on shutters. The sad part is this is the third time we've had to come to this location and we experienced the same lack of service. Plenty of employees seem to be walking around talking amongst themselves or avoiding eye contact with customers. Pathetic for a Saturday afternoon in Scottsdale."
