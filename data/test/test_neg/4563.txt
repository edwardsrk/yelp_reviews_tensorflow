b'I came to Sushi 999 with high expectations, based on the reviews here (hoping that the one negative review was due to that person arriving before the restaurant was in "prime time", as that reviewer generously noted).  However, I did come at prime time (a little after 6pm on a Wed night) and was disappointed. The tempura was really greasy, not crispy. The sushi rolls had lots and lots of mayo on them, and tasted more like mayo than anything else. The ice roll was probably the highlight from the night, as it used a mango sauce instead of straight-up mayo, and the rice paper wrapping was unusual and good.  I also tried to order the green dragon (though they brought me the red dragon, and it wasn\'t worth attempting to fix the confusion), the spider roll (which was fine, but a little greasy), and the tamago (which tasted like it had been made earlier in the week; spongy and flavorless).  My friends did have good things to say about the sweet potato roll, but were not particularly impressed by any of the other things they ordered (vegetarian dumpling; spring roll; salmon donburi; sweet tofu sushi; veggie tempura; a noodle dish; chicken teriyaki; beef-wrapped asparagus).  We ordered mango ice cream for dessert, and while it was orange, it didn\'t taste of mango at all and was really icy in consistency.One funny thing about this restaurant is it\'s hard to predict the size of the items you order: for example, the beef-wrapped asparagus and the spring roll come as one tiny piece each (comically tiny, it was impressive!), but if you order the vegetarian tempura you get a whole basket full (and the same is true of the noodle dishes or donburi). When we left, we felt like we\'d just eaten a lot of grease---not what I look for when I go out for sushi and drop $25.  For all-you-can-eat, Crescent Sushi is more impressive.'
