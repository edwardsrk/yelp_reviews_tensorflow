b"My last visit here was disappointing. Overall, the food was only okay. The quality of some of the ingredients seems to have declined since my visit here about a year ago. The fish in the sushi rolls tasted pretty fresh, but the rice seemed a bit dry and old.. this effectively ruined a lot of the specialty rolls for me. The sashimi was very good (especially the salmon and clam), but I wish we had the option to order eel by itself. I also enjoyed the beef tataki. The cooked foods were either hit or miss for the most part. The kalbi was pretty good, and we ended up ordering that a few times. It isn't the highest quality short rib, but they do get a nice char on the meat. I also really like their kimchi seafood hot pot. The broth is delicious with just the right amount of spice. The one complaint I have about this is that they put way too much inedible crap in there (like fish tail).. I'd rather have more soup and less of that stuff. The fried pork chop was probably the worst thing we received during dinner. It was thin, tough, and bland.. just about the worst fried pork chop I've had in a long time. I didn't bother eating any more after trying a bite. I really like the way they do desserts here. The servings are very small (shotglass size), so you can try a lot of different things. My favorite dessert was the lychee mousse.. I should've ordered 5 of those. All of the desserts I tried were pretty good except for the strawberry ice cream. The strawberry ice cream tasted really artificial (almost like medicine).The service was just awful. The servers got something wrong pretty much every time we ordered food. We had to order a few items multiple times to receive it once. We had to wait an absurd amount of time to receive the second half of our ramen order. There seems to be something that is causing a lot of miscommunication at some point in the ordering/food preparation/delivery process. They really need to figure out what the root cause is and fix it because it was happening WAY too often in our dinner. Our table also had a lot of issues flagging down servers even when it was getting late and less crowded. Our dinner must've taken about 2.5-3 hours because of how slow they were. The prices were reasonable for AYCE, but I don't know if I would be willing to come back and deal with the service again. 2.5/5"
