b"We are always up for trying new places, so we decided to try this place last night.After reading some of the reviews I was worried about running into the hostess from hell thats been described. Luckily we had a very nice hostess.The waitress, while pleasant, was less than attentive. Not horrible but not good.The food was blah. The calamari was rubbery and had little taste.The lemon chicken soup had a lot of lemon but no spices. Very bland.The mousaka of was bland. Couldn't taste the eggplant. Overall not bad food, just not good food."
