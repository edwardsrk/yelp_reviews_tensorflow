b"Wow this place is a hollow shell of what it used to be :(When I was going to high school in the early 90's, this was THE PLACE for records in Cleveland.  Their basement was full of vinyl, FILLED, with good quality stuff, upstairs had great posters and paraphanalia, and the walls were signed all over by visiting artists and bands.  It felt like a thriving place.  Couple years later -mid 90's - I visited again upon the suggestion of a well known national DJ who was then living in Cleveland, and again it did not disappoint.  The store used to be located at the corner of Coventry, up the street from where it is now.  I believe there was a movie theater next door, right?  Was it the Cedar Lee maybe?Fast forward to 2010.  I'm in Cleveburg visiting the folks and decide to check the place out for finds.  When I finally found it, I could not believe it was the same store.  All the vinyl was pretty much crap, scratched and water damaged.  Even the once legendary basement produced little worthwhile on this trip, and damn it was cold down there.  The clerk who was animatedly chatting with a honey for ten minutes, regarded me with disdain especially when I tried to get him to knock a dollar off the 5 $1 records I was buying.  That said, I did find a few decent records but in BAD shape.  What happened here? Rest In Peace, Record Revolution!"
