b"Iv had alot of great experiences here in the past but recently they updated their menu and made some other changes which made my last two visits here less than pleasurable. They got rid of my favorite sandwich the Italian and also removed the amazing garden chowder. Why? I have no clue but ok. I can deal with a menu change but also the service changed. Maybe due to so many new people there. My last two visits here took about 20min compared to the usual 4-5min because the new sandwich makers just forgot to make one of my sandwiches. Both times.   I hope they aren't going to run like this forever because I usually really enjoy everything here but have been recently disappointed due to management making too many changes at once with poor integration."
