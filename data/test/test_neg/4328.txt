b'2 stars was all I could give. There was the smell of weed when before I walked through the front door. I ordered a bacon double cheeseburger and an order of fries to go. When I got to my car (raining hard outside) I discovered the burger had no ketchup, mustard or anything on it and there was no condiment packets in the bag. Who does that? Also the girl who took my order acted like I was bothering her by being there. I like to give second chances so I will most likely give them another try.'
