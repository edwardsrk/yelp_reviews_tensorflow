b"Mediocre at best. I had been to this Bistro previously when it had a different name and had walked away pleasantly plump however my experience the other evening was not as filling or fulfilling. It wasn't the food that put me off most however as it was the conversations overheard about the patrons that didn't impress. I would have bought into the fake greeting had i not been privy to the server's true feelings about the less than busy business and the shortcomings of the patrons who bestowed this establishment. Someone needs to be reminded of just who puts those paper bills in your pocket. My suggestion to you is to be cognisant of your surroundings and please revert back to your previous recipe for steak as this version does not compare. Good luck to you in this tight economy as this schmuck will be spending $ at venues more deserving of my hard earned dollar. C'est la vie."
