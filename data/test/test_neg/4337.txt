b"I really wanted to like this place... I love mediterranean food and I think the concept is great (think chipotle meets pitas!) but execution was seriously off! I went and ordered the build your own entree and got the falafel. There were tons of choices to add on to my order and most of them were really great, but honestly their falafel was inedible. If I hadn't ordered it to go I would have taken it back, but instead I was stuck with falafels that could be utilized better by the Phoenix Coyotes as hockey pucks rather than a protein that is offered by an establishment offering fresh and healthy fare. Needless to say I was a bit turned off by my experience and I don't think I will be back. Next time I need my mediterranean fix I will head to Pita Jungle."
