b"ARE YOU SERIOUS? Look at how much cream cheese was on my bagel. I was so pissed when I opened my bagel when I got to my work this morning. This bagel was a waste of money and I didn't even end up eating it... So I was hungry. You can always take cream cheese off.... You can't add more from work! This was my second bagel like this. I didn't post the first one.. Definitely should have. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my coffee is usually good from here."
