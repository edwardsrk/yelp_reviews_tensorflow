b'The trout was excellent.   I had ordered frites with it.  Three of my colleagues ordered steak frites and their plates arrived piled with frites and mine on the side didn\'t arrived.  I asked the runner who said he\'d get them.  Later on I asked again and was told that they\'d get them.  The waitress got them to me as I was finishing my trout.  And when I told her that I no longer wanted them, she apologized and said that she wasn\'t charging me for them.  I should hope not.  I"ll never go back.  The quality of the food was quite good.  The service would have to improve to get to cavalier level.'
