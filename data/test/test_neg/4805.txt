b"I selected this shop because of the recommendations I received.  I was satisfied with the estimate and made an appt. 3 weeks before bringing in my auto for a broadside repair which included at minimum two driver side doors. I was advised on estimate that they would advise me of any additional repairs when the car was received.  Upon pick up, I noticed scratches and dents in the doors, as well as some sloppy paint on the trim edges.  There were also other scrapes.  I questionned and was advised that they did tell me they were going to secure used doors.  Of course, I knew that.  However, I was not aware that they were not going to repair the used doors to look 'new.'  Although some of the other scrapes were able to be easily removed, the deeper scratches and sloppy paint was not.  I was advised that a new estimate of nearly $1300 would be required to fix these scratches.  I am more than disappointed.  I paid $1000 for these two doors (of which they used my own existing interior), which in my own estimation were just swapped.  Very, very disappointed I was not made aware that any pre-existing conditions to used doors were additional responsibility--and never informed of additional work needed.  Never heard of such a thing!  I am financially unable to have these scratches fixed.  My auto did not have any scratches, sloppy paint, etc. prior to the accident and this was just shoddy.  Tears, tears, tears."
