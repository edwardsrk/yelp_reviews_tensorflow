b'First, I would like to thank the staff for a wonderful post event concession. Everyone was helpful and took very good care of our large group. Next, I am sure we will not return to this establishment for the following reason. When it was time to pay the piper, my debit card could not be found. The bartenders and Charlie (owner) gave great effort for 30 min to try and find my card. No worry, If not found by the next day I will cancel the card. Said owner Charlie "don\'t worry about the tab, I will call you tomorrow and let you know whether or not we found it. I will just comp this tab". Cool, things happen. So next day comes and no call so I call them. They said card was not found, ok. Next day bank shows pending charge of $46.80 and says card was swiped Sat at 6:40pm (an hour and half after I had left). I called again thinking great they found my card, no, they said that is the amount they used to hold my tab open thus to wait and it will drop off. Card has not been found. Same evening I receive a phone call from the organization manager that booked El Santo saying some girl was just givin my card and the receipt from saturday afternoon. She didn\'t know me or how to reach me so she drove it to the address of the event sponsor. Now today my card shows the bill of $39.00 posted and the tip they chose to give themselves in the amount of $7.80 and yet Charlie claims still that my card has not been found and no one has swiped.
