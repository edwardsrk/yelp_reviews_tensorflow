b'This place is definitely  not about the environment or the service. Owner did not have a good/positive attitude, who was also the cashier at the time. Tried the beef nahari, chicken haleem, naan, some orange chicken wanna be and chai. Naan, chai, and beef nahari were good, and but rest was crap. Chicken haleem smelled old and really bad and also tasted like it had gone sour. Would not eat there again.'
