b"This yours truly restaurant has surely seen it day come and go. The physical building itself is worn pretty badly and the restaurant could stand too close for a week or so and do a thorough deep cleaning. Varnish peeling of woods, the grout in the floor is filthy and it was actually pretty greasy if you had wet shoes you would slip slide around and it didn't seem very safe.I don't know what it is about this particular location versus the location and Mentor. The Mentor location seems to be a little bit cleaner well cap. Could do to a holly volume of traffic but a high volume of traffic should also lend itself to a high volume of repair in cleaning. The food itself was neither remarkable nor bad. It was sustenance, plain and simple.  locate rest area he would stop and eat at and then completely forget about it one hour later.I'm pretty sure it's not a chain, but the location. Clean this place up, we can work into the restaurant and you'll be ok"
