b'I work in the building where this bar is located, so I\'ve been there a few times.Warning: if you want to have a meal - or even just a drink - here in under an hour, best to go elsewhere. It doesn\'t seem to matter which manager (and as I understand, there have been many) runs the place, service always seems to be at the very bottom of the list. The food is serviceable, but nothing to write home to mother about. They used to be a "pour house", meaning they had tons of beer on tap, but for some reason have changed to what they call a "martini bar". If that was the case, you think they\'d learn how to make an actual martini. I ordered a dry vodka martini (which means little vermouth) with a lemon twist (and I specified no olives) yet I was served a dirty martini (tons of vermouth) with three olives.This place can be so sad sometimes that it\'s humorous. Mediocrity reigns supreme here.'
