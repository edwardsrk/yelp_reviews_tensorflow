b"I visit the Concord Mills area often on business and have eaten at this Red Lobster location on multiple occasions. The food is usually fresh and good, but my issue is that that at 5:45pm, they can't seat guests because servers are not scheduled in to work. The restaurant had more than 50 percent of tables open, but I had to wait 15 minutes for a table/server. This has happened before, but no more. Today was my last visit."
