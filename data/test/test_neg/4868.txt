b"I own a 2013 Ford Fusion, purchased from Berge Ford.  The two times I've had it serviced at this location have both been poor experiences.  This instance specifically was very disappointing. I contacted the salesman who sold me the car (Brenden, who did an amazing job and continues to be extremely helpful to me by the way) and he helped schedule an appointment with Joey in Booth 1.  Joey was very nice and helpful with the entire process.  The oil was changed and I received my car in a timely manner.  It wasn't until I had driven around to the other side of the dealership to say goodbye to Brenden and thank him for his service did Brenden notice that there was a fairly large scratch in the side of the car.  This scratch was not present when I dropped the car off.  I chose to wait until today (12/1) to make a statement to make sure that the experience was reported to a manager.  I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service coming out of the service department at this dealership.  In comparison to the service I received from the salesmen and finance department during my purchase one would assume that that same quality would come from other departments of the dealership.  It is apparent that is not true. I will not be returning to Berge Ford to have my vehicle serviced, nor will I recommend anyone visit that location for service."
