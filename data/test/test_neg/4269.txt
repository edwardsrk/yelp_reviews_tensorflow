b"I have been staying at the Flamingo every year for the passed 8 years. Just got home from a long weekend this Sunday. The Go Room's are the best bet, but I have to say  I reserved a GO Room 1 king bed and we were placed in the wrong room at the time of checking in. I had to wait a night to switch rooms (not cool). The newer Go Rooms are looking dingy/not cleaned. The wallpaper is coming off the wall's. The coffee shop line in the morning is out of control 45 minute wait for a cup of Joe. The Pool is great if you can get a chair. You have to be down there at 8am and wait an hour for it to open. People hold chairs all morning/afternoon that are not even at the pool. No free internet for hotel guest. The gift shop prices are out of hand. Sad to say that was my last stay at the Flamingo"
