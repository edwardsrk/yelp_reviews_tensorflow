b"This is one of our favorite places but last night was a complete disappointment. The beer and Jalape\xc3\xb1o Infused Margarita were the highlights. Our Queso Dip was just warm but I decided to ignore that. We ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, maybe my expectations were too high, but no sizzling plate. There was no flavor at all to the dish. I rechecked the menu and it did say SEASONED SHRIMP.  My seven shrimp were as white as could be with no sight of seasoning anywhere. My wife couldn't eat it so she ordered the Chicken Burrito. Our daughter had ordered this before and enjoyed it so it seemed like a safe bet. WRONG! Another Luke warm flavorless dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was won by the RICE!  Out of 10......Chicken 2...Rice 8!! I told our waiter Luka who said he would tell the kitchen but I never heard anything more.  I'm sure we will be back, after a while, but it'll just be Tacos!"
