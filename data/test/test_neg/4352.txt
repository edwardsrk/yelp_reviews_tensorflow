b"Although I'm not too fond of Chinese cuisine but I do enjoy it once in a while. I enjoyed Chinese food while I was in Chinatown of SFO. Few days back I was reminiscing those memories and suddenly craved for Chinese food. I read a lot of great reviews about this place on Yelp, so was excited to try it out. I ordered shrimp stir fry noodles and dry shrimp & squash with thread noodle hot pot, from the Chinese menu. They had complimentary tea which was nice. I wrote down my order on notepad and went to the counter to order. Food came pretty fast. I had my first hot pot at Chinatown, which was amazing. I was expecting it to be the same. Now, what I got looked like the food for a patient at a hospital. It was bland and I couldn't taste shrimp at all. Even, if I had been sick this is not something I would have enjoyed. Noodles were ok but again did not have much flavor. Overall, I did not enjoy the food. My husband and I took few bites and left it."
