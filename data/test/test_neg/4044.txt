b'me and my wife just moved there in May and we already hate it. parking feels like a mall parking lot on a saturday, you\'ll have to drive around for at least 20 min to find one if you\'re lucky. we work late till around 12 and we mostly park on fire lines and in uncovered parking since parking is not assigned. we can hear the naigbor talking on the phone and know every move the lady in the app above us does or if she\'s in heals or flip flops and her dog keeps playing and drag stuff all night over our bedroom. the power keeps going off about once a week due to breaker issues or whatever if we use mutiple electonic stuff at once. rent keeps changing for some reason, one month we pay 1400$ and the next we pay 1500$ and the place is not worth the price actually. the staff is nice, mostly adam and it feels that hes the only one we can talk too cause he acually helps, the others will just ignore you bacause they\'re "helping other".over all its a really nice place if you\'re home mostly to use their services but they need to get it together and fix their issues'
