b'Not a great place to eat. The food lacks flavor. I got the chicken and shrimp combo. The shrimp and chicken were good. Carrots were over cooked and too sweet, rice was sticky, and cabbage was bland. Egg roll was basic. Surprisingly they have a long line at lunch time. The prices are good. They are clean and you get your food soon. There is plenty of seating and parking. The staff are friendly. They are in a strip mall with other places you can try. Keep your options open. Good luck!'
