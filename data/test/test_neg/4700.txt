b'Meh...kind of feel steered wrong by my fellow yelpers. Overall, just "meh". I have seldom met a spider roll I didn\'t like so when I saw the Angry Crab Roll my insides got all gooey with excitement only to be served overly greasy, soggy crab without any crunch AND it was topped with fake crab AND it had romaine lettuce sticking out like a salad. Overall, just kind of sad knowing how amazing this roll could have been and the kind of place that makes me upset I did my hair for this.The one nice thing, and reason it has 2 stars instead of 1 is because my server, Mauro, was very helpful, friendly, and efficient.Really, all the staff is very friendly, they deserve better.'
