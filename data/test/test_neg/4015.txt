b'We\'re a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there\'s about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn\'t seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107\xc2\xb0. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn\'t accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn\'t know how long it\'d be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we\'d just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the "reserved" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he\'d rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn\'t engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn\'t even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn\'t received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, "oh, you want more?" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that\'s a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn\'t get the attention of the server and he didn\'t come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don\'t leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn\'t be back, individually or as a whole.I\'ve been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won\'t be back after yesterday\'s experience.UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven\'t heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn\'t change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.'
