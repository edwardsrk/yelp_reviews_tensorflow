b"It's quite a neighbourhood pub although in a busy financial district corner. The recent changed ownership makes it worthwhile to check this place out again. The waitress who was serving our table was efficient and attentive.For a Friday night, it's not as busy seated inside. But the patio was full outside. Nachos was good and you can't go wrong with calamari. Good array of beer in bottle and tap. Cocktails are mediocre...  Drink pricing is affordable and certainly not too expensive."
