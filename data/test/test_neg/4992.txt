b"My friend and I stopped by on our way out of Phoenix Fashion week.  I ordered a calzone with lots of veggies.  Point off for not offering marinara sauce and the calzone was just ok.  I must say tho that the seasoned fries were tasty!  I just wasn't blown away by anything.  Be careful if you're dining in, it's smack dab in the middle of the casino, so the smoke will getcha!"
