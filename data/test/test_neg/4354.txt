b'Dr. Webb delivered my son in late 2015. Let me start by saying, I love the front office people. They knew me by name (well, as they should, I basically lived at that office for 9 months) and every single person that worked there (besides Dr. Webb...) was seriously amazing. Paula Mazzacano is, without a doubt, the best ever. If it wasn\'t for her, I wouldve left after the first time I met Dr. Webb. But, Dr. Webb is known around Phoenix and I thought it wouldn\'t really matter who delivered my son. Boy (pun intended), was I wrong!!Again, Paula is amazing.  I wish (I SO WISH!) she would\'ve delivered my son. I met with her countless times after giving birth as well (thrush, IUD, thrush again... then, thrush, again..) and she was so, so incredible each time. You can tell she truly cares. But, then there is Dr. Webb. When I told the women at the hospital who my doctor was, they made a face. When I told my yoga instructor who is a doula who my doctor was, she made a face. I should not have ignored those faces!! He has a complete disregard for the individual needs of patients, to the point where he just didn\'t listen to me AT ALL.  I mean, once I was laying on the table while he lost his keys and proceeded to look for them, blatantly ignoring me for 5 minutes. He was just so spacey. When I wanted to discuss my birth plan, he laughed and said, "itll go how it goes." When i told him I knew this baby was coming early, he said, "No it is not." Well, he did, because I\'m the mom and it\'s my body and yeah.. i knew that.  He refused to check me for dilation (causing me to freak out and go into the office twice because the baby stopped moving, because he was descending, something i wouldve known had I been checked). But, the worst of his egregious behavior came when I was in labor. Sure, he showed up late (doctors always do), but did he have to completely ignore me? Did he have to act so uninvested that I\'m pretty sure at one point, he was sleeping? Did he have to not explain that he was giving me an episiotomy (something detailed as a no-no in my birth plan) and definitely something that could have been avoided, had he not just wanted to just get it done. I met with the doula/yoga instructor after having my son, and she asked if I wanted to talk through my birth process. She said how essential it is that women do that, as it is a traumatic experience. The second we started talking, I was hysterical. I felt that I had no one (besides my amazing, but clueless sig other) to be my voice in that room, to defend me, to even understand me. I felt alone and vulnerable, which was a horrific way to feel. Thank G-d Dr. Webb isn\'t delivering anymore, but nonetheless, people need to know he is 3/4 of the way out the door...'
