b'To be honest the food was pretty good. I got the chorizo stuffed dates, which was the best thing I had tonight. For my entree I got the wagyu burger, which was overall pretty good. However this is the point at which their rating goes down. The wagyu burger is advertised as coming with a "golden brioche bun", but the bun we received looked like the average bun you get at Walmart for a picnic; thin, flat and crumbling. We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the "golden brioche bun". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it\'s also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like. I uploaded a photo of the bun if you guys want to see for yourself.'
