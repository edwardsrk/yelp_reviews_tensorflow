b"Maybe this place rocks and swings at night. Maybe people guffaw and clack beers and music buzzes around the room. Maybe. In the middle of the day, though, it's pretty abysmal. The guy working the counter is too chatty and garrulous. I mean I like customer service to be sincere and friendly, but this guy was filibustering. I could barely talk to my girlfriend. God bless, you, dude, but put an ellipsis or two in your conversations. It's like hanging out with a racetrack announcer on fast-forward. The beer selection is also pretty daft. I know it's a kitschy, dumbed down bar - and that my expectations shouldn't be high - but when the best you can do is fill up a bucket with Bud, you not only take the wind out of my sails, but you set them on fire. Not to mention that these macros are fearsomely expensive. I'd probably hang my hat somewhere else, if I were you. It's not as though Vegas is bankrupt of places to drink."
