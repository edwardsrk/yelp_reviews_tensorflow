b'I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not.'
