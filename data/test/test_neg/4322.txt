b'I love Vietnamese food and I\'ve been waiting in excited anticipation for the grand opening of Rice Paper just down the street from my house... But it was a total disappointment.The restaurant is located in an unassuming remodeled historic home. The interior is modern and hip with a large bar. We were greeted by one of the owners who seated us and quickly moved on to chat up the male clientele. The menu is "sushi style," in that you mark your order on the menu.As vegetarians, we had very few options (2 fresh rolls, 1 fried roll, 1 sandwich, 1 salad & 1 entree). It doesn\'t seem like the menu was well thought out for the neighborhood, in which most restaurants try to cater to the large local vegetarian crowd.We tried all the vegetarian menu items except for the curry entree:The Vegetarian Tempura Roll was filled with vermicelli noodles, tempura asparagus, and fresh mango, served with a basil-based dip. Alone it was a little bland but tasted great with some Sriracha sauce mixed in the dip.The Buddha Roll was mediocre. Again, it was bland. I had to smother it with plum sauce and Sriracha sauce for it to have any flavor. The Saigon Bun Salad was horrible. It was literally a big bowl of plain vermicelli noodles, romaine lettuce and fried tofu with some roasted peanuts sprinkled on top - no herbs, no spices. The dressing (served on the side) tasted like it was made with rice vinegar, fish sauce and grated carrots, period. Really??? Ew! I had to make my own sauce by mixing plum sauce, Sriracha sauce, and some of the peanut sauce left over from the Buddha Roll for it to even be edible. The Tofu and Shitake Mushroom Vietnamese Sandwich was made on a pleasantly flaky baguette, with cucumber, tons of shitake mushrooms, carrot, and a little cilantro. There was some sort of mystery brown sauce that again had no flavor. The one saving grace was the side of scrumptious sweet potato fries. The fries were hot, crispy, flavorful and came with a spicy homemade mayo.The nonalcoholic beverage options were limited to soda, iced tea, fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice and Vietnamese iced coffee. The iced coffee was delicious but I wish they offered more options that would go with the food like coconut water, cucumber water, or even Thai iced tea, even though I know its not Vietnamese.Honestly, everything on the menu could be excellent if they just added more fresh herbs: cilantro, mint, or basil. Most items had maybe a leaf or two but not enough to taste.  Also the sauces and dips were boring and tasteless. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Rice Paper may be a good first taste of Vietnamese food for people that are averse to trying new flavors. It seemed very Americanized rather than authentic, which is confusing since the owners are supposedly Vietnamese. Mostly I was disappointed because I feel the place has so much potential. They use lots of fresh veggies and everything seems made-to-order. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting and I love to support local independent businesses. However, I don\'t see myself returning unless they overcome their fear of herbs and spices. For now I\'ll sacrifice atmosphere for flavor and drive the extra distance to Maxim\'s or Pho Avina - now that\'s my kind of Vietnamese!'
