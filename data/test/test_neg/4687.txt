b"Visiting from Las Vegas and was looking for an authentic Mexican/Spaniard restaurant. If I was reviewing the service I would give it 5 stars. But ~ considering we have an executive chef in the family ~ we are always expecting an amazing meal. Was shocked to see tiny shrimp as an addition to most dishes. The cerviche was sweet. Not the way it's suppose to taste. Was not impressed with the food at all. Definitely not a restaurant that I would have to frequent whenever I came to Phoenix. Hope to have better luck somewhere else tomorrow while we're here"
