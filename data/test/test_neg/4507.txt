b'I have two tanks - a 5 gallon tank for a beta and a 20 gallon tank for two goldfish. When I moved to this side of town, I noticed that my goldfish had lost a substantial amount of scales. I waited a few weeks to make sure it wasn\'t a growth spurt, fighting or injury during transportation that they lost their scales. I was worried that it could possibly be a bacterial infection and headed over here for some medicine and a background for their tank.I asked one of the sales people to point me in the direction of the medicine. Instead I got a lecture about how I should totally just wait it out because their tanks have tons of scales from their fish at times. Here\'s the thing. I don\'t have 300 small fish in a 15-20 gallon tank that are susceptible to overcrowding, fighting and damage from fish constantly being scooped out. I have two 6 inch goldfish in a proper sized tank that they never leave. My situation is different. I never was shown where the medicine was.I also wanted a tropical tank background for my larger tank. The same sales girl told me I should really just go with the black background instead because it\'s so superior and how the other backgrounds are cheesy. I didn\'t ask for a personal opinion. If they\'re the same price, give me what I asked for. Instead she cut off the black background roll and told me if I didn\'t like it, I could return it. Agh! Every time I look at the tank, I\'m upset with the background because it looks weird. On another occasion I had to buy a replacement 18" 15 watt bulb for my tank. They had two in stock that were $9.99. I got home and put it in. Nothing. I could hear something knocking around inside as if the filament was already broken. Agh! I took it back and asked to open the only other bulb they had in stock before I purchased it. It was also broken. I got a refund and went to PetCo. This location has a large selection for aquatics, but I cant give this place a higher rating because their sales staff doesn\'t understand that it\'s my money so skip the lectures if it is not an animal safety issue, and give me what I\'m asking for.'
