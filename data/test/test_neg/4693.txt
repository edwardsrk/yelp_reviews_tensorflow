b'very very disappointed in this property.  We purchased our package through travel zoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to stay in the room that was described.  It was the one bedroom suite with a full kitchen.  We usually stay elsewhere and frankly we should of stuck to what we know and like.  This was an anniversary trip and we arrived early in the morning so we\'d have the full day.  We went to see if we could check in (we knew it would be a slim chance).  Since we requested a high floor with a view of the city our room was not ready yet.  Which was fine since we had a car and decided to grab some breakfast.  I did not interact with the staff but my boyfriend said they seemed a snooty and felt like they were upset that we came early.  Nonetheless we went to breakfast with them say they would call or text us when the room was ready.We returned a couple of hours later to see if the room was ready.  It was not, so we decided to check our bags with the bell staff, change and hang out by the pool.  After about 2.5 hours we wanted to rest and get a quick bite to eat.  Room still was not ready and they were still snooty about it.I still had on my bathing suit, but had a wrap on around my waist.  we walked into the Rojo Lounge and there was a group of workers standing talking and they stopped looked at us and kept talking. We decided to sit at the bar to eat and have a drink.  We began to sit down and the bartender asked what we wanted.  We told her that we were going to get a bit to eat also could be have some menus.  As we were getting comfortable, she asked me if I had something to cover up with.  I said no, our room is not ready and our luggage is checked.  She then proceeded to say she couldn\'t serve me dressed like was I was and I need to go find a shirt.  They should of said something when we walked in the door and they should have a sigh saying such.  We left.  Checked on our room and it was not ready so we went to the gift shop to get a snack and sit in the lobby.  While in the lobby the bell staff were having a loud conversation about personal business for all to hear.  Very unprofessional!  Thank goodness our room was ready shortly thereafter.Now on to the room....yes it is nice but lacks upkeep to keep it looking nice.  The fake wood floors squeaked and sounded like they were ready to crack.  I did my best to stay away from walking on it.  The refrigerator is obnoxiously loud.  There was a rather large "patch" on the floor of grey electrical tape covering something that obviously needs fixing.  There were parts around the room that were falling off.  The windows were filthy.  The towels made me feel like I was using sandpaper to dry off. On the night of our romantic dinner, I was fully dressed in brand new red pants and brushing my teeth.  As I was doing that I happen to look down and realized that the front of my pants were wet with water.  The water in the sink was hitting the drain and splattering all over the floor and my clothes. Also with valet every time we called ahead to make sure our car was ready for us when we left.  We always had to wait  for them to get the car.  The Wi-Fi plan is the stupidest thing I have seen.  You are only allowed one device per room per day.  And I couldn\'t use the Wi-Fi until we had a room number.  it would of been nice to use my iPad by the pool while we waited. We decided not to have housekeeping clean our room because we were afraid how long it would take them.  Also the shower is a challenge to get set on the temp our want.  The next day I noticed a slight smell coming from the shower. It is a long walk to the breakfast buffet that we had complimentary passes for.  The view is nice and the room was quiet.  We would rather stay elsewhere next time. Seems people are blown away by what is in the room and not the quality for the room nor the staff.'
