b"Let's give you the run down. It's $10 a person at the gate. Children 12 & under are free. Once inside nothing's free except a beefed up presence from the chandler mafia, police-same thing. There's a few Booths to look for trinkets but mostly food trucks and booths. The lines for the food are ridiculously long. The angry crab booth easily had 100+ people waiting. We grabbed 2 corn dogs and 2 Lemonades for $26.... Then I snagged a catfish poor boy fro another $10. Refills are ONLY $3, well that's exciting ..... There's some knockoff band playing. They sound pretty decent. The kids zone has 4 attractions and it cost $10 for all day ride bracelet. There's hardly any actual seating and being that's it's nice and warm today everyone is hogging the shade which means no where to sit and eat. I think this festival could use a little more planning before it would be worth waisting so much money at."
