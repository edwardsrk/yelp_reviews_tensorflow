b"This is probably my last time here... I think the quality has been worse and worse throughout the years.We ordered the charshu udon and grilled salmon set.  The size of salmon is quite big actually so the value is not so bad.. but udon with chashu.. I have never seen this combo in japan!!  I have only seen chashu with ramen.  With udon it's always tempura or curry!!  Anyway despite of the creativity, the taste just doesn't match.  Also ordered teba gyoza.  It was quite salty.And dessert was matcha creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and it was ok.  Expensive for the quality."
