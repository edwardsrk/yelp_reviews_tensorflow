b"After 2 years living in the area, I finally was able to swing by here and check it out.I came in, it was packed. but we were able to be seated quickly and ordered.It took a while for our food to come out but eventually it did. The waitress was nice but I had a few questions which seemed to trip her up. It wasn't anything too tricky though.The food was mediocre, passable at most. I could live without it essentially. I found the rolls I ordered bland and the soup the best part of the meal.I don't see the appeal to this place. I've got a long list of other places that Id go to over here. That being said, maybe I'm just ordered the wrong things because Wakame has been there for a while and the place is consistently packed....Maybe I'm just wrong."
