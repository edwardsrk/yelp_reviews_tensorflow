b"A deli right next to the sports book = Sports Deli.Hmmm there really wasn't a choice for a quick meal and I didn't really trust the Vietnamese spot next door so decided to grab a sandwich.  Went for the pastrami + egg triple decker and damn it is a huuuge sandwich.  Essentially a pastrami sandwich and then on top of it are your veggies and a fried egg, then covered with another loaf of bread.  Tasted whatevers.  The pastrami is your generic deli pastrami, and pretty fatty too.  The egg is pan fried but I wished the yolk was only half cooked.  It's over $10 for the sandwich, so a bit pricey, but it is inside a casino, so that's to be expected.  Again, huge sandwich, so you won't feel hungry after that's for sure.  Add fries and a drink for $5 more.Saw someone eat this crazy footlong hot dog.  That looked much better."
