b"I think Dr Miller is very good clinically and very compassionate, but for our 6 visits since last November (typical stuff - ear infections, stomach bug, allergic reaction), our average wait time was at least an hour.  Even our 18mo check up appointment that was at 8:15 didn't start until 9 because the people with the appointment before us was late.  Not our problem...We're going to try elsewhere."
