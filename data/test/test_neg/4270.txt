b"I'd been to this location before, but this last time was the most disappointed I'd ever been with a Five Guys restaurant. I had ordered grilled onions, but they came uncooked. The buns were stale. The shake was thin and low quality. We ordered a large fry and there were barely any extra fries in the bag, which is not normal! They usually add an extra scoop into the bag, especially for a large fry.Aside from all that, the food is usually delicious and plentiful. I hope they were just having an off day."
