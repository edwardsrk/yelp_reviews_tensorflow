b"Unfortunately, this place could not live up to the hype created. The cheese bread was fine but nothing to write home about. You should not go here when you are very hungry because the pizza takes about 45 min to an hour to prepare. Sadly, there was a mistake in the kitchen with our pizza and we waited for 1 1/2 hour for our pizza to be prepared properly. This would have been forgivable if the pizza lived up to my expectations. It did not. It was not even edible. The only saving grace at this place was the staff. Everyone was pleasant and that means a lot. Although, I'm doubtful the friendly service was enough for me to try again. Very disappointing."
