b"*only reviewing the lunch special/service*The quality of food and service lives up to its name. I was here with 9 guests and each dish came out separately after 1.5-2 minute intervals (hence waiting 15-20 minutes until we could eat together).The salad was lacking dressing and the bowl had too much water (although good to know they wash the salad). The miso soup was barely warm and rather gritty (see attached picture once it settled). The 'chicken teriyaki' bento box was rather disappointing. The chicken is served on vegetables and due to a lack of sauce, almost resembled chicken fajitas. The tempura was more oily than most places and even the size of the shrimps was quite disappointing (see picture of baby shrimp). The California roll was average, which is shocking, since KaKa boasts about 'premium sushi flavors'.  Even though this is a lunch special, for 13.99 the quality should be there. The sushi place previously here (Sushi Queen) served better quality food and similar portions for 8.99. Yes the interior of this place looks improved but there is no excuse for taking more than 1 hr to serve a mediocre lunch special!"
