b"Well, we can say that this hotel is not too bad. The hotel itself is so-so. The garden with the animals is good. Pools are ok. A lot of people but it is not fault of the hotel. The staff is friendly and kind. I give 2 stars to this hotel because our room smelt to tobacco smoke every time. We hate this smell and sometime it was unbearable. The housekeeper tried to fight against the smell, but nothing changed (it is not his fault. He was very kind). Also, our room was connected with another room by a door. With which, if somebody wants to do a party you are in, even if you don't want. The bathroom was old and it needs to be upgraded. And the lifts too. In addition, you have to pay for wifi 15$ dollars per day!!! For us this point was important because we are from Spain and we want/need to be in contact. This was very annoying for us above all because you don't pay in other hotels. Even if you are not a guess."
