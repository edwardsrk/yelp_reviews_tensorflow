b'Have visited Port City on a number of occasions.  Each being hit or miss.  Here is a multi-million dollar property, with the potential to be a outstanding lake side restaurant.  Each visit has been tainted by incredibly poor attention to detail, either by the Wait staff or the food itself.  The price structure is one you may expect to pay while enjoying the view on the lake, but honestly the food never reaches those price points in dining.  Each time we have visited we have had to introduce ourselves to the waiter or waiter.  Each time asking to know what the specials are.  Our last visit was at lunch time.  We ordered the Baked brie to start.  It was serve uncooked on a small platter with a small(maybe 6 Pepperidge Farm Crackers).  On the plate the fruit compote was actually some type of fruit jam.  As we scrapped the hardened Brie from the dried crust we asked for some more crackers or maybe a smidge of warm bread-our waitress sorry "got no mor" and walked away.  Next to the Club sandwiches we asked them to be serve with their special potato salad side. Special indeed, the potatoes were not completely cooked and the only seasoning to the flavor was the watery mayonnaise they happened to brushed over the rock hard potatoes.  The Club consisted of cheap deli meat, nothing fresh or even high end attempts were made at the meat.  The sandwich had been thoroughly and completely dipped in some type of oil and fried on the grill. So much so the we had to ask for additional napkins to keep up with the removal of the oil from our hands. After a few small greasy bites we asked for our check. Our Waitress whom we had flagged down by standing up, came up and said "didn\'t like it much" we said no and she took or credit card for payment.  By the way never had a refill on any beverages.  We figured her time was better well spent talking with the guys working near the bar outside, since this appear to be where she spent most of her time.  I wish them well at Port City. Just not at my expense.'
