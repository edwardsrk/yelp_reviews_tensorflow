b'Stopped by on a Thursday by myself around 1800 ... place is small ... there were four diners and a waitress and a heavy set guy, perhaps a waiter ... stood by the door for about five minutes and Mr. Heavy Set who wasn\'t doing much of anything wanders over and asks if i have a reservation ... replied that no, i did not ... "ahhh well then we can\'t ..." he says as i stare at all the empty tables ... ah, okay, maybe they get crowded later and the whole place fills ... heard the food was good, but Mr. Heavy Set\'s attitude clearly said he could care less ... won\'t bother going back'
