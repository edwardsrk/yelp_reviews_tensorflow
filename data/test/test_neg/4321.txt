b"My girlfriend and I came in to exchange a watch band today. When we came in we were kindly greeted, but ended up waiting 15 minutes for a salesperson to pay attention to us. Keeping in mind that they took my name down and said someone would be over 'soon'. We got so tired of waiting we returned it altogether. This store is kind of a victim of its own success, a lot of customers, not enough personnel."
