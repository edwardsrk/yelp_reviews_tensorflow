b"Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore."
