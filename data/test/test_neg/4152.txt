b'We recently stayed at this hotel and were in a renovated room, except the bathroom. This is an epic fail. We paid for 4 persons in the room ( an extra $50 a person) however these fees did not allow for all 4 people to use the fitness center. I would think the additional fees should allow usage in the fitness center. Not a fan and will choose a different option next time.'
