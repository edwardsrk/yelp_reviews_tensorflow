b"Nice people and seemed to be great at first. Went there for about a year or so now and I'm changing vets..you make an appointment and you're still in a tiny waiting room full of so many dogs you can't walk by for an hour even though you had an appointment scheduled. I brought my cat in in December because he was losing weight quick. All Dr.Scott said was 'it's probably just age, I CAN do blood work but it's pretty expensive so if there's no signs it's probably just age'..3 months later he can't seem to go to the bathroom so I rush him to a closer vet who did blood work right away and said he had kidney failure which weight loss was the first sign of. I could have caught this months ago but thought he was just fine thanks to the doctor. I was also told they have no prescription medication for cats arthritis. Now the vet I am going to has some prescription medication for that. The doctor doesn't seem to want to give you time of day and overcharges. I was charged a vet fee and all he did was check his stools and looked at him. Did not check his vitals-nothing. And I had to pay an entire vet fee that's outrageous as it is."
