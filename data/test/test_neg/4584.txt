b'Calling this a "day spa" is highly misleading.  It\'s more of a nice nail salon that has a room where they can do a massage.  I saw nothing "day spa" about it - particularly when I sat in the waiting area, looked up at the flourescent lenses in the ceiling and saw it loaded with a bunch of insect bodies and remains.  And I don\'t mean two or three - I mean like 20-40!  The other flourescent fixtures had only two or three.And at that, the "massage room" was ill equipped.  Twice during my massage the attendant had to say excuse me and exit the room (once for the hot stones, and the next for warm towels) - letting in the harsh flourescent lighting glare and completely breaking the relaxing atmosphere and ambience that once should be able to expect and enjoy during a massage.   I had a manicure here once a couple years ago, and was very unimpressed and annoyed by how much the manicurist kept trying to sell me on a more expensive service.  No means no!!So if you\'re looking for a day at the spa - this is NOT the place to go.  If you just want to go in and get a utilitarian massage, then go for it.'
