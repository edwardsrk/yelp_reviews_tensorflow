b"I ate here today, Saturday, at around 1:30pm. The service was good but a little slow. I was not impressed by the menu. The salad bar peaked my interest so I went with that but it turned out to be ok. Yes, just ok. Aside from the typical veggies, lettuce, and salad dressing there really wasn't much else. A few pre-made salads like beat salad, couscous, mushroom salad. Fruits that really kind of tasted funny. No cottage cheese! No pasta salad or Greek salad. Soup of the day was an extra $9.50 , in addition to the salad bar which was already $18.50. I have no desire to return here. Really did not feel like I got the money's worth."
