b"The service was horrible!  We were the only table and got decent service then a crowd of rowdy women came in and we were nonexistent.  It took us over 30 min to get our check and that was after I  had to walk up to the front counter. The food was decent but will probably not go back. I don't like to be in an establishment where I'm treated like I'm a bother than welcomed. Being a prior food server I was very disappointed at the quality of service."
