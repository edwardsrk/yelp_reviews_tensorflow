b"I was so excited to try this place and left so disappointed.  I had my hair blown out just before Christmas wanting the style to last a few days over the busy holiday.  I've had my hair blown out hundreds of times by various stylists, however, the stylist here used the most odd technique.  Regardless, the style looked like the blew out my hair myself - and I'm not a pro.  I was planning on becoming a regular customer and left so disappointed that I wont' be back."
