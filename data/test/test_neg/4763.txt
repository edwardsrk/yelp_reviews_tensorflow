b"We went there for the lunch special.  I had broccoli chicken and my mom had vegetarian.  Both were drowned in a salty sauce.  I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  Otherwise, the food was ok.   Mine came in a smallish bowel.  If you don't want to get full at lunch time, it's perfect.Service was very friendly and fast.  Prices were ok for the amount served.  It's pretty quiet in there, so people can hear your conversation if anyone pays attention at all."
