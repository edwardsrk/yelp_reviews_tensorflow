b'Honest opinion on this restaurant after visiting this place with my gf the other day. Atmosphere is great, not pricy but quality of food just does not make up for the experience. Miso soup was water down, with minimal ingredients. The lunch set that I had was a teriyaki salmon. It served with a measly thin slice of tuna. My gf had a bowl sashimi with rice combo, the problem is they serve in both meal with normal rice instead Japanese rice steam with vinegar. \xe2\x80\x8d'
