b"Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered."
