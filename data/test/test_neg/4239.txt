b"This is a great place to come enjoy some great food however, this time was not as expected. About 3 problems with food , we didn't get refills we had to ask who our server was after getting our drinks.  The visit got better when we talked to the manager(Angela) who made sure every problem we had was fixed. Then we got our waitress Sydney who helped save the day along with Angela. Hopefully that girl who was supposed to be our server, gets a reprimanded for the lack of  customer service skills , bad attitude she provided."
