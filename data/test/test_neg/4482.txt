b"Made reservations on OpenTable. They were slow, so we were sat ASAP. $40 corkage fee for a bottle of wine we brought. We thought that was very high, so we just ordered drinks. I had the barrel-aged old fashion. Too many ice cubes. Tasted like bourbon on ice with a cherry. $16. I'll pass. It also took over 10 mins to get our cocktails after we ordered them. As far as the food goes. Ordered the French onion soup to start. Again, took a long long time to come out (and it's a slow time - 630pm). Soup tasted good, although very watery. Presentation was awful.No bread or anything for the table and the waitress Mariel, rarely came around. Main course took an excessive amount of time to come out. Meanwhile, no waitress in sight. Main course was the Rigatoni in Bolognese. Pretty good, however it came out only warm, not hot. Waitress didn't check on us again. We asked for the check and left. I give it 2 stars. Standard, over-priced Vegas Strip restaurant that doesn't pay much attention to detail or quality. I don't think we will be coming back."
