b"Pretty disappointed with the service. The workers seemed to be caught up in conversation and cared more about that than serving me. I asked for my caramel macchiato with caramel only on the bottom but they instead put it both at the bottom and around the sides on top. So my drink had way too much caramel and was way too sweet for my liking. If they weren't busy talking they might have gotten my order correct. Don't see myself coming back to this location."
