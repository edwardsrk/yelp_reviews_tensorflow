b'Came here for dinner since it was close my UMC trauma, and it closed super late.  When we arrived, there were no customers in the restaurant, and no staff in the front.  I had to yell out "hello" twice to have someone come out, and greet and seat us.  When we sat down, we had another staff come and take our order.  The lady that served us was a little pushy.  She kept trying to recommend a lot of stuff so we would order more.  We ordered tom yum noodle soup, shrimp pad thai, penang curry, pad see ew, and a steamed chicken dish that was similar to hainan chicken.  The menu had an error so it erked me that they mislead customers.  There was a section about that street food specials and noodles, and it said 9am-4am.  Apparently, it was 9am-4pm.  The food was good, but portions was small compared to all the Thai restaurants I\'ve been to.  Service was slow too because we received our Thai Iced tea after we received two of our dishes.  The penang curry took a long time to come out too.Will not be coming back.'
