b'Duffs famous wings are famously not that great. They are expensive for what you get and the flavours are really poor compared to say St Louis or I wings on Queen. My girlfriend and I have been here several times, each time expecting better, but do not get the other Yelpers recommendations. Poor fries, poor wings, average service and an average setting/ ambiance. 2 out of 5. If u love great wings try elsewhere!'
