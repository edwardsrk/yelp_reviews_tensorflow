b"I purchased my meal, and when I get home I find out they didn't even bother putting in hot sauce or soy sauce as silly it my seems it completely destroyed my meal. Now a days all restaurants always do this. Is not the customer job to remind them of the things that need to be in the bag. Fast food places keep the same prices all year round...always the same bad quality services as well.Thank you Panda Express."
