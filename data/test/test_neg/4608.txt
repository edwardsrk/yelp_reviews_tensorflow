b"First time back to the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel. The valet entrance was less than inviting but inside, things are looking up.Had dinner and cocktails at Oscar's, the new restaurant where Center Stage and the pool used to be. Great atmosphere, friendly staff but they need to work on a few things. Drinks were $8 and dinner ran about $50 but had I made other choices, it could easily have run $60-70 per person.While my food was delicious (awesome double boned pork chop and creamed corn brulee), the long wait from the kitchen was terminally s-l-o-w. My dining partners complained that their food was cold (must have sat around, waiting for my pork chop to cook, because mine was hot).I dined with six, unrelated business associates, and splitting the bill was beyond ridiculous. I would have been fine splitting the ticket six-ways but that wasn't really fair to two who were eating light, probably due to budget restraints. The server could easily have given us separate checks (come on, it's all computerized!) but of course he refused. One of the guys spent 15 minutes figuring who owed what.Add in the poor acoustics due to the glass rotunda and you can bet that I'll never go back. I wish them well but they've got a few areas to improve."
