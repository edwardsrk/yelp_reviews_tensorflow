b"Came here after work one evening because I was really craving a shawarma. To be honest a left quite disappointed. Here they use a different kind of bread which has more of Naan type flavour and it tasted very doughy.I found that the bread overpowered most of the other ingredients and it felt like that's all I was tasting. On top of that the wrap was poorly put together and fell a part as I was eating it. The price was also on the high side just for a single wrap, I was not really a fan of this place and most likely won't be coming back."
