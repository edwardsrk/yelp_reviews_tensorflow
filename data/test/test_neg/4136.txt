b"5/26/17 around 10:00 am. Medyo mahal mga tinda nila compare mo sa ibang asian grocery store. Customer service is terrible. At the cashier lane, very long line with 1 cashier only. Seems like she doesn't care. She's didn't bother to tell us if another cashier is on the way or call a manager for help."
