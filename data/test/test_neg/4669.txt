b"Everything was sort of fine but kind of pretty underwhelming. I expect premium to mean service that goes way above & beyond. Walked in, & 3 TVs had the QVC network on, 2 more on some NFL network clip show, but no TV had the World Series on, nor the Hornets game. Are they paying attention or even trying? Our awesome waitress Jessica got cut right as they were getting busy, & the bartender got slammed & couldn't keep up with her tables. Rest of the floor staff was a little unpolished. Not rude, just meh. The fried pickles were ok, but too salty. The burger was fine but either the plate was huge or the little handful of fries too small. $6 for a draft beer is just too much. Again, I expect 'over the top' friendly for these prices & 'premium' name. Too many staff walk around frumpy & annoyed looking. Oh, and don't charge me for an extra (low quality) blue cheese that you don't even make here. That's just petty."
