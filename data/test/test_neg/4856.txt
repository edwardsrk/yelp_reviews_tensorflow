b'I guess I am just not a fan of this "new age" style of theater. Really all you are getting for the extra charge is a bigger seat which isn\'t even all that great. Also, parking right around the theater is not as good as it was in the old location. But mainly I do not understand using up so much space for a liquor and coffee bar when you are a five minute walk from much better options both inside and outside of the mall. Bottom line: There are better "premium" theaters in Scottsdale so if you can travel, I suggest you do. For locals, the Cine Capri in Tempe is a much easier experience and you don\'t have to shell out $40 on tickets and drinks for two people.'
