b"Still haven't found that go to mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Don't quite understand the good reviews. Pre shredded cheese with powder coat is nasty. Fajitas with more peppers and onions than meat. And waiters with personalities of an unsalted cracker just don't cut it for me. What I would do for a Javier's of Orange County CA in Charlotte.Only thing this place has going for it is the darling decor. That is not enough to ever bring us back."
