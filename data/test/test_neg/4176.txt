b"Tried to come here last week and they said they didn't receive their shipment and had NO food to make anything. Came back today and they were out of halal chicken, tomato and straws. The wait takes FOREVER - don't come here if you are in a hurry. Not sure what's going on with this location lately. Never had an issue before but the last two times I've been here I've been very disappointed."
