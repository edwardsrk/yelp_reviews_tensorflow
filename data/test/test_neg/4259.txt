b'Our first warning should have been when we walked in the establishment and we were told by the hostess they only had one booth and it was reserved. They actually had  three booths and we were able to get one of them. The service was excellent and the waitresses were very attentive. However, the food left much to be desired. The ranch dressing tasted like tarter sauce. The rest of the food seemed to be of the frozen variety straight out of the freezer into the deep fryer.'
