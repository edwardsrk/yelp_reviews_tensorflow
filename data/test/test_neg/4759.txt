b"The food at l'Harmonie d'Asie was absolutely fabulous. Fresh, savoury, well-prepared and beautifully presented. The crispy duck was a particular favourite. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to ever go there again because the service was so unbelievably horrendous.The waitstaff was very kind and friendly. However, there were only two waitresses for a packed, Saturday night room, and I suspect that the kitchen was even more understaffed. We literally waited an hour between each course. An HOUR. We chatted with the couple sitting next to us, who were apparently regulars, and they said that the service was always the same - unbelievably slow. They seemed to enjoy kvetching about the service while downing an unfathomable amount of alcohol - which might explain why they kept coming back despite the bad service. We, on the other hand, were just starving and annoyed.Another annoying aspect of this place is that while it is BYOW, beer is forbidden. The waitress informed us that before the ban on beer, people would mix wine and beer together and get sick in the washrooms. This didn't stop people from sneaking beer from their purses - we noticed a bit of this, and we indulged ourselves - it just made drinking our two beers (without incident) unbelievably tacky-feeling and uncomfortable. The staff just didn't seem to understand that their clientele were getting stinking drunk, loud, and sick, not because they were mixing alcohol, but because they were being forced to wait three hours for a meal with nothing to entertain them but their wine.In short, good food, but not worth the disappointing ambiance and the absolutely terrible service."
