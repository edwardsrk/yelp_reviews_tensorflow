b"i work in the plaza in which this chipotle is located.  so i have more insight than others on the day-to-day operation of this place.as someone who frequents this place at least once a week, i can honestly say this is one of the worst places i have ever eaten from.  rarely do the workers know who is doing what.  at least one person on the line has an attitude that really shouldn't show (im in customer service too and it puts a bad tase in the patron's mouth).  they consistently get orders wrong and bag the wrong things at the register.  food is never prepared on time and they run out very quickly.  the place was even closed for a few hours one day because they ran out!  unbelievable.  the supervision monitors how much meat is given to customers constantly as well.sometimes i hold fault w the customers for having outlandish requests that hold the lines up...to that id suggest calling your orders in or having a separate line for those types of orders.  but that notwithstanding, the service is really bad.  legacy village or coventry are way better options if you're willing to drive 5-10 minutes in each opposite direction."
