b'Dryest meatball sub I\'ve ever had.  So sloppily made with marinara sauce only on half.  I ordered it "big" which didn\'t seem large at all to me compared to any other sub shop I\'ve ever been to.  There was about an inch of bread at the end with NOTHING on it:  no meat, no sauce, no cheese - so I\'m assuming I paid an extra dollar for an inch worth of plain bread since I\'m not sure what their regular size is.  Very stingy on sauce and on cheese and the few mushrooms that cost an extra 50 cents.  Complete ripoff and not even as good as subway.  Don\'t bother with this place.'
