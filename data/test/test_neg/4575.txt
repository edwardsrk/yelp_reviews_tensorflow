b'Went to a show last night and a few things were disappointing. The lines in the venue to get drinks were 15-20 minutes long waiting in line! Not enough barservers or locations to purchase. The vocals were somewhat muffled and could not understand any lyrics. Showed up for the show at 6:15 p ,had to wait thru two opening acts, long changeovers between bands and headliner did not start until 9:30 pm. Sold out show , so crowded and poor air conditioning.'
