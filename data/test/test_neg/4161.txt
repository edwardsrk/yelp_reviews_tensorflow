b"This place is pretty cool but there are quite a bit of shortcomings. Expect a cross between Chuck e Cheese & Dave and Buster's. A group of my friends came here after buying the Groupon deal for all day arcade play. The bar was such a nightmare. I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left. They had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken. More often than not, one of the two controller would not work.  This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders."
