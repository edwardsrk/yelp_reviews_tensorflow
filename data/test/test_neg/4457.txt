b"I didn't even know this movie theater existed by MGM. Not sure how it stays in business. It's pretty hidden and super, super old. The tickets are sold at the concession stand (I think she was the concession stand person as well).Theater itself was huge but seating was old. They don't recline back much less even move. Arm rests don't raise up and the rows are very close to each other. Probably won't go back."
