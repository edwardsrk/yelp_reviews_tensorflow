b"On my return from Cleveland to LAX I was able to move through the security line pretty quickly which was a plus. One of the security guards told me to remove my body spray I had forgotten was in my purse my entire trip,  which I understand now why. But his interaction with me went as follows. Him: You have to take that bottle outMe: But I flew here with it in my purseHim: No you didn't ???? (So I guess I'm lying)Woman security: You can take it back to your carMe: I am flying HOME, which means I don't have a vehicle and am not coming backI don't know they were just a little rude about it. Maybe LAX slipped up when I travelled to Cleveland.  He could've just said something similar. Sheesh!The airport is clean and well kept though."
