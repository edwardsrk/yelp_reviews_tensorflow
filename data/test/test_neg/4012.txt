b"2.5 but I rounded down.This is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.I'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.Food is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses."
