b"I always think of Mickies as a must-go place when I am in town, but this time around, I questioned why that is the case.  The food was decidedly mediocre, not cheap and the wait was interminable.  My companion's omelet, ordered with pepperjack cheese, was served with cheddar sprinkled on top.  My mushroom and swiss omelet almost certainly was made with slimy canned mushrooms.  The fried cheese curds - which my every visit to Madison must include - were forgettable, sadly.  Even the coffee was not up to snuff.  At least the waitstaff was friendly and trying hard."
