b"I really want to give South Point four or five stars - some areas are amazing. The front line staff, for example, were always incredibly friendly and helpful. The room itself was nice enough for a 4 star (though by no means as flashy as some others) and the location is surprisingly pleasant, only 15 minutes from the strip at most via I-15. However, I'm not going back. There were just too many minor annoyances night after night that weren't solved around our room. Alone, they'd be fine, but all together, it was enough to keep me from coming back.-The iron was broken. We asked for another - it took four hours and another call to get.-The blow dryer cradle fell clear out of the wall when I tried to use the blow dryer.  -They only stocked two towels each night - even after we asked for more.-They only stocked two pillows each night - they got that right after a couple nights...and so on. I don't want to be one of those reviewers who get into every problem, but you get the picture. Nothing that ruined my time there, but collectively it was just too much. On the plus side, the resort fee ($14) gets you internet access and boarding passes, the buffet is quite good, the casino ain't bad, and there's plenty of convenient shops (not for hardcore shopping, but picking up extras) within two minutes driving distance."
