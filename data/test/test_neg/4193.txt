b"Let me start out by saying that I be been visiting this restaurant since 1995. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the food is good, especially  the pit roasted chicken. I have made it a must visit and never missed coming here the 20 something times I have visited the Phoenix area. But I recently visited the restaurant and had a very disturbing experience. I checked in with the hostess and was asked if so had a reservation,and replied that so did not know they took reservations. She told me that they don't in busy months, but do in slower ones.She said that she would be able to seat us ( my girlfriend and I) in 15 to 20 minutes, which I said thank you! We then stood and watched MULTIPLE PEOPLE come through the door and were all seated within 10 to 15 minutes while They continued to pass by us, and basically ignore us. After 45 minutes of patiently waiting I went to the hostess and asked when we would be seated. I was informed it would be about 30 more minutes. Finally 10 minutes later ( after everyone but us were seated) we were seated.( The blonde manager seemed really put off towards us, slammed down a couple glasses of water on our table, and rudely marched away!   We felt so DISRESPECTED , and killed the great mood we were in before entering the restaurant!  We decided this place did not deserve our hard earned money and got up quietly and walked out! I felt I should leave this review so other people won't feel the snobbery we were treated to. This is depressing to me because I bragged to all my friends that I have brought here how great this place is. Sadly though this bad experience  has soured me, and will not return. People should be treated equal, and we dressed nice.but must not have  met their snobby Scottsdale expectations...RESPECT PEOPLE"
