b'I\'m a little frustrated with Bellevue Beer\'s push for constant change.  A few years back they were quite simply the best place to go for a variety of craft beers by the case, at a reasonable price.  Fast forward to the present - they now have a legitimate selection of beers but increasingly by the 6 pack and for less than reasonable prices.  Now you have to suffer buying overpriced 6 packs instead of being able to purchase a case of whatever you fancy, unless of course, you\'re buying a standard American-style "lager"...they still have plenty of cases of watery beers.  I voiced my opinion to the cashier last time is was there and he told me that there is more selection now.  He\'s wrong.  It\'s the illusion of choice.  They have a section for overpriced 6 packs (single type of beer) next to the overpriced mix & match singles beer section, both with the same stuff.  Basically, what he was saying is that you have a larger selection of ways to being gouged by a business taking full advantage of the new PA beer laws...to the detriment of the consumer.  If I wanted single beers I would go to a true 6 pack shop, a bar, or a local brewery - not some side of Route 65 pass-thru.  Get a new sister-store if you want to pull this off the right way.  I\'ve been coming here for years (10+), typically stopping in to get two cases of craft beers at a time (one was usually the beer-of-the-month special) and going on my merry way.  You\'re losing me!  This isn\'t some walk-in store front.  You need a car to get here, and I\'m taking my car and going to a different neighborhood (see: Buddy\'s, Sav-Mor, Duffy\'s, etc.) to get my beers by the case.  When I want 6 packs, I\'m going to Mt. Washington (see: Packs & Dogs cause they have dogs too) or elsewhere.If Bellevue Beer\'s owner/manager could charge you by the ounce, sip, or smell, I\'m pretty sure they would.  Wrong! And, also...Sad!'
