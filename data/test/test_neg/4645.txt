b'I had to use this place while my car was being repaired at a local shop. The one young man was very nice and super helpful, drove me to the repair shop when I repaired the car as well. The reason for the low rating is the actual cars. The first car they tried to put me in was a Camry with the front bumper hanging off. The next two cars were extremely dirty: windshield had so many bugs and dirt you could barely see through, stains on the seats, etc. I would recommend going a few miles out and finding a better rental place or even a different Enterprise in nearby Gilbert or Scottsdale, where the cars are actually clean and nice in those areas.'
