b"Best bagel shop I've been to outside of NYC.  Yes it's a chain, but they execute it well.  The workers here know their regulars.  They're extremely helpful and friendly, even if it's 5:30 in the morning.  The coffee choices are always fresh, and the bagel sandwiches they make have never disappoint either.  I usually get the egg, spinach, mushroom and swiss.  The sandwich is always carefully assembled.  The spinach and mushroom are drained properly before being placed on your sandwich, so they neither turn the bagel to mush nor drip as you're trying to eat.  It's this attention to detail that makes me look forward to eating here.  I just wish they were open for dinner - they close late afternoon."
