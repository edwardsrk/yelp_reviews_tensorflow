b"Cake batter, vanilla snow & peanut butter!  Topped with peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips, yogurt covered raisins and Cap'n Crunch!Not a hint of iciness in this fro-yo, yo!  A great selection of flavors, more toppings than you can shake a spoon at, and pretty cheap!  And Kosher too!

But either way, this was a great frozen treat for dessert, and looking forward to getting some mo'!"
