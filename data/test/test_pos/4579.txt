b'Best women\'s athletic apparel in Madison. They break the sections of the store up by sport/exercise type. There is running, gym/training, skiing, yoga, and general outdoors apparel. I love all of their clothes and appreciate the quality Athleta offers. Their twist hoodies are perfect for running, I love their sports bras, and their pants are comfortable to workout in as well as flattering. I am a loyal fan of the twist hoodies and will most likely end up buying every color. They fit very close to the body, have awesome sweat wicking material and also boast being "anti-stink" therefore you can wear their clothes longer before having to wash - which is convenient as well as eco-friendly.  Another thing I love about Athleta is their guarantee to their customers, one can take off the tags, work-out in the clothes, and if not happy for any reason can return the items no questions asked. I think they call it their sweat guarantee.  I read about a woman who accidentally threw her yoga pants in the dryer after owning them a year. She took them to the store to ask how to remove the pilling that happened and they told her to just get a new pair, on them. Wow. I am completely comfortable and confident spending my money at Athleta.'
