b"I have been seeing Dr Keller about 8 years now and while going to see your Gyno is not the most fun thing to do, she is one of my favorite doctors.  Her fun, upbeat personality and her friendly caring, staff have always been consistent and professional.  You may have to wait a few minutes on a phone call as her office gets busy, but her staff have always been pleasant and patient with me and all my questions.  *Warning* She is a firecracker.. straight forward and blunt and is full of laughs.  If you cannot handle that, then I suggest you go elsewhere.  But if you appreciate a no fluff doctor who has personality, who spends endless time educating herself and her patients and who doesn't just see you as an insurance payment and a lab result.. then I highly recommend Dr Maria Keller.  Dr Keller is one of the only doctors I have been able to build a cohesive relationship with, which in turn provides me the best women's health care.  For me, that gives me comfort.  Her office is also relaxing and calming.. makes me feel like I'm on a beach/ next to the ocean, rather than a doctors office.  I have lived in many different cities (west coast and east coast) and have not been able to find all this in any other doctor."
