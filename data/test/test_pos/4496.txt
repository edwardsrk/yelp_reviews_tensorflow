b"Mache Bacchus is amazing.  Entering thru a fine wine shop, you can pick up something reasonably price.  Then, proceed to your table.On the outdoor deck, you'll be treated to live music, and a spectacular view of the lake.  Although man made, you would never know.  Alas, I became fooled many of time.This is particular a good choice for a romantic evening, or comfortable and nice enough for a group of friends for an afternoon.  Delightful.I recommend the Steak Frites ($25), Moules Mariniere (mussels, $19), and the Roasted Chicken ($22).Wonderful, wonderful place.  Also, it is miles from the strip, and provides ample parking."
