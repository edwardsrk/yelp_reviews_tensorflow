b"I purchased my wife's wedding ring from Rich, owner of Red Rock Jewelers about 1 year ago. He is very easy to work with, listened to our desire and created a custom ring on the spot in front of us. The ring was delivered right on time just as promised and the craftsmanship is remarkable. Rich is the only jeweler I trust in Las Vegas!"
