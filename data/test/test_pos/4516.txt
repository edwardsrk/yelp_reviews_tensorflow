b"The Gyro House was a fantastic night out. Upon entering we were greeted by a belly dancer and live Middle Eastern music. It was very clear this was a local favorite - run by family. If you have a hankering for hummus, grape leaves or of course, gyros - this is your stop! Top it off with cream tea and freshly made cinnamon dessert - heaven! This house is full of a welcoming staff ready to fill your belly! Don't forget to byob!"
