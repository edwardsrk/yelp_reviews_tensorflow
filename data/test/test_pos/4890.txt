b'This is probably one of the coolest constructed coffee shop I been too in Vegas! Be ready and have your camera in hand because this place is photo Heaven! There are literally no bad seat in the place. A Alice and Wonderland vibe with the setting of 1920 S. Korea.  Right when you walk through the door you basically time travel.  A must go for every Vegas resident.     I was really impressed with how prompt every employees were and you can just tell they really loved their job! I will definitely have to go back and get a better food review. Only because I was so caught up with interior of this place! Well enjoy the video and pictures. "Lets eat Las Vegas"!!!'
