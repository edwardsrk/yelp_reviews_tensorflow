b"My wife and I have been wanting to come here after we saw their episode on Restaurant Impossible. We finally made it April 9th for my wife's birthday. The server was helpful in selecting or order. We started with a Cesar salad which the server said was enough for two and he was right.  We each had two servings of salad. Wifely ordered the veal piccata and I the veal Parmesan. It was absolutely delicious. We wanted to stay for desert but this being a Saturday night the restaurant was extremely noisy so we ordered a tiramisu to go as we could not handle the noise level anymore. The restaurant needs some noise abatement material to soak up the level of the conversations  I would love to go back but never would on a weekend. I'll have to try an early dinner on a week night. Don't write this restaurant off because of the noise level, instead plan your dinner here on a time when they are slower and I'm sure you will be rewarded with a great dinner."
