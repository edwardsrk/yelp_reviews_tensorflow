b"I have never been brave enough for a boat and last week I went in Miller Ferry to put in Bay and this past Friday and today  (Sept 3rd and 5th 2016) was my first time in a kayak. My husbands first in a tandem. The staff is absolutely top notch. Super sweet people who I can't say enough good things about. Nice lake for first timers who are terrified of water, boats and waves. They were wonderful people and I'm glad to wear my kayak shirt from here. Wonderful experience all around even if I was terrified the first go out! Thanks!"
