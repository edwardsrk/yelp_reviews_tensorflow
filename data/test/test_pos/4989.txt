b"When you first walk in it will trip you out! Very elegant and classy inside. Good luck finding good seating. This place is huge, but almost always packed. Pastries are a total delight! I would come here just for a pastry treat and pass on the coffee. Probably one of the most enchanting coffee shops I've ever been in. A fantastic place to bring a close friend or relative for a long conversation."
