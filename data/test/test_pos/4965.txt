b"Five Stars you say? But why? Why 5 Stars?I'm giving The District Five Stars because I have come to adore The District over the past couple years. It has strangely enough become a staple of my trips to Henderson. I often look forward to a trip to The District as it hosts many of my favorite shopping spots. Normally I head over for a few reasons: I need cards from Hallmark, I'd like to browse Williams & Sonoma or pop into the doggy boutique to buy some treats for my dogs. The District also hosts Whole Foods as well.As for restaurants I've been to a few of them: Al's Garage, Presidio Rachel's Kitchen, of course, the Panera Bread, and Coffee Bean (love it!). They have events, you can see people walking their dogs and honest to goodness it almost feels like you aren't really in Vegas anymore when you're here. Overall this is one of my favorite shopping areas in Las Vegas/Henderson. Love it."
