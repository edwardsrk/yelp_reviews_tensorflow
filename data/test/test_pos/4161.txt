b"I wish I could give 10 stars!!!  Scottsdale Auto Glass should be your go-to for all auto glass needs for three reasons:1. They do excellent work at a reasonable price.2. They are on time, professional, and thorough.3. Seth!  He helped me more than 1.5 hours on the phone with the insurance company and insurance's glass claims company.  He made sure I got the insurance information I needed, the windshield replaced, and even followed up afterward to make sure all was done properly and I had everything I needed.  His level of service was waaaaay above and beyond."
