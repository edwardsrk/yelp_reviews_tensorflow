b'I used to try and make it here weekly/bi-weekly as it was the place that "made" downtown Phoenix for me. Don\'t get me wrong, there have always been cool spots down here, but the dark atmosphere coupled with killer live music made Monroe\'s second to none. I saw Paris James for the first time here years ago and it was one of the best live music sessions that I have been fortunate enough to witness. The sign is still on the outside of the building and the space remains vacant. Like that childhood love that you always compared others to, Monroe\'s is that bar that I always size others up to the moment I walk in. I\'ll hold on to my hopes that perhaps they will open their doors back up so I can grab a Ruben sandwich (their Ruben was one of the best I\'ve had) and some whisky waters, and let my ears bask in the heartfelt melodies emanating from the strings of the featured musician.'
