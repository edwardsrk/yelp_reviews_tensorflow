b"This morning my daughter in law found this place on groupon and called to get both her mother and I in for a massage...by the afternoon we had an apt...they were very accommodating... I was scheduled with Danyelle and she was awesome!!! Excellent price for both of us & well worth it! After my apt I was given water & got to chose a gift from a variety of things... I'll definitely be back in the future thank you angel blessings wellness spa!!!"
