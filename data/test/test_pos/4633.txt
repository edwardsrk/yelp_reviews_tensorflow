b'Went here for a mani and pedi. They not only did a great job with my help pedi, but also did awesome on my sns nails. I took off my acrylics before I went and a few on my nails were weird shaped due to me snagging them before i could get them done again. Not only did they put tips on the ones that needed it, they took the time to make sure both hands matched! I will definitely be coming back again!'
