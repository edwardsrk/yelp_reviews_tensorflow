b"Came to Vegas with the bf for a early bday celebration and decided to give this Lawry's a try on our first night in. Don't even remember the last time I been to a Lawry's. But I do know it was a many years ago and I remembered I've had better. Coming into this one with that expectation, I was actually surprised to be totally blown away. Maybe it was my mood last night, maybe it was my tastes bud not having steak for a while. Or maybe it's really this Lawry's do taste better than the ones in L.A. But my prime rib was delicious! I can't complain one bit. Tender, juicy, just the right cut. Creamed corn still just as good, and sweets didn't disappoint. Thank you Lawry's for the wonderful experience. I'll be sure to stop by more often  next time I come to Vegas"
