b"I wanted to share my wonderful experience at Applebee's the other night, we had a long night at school so we decided to grab late dinner. Our waitress was Evelyn, she was the absolute best! We grabbed a few pi\xc3\xb1a coladas with an extra shot apparently the shot was an extra 6 dollars! She was nice enough to notify us before making them just Incase we changed our mind, we didn't mind at all but we sure appreciated her letting us know. It was a busy night our food took some time but in all honesty it didn't bother us, mainly cause she was just so professional with the way she treated us and made us feel so welcomed. I enjoyed my very expensive pi\xc3\xb1a colada & meal gave her a very nice tip because it's hard to find service like the one she showed that night. I will definitely be back!!!!"
