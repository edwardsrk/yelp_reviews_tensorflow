b'This was, by far a very enjoyable and top notch performance put on by a small acting troupe in a small theater in the back of an obscure "miracle mile" mall in Planet Hollywood. Everything about this show was what the old Vegas was all about ... comedy, elegance, fantastic dancing and terrific LIVE music. In fact, I can easily say that the band made all the difference in the world. They are surprisingly high above the stage in the back and become an integral part of the show. Lora Kelsey and Sophia Monica are extremely sexy, talented and make you "drool" zombie style for more. Patrick Leahy is also a riot in his performance and you can tell he\'s an audience favorite. I don\'t think Augustus Scott was Zenoch this night but it was alright because the stand-in was brilliant. There was more "gayness" references than I need to listen to but these are entertainers and this is Las Vegas. It is well worth and more the box office price to see this production.I do NOT recommend getting the show/dinner package. The restaurant they pair you with called Pampas Brazilian Grille are a bunch of jerks. They have two lines they put you in... one for show vouchers and one for walk-in customers. They told us 25 minutes (two hours before the show) that they would seat us. They said they would page us. While I am sitting there they are seating each and every walk-in customer. They never paged us at all. I got qissed off and went next door to Todai and they were kind enough to give us $20 off each meal just because of my experience there.'
