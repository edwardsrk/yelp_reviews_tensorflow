b'****Service - Food- Atmosphere is always excellent!!!! Consistent every time and gets even better the next visit. The only sushi place my family and friends come to because everything is always great. Fish is always fresh and the oil they fry in is ALWAYS clean. Owner always takes time to talk to his customers and frequently checks on everything especially the people. Unlike other sushi spots that always seem annoyed when you order "All You Can Eat" , Hanabi always gives you a great big smile and always asks if you would like more. Definitely the #1 spot for Sushi in Las Vegas!!!!!!! *********'
