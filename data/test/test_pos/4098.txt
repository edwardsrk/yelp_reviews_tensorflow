b'This place is the real deal with a beautiful dining room, a professional wait staff, and the food and wine is outstanding. My wife loves duck and it was perfectly prepared. I had the sea ass and the waiter helped me pair a glass of wine. We laso had dessert and the waiter had the staff pick a perfect dessert wine to go with our dessert. Just perfect. You will love it.'
