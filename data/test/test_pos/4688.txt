b"We needed some odd size passport-type photos for a country in Europe as well as regular US passport photos.  We had gone to another store and they weren't helpful at all.  The folks at this PostNet went out of their way to help us out.  They researched the correct size online and then had their graphic designer size them to the correct specs.  They were friendly and knowledgeable, and in my opinion, went above and beyond.  I highly recommend this store for all your postal and printing needs."
