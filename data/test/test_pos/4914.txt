b"They were a little reluctant to give me by myself a table but once I insisted it was awesome. All the fun of coming here is cooking the meat in my opinion, like at a yakiniku place in Japan that I often miss. It's very reasonably priced too and everything is great. I didn't really like the sides that came with it, but that's personal preference (not a fan of cold pickled bleh kimchi and vegetables). But nonetheless, I definitely will return."
