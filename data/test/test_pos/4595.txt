b"Well what can I say about our experience at Zenshin? Excellent as always. Their spicy tuna roll is one of my favorites there! I want to say they use wasabi to heat up their spicy tuna? They're rolls are always fresh and very delicious. The flavors of Zenshin's cuisine is beyond any sushi restaurants. Their staff is courteous and very attentive. Garret and Alisha are two of our favorite servers there. I definitely reccomend Zenshin to everyone, as it has the perfect ambiance anytime of the day which makes having any meal very delightful. We never get tired of eating at Zenshin and it's definitely my first choice for sushi. Thanks you Terrence for a superb restaurant of the best creations!"
