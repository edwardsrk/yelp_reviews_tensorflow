b"My friend and I came here around 8pm on a Thursday night. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. I ordered the pho tam nam and my friend ordered the oxtail pho. We both had generous portions of meat and just the right amount of noodles. The broth was very flavorful that I hardly had to doctor it up. It came with all the traditional sides. Will definitely be back again."
