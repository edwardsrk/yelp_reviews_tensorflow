b"First time eating here with a girlfriend and we're both hooked! Came for dinner and since there is no dinner buffet we tried a couple things off the menu. I will say everything was awesome, and their tandoori chicken was especially amazing. Super sweet and attentive service. Awesome experience, and I honestly might do a takeout order asap because I'm craving it already."
