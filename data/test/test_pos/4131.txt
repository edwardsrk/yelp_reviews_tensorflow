b"I have always wanted to try Ethiopian cuisine.  Glad, so very glad I did.  My wife and I love this place.  Lunch seems to be leftovers, good, but not as good as dinner.  Dinner is sooo good.  The first time we went, I was very hungry.  The smell of the delicious food is so wonderful that even though we weren't kept waiting long, I was starving by the time the food came.  I just can't put into words how good it is!The family that runs it are very very nice and super friendly.  They'll take time to explain things.I really wish this were a chain.  But it's worth the drive.  I'm writing this now because some family were looking for a place to lunch with us in Tempe tomorrow.  This is it."
