b'Having been an avid frequenter of bookstores in New York (while living there 50+ years before moving to Concord), and having visited many others while traveling domestically and abroad, I can wholeheartedly say that Books-A-Million is nothing short of an A-1 first-class operation. With a relaxed atmosphere, diverse selection of books, music, magazines and gifts, there is something here for everyone, Thank you Chris, David, Cylie, Sarah, Michael and Aleia for providing top-notch customer service.'
