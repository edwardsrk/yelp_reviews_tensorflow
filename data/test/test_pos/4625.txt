b'This is my favorite spot. My boyfriend and I always come here to have a quick lunch. They just updated their menu with new items and of course if you check in you get a free drink. The staff is very friendly, and they provide excellent customer service. My friend is allergic to shellfish and they accommodated that when asking about the items. Needless to say I will always be a regular customer here. My favorite items are the curry udon and chicken karaage. They used to have taiyaki and if they ever do make it again, be sure to try it out for dessert!'
