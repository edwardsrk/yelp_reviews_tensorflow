b'Excellent service - every plate we ordered came out so fast and our water glasses never were below half full and the restaurant was packed! We enjoyed everything we ordered - the spring rolls, tuna tataki (thick pieces of tuna!), Thai street pork, short rib ramen, and the Thai crepe dessert with vanilla ice cream and fresh mango. Well priced for great quality food. We will be back!'
