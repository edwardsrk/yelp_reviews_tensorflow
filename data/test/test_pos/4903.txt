b"I've been here numerous times now (monthly!), and stand by my statement that M Lovely Nail has some of the best quality, talented nail artists and craftmanship in Toronto.  I've been to TIPS Nail Bar, the 10 Spot, and more bougie places, yet have never received the kind of customer service and attention to detail that I receive here at M Lovely Nail.  I'm picky about my nails and who I trust with them, but at this salon, nails really are an art, and all of the staff here treat their customers with care.For my nails, I like to see Tony and Quan.  Tony is so talented with nail designs and french manicures, and Quan is excellent at shellac. I always get so many compliments after seeing them, and my manicures last forever!  My friends have requested Brandon and have had great reviews for him too, so I highly recommend just about anyone at this salon.  It's a hidden gem in Toronto that definitely deserves more attention. I'd give this 10 stars if I could! :) Location: Right by Yonge/Bloor, so it's a convenient walk from the subway and closeby U of T campus!Price: One of the most affordable in town! I pay abou $25 for shellac and $35 for a french mani.Thank you so much, M Lovely Nail! I'll definitely be back. :)"
