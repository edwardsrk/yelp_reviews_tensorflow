b"I've been going here for at least 25-30 years, and I've never been disappointed in either the cleaners or the alterations - they've always done a superb job, even on difficult things.  I've given her some really difficult mending jobs and alterations, and everything has come back just the way I wanted it.  Very professional, I would never go anywhere else!"
