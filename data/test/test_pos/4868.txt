b'This is my families pizza haven - and we try and get here once a week!Everyone who works here is friendly, nice & really wants you to have a great time.  They are constantly coming up weekly pizza, salad & appetizer specials that are different and wonderful.  The "wedge" salad was one of my favorites!They also have great patio seating as well.'
