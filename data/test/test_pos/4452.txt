b"Another visit to one of my favorite lunch-time haunts with my Zach. Can't stop trying the nachos, but have also branched out and tried the lengua tacos (yum) and some of the other specialties on the menu. I haven't been disappointed yet, and the place is always packed at lunchtime. So much better than most of the fast Mexican places out there and quite good prices. Once a week is not enough :)."
