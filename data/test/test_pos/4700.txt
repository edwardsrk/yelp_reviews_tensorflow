b'This place is legit. I went for a Chicago style dog and they delivered 110%. The dog had a perfect "pop" when you bite into it (essential) and tasted just like it does in the states but with better tactics. The sports peppers are thinly chopped, which are the main difference. Other than that. Everything else tastes exactly the same. Spot on!'
