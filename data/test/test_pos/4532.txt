b"Super quaint little mom and pop restaurant. Originally ordered take-out but then decided to have a beer and enjoy dinner. It was a little empty, but since it was a holiday I'm sure they weren't expecting to be busy. The server was super attentive and sweet, and I ordered the tom kha, as well as the pad thai, both spicy (4). Food was great! I'll definitely be back!!"
