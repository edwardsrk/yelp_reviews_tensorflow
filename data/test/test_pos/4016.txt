b"If I had to choose one favorite in Las Vegas this would be it! It has the best vibe, best service and best food. If you come here ask for Tina as your server. She is the best. Happy hour is where it's at too. I can't say enough good things about this place. I've been here several times and every time it's been perfect. It almost feels like you're not in Vegas but the Bahamas, hence Bahama Breeze. :) Enjoy your dining experience, it won't disappoint!"
