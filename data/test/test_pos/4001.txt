b'My tire was low on my way to work one day so I pulled off the highway and pulled into Big O tires. I already called my job to inform them i was going to be late. As soon as I pulled in, Ray helped me right away, he was extremely attentive and didnt just check the tire that was low, he made sure all tires were good. I dont know if he sensed my urgency, but he was so quick and helpful that I wasnt even late to work !'
