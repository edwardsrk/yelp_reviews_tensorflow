b'Their Pork Belly Ramen answered my craving for that crispy pork skin on layers of tender pork and a little pork fat. The soup stock is very flavorful and the noodles are just perfect! Their tuna chips and chicken wings are also good.  I also like the vibe in Clever Koi. I got to speak with one of the young owners. Very friendly. Highly recommending this place if you want something Asian with the LA vibe.'
