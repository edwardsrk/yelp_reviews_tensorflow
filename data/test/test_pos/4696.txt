b"Superb fusion of American and Vietnamese cuisine.  on the table are plates of oxtail fried rice, fried oysters, mekong river soup (made with beef, fishball, shrimp, and pork)... Dungeness crabs and Branzino.  All entrees are well prepared and are an explosion of taste. Yummy to my tummy.  Can't wait to revisit."
