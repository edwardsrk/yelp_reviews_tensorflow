b'Went for my birthday dinner. So yummy! The decor is absolutely amazing. I fell in love, so classy, so chic, perfect for my bday celebration. I wanted pizza and what a good choice it was! We started with the chicken artichoke bruschetta! Excellent. Then had the four cheese pizza adding spinach. Delicious. Then they brought me a yummy dessert  I loved it!'
