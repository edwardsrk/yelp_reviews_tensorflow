b'Amazing customer service, would score higher than 5 stars if possible. Received call in advance as promised and Kevin, the electrician did an amazing job. He was able to identify the problem  and fix for much less than I expected. Kevin was professional , efficient and friendly. Brian did an excellent job of trying to identify the problem over the phone and scheduling the service.  A very professional company with great people. Fan Doctor will be my go to for future repairs.'
