b'Really enjoyed this place! Lets start with the decor and ambiance. Well above average. Very swanky retro feel but cozy with plenty of wood details and great energy throughout the space. Awesome hip, urban eatery. More than you\'d expect from a restaurant within a hotel in downtown Phoenix. I\'d come back just for the restaurant even if I wasn\'t staying at the hotel. Started off with the yellow corn cake app with onion jam and shaved squash=fantastic! We then shared the \'Big Ass Steak\' with scallop potatoes. Equally fantastic. An enormous T-bone cooked just right:) at least 2" thick!Had two Mezcal cocktails with my dinner.  Good, strong drinks with old fashioned big ass ice cubes. Awesome looking and tasty drink if you like Mezcal. Great joint. Wouldn\'t hesitate to come back.'
