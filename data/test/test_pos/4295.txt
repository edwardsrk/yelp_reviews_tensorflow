b'Sorry for a lack of pictures.My daughter wanted sushi, so yelp led me here.  She got her $5 California Roll and I ordered their all you can eat for $25.  Now, I\'m not competition eater, but he couldn\'t have possibly made any money off me, seriously.  I ate about five $10 rolls, my favorite being, "I need water", which was spicy but not too spicy.  I had some specialty dishes that were fried, "monkey brains", being my favorite and I also had some sashimi.  All the dishes have less rice then what I\'m use to.  It really allowed me to taste more of the flavors and not just get filled up with rice.I had my camera with me, with the best of intentions, but everything looked and tasted so good, that I couldn\'t wait to just dig in.  Most of the sushi places I have been to, all taste the same, with very few standouts.  To some degree, we want a California Roll to taste the same, but I have been looking for more flavor for quite some time.  I found it here.  I\'m hoping he\'ll still be in business the next time I\'m in town, because I would like to be back.  My fear is that he\'ll continue to lose money by people like me...'
