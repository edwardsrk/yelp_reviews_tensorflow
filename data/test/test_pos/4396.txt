b"By far the best experience I've ever had! I deal with a lot of pain (neck, shoulders, back...and Fibromyalgia)...and my job is very physical (OT). I had come to him after nearly 2 months of progressive debility, with 5 days of barely walking.  I felt like my world was falling apart! All the things I've loved to do seemed like they were quickly fading away. Since acupuncture worked well in the past I thought I would try again...and I am so glad!! Ron takes a thorough evaluation, attentively listens, and gets right to work. Not only did he deal with the neck and back, but migraine issues as well. Though it took approximately 90 minutes(first session)  I was so relaxed that it truly seemed like 3 hours....and I walked out WITHOUT limping! To top everything off, he has a sliding scale fee so everyone can afford treatment. This is a practitioner of outstanding quality and has passion for his craft. As a therapist,( and client) I would encourage a session...or 2 or more!"
