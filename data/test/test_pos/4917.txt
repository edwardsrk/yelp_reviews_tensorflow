b'Das frank rocks! So supper nice. Made me feel way less anxious. I took my art to 6 artests, he was the only one that didnt try to change it. Actualy the tat came out beter than the immage. More crisp and clear and saturated in color. Im verry pleased. Im coverd in tats, and this was my favorite experience :) o, i got there early and saw him finishing up the previous dudes art. I was jellous. Dude can tat!'
