b"This place is fun!  The staff are friendly and easy going.  Loved that our waitress have some good menu suggestions and was very attentive ... Service was A+  tried the pulled pork tacos with a side salad.  Loved all of it.  There are two tacos and if you are hungry or have a large appetite ... This meal won't suffice.  My friend ordered the vegetarian burrito and she said it was delicious and really really filling.  The patio was open and it was a great night to relax and enjoy the weather.  The hot sauce (made by the restaurant) was really really good!  Will return."
