b"I've only experienced the Tempest bar. With limited time in Madison, I had a list of places friends suggested I go, and I tried to cram them all in my short trip. What I can say is that every dish I saw looked delicious (I did sneak some tastes), and I'd happily return to eat a proper meal. As a business traveler that frequents solo dining experiences, I can say that the team at Tempest was awesome. All were incredibly friendly and quite amusing. The bar, led by Nick that night, was entertaining (pony up at the bar and you'll be happy). He's a great mixologist, taught me how to peel a lemon as a garnish, and we all tried some new concoctions.  I highly recommend stopping in. My girlfriend gave a great recommendation and it's worth passing on."
