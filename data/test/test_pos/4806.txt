b"We went to Bowl of Pho for Father's Day, and we had a great experience.  The staff was extremely professional and courteous.  We had two small children, and they were very accomodating.  The traditional chicken noodle soup is awesome, and the appetizer sandwich was one of the best sandwiches that we've tried in a long time.  Overall, great experience and will return!"
