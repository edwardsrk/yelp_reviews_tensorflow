b"We've been going to the restaurant for 6 years and year after year it gets better and better. The staff is very accommodating, the New menu is very good, the BBQ Salmon and French Onion soup is awesome!  I've used there catering service for several events most recently a Christmas party and everyone raved about the appetizers.  I shouldn't be commenting on desserts because I don't need them but there desserts are amazing!"
