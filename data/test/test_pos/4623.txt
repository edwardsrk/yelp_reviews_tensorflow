b"Only the best brownie on Earth.  I stopped in because I saw the now open sign and figured I'd support a new business in the area.  Everything looked amazing so I ordered my mainstay, chocolate brownie and I am not sure how to describe it but if you can envision a brownie and a hunk of fudge having a baked good baby, this is it.  Not that light crumbly thing that some pass off as a brownie, this was a big ol hunk of wonderful thick chocolaty, moist, amazingness the likes of which I have never tasted.  Please don't tell my trainer I stopped in here cause he'd make me work more but this is worth it.  My trainer says that you should absolutely love your food and use it as a special treat rather than the norm, well, I found my cheat day brownie for reals.  And, they use organic ingredients.  How amazing..."
