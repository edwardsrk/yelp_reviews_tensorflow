b"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pmish and didn't realize they close at 2p. We managed to get a table but had to wait for about 20 minutes or so.My girlfriend and I ordered a lot of food to try different things. Everyone said to order the waffle dogs so we did. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my friend ordered the brioche french toast. We could tell our waiter was in a bad mood so we made it our goal to put a smile on his face. After being nice to him, we managed to get him to smile and service was much better afterwards.The coffee was just OK nothing spectacular. The best thing I ordered was the SWEET POTATO TOTS."
