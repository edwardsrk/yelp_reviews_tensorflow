b"This place is tucked in a plaza on Clark. The inside is a small convenience store, but the larger part in the kitchen that makes insanely good burritos. Eff Chipotle, this place is waaay better. Their menu isn't limited to chicken, steak, pork, beef, or veggie burritos and tacos, they also have corned beef, shawarma, gyros, Polish boys, and burgers. The burrito was HUUUUGE and supafly delicious. Delicious food and friendly staff means I'll be back. Yay local business!!"
