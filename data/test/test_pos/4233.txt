b"We are new to the Cleveland area and Chinato is one of the reasons we LOVE our new hometown.  I was staying at a hotel downtown and would walk to 4th street on most nights to eat dinner.  Once I discovered Chinato, my husband and I ate there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is refined and modern but not stuffy and service at the bar is about the best you'll find anywhere.  John is the BEST!  The crudos are DIVINE, the cheese course is a DELIGHT (especially the way it's served) and the pastas are FANTASTIC.  There is a wonderful food scene in Cleveland and Kack Bruell is a key part of it.  A must!!!"
