b"Hired a 3 man crew for my 1600 sq ft house. Guys came on time and worked tirelessly in 90+ degree weather, only stopping for a quick lunch break. They we're very nice and they carefully got all my furniture in the house and set a lot of it up too. I really appreciated when they brought my fridge and treadmill in my house and had to be very creative yet careful when moving these large objects in tight spots. Best of all their rate was far and away the cheapest I found. Would definitely recommend these guys."
