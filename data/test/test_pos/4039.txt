b'Booking the appointment was a bit of a challenge, but in this location everyone was really 100% professional and friendly. The lady at the front desk managed to reschedule my appointment in a way that was more convenient for me. They took me on time (no waiting whatsoever) and the technician was very friendly, professional and patient. Thanks for making this as easy as possible for me.'
