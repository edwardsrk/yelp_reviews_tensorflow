b"Who would've thought a hot dog place would be so good?!? Not me, that's for sure! This place is simply great - hotdogs are not just for baseball games anymore and there are so many options - not just hotdogs, there's something here for everyone! I will say, I was surprised to see the line so long on a Sunday afternoon but definitely worth the wait."
