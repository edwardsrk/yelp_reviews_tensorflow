b"I love sea food and I loved the Angry Crab Shack.  Wife and I came in for a date night using a gift certificate and tried a bag with 2 pounds of crab, a grilled meat platter for 2 and an appetizer of gator bites.  I'm glad that the waitress explained that when you add spice to the bag hot means hot.  We ordered mild and that had me sweating a bit.  Everything was so good.  I will definitely return."
