b'Excellent place for real Italian food!!!If you are looking for a REAL Italian family style restaurant, this is THE PLACE!!!The setting is like being in Italy. You will love the atmosphere. Great experience.  This is the best place we have been in Las Vegas. The service was perfect!! We made a reservation and had to queue only for 3 minutes, when the restaurant was flooded by customers arriving from everywhere. We had the pasta which is unique, a sublime pizza, an amazing tiramis\xc3\xb9 and cannoli (The list of pastries is delicious) and as we were really happy with the table we got, we decide to get an Italian red wine Chianti.Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Thank you Ninni, Pasquale and Milena.I wish you al the best!!'
