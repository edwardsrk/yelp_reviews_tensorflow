b"Food is amazing! I ordered the Gyoza (chicken, $4+ tax), and Tonkotsu Ramen ($8.50+ tax). Broth was great, as well as the gyoza. Definitely would recommend, came around 8PM on a Sunday night and wasn't too busy. Noticed that their hours on google said they were closed, however I believe the hours on yelp are correct. You can call them to verify! Very nice staff, a lot bigger than most ramen places I've been to in town. More tables (7-8) and more space at the bar (9-10). So good! Definitely would recommend."
