b"I took my mother here when she was in town, as she was on a strict diet and could only eat very bland foods.  The kitchen staff was very accommodating in preparing her dish as requested, even though it clearly upset the chef in letting the dish leave the kitchen as it was.  My meal was fantastic, and not bland at all.  We ended up going back the next day for another meal there, and I was just as happy with another meal there.  I've been back once or twice since and have not had a bad visit.  Highly recommended."
