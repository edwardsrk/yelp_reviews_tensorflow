b"During weekday 12-4PM, It is only $23.  You don't get desert.  We went there on a Thursday.  It wasn't too crowded, we get very good service.Good selection of seafood items and vegetables.  I like the lamb,  it tasted good but a bit tough.  The soap base is just OK, but not as good as the ones at the Noodle place in Gold Coast Casino.  They charge $17 for the lamb Shabu already.  It makes this place a good deal for $23 weekdays.We went to the Rio Seafood buffet on Sunday and it was $45.  So again , it is a pretty good deal if you like seafood and go for lunch on weekdays.I highly recommend this place for shabu on weekday lunch only for $23."
