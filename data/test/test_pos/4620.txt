b'Room is large. We booked last minute online & got a good deal. Clean. Smells a little but whatever.  The bed is bouncy and comfy and the pillows are awesome. The shower pressure is great! And breakfast is amazing. Special thanks to the wonderful Sarjit for helping me accommodate my special needs at breakfast (I have weird allergies). You made my morning great before a long day of driving and snack foods in the car.'
