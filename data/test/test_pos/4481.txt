b'One of the must hit places in dt K-town (bloor and christie)! Have been coming here since middle school and their walnut cakes are always served fresh! Walnut cakes come in 3 traditional flavours: red-bean, mashed potato with walnut, and mashed potato with almonds. You can ask the server to separate and mark the flavours if you are buying assorted. Fairly fast service with friendly servers that can speak fluent English. The owners should seriously consider expanding its store operations.'
