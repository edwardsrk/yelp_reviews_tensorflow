b"I finally had the chance to try this restaurant out. What an amazing time I had. Service was top notch and friendly. The food was incredible! I started with the Heirloom Tomatoes appetizer which was the best decision I have ever had when it comes to tomatoes. I can't believe how amazing this tasted. Symphony of flavors! Virgin olive oil, sea salt, mint leaves,etc. Oh wow!My main course with the chicken dish and it did not disappoint. You get almost a half chicken with corn done four different ways with whipped potatoes. Incredible.The ambiance and decor is amazing too - hence the higher price point because, well, Trump. Haha!I can't wait go to back!"
