b'This is an easy review to write; These guys are pro\'s. After some clumsiness at finding which service rep would check me in, I met Don Pagel, who is the foundation of the repair department. I needed some repairs done on my Silverado diesel, and gave Don a comprehensive list. He called the next morning with the list broken down bit by bit. When I explained I\'d hoped to have the truck back in 3 days, he expressed that while he could probably do it, it wouldn\'t be as thorough as he\'d like and would I accept the offer of a rental car at their expense, so they could do a thorough and clean job. They gave me a rental car, Eli was terrific to deal with. Throughout the next four days, Don emailed me each day with progress, and overall sharing that they were on-schedule. This guy is a complete pro from start to finish.On pickup, he made the rental return as easy as "didja scratch it?", a quick walkaround, check of the fuel, and gave me the keys to my truck. My truck had been washed (I kinda wish they\'d detailed the interior, it was quite dirty but also disorganized and I can\'t blame them for attacking this mess). Then, Don followed up with an email, and this morning followed up with a phone call. My experience at this Findlay property was in such contrast to my experience with their RV lot, I simply needed to share.You can read about my RV experience at: https://www.yelp.com/biz/findlay-rv-las-vegas?hrid=8BMTgU2mXlFOEhle3rMxKAWith people like Don Pagel, it\'s no wonder that the vast majority of the reviews for Findlay Chev on this site are stellar.Thank you Findlay. We\'ll almost assuredly be purchasing from you next time, too!'
