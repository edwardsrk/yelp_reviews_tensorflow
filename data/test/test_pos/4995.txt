b"Yum... Need I say more! Normally my wife and I split a meal but at Haji Baba we don't because it's more fun to share! Not the typical type of food found in the valley a real hidden gem. What it lacks in the decor and atmosphere it makes up for in flavor and price... I highly recommend this place!"
