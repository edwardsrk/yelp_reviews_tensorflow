b"I travel and always drop-in every chance I get.  Veni Vidi Vici is a great box!  :-)Everyone made me feel like part of the family as if I had been there forever, very welcoming and their drop-in policy is fantastic. Great staff, great members, great WOD's....I travel to Vegas at least once a year and I will return to Veni Vidi Vici!And if you are a local, try this place...you will absolutely love it and you will become part of their family on your first visit!"
