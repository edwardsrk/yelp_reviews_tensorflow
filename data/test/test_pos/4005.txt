b'I had some pictures on my phone and thought it would be fun to print some if them. The Fotobar staff was very helpful. We sat at a computer and step by step it walks you through downloading pictures to their service, editing them and putting text at the bottom. I had 16 photos printed and it took about 10 minutes to get the text that my order was ready. We were very surprised by the quality of the print. Not like old fashioned Polaroids at all, these are printed on heavy photo board stock. You can print pics from your phone or iPad, Facebook, Instagram, or internet. And once you create an account you can order online! We were very impressed!'
