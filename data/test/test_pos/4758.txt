b'The smell outside draws you in. Our server Amer was very friendly  and did a great job helping us decide with some samples.  The menu was easy to read and the steak and chicken werr fresh. I do recommend on the steak that you ask to have it chopped up small in case you get tendon.  Lots of value for $8 burrito, and could have shared. Will be back for sure.'
