b"This is a good location for kids to play. I'm giving it 4.5 Stars because there isn't a parking lot and the place is not fully finish renovated yet. We brought our two boys they had so much fun with the splash pads, my first time going there using the splash pads (one of the advantage in the parks in Canada). I like it because in the heat of the sun there's always a good shade where you can stay when it gets too hot for you. The cold water in the splash pad helps to cool you down in this summer heat. Our toddler enjoyed running around with his water bucket along with the other kids there while I let his baby brother dips his toes in the paddles watching them run around. We moved to the playground beside it after a little while, it's a good playground too except they removed the sand in it and change it into playmat floors."
