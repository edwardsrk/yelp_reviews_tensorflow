b"La Panth\xc3\xa8re Verte is my veggie go-to place for delicious and very reasonably priced food in a chilled,welcoming atmosph\xc3\xa8re. Everyone I've taken there has really liked it too.The menu is not big and is limited to sandwiches, soups and salads, plus a few smoothies . But everything they do here they do WELL, the pitta's are stuffed full...my favorite is the BBQ tofu which has huge chunks of tofu in it . The salads are also really good and you can get a large plate with a mixture of a few different ones which is nice...They also have a bar at this location which is cool and rare for a veggie cafe like this, a beer goes perfectly with the pittas !"
