b'Went here with my mother and stepfather. Atmosphere was nice and quiet.Our food was incredible. Mothers steak was perfectly cooked medium rare as she ordered it, and her and my stepfather\'s vegetables were cooked just right.I had the "Chicken Southern", which was penne pasta with peppers in a spiced sauce. It tasted incredible.We paid $90 which I think was worth the meal.'
