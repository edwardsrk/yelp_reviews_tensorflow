b'Well I ordered from here again and it was great!!!!!Boyfriend tried the Oh no roll 2!  He said it was excellent! He really liked the  fried soft shell crab on it.For the first time we tried the Mexican roll... It really tasted like a Mexican! A little bell pepper kind of light jalape\xc3\xb1o. Was really good! The crab they use it very good! Most places use imitation crab, not sure if they do, either way its pretty good.Crab rangoon has great wonton crisp. Nice and thick, not oily.I love their Philadelphia Roll, but I get it with shrimp instead of salmon. The BEST! The avocado roll should be called The Green Marshmallow,( so fluffy)  I think its the best avocado roll in vegas... Its so simple but packed with avocado! Young man took my order he was very friendly and got my order perfect!Once again the wasabi was disgusting but I have my own. I learned from the last times.'
