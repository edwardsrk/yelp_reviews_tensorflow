b"I have never written a review because I can be quite critical, but I felt compelled this time due the excellent food and service that we experienced.  The food and sauces were just as good as how my Mom would make it.  The portions are sizable, and there is a great balance of the new and old with regards to the decor and the cuisine.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want a friendly, relaxed atmosphere to enjoy for a quick meal or a nice sit down family meal.  In fact, my daughter felt so relaxed that she couldn't resist the urge to prop her feet up and enjoy!  Last but not least: please note at how the owners even come out to greet us.  I would give this place 10 stars if I could."
