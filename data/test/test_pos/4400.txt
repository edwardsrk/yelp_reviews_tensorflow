b"Today was my first time at Naked BBQ, and I can gladly say that it won't be my last. The chopped brisket sandwich is amazing!! Seriously... You need to try it!!Wayne was such a great help! He was very well-mannered and took the time to ask how the meal and experience was. He definitely made the experience better. The pi\xc3\xa8ce de r\xc3\xa9sistance, however, had to be the BBQ sauce. It was so good, I had to go and buy my own bottle. I'll be back again real soon!"
