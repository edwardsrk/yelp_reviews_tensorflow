b"I went to see Denise today, after a lash disaster at Beyond Beauty Lashes, and she did an amazing job. She kept apologizing for the uncomfortable removal that was due to the other salon gluing the lashes close to my skin as well as the massive clumping she had to work through one by one. Denise was so nice and really took care in the removal and application of my new lashes and I love them! CLL is well worth the money to go and get a professional that knows what they're doing to apply your lashes. Beware of the fakes. I had to learn the hard way before coming to my senses and going to CLL."
