b"I used this company in 2011 to paint my entire house inside and out and was absolutely pleased with the men and the work done. In 2014, I had moved and needed some painting done in the new house. The work wasn't done very well, walls weren't completely painted, and a lot of paint splatters were left in the rooms. These were a different group of painters, not any of the ones we had on the first project. Today, an appointment was made by the office personnel to meet my husband at a specific time for another estimate. My husband left work early, to make the appointment time, and Mike never showed up, called, or contacted us in any way. Question: has this company gotten so big, they no longer care about their customers, and repeat customers at that?The above proved to be a miscommunication. Crash of Rhinos owner has resolved the problem, and has gone above and beyond to provide the excellent service he has always been known for."
