b"So I may be biased a bit. I am a teacher at CorePower and btw I am in my 40's. I tend to practice and teach at night, though I do come on the weekends as well. So first and foremost the clientele is all different ages, I love this and we strive hard to create a true community. We offer 4 different types of classes majority of which are 60 minutes, 3 out of the 4 are heated and 3 out of the 4 are sequenced. I first came to my yoga mat in Denver at CorePower, upon moving back to Arizona I could not find a comparable format or studio. So I made due and traveled a lot around the valley.  We have been open since September of 2015 and while we do have clientele from ASU, we also have a Tempe studio opening up this Month (March 2016) right across from ASU. Guess what you get your first week free, no other studio does that. Trust me I know (remember above the traveling I talked about).  With that being said come give it a try and hey guess what when you join one CorePower you can use them all. Oh we have showers (3 for women and a couple for the men), free supplies (like mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, deodorant, hair ties) and towels, water, mats, clothing if you need them. We also offer challenges that motivate."
