b'What a great place! Love the food and the atmosphere! I was in last Friday and although it was packed due to Phoenix Comicon, a Dbacks game, the Phoeinix Symphony and first Friday...  We got a table in the bar, had attentive service and made it out just in time to make it to the Phoenix Symphony for our show! My boyfriend and I went in yesterday to enjoy some drinks and appetizers for the afternoon and had a wonderful time again! Lauren was our server and she was fabulous! Again attentive and made sure we had everything we needed! I will definitely be back!'
