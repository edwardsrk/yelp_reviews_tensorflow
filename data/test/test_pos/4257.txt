b"One of the best Italian restaurants in a city that has several. A BYOB restaurant tucked away on the working class side of Mt Washington serving delicious homemade Italian classics. Brought my family here when they were in town to visit and everyone came away satisfied. I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should."
