b"Dianne was really fantastic for my daughter's sixth birthday party.  It was a butterfly theme and she gave the children gorgeous full face butterfly and garden designs.  The children looked amazing and were so excited.  She is very talented and I'm very pleased with her service.  I would definitely recommend her to anyone looking for a face painter!"
