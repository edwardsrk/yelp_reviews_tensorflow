b"This place has excellent tacos.  The prices are great for the quality and quantity of meat per taco.  The asada tastes great and free of gristle.  The pastor is great.  The tripa is nice and crispy.  The lengua and cabeza tacos also excellent.  I've also tried the chicharron gordita.  Everything that I have tried was great.  The salsa bar could have more options.  I've ordered take out and received salsas that were not at the salsa bar.  I would go back and recommend it to anyone looking for authentic tacos.  It's surprising to find it so hidden away in a residential neighborhood.  If they were on a main road, they'd be super busy."
