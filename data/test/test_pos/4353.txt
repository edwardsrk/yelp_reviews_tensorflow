b"It had never crossed my mind to use a car transportation service when I going to move! Instead, I was going to try to find someone to drive my car and transport it for me to my new location. When I thought about it, I felt like it was going to be such a hassle and I would feel bad asking someone to make a long drive for me. Thankfully my cousin told me there were companies that actually transport cars so I searched around my area for transportation service and found Pheonix Auto Shipping. I was hoping the workers wouldn't be awkward and I was very happy once I met them. They were very nice, they loaded my Range Rover and Escalade (two very big cars) professionally and I felt comfortable allowing them to transport my cars. Thanks for all the help guys!"
