b"Had an appointment for an eye checkup and to get my first pair of glasses in over a decade, and they couldn't have really made it more painless.  Dr. Jordan was professional, knowledgable, and most importantly - personable.  They got me in quick with no hassle and I didn't have to wait very long at all.  Jen was great in helping me select and set up the frames that fit my needs!  I look forward to continuing to go to them for all my future optical needs, barring that I don't wake up one day with super vision :-)"
