b'Wayne at the Front Desk is soo helpful and kind. My family stayed here for my graduation this past weekend, and having a bunch of reservations, he was able to help us out and get everyone nearby. He was so friendly the whole time and my family felt welcomed. The rooms are very nice, newly renovated, we used the business center to print boarding passes and it worked well. Beds were comfortable and the complimentary breakfast was also nice! Thanks so much Wayne for all of your help!'
