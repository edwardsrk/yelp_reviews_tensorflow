b'This is our 1st time at any of the Mastro\'s restaurants.  We have family & friends in the Vegas area who recommended & accompanied this as a truly upscale & 4-to-5 star dining experience.  They were correct!  Upon being seated practically in the center of their 60 ft teak or mahogany simulated Treehouse, we asked the very crisply uniformed Captain to recommend the appetizers.  He had us create our own "Seafood Tower" and we chose crab claws, shrimp, oysters & calamari... delish!  The Lobster Bisque, Clam Chowder & Iceberg Wedge were next.  The five of us then shared a Filet, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Salmon & Scallops with Garlic Mashed Potatoes.  Our Captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.Now.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the Mastro\'s Butter Cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  Needless to say & in keeping with my "positively outrageously" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy Mastro\'s if you\'re in Vegas!'
