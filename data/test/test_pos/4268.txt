b"There is no way you can beat this price for this much food, and extremely delicious food at that. The molcajete can easily feed 2 or 3 people. I don't speak much Spanish, but that doesn't matter. I still found the atmosphere friendly and welcoming. The wait staff is always accomodating. The traveling-through vendors are quite non-threatening, and immediately leave if the police come in to eat :)"
