b"This place was totally worth the drive. It's an enormous store with many quality brands. I have problem feet, and I found what I needed at the Shoe Box: a huge selection and a friendly, experienced salesperson who could scan the shelves and quickly identify exactly which models were most likely to work for me. I should add that I showed up less than 1 hour prior to closing on a weekday, which helped... there were a ton of salespeople and very few customers at that time, so it was a great time to shop.This is not the most fashionable store, but it isn't bad... for women they carry a lot of brands including all the athletic brands, plus Keen, Clarks, Naturalizer, Born, and most of the other comfortable/healthy women's shoe brands. I didn't try the Bargain Room but the regular section prices are about what you would expect elsewhere. If you want super cheap shoes, go to DSW. If you want quality, selection, and service... especially if you have hard-to-fit feet, come here."
