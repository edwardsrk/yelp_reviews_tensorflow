b"The best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas !!! I love the shrimp cocktail , the carne asada burrito, carne asada sopes, enchiladas , camarones ala diabla , the three different salsas, and the fresh cucumbers to munch on while you wait for your food. It's very clean and the staff are very friendly . I never have to wait a long time for my food. Everything is freshly cooked and very tasty :) if your looking for some real Mexican food, go here! Trust me you won't be disappointed . I've been to a few different places and they charge like crazy but here they have good reasonable prices . There is a lot of parking space so you won't have to be driving around looking for a parking space."
