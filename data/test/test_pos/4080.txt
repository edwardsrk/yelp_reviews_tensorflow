b"I've been looking for a new deli ever since my previous favorite closed; I've been ever so lucky to have found this place. The family owned deli is a gem in a city of coal. Their customer service is outstanding especially in reference to their first time customer routine where the give you samples of their popular sandwiches. The prices are fair especially considering their portion size is equivalent to two. If you're looking for good food & a respectable loving family environment, look no further."
