b"Denise is incredible! I've never had a Brazilian blow out before, and after researching it, I knew it was something I needed for my overly dyed, heat damaged hair. I'm so glad I drove to Tempe to Denise's business, because my hair is the softest, shiniest, and TAMEST it has ever been in my life! She doesn't push a sale of the products at all, and she even trimmed the unevenness in the back of my hair. She is welcoming, kind, and the service she provides is true sorcery. On top of this, the price is very modest; I'd read online that I could expect to pay $150-$300 at a salon for this service, but she charges a flat rate of $120 regardless of how thick/long your hair is. Truly amazing, if you feel like treating yourself to the smoothest hair of your life, give Denise a try!"
