b"This was best Korean BBQ I've ever tasted and the service was probably the best service I've ever had. The only problem with this restaurant is they don't take reservations and the wait, they take your number down and call you later, so if you come late night you might be waiting for awhile. Other than that the meat quality was perfect and try all of the side dishes because they compliment the meat very well. This is my new favorite place."
