b'I came across Modern Tortilla at the food truck event in front of the chef store in tempe and I can say I am glad that I did. The food was very different from any other taco truck, and different in a really good way. Everything looked brand new and clean, the team was smiling and seemed to enjoy their work. I saved the best part for last, the food, absolutely amazing! I had the pork tacos followed by their real deal churros, which I can assure you were the real deal and delicious! I will be eating here again next time they are in Tempe.'
