b'This is like fast food for hippies.  I was staying down the street and after my first time here, I made it my goal to try everything on the menu.I feel wonderful after eating here and don\'t want to eat anywhere else.  I wish a Flower Child replaced every Applebees and TJI Fridays because I don\'t think there will be a flower child when I go back home.  The meals are balanced and although they look heavy, they make me feel light.  Quick, simple and no nonsense, great environment, and what looks like Paleo food with vegan/vegetarian base and optional added protein that includes chicken, salmon, grass-fed beef and whatever else.  Probably my favorite place to eat now.  I love it here.Nobody is "waiting" on you, you refill your own drinks and can get your own utensils, you can even study or read before or after eating here.  Plenty of outside seating too.  I love it (again).'
