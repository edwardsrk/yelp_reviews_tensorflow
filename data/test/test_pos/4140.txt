b"Phenomenal company! I had a plumbing disaster in my home that resulted in an insurance claim and a ton of work restoring my home. I couldn't have been happier with my insurance company's preferred vendor which is of course VBS. They were really the only people I trusted in the entire process. That was huge to me. On top of that, they also did some absolutely fine work. As anyone that's restored a home knows, the process is long and can be arduous with a ton of emotional investment because it is your home. The professionals with VBS are patient and understanding. They work closely with you, and you never leave a conversation feeling uncomfortable. They also only hire top employees. Not only did I trust everyone wearing a VBS shirt - I really ended up liking each one of them. And finally, my wife is a perfectionist. Their work pleased her which is close to impossible! And she wants to hire the same crew to comeback and help with future projects. I have absolutely no recommendations on how VBS can improve because they are top notch."
