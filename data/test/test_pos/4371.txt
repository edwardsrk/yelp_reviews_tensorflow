b"I came here on the spur of a moment invitation. When you first walk in the spa it is already calming with a very nice reception area. They have lockers for your things and give you a comfy robe-slippers.I was receiving the 80 min jasmine flower detox & massage. Brandi was my therapist & she was amazing!!! The detox wrap smelt wonderful and really felt as though it was getting the toxins out. I showered and then it was massage time. I have been looking for a good massage for sometime & only wish she worked in Atlanta!!! I was very specific in what I wanted and she liked that. She gave me good deep pressure in my traps and problem areas, but lighter pressure in the less tense areas. I would recommend her to anyone & will definitely see her whenever I'm in Vegas!!!"
