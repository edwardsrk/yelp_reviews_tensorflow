b"after 6 yrs in Charlotte finally made it in & it was worth every minute of the wait!  I had the ahi tuna watermon tacos & the ramen.  Simply oh la la!!  can't add any more to what everyone else has said to this marvelous place except create a phone in waiting list, accept reservations, & when is a bigger location to be opening & another location in the Ballantyne area."
