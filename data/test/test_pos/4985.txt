b"I absolutely love this place atmosphere, people, classes, and vibe! I first came here a few months ago with my boyfriend tried the week of free classes deal and fell in love! I am a student at UnLV and they have a great deal for students! Not only very affordable but so close to my home! No more community showers at the school, Trufusion has such a clean facility. Very impressive. The classes I take on a regular basis include hot Pilates and sculpt, trufusion 60 & 75, and my absolute favorite yin with Zeeky! He is seriously the best yoga teacher I have come across, unbelievably friendly, motivational, passionate about yoga, and his students.  He takes the time out of class to help anyone who needs it. He fills the room with a fun, calming, and welcoming energy. I couldn't ask for a better teacher. Thank you Trufusion for showing me yoga and it is truly changing my life."
