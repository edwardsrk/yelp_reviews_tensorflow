b"I've lived at Cortina for two years and absolutely love it! After first visiting with the friendly, professional staff and touring the beautiful property, I knew my search was over. The pools and grounds are picturesque and very clean, which was important to me when selecting my home. I frequently use the 24/hr fitness facility, which has several machines (both cardio and weight) as well as free weights. The apartments themselves are well kept with updated appliances, and the maintenance services are very prompt.I feel like I really lucked out when I found this place. It looks like a resort that I get to call home. :)"
