b'When I look at reviews on yelp I always make sure to look at the age of the reviews when they are negative. Obviously they have gotten rid of whoever was terrible in the past because the people they have now rocks. Jennifer was very kind and very caring and was able to fit me in when I needed it. When I showed up I was a bit frantic since I thought that I was going to be late from this crazy traffic. she got me a bottle of of needed water. Top-notch customer service will be back for sure thanks Jennifer and Ismile for making me smile!'
