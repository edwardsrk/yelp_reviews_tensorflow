b'We visited several dealerships before we felt comfortable. Moore offered us outstanding service with knowledgeable associates. Wally & Steve did an excellent job finding what we wanted at a great price! They both went above and beyond our expectations to ensure a positive buying experience. Wally was so friendly and always called us by name. (Our names are often mixed up, but Wally never made that mistake. I appreciate his attention to detail.) He listened to what we wanted, and he was so willing to spend the time showing us all our options. Steve was absolutely amazing! He was honest and transparent. He made us feel like friends, and we quickly trusted his thoughts and opinions. This was a tremendous help for us to weigh all options. The made the whole process enjoyable and stress-free. We are so grateful for their help through his car-buying experience! We are so happy with our new Jeep Wrangler!'
