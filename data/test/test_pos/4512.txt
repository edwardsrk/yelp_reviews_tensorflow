b"I don't write many five star reviews.   And didn't really expect good Chinese food in such a small town.    The service is sit down cafeteria style.    You write your table's order on an order pad and pay at the front counter.   The give you a table number and bring the food right out.    Very easy and low stress way to dine, though perhaps it may confuse some.Tea and water are provided for free.   This restaurant is BYOB, and there's a nice liquor store next door.PROS:   Amazingly authentic menu!   I've lived in China and traveled there extensively, and found many of my old favorites on the menu.   (A Chinese menu is posted on the wall with item numbers that correspond to the English language menus.)    I got to enjoy food I've haven't had in years and never thought I'd find in the US -- great stuff from several regions of China.    I also enjoyed some items that I hadn't had before, or had enjoyed in slightly different forms.   The crispy tofu for which this restaurant is so well-known is a fun item that everyone should try.   The pork bun is amazing!  Well-seasoned fatty deliciousness.    So many items to try.   I wish I lived in the area.CONS:   None at all.   I hope this place never changes."
