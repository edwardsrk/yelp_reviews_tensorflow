b"My husband and I stopped here because no other restaurant was open on a Sunday in the area. We have never tried Vietnamese but after reading all the great reviews on yelp we gave it a try! The reviews were spot on with this place, it was so good! We had the fried tofu first and it was awesome. We both ordered the #88 mine with beef my husband had chicken. We also had tofu fried rice. All the food was delicious and very home made tasting. We loved our meal and the owner was so sweet! We don't live in the area but hope to come back and try different menu items!"
