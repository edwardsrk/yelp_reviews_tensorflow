b"We came in after seeing great reviews on Yelp; after stuffing my face with hot, juicy crawfish, I felt another review was deserved!The service was friendly, upbeat, and swift.  The room has a nice ambience, great R&B music playing at a good volume - Enough to enjoy and groove while still carrying a conversation with my wife.  The food.  She had the Cajun Garlic Butter Salmon.  The rice was tender, the sauce was spicy - but not overbearing.  The fish was cooked masterfully.  Moist and flaky, not falling apart all over the place.The crawfish.  I got a bag with corn and sausage; spicy Louisiana style.  The heat was PERFECT.  It was hot, but I never had to stop and sit because my mouth was on fire.  Many places struggle to find the delicate balance between flavor and heat, but that struggle was nowhere to be found here.  The sausage was tender, boiled in the same juices.  The crawfish pinched apart beautifully, the tail meat came out in one smooth piece, and of course, the head!  Sweet and savory, soft and buttery.. All around, one of the more fun and vibrant restaurants I've been to!"
