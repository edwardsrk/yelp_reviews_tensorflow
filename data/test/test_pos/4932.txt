b'Great prices and caring staff. I had a faux suede purse that I took to their store to clean. Man oh man they did a great job. It needed a soft handas it is faux suede and the color was intact. Before cleaning it the owner and myself made sure it was a faux suede (it was stretchy) as to not damage the purse. Very nice customer service and great prices. Thank you'
