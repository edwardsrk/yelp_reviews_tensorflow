b"This is one of the best seafood places in Madison. The ambiance is swanky but still relaxed and there's plenty of room at the bar. I've been a few times, once on NYE, once on a Tuesday, and once for restaurant week. All three times the food has been excellent, and I especially recommend the tower options, and soft shell crab when they have them! I would highly recommend making reservations for busy events or if you have a large party. Or, you can grab some grub at the bar! Cocktail menu is .... Different. Ended up with a jalape\xc3\xb1o tequila because I skipped the jalape\xc3\xb1o part so read the happy hour menu carefully! On that note, the servers I've had have always known which wine to pair with you dish."
