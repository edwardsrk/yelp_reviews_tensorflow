b"Great Nail Place! It's very rare that you find a nail salon with great customer service! This place has it all... super friendly staff,  great color choices, and awesome designs!I booked an appointment with Tina based on the other Yelp reviews and she did not disappoint! She's extremely talented and takes her time to ensure she does a good job. I will definitely come back (already have next appointment scheduled)! Keep doing what you are doing! Thank you!!!!"
