b"I stopped in for their notorious Tuesday $5 burger and although my stay was considerably short, it was pleasant and I left with a full stomach and nothing to complain about.They give you your choice of five or so burgers at that price, and they come with fries. That's a smoking deal, and the burger was actually very good too. I sat at the bar, since I dropped in by myself, and all three bartenders were nice and asked several times if I needed anything and if everything was okay. Tuesdays at Bar Louie are a must."
