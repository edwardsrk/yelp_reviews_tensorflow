b"Spent a long and stressful day at the hospital down the street from this location. Decided to stop at Mimi's Cafe for dinner on my way home. I walked into Mimi's in not the best of moods.... fortunately we had a wonderful waitress that was about to turn things around for me. She was very friendly, helpful and gave us amazing service. My kids loved talking to her and we ended up having a great dinner. A big thank you to Gi Gi for her service and sweet attitude."
