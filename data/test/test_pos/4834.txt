b'I have been here multiple times in the past and always loved it. Location near the public square with small sitting inside and a few tables outside is fun in summer. I like almost all of the things on menu that I have tried. There is a certain freshness to the food. Taste is pure and enjoyable. Portion size is ideal for one person, so nothing left at the end to take home!! Wait staff is very friendly and helpful with ordering if you are new. I have not tried any of their desserts but I bet its nice. I will be a regular here whenever I have to find a place to eat near public square.'
