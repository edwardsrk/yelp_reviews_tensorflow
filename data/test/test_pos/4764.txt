b"Thanks for the review Yelp. Upon entering the cute shop, there's no menu on the screen. However, there's a menu located at the front register that you can check out. There's a good flow, seems like they got their system down. There's two size on the drinks, regular and large. The honey boba was made perfect. Not too hard, the perfect kind of softness. The wait for the drinks was pretty fast."
