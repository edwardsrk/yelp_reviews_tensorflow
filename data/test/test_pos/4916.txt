b'In Champaign for a job assignment and had a day off so I wanted to drive around and find some good eats. Came upon this place V Picasso which had a sign next to it that says "We grow our own" which pretty much means farm to table. That always attracts me so I gave it a try. I had the grilled duck breast with veggies on it. The dish was very delicious but my only mistake was that I should have ask for the duck skin on the breast to be crispy for the duck fat is what makes the dish but nonetheless I loved it and it was very satisfying. Had a glass of Malbec wine to go with it and to finish off, I had an espresso and the Halva Shortbread for dessert. Many might find that the food is on the pricey side but I don\'t care. I\'ll pay to eat good and healthy especially when it\'s farm to table. The service was great as the waiter was very attentive.'
