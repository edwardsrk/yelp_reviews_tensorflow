b'We have known Dr Noorda about 15 years, and he is the most caring, professional, and kind orthodontist we could ever hope for! His staff is awesome as well.  My daughter Kristin has cerebral palsy and had an exceptional amount of orthodontic work to be done, and Dr Noorda was always patient, and kind with her and made her feel extra special, and he did an amazing job with her teeth, and she now has the most beautiful smile in the world! It is still a joy for her to come visit him when she follows up with her retainer care. Would recommend him definitely!!'
