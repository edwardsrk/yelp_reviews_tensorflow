b"Went for our 1st time and took our out of town relatives from Seattle Washington to experience what we grew up with in Chicago.  We were not disappointed one bit!! The food was just like our old family recipes!  We had the Potato pancakes with Pierogi and smoked and fresh sausage.  The sausage was just like Easter morning and all the samples of Pierogi was DELICIOUS!!  A must visit place !!  Also shopped in the deli to take a little of Poland home for later!! Please do not ever change your recipe! Can't wait to visit again!!I Would have  given more stars if available!"
