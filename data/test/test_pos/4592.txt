b'We had a mix of empenadas tamales and enchiladas as well as a bowl of the tortilla soup for lunch and they were all delicious. The green chile enchiladas had a nice creamy sauce with very nice spice. The mole sauce was amazing and had just the right sweet and spice. The empenadas were bite size and I would have loved to try more but was just too full from the rest of the meal. Be sure to finish with a sweet empenada and some ice cream.'
