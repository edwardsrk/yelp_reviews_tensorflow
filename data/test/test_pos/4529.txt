b'My ac went out on Sunday and as most of you know we broke record heat here in AZ. Through the home warranty it took until Tuesday morning to get someone out to my house. We have two kids and staying in a hotel was not fun. Everything turned around when Danny the service tech showed up to the house. He was very professional and efficient and explained to me exactly what broke and how it happened. I would highly recommend this company to anyone needing repairs. My air was fixed in less than an hour and the customer service was amazing especially considering these guys are out in the sun all day just to keep us cool! Thanks Danny and Cool Blew.'
