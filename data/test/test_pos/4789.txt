b'I have been here twice in the past few months and both times it has been excellent. The Malai Kofta was particularly good and the samosas excellent. Our service was top-notch both times, with the server frequently refilling our waters and checking on the food. The atmosphere is cozy and the staff pleasant and attentive. I highly recommend it!'
