b"I have found my new favourite restaurant in Calgary! After a girlfriend suggested Cibo for our dinner date, I admit I was less than thrilled. Although I had heard good things, a quick menu check online didn't really excite me, I found nothing to be that interesting or drool worthy. Nevertheless, there we were. We were seated upstairs at a lovely table near the bar, and I was already hooked. The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is perfect. Although it is loud (almost too loud, which would be my only complaint), it's very energetic and fun. We ordered the aranchini to share, as well as the mixed greens and the prosciutto and pineapple pizza. Everything was absolutely fantastic. We also split two desserts and each had a chocolate martini. Our server was the sweetest little thing and everything came out perfectly timed and expertly cooked. I was blown away, so I took my boyfriend back the very next week. We also shared the aranchini and mixed greens, but we had the lamb meatballs and the spaghetti for 2 meal. Once again, I was blown away by the quality of the food, service, and price! It is seriously a steal to eat here. I am absolutely in LOVE with Cibo and I will make it a point to return again and again!"
