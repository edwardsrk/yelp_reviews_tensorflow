b'After moving back to AZ a few months ago I have been to several nail salons with not one satisfying my mani or pedi needs. My friend and I just left The White Spa where she got a gel pedi and I got a mm Express Mani and Pedi. Not only were they so nice from the moment we walked in, but the provided possibly the best customer service of any nail salon that I have ever received in my entire life! Tiffany did my mani while Liz did my toenails. Jackie did my friend\'s gel pedi. They were all so nice and attentive. I asked for a touch up on the edge of my toes with polish and they were happy to do it. Normally I would be treated poorly for asking for anything other than what had already been done. Tami did the touch up for me and they actually said, "you\'re paying for this, you need to love it and have it EXACTLY the way you want it!" Definitely coming back here very often!!! They\'re all great and Jackie is hilarious! 100 stars!'
