b"Were greeted when we entered by almost every wait staff we passed, was told by the hostess to sit where ever which is fine, had a very young waitress very polite got our drink order, we opted for the buffet which was great & at a decent price $8.99, the eggs of course were liquid form but good, bacon was nice & crisp, sausage was flavorful, waffles, pancakes, French toast sticks & potatoes were awesome I just wish that they had shredded home fries, every food that was displayed was nice, hot & fresh it was replenished quickly when they saw it was getting low they didn't wait for the food to run out, the fresh fruit were great nice & sweet, the dining area & bathroom was clean...      I was told by one of the waitresses that the old owner had come back & is going to add other foods to the buffet line whatever it is I can imagine it's going to be good, the only advice I'll give is that the tongues are very hot to touch if there's someway not too have them that hot, now would I come back you bet your bottom dollar I would..."
