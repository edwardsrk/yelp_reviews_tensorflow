b"One of our favorite outdoor adventure areas in Las Vegas! Go early if you are out on the weekend because it gets busy. The visitor center is worth the stop and you might be lucky enough to see the tortoise, Mojave Max. Definitely stop at the first two stops, as they are the most interesting. There is also a great overlook worth getting out at, and even a children's hike which is less strenuous. The landscape is different at every stop, so you can see different things each time you go if you just do one stop each time and really get out to explore."
