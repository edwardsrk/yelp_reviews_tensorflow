b"Oh how I've been longing for some fried fish and all I can say is.... DELICIOUS!! Our server Mary was warm, welcoming, attentive but not intrusive. The food was seasoned appropriately, and served hot. This place was packed but yet service was on point. I can tell that the staff works as a team and that is what makes it successful.  Excellent food + excellent customer service= 5 ! I will be back!"
