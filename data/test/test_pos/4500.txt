b'Probably the best nouveau Italian place in Cleveland - the mussels with fennel were perfection.  From there was the arugula salad and col busso.... Wow!  The layers of differing flavors and the beautiful presentation, not to mention a really special wine list were just incomparable.  Reminds me of some of the better places we visited in New York and Napa.  Love you, Chinato!'
