b"First time eating here and I gotta say would definitely recommend to friends, family, strangers, etc..We came in not knowing what type of cuisine they served and our waiter came over completely ready to answer any questions/uncertainties that we had.With their Vietnamese cuisine today we ordered:-Pho Tai (?)-Spring Roll-Fresh Coconut (drink)We didn't order much since we weren't sure so we shared the meal.I enjoyed every single bite. My favorite dish is the Spring Roll and District One nailed it. Keep it up."
