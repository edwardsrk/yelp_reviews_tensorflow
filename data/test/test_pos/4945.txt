b'Love this place!We went to the later showtime.It was not packed. Plenty of seats. No bad seat in the house ^_^The cast interacted, and kept us engaged throughout.They offer snacks, adult bevies, at reasonable cost.No minimum to purchase.Tix cost varied. However, we paid 10.00 per person due to coupon code.Plenty of parking as well.'
