b"Absolutely love this place ! Every time my husband and I come in, we're always greeted by our first names. My husband and I order the same everything every time and if one of the employees makes a mistake, they always fix it before giving us our orders. The owner is so nice. His name is Sou and he has great customer service along with Jesalyn? I'm sooooo sorry if I got the name wrong but she always says hi to me and doesn't even have to ask for our order. You guys are amazing and keep up the good work"
