b"Had a late lunch here today, the service was great. He was friendly, quick, and helpful when I asked what was in the veggie pho, he went to ask the chef what's in it. The veggie pho was amazing, the best by far I've had in the Phoenix area! Flavorful, not too salty, and with fresh veggies and jalape\xc3\xb1os to go in it. My boyfriend enjoyed the shrimp spring roll things and his shrimp pho as well. We will definitely go back next time we want pho!"
