b'Possibly my favorite brunch spot in Montreal (and that\'s saying a lot). I got the legendary French toast, which is crisped to perfection with Panko crumb breading. It was very good, but more of a "fried" experience than French toast typically is. I loved the way it was accompanied by a beautiful fruit salad and a tiny smoothie!My friends and I enjoyed our experience so much that we went back again later in the week. The second time, I tried the gaufres (waffles), and they were probably the best waffles I\'ve ever had! Crisp on the outside, positively cake-like on the inside, and generously topped with with fruit. My friends also highly recommended the potatoes.'
