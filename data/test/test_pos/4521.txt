b"Yelp once again lead us to this great Indian food restaurant. The people who served us worked as a team; they were very welcoming and friendly. Our Food was delicious, chicken tiki masala and shrimp korma, which can both be made with coconut milk to avoid the dairy. Our waiters kept bringing water and it didn't  take long at all for any of the food. It was a great dining experience and the food couldn't have been better. Try this place once and like us, you're going to want to go back."
