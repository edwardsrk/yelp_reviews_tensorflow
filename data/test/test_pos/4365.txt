b'Best Thai... I feel bad that I have betrayed Thai-E-San but the yellow curry was awesome. Disappointed that they were out of mango for the sticky rice.  Also... Caught a Wild Charizard!! This is the best spot for Pokemon hunting because it is magically located between two Poke Stops. I set up two lure modules and enhanced it with an incense and waited 10 minutes for that sucker.  Also collected plenty of ultra balls and even leveled up! I would give this a 4.5 if I was able to but because the Charizard was only at 617cp :/'
