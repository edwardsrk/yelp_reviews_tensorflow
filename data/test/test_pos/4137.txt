b'This neighborhood storefront cafe has fresh and delicious sandwiches.  I had their pesto bacon sandwich-- pesto, bacon, fresh mozzarella, thick slices of tomato and arugula on multigrain bread; my wife had an equally good tuna salad sandwich. The rest of their menu looks equally delicious. Pleasant and bright atmosphere.'
