b"It's not that I'm 9 months pregnant that I was able to eat an entire pizza here, but that the pizza here is THAT good! First time trying it but will be back again (soon I hope)! Very clean place, very friendly guys helping us with how to order and very good pizza (had I mentioned that?). Many thumbs up CBP!!!"
