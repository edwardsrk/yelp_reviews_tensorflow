b"Usually cheaper fuel than QT up the street. Easy in/out with plenty of pumps. I'm a regular so staff is always friendly to me but they generally are upbeat and move quick enough to get people through the line. Wish they had a better selection of Xyience energy drinks. Overall its my go to convenience store/gas station unless I want donuts or corn dogs, then I go up the road ;)"
