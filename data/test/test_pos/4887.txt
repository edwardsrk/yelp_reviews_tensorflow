b"New location for this burger franchise by the original owner. Place is really clean and freshly remodeled. Classy for a burger joint. Modern. Extensive menu covers way more than burgers. I'm told plans are to add pizza and wings next. The food was fresh, quick, hot and delicious. My burger was cooked med to med rare. I can attest that they use quality ingredients. Fries were fresh and flavorful. Perfectly salted. Burger was pretty big. Much larger than fast food places. Staff dressed in uniform. Not sure if they always do this, but it wasn't too busy when I was here at 3pm, and they were bringing food to the tables. Drive through opening soon, and delivery... This place will be unstoppable. Great addition to downtown."
