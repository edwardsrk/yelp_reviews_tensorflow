b"Favorite thai place in Vegas!!!! A friend and I went there for the first time because we found it on yelp, and I haven't stop frequenting it since! I have tried a lot of different items of the menu and everything is delicious!!!nevertheless, I have a clear favorite, number 38!!!flat fried noodles with egg and sweet and sour sauce...to die for!!! Totally recommend this place!!"
