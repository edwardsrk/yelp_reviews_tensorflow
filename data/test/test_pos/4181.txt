b'We ate here DEC 17th 2017. The food is amazing. The dim sum is cooked just right. This is a perfect little hole in the wall spot . The owner is compassionate about her food, customers and staff, that was clear when we ate there. She answered any questions we had while we were there. On top of that they made me a birthday dessert while I was there, and sang  , you could tell that was out of the norm for them. The resturant is clean. Check it out! Also there is a Dutch Bros in the area too.'
