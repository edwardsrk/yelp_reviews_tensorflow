b"GREAT barbershop!!! Locally owned (Don is the BEST!!), professional, friendly, clean, fun environment, and they do a great job on all their services. All of these great qualities are exemplified by my barber, Chris Saunders.  He's one of the best (if not the best) barbers in all of the Valley. Only thing that rivals his cutting skills is his customer service. Make an appointment with him today, you will NOT regret it!!"
