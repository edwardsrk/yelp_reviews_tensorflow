b"Best sushi in Cleveland, hands down.  Any time I come back to Cleveland, I have to get my Pacific East fix.  Several years ago, I lived almost directly above this place and I now realize how good I had it.  I have been to their other two locations (much closer for me) but nothing beats the original.I usually keep in pretty simple with a 2 roll maki combo.  You can't beat the price and the taste is to die for.  I love their ginger salad dressing their miso is tasty.  Their standard rolls are anything but..they are quite large compared to other sushi places and always delicious.  The spicy crab roll is the stuff that dreams are made of.Living in Chicago now, there is a sushi place on every corner.  Still nothing compares to Pacific East."
