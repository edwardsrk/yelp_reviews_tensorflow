b"I love this place! You'd never think of it just driving by but it's incredibly nice on the inside and has this cool little balcony area with a killer food menu. I usually come in late at night around 2am for a night cap and when I get there it's always the greatest atmosphere and awesome music playing. Patty is usually the bartender when I come in and I couldn't ask for better service! He always has my drink ready and waiting for me before I even sit down. This has become my favorite bar to go to, mainly because of the staff! And I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Keep up the good work!!"
