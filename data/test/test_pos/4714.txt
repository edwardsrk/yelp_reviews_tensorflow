b'Not cheap, but fast, efficient, and courteous.  Called warranty company Old Republic and they sent AM/PM PLUMBING and got the run around for 2 days. 3 toilets and 2 showers with NO drainage.  In the end, called Apple Plumbing on my own.  Came out same day, Grant was courteous, on time, AND FIXED THE PROBLEM with a 75 foot line from the roof, the tech used about 65 feet of his line and AM/PM told me he couldn\'t fix it with 100 foot line (lies lies).  Just FYI -Don\'t flush Costco Kirkland "flushable" wipes, they don\'t break down.  This company was there for us and we won\'t forget it.  Thanks for your help!!!'
