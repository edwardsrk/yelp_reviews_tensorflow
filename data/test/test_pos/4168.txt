b"We've enjoyed several great meals at Gallagher's Steakhouse. This weekend we were in town with our kids and decided to meet for dinner. I went on line and made reservations and requested a table for six near the kitchen so we could see the grill. Much to our surprise we were set up at the Chef's table. The Chef visited our table and provide great suggestions which turned out to be fantastic. The steaks are by far the best we have enjoyed anywhere in Las Vegas. This may not be for everyone but we love the action and the experience of a working kitchen. The food being prepared and the aromas are so great. I highly recommend a night out and great food and service at Gallagher's."
