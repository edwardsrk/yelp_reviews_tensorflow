b"Yum Yum and Yum!  I really enjoyed my meal at Brand and every bite was delicious. I had the filet which was cooked to perfection, with the gratin potatoes which were made with a rich garlic cream.  With little notice they were able to write Happy Birthday on the plate of my guest as it was his BD. The restaurant itself was chic, modern, lowlit, hip-music and awesome wait staff. I will come back here next time I'm in Vegas..."
