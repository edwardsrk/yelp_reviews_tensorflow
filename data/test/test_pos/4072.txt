b'Lanae was a tremendous help in getting us settled in our new Scottsdale home. She has a fantastic eye and very creative and innovative ideas. She knows all of the local stores and trades people and had great tips for saving us money when possible. Most importantly, she was a great sounding board, advisor and mediator as my husband and I selected furniture and artwork. She is very good at working with couples (including those with contrasting styles!). We highly recommend her design services!'
