b"Yes! I'm officially addicted to this pizza. Honestly, the only good New York style pizza in Madison. I'm originally from New Jersey (yes, I am aware that is *not* New York) so I've missed a good thin crust.So far, the eggplant pizza is my favorite. I mean, I've liked all the ones I had. I think the ratio of the ingredients is good.I ordered a salad yesterday to pretend like I was being healthy in addition to the giant slice of pizza I was going to consume. They give a good amount of salad! The feta in the Mediterranean salad is super yummy, though on the salty side.I went there again today, after ordering delivery yesterday. I don't plan on going tomorrow, but we will see."
