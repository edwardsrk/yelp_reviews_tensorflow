b"Most outstanding gelato I've had in North America.The recipes flavors are not only very creative, they taste amazing.The indicated flavor is exactly what it will taste like, none of that artificial stuff. Being able to sample the flavors can be a good and a bad thing - because you genuinely won't be able to make a final decision .Located right on the waterfront, you're 10ft away from gorgeous views.Huge kudos. Definitely a must."
