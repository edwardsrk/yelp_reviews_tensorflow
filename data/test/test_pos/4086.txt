b"I looked for a doctor referral for several years. I went into doctor clinics, pharmacist and they all said Dr White is in her own league of truly caring for her patients. Then through several general follow up appointments with other doctors I have heard 1st hand how she has saved lives with her attention to detail. I referred her to a colleague and it sounds like she helped her with a serious illness she wasn't aware of. She doesn't just push a bunch of papers around, she's aware of her patients and cares. Her staff is amazing(Tara?) She's in patient overload and is so knowledgeable and organized."
