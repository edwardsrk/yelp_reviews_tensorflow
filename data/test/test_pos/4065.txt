b"Had a great dinner here today!!  We had an awesome seat right by the windows, which were wide open because of the beautiful weather today!  The garlic snails were yummy and the mussels and fries were to die for!  We ordered the baumande and Proven\xc3\xa7al, both were cooked to perfection!  The price is also easy on your wallet (can't beat $14 mussels and fries).  The restaurant does not serve alcohol but it allows BYOB, so our meal went well with our white wine!  Ambiance is excellent and service is unbeatable!  Our server, Anthony, is very kind, attentive and helpful!Highly recommend and would definitely return!  :)"
