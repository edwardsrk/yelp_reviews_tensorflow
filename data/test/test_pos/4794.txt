b"Called them at night and within 2 hours later they were at my house. A guy named Jose showed up. He was absolutely amazing! They charged me $99 for the service call and within minutes of getting there my system was fixed. He was very straight up with me and extremely honest. Also great prices. I'm very happy I called this guy. I will be only using them in the future for all my electrical needs. Very happy customer here."
