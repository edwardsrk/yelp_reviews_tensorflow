b'My day was centered around visiting Sweetie Fry today as I wanted to totally treat myself to a gluttonous lunch.  I had to wait until they opened (2:30) but it was no problem as I hung out at Phoneix Coffee, right down the street.  I introduced myself  to the owner, Keith and was treated to sample after sample of all of the AMAZING flavors that he had to offer.  Pumpkin flavors will certainly steal the show this time of year and his small soup pot of salted caramel should not be missed,  he took the time to put caramel onto a small spoon for me to sample.  Goat Cheese with honey and walnuts was my choice after trying everything.  My head was reeling after so many wonderful samples.  Vegan-non dairy fruit sorbets are present for some nice variety and you can tell they stand behind the perfection in each flavor!  I can only hope that the strawberry sour cream will be there the next time I visit.  The color and flavor of this one was so fresh and reminded me of strawberries that we would pick and eat at the local strawberry patch in my hometown.After enjoying a perfect basket of fries with gorgonzola cheese and tabasco sauce, I was ready to commit to a few flavors of ice cream.  What was the most refreshing thing about my visit was the enthuiaism of the owner.  He is on to something here, especially if customers are so valued as I was!'
