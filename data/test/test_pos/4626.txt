b"Yay for Restaurant Week!  This place was fantastic!  I ordered the Scallops, Filet Mignon, and Peanut Butter Bar.  All were excellent.  The Filet was cooked to medium rare and it was perfect!  The sauce it came with was amazing and the veggies were delicious.  I wish they had put more on the plate (I only got maybe 5 small wedge potatoes and 5 small asparagus) cause they were so, so good.  I wasn't thrilled with the dessert options, but I asked the waiter which dessert was his favorite, and he chose the peanut butter bar.  He was right!  That was so good.  I had a bite of the bread pudding and that was also very good.  I will have to say that I definitely preferred the peanut butter bar though. :)  The staff was very nice and organized.  We will definitely be back!"
