b"Great job!!! If your looking for a great bagel sandwich look no further. I truly like this place. Iv tried other bagel places but no other has the back east taste like kokopelli. They are very very busy in the morning so you might have a few minute wait but they say sorry for waiting which for me that's great service. Iv read other reviews that complain but iv been here plenty of times and have always had a consistent great experience. I like my eggs scrambled with cheese and they do it for me every time without charging extra. Thank you. This place is a great start for your day."
