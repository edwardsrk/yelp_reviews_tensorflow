b"It's a nice old school place but I loved it.   The service at the hotel was probably the best I've ever experienced in Vegas.  There is no casino and the Trump Hotel and it off the strip so it quieter but i really loved the energy of hotel guests and the staff.  I love many Hotels in Vegas but the is one of best if you are looking for a classy low key experience."
