b"Beth and her team are absolutely fantastic. I travel extensively and we have never used a pet sitter that isn't a very close family friend. This year, our plans didn't work out, and 5 says before Thanksgiving I reached out to Beth in desperate mode for a sitter for a 16 week old retriever puppy, 12 year old yellow lab, and tiny special needs kitty. She accepted the request, came over without much notice for the meet and greet and did a phenomenal job with a tough group of animals. She kept us updated with texts, pics and notes and we were able to enjoy the holiday without stressing. We will spread the word to as many people as we can, I highly recommend Beth and the wags in the city team!"
