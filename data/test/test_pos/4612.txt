b"I went in today to pick up a to go order and boy am I glad I found this place. I tried the Ma Po tofu and sesame chicken and it was sooooooo good, and the portions are huge. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish it. Also if you order $15 or more you get a free soda can, which was pretty neat. I highly recommend this place and cant wait to try more!"
