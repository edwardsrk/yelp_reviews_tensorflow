b"At 3 1/2 years old, Pepper came here because, although her other preschool teachers were loving people, she was bored, and didn't seem like she was learning anything. So we came to phoenix preparatory preschool. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. It is  obvious margot the owner knows what she's doing. Her curriculum and activities keep the students engaged. Whenever I drop off or pick up pepper, the kids are engaged in some activity or another. Pepper has learned how to write some of her letters already, is learning and excited by mandarin, and has come home bragging how she has tried some new food margot introduced and liked it. She enjoys puppet shows there, new songs, new dances, even Kung fu! Before when I dropped her off, she would be upset, now she looks forward to school. Also, if you care about diversity like I do, the kids here are from all backgrounds. That is a win!"
