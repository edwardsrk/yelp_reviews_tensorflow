b"This little shop is home of Waffles, glorious, fresh and hot little waffles with ice cream or whipped cream toppings for your pleasure. I've heard a lot of great things about this place but only just dropped by the other day for dessert with friends and I was blown away. The waffles were hot and had a hearty scoop of Ice cream sat upon it, and as it melted they filled the little ridges of the waffles perfectly with sweet and richness. The shop itself is tiny and cozy and smells delicious. There is enough seating for about 7 people but it's a good snack to have while walking around squirrel hill on a nice day.The sugar waffles are a good medium size but the ice cream topping or whipped cream topping is quite large so I'd advise people not to eat here if they are full from a previous dinner. Make room for dessert!"
