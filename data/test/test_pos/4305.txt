b'I lived in northern NJ for a couple of years (which in my opinion has the best Chinese food out of any state) and this is the only place in Surprise, AZ that comes close. I have had the privilege of meeting the owner and his employees. They are hospitable and make very good food! I do not get Chinese food from any other place. Good job Patrick!'
