b'Las Vegas Krav Maga is a truly cutting edge self defense studio based on Israeli Special Forces hand-to-hand combat. The system originated with one man, Imi who developed it in the ghettos of Europe pre WWII and later fine tuned it in Israel. It is used by military, law enforcement and similar organizations worldwide. The "Tribe" is truly like family led by the ever vigilant and innovative Donavin Britt. Real life scenarios (ie disarming a knife/gun wielding attacker, plucking away a choke hold, getting OFF of the ground, getting to safety after thwarting an attack, etc) The instructors are all top notch and are truly interested in each student being the best he or she can be. Classes usually start with drills ranging from sprinting/suicides outdoors, to calisthenics to the point of exhaustion, Crossfit and even sledge hammers taken to giant tires out back. You work HARD here. Krav Maga isn\'t about mastering a fancy kick: it is about identifying a threat, neutralizing it and getting to safety. Though you are taught to break free from being pinned on ground, etc the focus is on being on your feet. This is not grappling.  People of all ages from children to older adults benefit from this system. After training for a while, you can test for Fight Class which involves an all day series of everything you\'ve learned up to that point amped up. Again, instructors and students alike support one another throughout the process as they do in class and beyond. Due to a bad concussion, I\'m unable to participate in most of the Krav activities and I really miss it. Being empowered as a woman (or man) and having confidence that you can defend yourself and push past self imposed limits is an invaluable gift Donavin, DC and all of the instructors provide. Plus, it is a great stress reliever to kick & punch tombstone pads and all of the off the hook drills they dream up. I\'d recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn the practical techniques and add new challenges to their fitness regime. Truly miss the Tribe and hope to be among them again, soon.'
