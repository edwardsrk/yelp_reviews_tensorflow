b'I seriously thought that "religious experience" hot dogs were only available in New York city or Fenway Park.  I was wrong.  Jerry, the guy who runs the cart makes an incredible dog.  While I was ordering people were coming up and telling him how good they were.  The "Jerry Dog" is easily the best hot dog I have had yet.  5 stars, dude!  Wow!'
