b"Perfection. Seriously. I felt like a princess walking into this beautifully modern but inviting nail salon with glittery silver floors. And I felt like a million bucks when I left! I've never seen a nail salon with such welcoming decor. It's usually the same office-like chairs and oversized, slightly uncomfortable massage chairs. The furniture here is contemporary but so comfortable and welcoming. I wanted to sink into those pedicure chairs but only had a manicure on my first visit. The salon is SPOTLESS. I was told that the pedicure tubs have their own disposable liners, which makes me feel so comfortable with how hygienic and clean this place is. Jenny did my manicure and she was fabulous. Very personable and so meticulous! I chose a pink glitter polish but expressed concerned that it wouldn't be dark enough with two coats. She initially tried and realized it wouldn't be, so she removed the polish and started over with a darker color for the first coat. I so appreciated how hard she worked to make my manicure perfect!  My only complaints are that they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays (I've been meaning to come here for quite some time but, ironically, the only times I found myself available for pampering were on Mondays so I missed out for quite a few months... finally, when I was off on a Wednesday, I was able to make an appointment). I'd also like a separate drying area for my nails. I'm obsessive about making sure my nails are completely dry prior to leaving and I would literally sit for 40 minutes under the dryer if it meant they would be hardened and dry and I wouldn't ruin my lustrous new manicure! LOL. I can't wait to go back and get a pedicure next time! If you go and you're a first timer, mention it for a one-time 20% off discount. I so wish I had saved my first time for when I was doing more services."
