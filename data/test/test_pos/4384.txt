b'The food was awesome!  The house oysters were delicious, we ordered a 2nd order.  The bone marrow soup was crazy big and the broth was great to sip on.  The belly buns were a good appetizer.  The carpaccio had a ton of flavor but I thought the slices were too big since it was hard to cut into smaller sizes with just a fork.'
