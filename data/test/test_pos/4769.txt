b"I am a regular here at Repose, and I have been coming here since before it became part of the Hotel Palomar. Esthetician Deanna is awesome; I've come to her mostly for waxing. She does a fantastic job and is always very thorough. Plus, she's got a great personality and makes an unpleasant necessity pass quickly. It goes without saying that everything is sanitary and comfortable (never a reused wax stick, heated beds, fresh thick towels and robes, etc.). I've also had my nails done here, and they have always turned out great, especially the gels!They recently instituted a new membership program that gets great discounts and rewards. I do miss the old lunchtime quick deals, though. I would often stop in during this time.Prices are reasonable."
