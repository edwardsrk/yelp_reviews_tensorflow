b"This past weekend I finally made it out to the NCT in Mesa.  And I definitely was not disappointed.Nestled in a cosy strip mall in Mesa, with plenty of convenient parking I was thrilled at intimate and funky interior.  Cool old Movie Theater seats and the smell of popcorn!The players were really funny and talented.  I like the competitive aspect of having them in two teams and I also really loved the games, especially 5 things!Really awesome Independent Venue, we'll be back for sure!"
