b"This place opened up a couple months ago and it has been truly a heaven sent! My boyfriend and I usually like to get our fill of cheap but satisfying sushi from Sushi on Bloor, which isn't particularly close to us. Since this place has opened up, we've completely abandoned Sushi on Bloor. Moons' sushi is slightly more expensive, but it makes all the difference in the food's quality--it's SO much better."
