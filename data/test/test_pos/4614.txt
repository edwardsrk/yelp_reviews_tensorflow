b'Wow! What can I say, this is the place to go in Vegas if you are looking for some rest and relaxation away from the Strip, but not too far away where you can easily get to the strip when you want to go.. They have the top rated Spa in all of Las Vegas, the nicest cleanest rooms with doorbells on them even and do not disturb button or please clean room bottom that you can just push when you need one of those things. I would highly recommend using your players club card so you can get the casino rate or even a complimentary room... The staff is super nice and friendly and take care of all your needs. They have several bars there, one near the pool and has some neat couches that you could sit on with silk covering them or you can relax outside by the pool with your drink.. They also have the district where you can go shopping conveniently located next door and many fast food restaurants where you can eat or high end or other restaurants priced in the middle.. I have been there many times and have never been disappointed!!'
