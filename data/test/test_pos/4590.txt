b"I heard this place was good and it was. I ordered a personal sized cheese pizza with no extra toppings for $7.50. and it was good. They make it like Pizza Brutta on Monroe St, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. Novonta pulls that off (Pizza Brutta did too). Novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. I really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. Some sort of Basil or Spinach leaves in there... I don't know but it was good. It also only took like 2 minutes to make."
