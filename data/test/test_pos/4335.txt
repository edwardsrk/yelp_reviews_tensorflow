b"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh!!!But really, I don't think I've ever craved anything as much as I crave Waffallonia. The waffles are warm and cripsy on the outside, and ridiculously soft and fluffy on the inside. If I'm going all out, I'll get the Waffallonia with bananas, strawberries, and the Speculoos icecream (just get it). I prefer to share it with someone since it's a pretty big portion. The plain waffle is also amazing and I'd recommend that too!! Basically this place is the best and I would eat this every day if it didn't have calories"
