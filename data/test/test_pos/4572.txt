b'Been by John\'s twice this last week and was throughly delighted with both visits!  They are about the only place around to get real home cooking.       They give you a small serving of real, homemade potato soup.  They have a main course with two sides, and the "sides" list includes such items as banana pudding, so you can have a small desert if you don\'t want one of the big pie slices you see as you come in the door.       Prices are reasonable; my roasted chicken with dressing, with sweet potato casserole and cooked apples tonight were less than $9.00.     They\'re my favorite place around!'
