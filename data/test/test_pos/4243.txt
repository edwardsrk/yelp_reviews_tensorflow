b"I'm not the biggest ice cream fan, but this place consistently has good service and even better sweets. It helps that I got a behind the scenes tour at their Scottsdale location and learned how dedicated they are to their business. I decided to split one of their sundaes with a friend, the campfire s'mores. It comes with 2 scoops of Belgian Chocolate (you can choose other flavors if you please), whipped cream, hot fudge, and topped with a toasted marshmallow and sprinkles. Gotta have the sprinkles. It was delicious and totally worth the price when you share it. This place is usually busy so grab some indoor seating when you see it. You can buy pints to take home with you to enjoy during these sweltering summers."
