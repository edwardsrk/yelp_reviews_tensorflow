b'Tony is awesome! We booked the bike for my boyfriends birthday! From the beginning Tony was helpful answering my questions and getting us booked! We met at the Downtown Grand then went to Nacho Daddy, Atomic Liquor, Bin 702, and then ended at Gold Spike. Each bar has drink specials just for being with the bike. Tony gave insight on each bar when we arrived and was super fun! We blasted music and partied and peddled our way to each bar. Highly recommend doing this even if your a local! We will definitely be doing it again!'
