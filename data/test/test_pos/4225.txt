b"awesome experience! Those guys from sky-dive Las Vegas are great, professional and fun at the same time! I felt very comfortable and safe during training and the jump it self. I got a great video and many many pictures of me, the group in the plane and the view over Las Vegas and the canyon, for just a few extra bucks! The money is definitely worth it!  Do it!! It's fun!!"
