b"Dr. Brown at Comfort Care has been our dentist for about ten years.  The staff is friendly and helpful, he's awesome, and the hours are flexible.  Whether you need a weekend appointment or a time after you get off work, they will get you in, and even when your insurance company is ridiculously hard to deal with, Comfort Care will make it work.  Procedures are quickly completed and the patient is kept as comfortable as possible.  I highly recommend this office."
