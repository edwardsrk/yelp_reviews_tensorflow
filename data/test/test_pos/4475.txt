b"Mike and the rest of the guys down at 5 Star Auto Repair are absolute lifesavers! If I could give them more stars, I would! After my check engine light came on in my Lexus IS300, I was praying it was just a bad O2 sensor but quickly learned that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. After a dealer quote of $4000 (which is more than I paid for the car), I went down to 5 Star Auto to get a quick estimate. Not only was I impressed with the price Mike was able to work out for me, I was thrilled to be able to schedule an appointment for the following monday (3 days after I came in...including weekend days). True to his word, Mike had my IS done on time and even went the extra mile to clean my lifetime air filter. The car runs like a dream, and I couldn't be happier! Wish I could keep these guys a secret but that would truly be a disservice to the community. Thanks, again, Mike and the rest of the team at 5 Star Auto! You guys rock!"
