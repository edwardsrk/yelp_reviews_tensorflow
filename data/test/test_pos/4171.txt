b"We searched for a place with healthy snacks and food for our pups and stumbled upon WAG N WASH. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by ALL the associates and we were helped by Brittany (pretty sure that was her name) she was super helpful in helping us find the perfect harnesses for our puppies. She even tried them on for us. We also got a complete tour of the store. I'm so excited to come here for our pups birthday cakes! We left with some really cool harnesses and new leashes. The best part.......... Each one of our dogs got a FREE new tag! I love this place will be taking them for grooms, treats, and everything else! Thanks everyone at WAG N WASH you guys rock!"
