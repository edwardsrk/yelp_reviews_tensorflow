b"Tonight I tried for the first time Sombrero's and it was amazing! I got the meat quesadilla with asada it was soo yummy! I tried it with some of the guacamole, sour creme and jalape\xc3\xb1o creme cheese, needless to say it was worth the heart burn! My mom got the 3 soft tacos with the carnitas. She says it's delicious with the jalape\xc3\xb1o creme cheese and spicy sauce. What she's ranting and raving about is the horchata. She says that it tastes like vanilla ice cream but melted haha. I tried a taste and I thought it tasted like a shake. She wishes that she had more because she finished it before we even got home and we only live down the street. I also want to add that the family that runs it so nice and friendly. We will definitely be back. Next time is burritos!"
