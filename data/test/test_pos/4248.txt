b"Inexpensive neighborhood diner environments are so rare here in the Valley of the Mega Chain.  And yes, Black Bear is kind of a chain -- but compared to the dreary suburban factory that is Cracker Barrel, this place feels like it really is involved in a community.  And the food is VASTLY better than any Cracker Barrel, AND the staff, at least anytime I've gone here to the Bell Rd. location, really acts as if it is enjoying their job.  I love this place so much!  It just feels like home!"
