b"My daughter tipped me off to this place.  I'd been passing it for years.  I went in with my 1963 Mercury which had a stalling problem.  We popped the hood and one of the guys fixed the vacuum hose in 10 min.  No problem.  You get honest, hard work from these guys who are fair and have great prices.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
