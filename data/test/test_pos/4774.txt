b'Wow. Everything about this place was fantastic. The service was great. We arrived earlier than our reservations and were seated promptly. As soon as we arrived, our waiter approached us and greeted us. He went over the menu and brought us complimentary bread and drinks. Checked on us several times and had some great recommendations. The service size was huge. I had the Cajun Alaskan Halibut - Yum! So fantastic! Others had steaks, too big but way too delicious. We were celebrating a birthday -- and we got huge complimentary dessert -- oh and the dessert came with like even bigger portion of whipped cream! lol We were too full for the dessert but appreciated the gesture. I would love to go back and visit or at least wish we had this restaurant where we live! Highly recommended.'
