b'I went in on a Saturday morning around 9:30 after a 5k run... so I was starving! The food was amazing! I ordered the pancakes... 3 huge pancakes with eggs and hash browns for $5.50. I had my food in about 7 - 10 minutes and was not disappointed! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pancakes tasted like I made them at home. This is a great place for a good, cheap breakfast if you are in the area. I will definitely be back!!'
