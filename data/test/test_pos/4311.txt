b"Having just moved to the Charlotte area, I found myself in need of a bedroom suite. After looking up several area furniture stores online, I found a great-looking bed at Rooms to Go Furniture's website, so my wife and I decided to visit the store.Rooms to Go has a very attractive showroom and is designed to appeal to the visual senses. Rooms to Go specializes in modern style furniture, unlike many of the other, more conservative, furniture stores in the immediate area. If you are looking for a more hip, modern look, Rooms to Go is where you want to start looking.We were helped immediately by our salesman upon entering the store. He was able to locate the bed I was interested in and assisted me in finding the appropriate mattress for it as well. I ended up purchasing a matching chest of drawers and end table. We were assured that all the items were in stock and would be delivered on 2/29 to our home. The delivery people arrived on time today and had the entire bedroom assembled within 40 minutes. They were extremely professional and efficient.I plan to make Rooms to Go my place to go for any other furniture we may need. We will be in the market for a sofa or chairs coming up and this is definitely where we will begin our search."
