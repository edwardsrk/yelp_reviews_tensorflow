b"Good food, the peanut oil is so much better for you. I got there at 1055, and they opened right at 11, the manager was super nice and the staff was super motivated to help me.Got there enjoyed my food, they threw an extra patty on my burger, which is cool since I'm a fat ass.I left came back 30 minutes later and used their bathroom, I think I stuffed up their toliet with TP and poop. So I'm writing this review to make amends for my folly.Sorry bro."
