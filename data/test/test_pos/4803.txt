b"We were always skeptical to come here because we aren't vegan and it seemed too pricey. But after hearing so many raves about this place, my husband and I rode our bikes here. The ambiance is charming and the staff is genuinely sweet. I enjoyed a toddy while the hubby sipped on a chai tea latte. We shared an oatmeal cream, two oatmeal cookies sandwiched together by icing, addicting but a little too sweet for my taste.Edited-We finally tried the tsoynami and it was delicious!!!! In our minds we always rationalized by saying we would rather get blizzards at DQ. So happy we didn't this time around. My favorite is the Chai Tiramisu tsoynami and my husband loves the Fluffernuterin. We've also tried the Almond Oy Vey and the cookies 'n' cream."
