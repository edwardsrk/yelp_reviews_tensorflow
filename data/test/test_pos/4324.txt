b'As a Chicago native who moved to Tempe for school they finally opened the first potbellys on 7th and Camelback. I traveled all the way there to get a sandwhich because it was a reminder of home. Then they opened the one downtown and of course I started going there more often because it was closer and thats when I began chit chatting with the assistant manage (who is now the manager of the tempe one) and he remembered my sandwich and how many cookies I got on a regular. And then the Tempe shop opened and it seemed like I was there every day! I adore how the people treat me there and the manager there is always so happy! He does a great job with his customers. My sandwich is always top notch even with the basic toppings and the cookies my goodness if I could marry a food place this would be it!'
