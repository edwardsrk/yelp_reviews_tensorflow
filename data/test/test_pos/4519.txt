b"I was in Vegas with a friend of mine and she always wanted a tattoo. We found this place on Freemont Street sort of by accident and honestly I wasn't expecting much. I was wrong. I mean what are the chance that you happen upon the perfect place to get what you wanted? Go figure. :PBut seriously, they were great. Very clean facility and the people were all quite helpful. She ended up getting a small tattoo on the inside of her wrist, a little cute flower.I think before now I always pictured a tattoo shop as dirty and I don't know. But that wasn't what I got here. It was nice."
