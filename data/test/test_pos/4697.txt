b'I definitely recommend this vet office !They are really nice and Very helpful !The prices are good too! The vet tech was really nice and made my Ruger feel very comfortable! The vet is also an amazing person ! Ruger really liked her and warmed up to her fast! She prescribed him a good cocktail and made him all better!! "He had an ear infection "'
