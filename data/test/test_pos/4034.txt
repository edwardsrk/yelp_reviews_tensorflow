b"I saw this show on April 8th, so it's been a while. It was the greatest thing to ever happen to me since I discovered The Beatles themselves. Everything was authentic. The songs, the costumes, their impersonations, everything was top notch. To be fair, George looked kind of old to be doing the part, but all that aside it's still a great show. So if you're a Beatles fan on a trip in Las Vegas, give this show a watch."
