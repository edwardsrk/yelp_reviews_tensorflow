b"I haven't been in to see Dr. Bakerink in a while because his office stopped taking my health insurance. I took my children to Dr. Bakerink from 2000 to about 2010 and I must say he is the BEST pediatrician ever!!  He always takes his time and explains what is going on with your child and how to make them feel better. I really miss him treating my kids however he definitely deserves 5 stars for being such an awesome pediatrician!!!  :)"
