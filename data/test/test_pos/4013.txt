b"Great little park in the midst of downtown Pittsburgh. A lot of different walking trails, food vendors and a nice place to just chill with friends. Our group met up here for a little tour through downtown Pittsburgh and it was a convenient initial meeting point to get us started.There's a great view of the Cathedral of PIttsburgh from the plaza and some great potential photo's for us tourists. There's also opportunity to play disc golf here and you'll often see artists, University students, hipsters, families just hanging out in the park.The only downside is the downtown parking, although there is plenty of pay parking surrounding the plaza at $2/hour."
