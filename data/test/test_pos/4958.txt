b"We went there today for the first time. The food was awesome ! They warned us of a wait very nicely and we decided to stay. We got seated right away and ordered cream sticks and coffee which we got very quickly and they were both very very good.  We ordered breakfast and it was worth the wait. The food is homemade and delicious. The place is clean even the bathroom which is important to me. We had great service and can't wait to go again next weekend."
