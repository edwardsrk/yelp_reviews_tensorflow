b'Once you go to LV nails.... You\'ll be ruined forever (saying it in a good way)I moved to Vegas over a year ago and my girlfriend introduced me to this salon. They have hundreds of gel colors and all of the techs knows how to create all the latest trends. I never left there not satisfied. Even thought they are constantly busy and booked up, they are definitely always trying their best to accommodate my schedule. The owners always remembers their clients named and that is impressive because I am sure there are hundreds of people that walks through those doors.I cheated on them once and I learned a hard lesson with ugly nails for a week. When I returned to LV, they looked at my nails and said "where did you go?" Jokingly judging the work! Lol'
