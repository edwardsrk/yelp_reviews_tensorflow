b'Everything I tried here was delicious and service was friendly. Go I recommended this place!!! Try everything or ask the servers what they recommended. The coffee and dessert is also yummy. I definitely go again I want to try more dishes and explore the whole menu.  My brother and I went and ordered different plates and shared. Nice atmosphere the theme is Island hint the name. First time I had tried Malaysian food and I loved it!!!'
