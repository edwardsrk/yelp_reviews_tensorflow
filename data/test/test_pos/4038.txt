b'I went to Ilios Noche this evening for dinner. I was shocked when I walked in and realized what a beautiful restaurant it was- it was a bit of a surprise for a restaurant in a strip mall and we were DEFINITELY a bit under dressed. Regardless, the staff never missed a beat. They were extremely warm and welcoming. Our waitress Mia was phenomenal. All three of us ordered the seared sea scallops with a mushroom parmesan risotto and it was absolutely divine! There was a rich marsala cream sauce that I will be dreaming about. It was the best meal that I have had in a long time. There are so many items on the menu that I am excited to try but it going to be a challenge to resist ordering that amazing scallop dish. We will be back!'
