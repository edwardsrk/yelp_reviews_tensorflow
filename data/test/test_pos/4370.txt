b'Reading the reviews for this place cracks me up, mostly because they are all true, the 1 stars and the 5 stars...too funny. Yes, the biz operates in a very counter intuitive manner, I mean come on, cash only (they do now have an ATM at the front, after 70+ years in biz...), no restroom, the employees are anything but friendly, even when they call your number, they say "24", not even "number 24" or "now serving..." just the number, and in such a disgusted tone. And nothing but outside seating in the scorching heat (although they do have misters)? But really, would any other tactics do this place justice? The place is nasty, in a nasty part of town, what, should they have spent some money unnecessarily, given the place a little spit shine, made it pretty, trained the staff to be more chick fil A like? No across the board, their biz is perfectly in line with the totality of their circumstances.  Now, where I do disagree with the 1 star reviews is the food. It may be nothing more than "glorified fish sticks" accompanied by "watered down ketchup", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried. So five stars for the food! My wife gets so angry because this is my chosen place for birthday lunch each year. I must admit, there is a component of nostalgia to my five stars and that would be due to the re-enactment of cherished moments of my youth (as I shed a lone tear...) because Pete\'s was one of the few strong holds that continued to offer Dr. Slice after many others stopped. Anyone remember Dr. Slice? How they ever stopped making that, I will never know. Any who, should I ever find myself on death row requesting my last meal, Pete\'s Fish and Chips will lay claim to that honor!'
