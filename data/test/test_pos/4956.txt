b'Overall it was very relaxing & comforting. The masseuse are very attentive to make you feel at peace. I had a facial & during the facial, she will also massage your arms & legs. I have a rash and she was totally ok with it & used coconut oil. It was soooo soothing!!! I will definitely come back !!!! My boyfriend booked this for me for my birthday - the sweetest guy !! The place is clean & they offer nice refreshing water with nice music :)'
