b"The food has always been good and the service just keeps getting better.  They recently remodeled the building, so it's very modern/clean looking.  They always give you a heaping mound of each dish, so you never feel you're not getting your money's worth.  There's an extra $0.50 or $1.00 for some of the more premium items (shrimp, added bacon, etc) but it's always worth it.  I wouldn't want to eat there every day, but I'm always happy when I get the chance."
