b"I have become a huge fan of this little downtown jewel. FINALLY, a spot with fresh delicious food that won't break the bank. The breakfast muffins are super tasty and the wraps are divine. The owner is extremely accommodating and the staff are all friendly and well-versed on the menu. Breakfast or lunch.. this is the place to go when you work or live downtown. Period."
