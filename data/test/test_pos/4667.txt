b'I have been to the others (Vegeway, Veggie House) several times, so of course I had to try this place. The restaurant decor is... not attractive. But whatever, the food is good, great variety. Similar menu to veggie house, but with some added stuff like sushi, ramen and pho, etc. Our server was Li, and she was so lovely and sweet. She made the experience even better. I will go again.'
