b'I love this place soooo much, everyone is soooo friendly. Been with my technician for idk how many years now, decided to follow her and I surely made a good decision. 4 stars because I know that they are still working on the interior design of the place but can not wait to give it a 5 star after everything is settled... Prices are affordable. They are def 5 star... This place improved soooooo much'
