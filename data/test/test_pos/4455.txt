b'I mistakenly made an appointment with Pearson Eye Group because they are in the same mall as Visionworks (the office I had used 3 years prior)    So I arrive at Visionworks.  Quickly we figure out that I\'ve made my appointment with Pearson and not them.   Prepared to just forgo my appointment with Pearson and make a new appointment with Visionworks, I inform them the reason for my visit (Glaucoma check) and ask them if they have my old records to compare my next visit with.   Thier answer:  "We have you on file but your records are in storage".   I\'m not sure what that means.  Are they still using manilla folders and file cabinets?  Do they have a unit at Uncle Bob\'s Storage?  Quickly I realize I want to keep my appointment with Pearson.  So I appolgize for the interuption and ask them where Pearson EyeCare is.  The "wrong" Optometrist ended up being the "right" one.    I don\'t have insurance and the price for a full exam was extremely reasonable.  My family is predisposed to Glaucoma and Diabetes and I fear blindness more than death itself.   Dr. Hagstrom picked up on this, and explained every test (and the results)  AND...Even though I had my retinal scan done (which was probably more than adequate) she also dialated my pupils and inspected each eye herself.    Long story ... L O N G E R ...  I get home thinking my eye pressure was in the 90 range as that was the readings I got off one of the tests.  Through google I learned that 20 was a normal pressure.  A tad bit panicked I called late Friday and left a message asking for clarification.   Dr. Hagstrom called me herself the following morning (a Saturday) and put me at ease and explained that the readings of "90" that I remebered were another unit of measurement for a different kind of test.   She gave me my eye pressure readings and they were in fact 20 in each eye (which is normal yay!)So yeah.  I\'ll be back in a year for my Glaucoma check.  Thankyou!'
