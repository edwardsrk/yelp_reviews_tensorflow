b"Everything was phenomenal from start to finish. Beautiful fish and delicious dishes... our server Jerome (Jerone?) was superb and made a tasting menu for us based upon our preferences and it was perfection. We can't wait to come back to Vegas and dine here again- what an amazing experience! Morimoto doesn't disappoint!!"
