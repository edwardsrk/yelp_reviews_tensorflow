b'I dont even know where to start. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The wings are to DIE for (comes with a delicious dipping sauce). Peach Tea Saketini is a must try, its refreshing and gets the job done. My server Hau was nothing short of amazing. He took his time explaining the menu to me and even had great recommendations. Cant wait to come back!'
