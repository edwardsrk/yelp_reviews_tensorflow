b'Once again I experienced a "over the top" job from the great Men In Kilts as they polished my windows, sanitized my gutters and power washed my driveway and sidewalks to a sparkling condition. The gentlemen are always polite, punctual and very professional. I heartily recommend them for any of those pesky jobs you want to get done right for that is how they will do them - and with a smile.'
