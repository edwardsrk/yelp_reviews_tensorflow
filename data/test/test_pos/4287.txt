b'I want to live at Veggie House. Seriously,  how does Chef Kenny do it? Lettuce wraps? Bomb. Giant bowl of miso soup? Delectable. Mongolian beef? The ish! And it\'s all meatless.  We ate soooo much but at the end of the meal we didn\'t have that dreaded feeling of "the itis" since everything is on the healthier side. Everything was served so quickly,  if you\'re in a rush then this spot is for you. Also if you like crazy delicious food that won\'t leave you feeling guilty then this place is also for you. Don\'t be fooled by the fact that it\'s vegan and vegetarian,  the food is as good as, if not better than its meat filled counterparts.  I\'m mad that I\'m not eating there right now. Chef Kenny, I heart your face and your food. Don\'t be scared when you see a face in the window at night, that\'s just me waiting for you to open.'
