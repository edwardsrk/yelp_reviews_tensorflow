b"Delicious pizza! I had the Lambretta special pizza, minus the prosciutto because I was in the mood for vegetarian (I'm sure it's delicious with the prosciutto too though). It was HUGE but it was thin crust and it was all I was having and I was hungry so I ate the whole thing myself!The service was very fast and friendly, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant were very pleasant and modern. I will definitely come back here! The pizza was made from high quality, authentic ingredients, and I didn't feel stuffed in a bad way like I do at other pizza places. I felt great afterwards."
