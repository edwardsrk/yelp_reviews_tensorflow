b'Make an appointment w/ Mary based on Yelp review.Brought some Far East gold jewelry for an estimate.  None were stamped to exact gold content and many were unique items.  This made estimate difficult.  Mary made the decision to perform an instrument (XRF) measurement instead of relying on acid test.  Got much more accurate reading.  Then She was able to make better offers as a result.While waiting, Mary provided many valuable advice on gold investing.  Thank you very much for your time and service'
