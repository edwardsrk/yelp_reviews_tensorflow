b"I'm surprised Yasu has any negative reviews. This is my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix. The service is not fast but you go there for the experience not fast food. If you are an adventurous eater and want to enjoy an evening out eating authentic Japanese food the chef clearly prepares with care go to Yasu. If your an unadventurous eater, looking for a cheap meal or are in a hurry...you might not appreciate it as much as you should I guess..."
