b'The food tastes really homemade :) I had the goulash which was super tasty and the chicken paprikash- both really good! The server was very sweet and friendly too. My only issue was that the dubonet I ordered came in a pretty dusty glass but the server apologized right away and brought me a new one when I told her.'
