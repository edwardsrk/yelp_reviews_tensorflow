b"My favorite Chinese takeout place that I've found around the Ballantyne area. Doesn't look amazing on the inside but we never eat in. I usually order the chicken and broccoli and last time I went for the garlic shrimp. I'm always scared to try new things but I loved it! New favorite. The portions are huge. We often eat down for dinner and have lunch the next day too from one serving. We also order it with chicken fried rice which is way better than the pork fried rice most dishes automatically come with. Think it's $1 extra. They have the lowest prices of any Chinese food places we've been too around here."
