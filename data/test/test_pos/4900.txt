b"We visited this restaurant in leu of leaving the casino for cheaper alternatives but I'm glad we stepped in. The prices were modest. We each ordered their mouth watering green chili cheeseburger and fries. The appetizer was awesome. We shared a sweet shrimp tamale. The meal started with an overflowing basket of crafted warm breads and rolls. I especially enjoyed the jalape\xc3\xb1o bread. The service was definitely 5 star. I'll definitely stop by on my next trip."
