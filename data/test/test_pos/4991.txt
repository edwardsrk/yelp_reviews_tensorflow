b"Really great 'fast' food - healthy and quick but everything was just SO flavorful! I got a veggie wrap and the flavors of everything worked so well - hummus, pickles, cabbage, rice, lettuce - the tahini dressing was amazing and the Greek vinaigrette finished it off nicely! I almost went back for another one! My husband got the steak wrap with hummus, lettuce, tabbouleh, tzatziki, and rice and he said he was really good as well. We also got the season chips which were great as well. This place is basically a Mediterranean Chipotle"
