b'The best Wagyu steak I\'ve ever put in my mouth. Our table had a variety of different types and cuts of steak. Hands down the Wagyu was the BEST! As my friend put it best "DREAM WORTHY"!  Don\'t waist your time on any other steak or you will be the disappointed one at the table once you sample the Wagyu. We family styled the sides and my favorite by far was the spicy rice! YUM! I absolutely loved the fresh mixed cocktails too and the wine list is fabulous.  The staff took our experience seriously and every aspect of our time with them was enjoyed. My experience will continue to be "Dream Worthy" . . . Best food memory of 2016. Until next time!'
