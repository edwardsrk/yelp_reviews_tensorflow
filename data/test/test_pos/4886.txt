b"Dinner tonight with my friend Steve to Fellini's at the stratosphere. Such an awesome old school Italian gem. The shrimp Caesar to start was delicious with large and many shrimp with creole flavor and spice. I had the veal vandoastana! A 12 0z veal chop stuffed with prosciutto and fontina cheese, breaded and saut\xc3\xa9ed in a sherry wine sauce. Our server said this was his favorite dish and I see why, a 10/10. That sherry wine sauce alone would taste magnificent on regular pasta. Steve had the beef brasiola and that was just as good. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back to try the gnocchi in Gorgonzola cream sauce with tenderloin. Thank you so much Kevin Calder for the wonderful Christmas present of this coupon and meal. I would have never tried this place. Thank you so much"
