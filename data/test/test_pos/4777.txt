b'Toni has been absolutely wonderful to work with!! She noticed right away that my prescription was not right, so she had me call my eye doctor and have my eyes rechecked. She helped me pick out frames and was able to explain the prescription to me. She also helped me to save even more money on both pair of glasses. I really appreciate everything that she has done for me!!'
