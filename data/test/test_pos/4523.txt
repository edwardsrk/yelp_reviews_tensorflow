b'Went for the machine gun experience on our recent trip to Las Vegas. Had such a great experience we went back a couple days later. Jason helped us decide what we wanted to shoot, instructed our teenage sons on shooting and made the experience a real blast. Very friendly and nice clean, modern facility.'
