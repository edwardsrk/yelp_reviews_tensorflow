b'Our Mini Schnauzer is up to date on her shots, except for Bordetella so she can visit a doggie day care. We were referred here by the doggie daycare and I am very happy with the service.  I called ahead and found out that they do walk in vaccinations from 6:30 to 8:30. We got there at 6:45 and while the waiting room was full, we only had to wait 30 minutes.  When it was our turn, we were in and out quickly. Thank you for the efficient service!'
