b"Came here with hubs while shopping,  the pretzel bites are nice and soft but the cheese dip is not so yummy... The chili is amazing and has enough kick to the tongue but doesn't roundhouse your face. I had the Mac and cheese which was really good, hubs had a burger which was great but he wished that our waitress asked how he wanted it, came out fine just the same. And the milkshakes are amazing! Get the monster size (fills your glass twice, massive portion)! Thanks again!"
