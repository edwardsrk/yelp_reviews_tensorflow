b'Delicious!  This has to be one of the best airport restaurants I have eaten at.  I ordered the Tortilla soup as an appetizer and the Green Chili Cheeseburger with Fries for my entree.  The soup was flavorful and well seasoned with just the right amount of kick.  The cheeseburger was moist and tender, cooked to perfection.  The green chili is warm, but not extremely hot.  The seasoned french fries are superb - hot, crunchy, with just the right amount of seasoning.  I would highly recommend a stop at this restaurant when passing through Sky Harbor.'
