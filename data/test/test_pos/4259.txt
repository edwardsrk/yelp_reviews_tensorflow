b'We walked into Melt. "Did you want to put your name on the list?" the hostess says with exasperation. Whoa..."Uh, yeah, how long is the wait?" pause...HUGE eyeroll..."Like, an hour. Hour and a half. Hard to say." Having just driven over two hours from Pittsburgh and being met with this wonderful attitude, we immediately peaced out of Melt. I looked down the street and pointed. "DEAGAN\'S!" And sorry, I have a hard time believing that even Melt\'s super-hyped grilled cheese sandwiches could have lived up to our perfect lunch at Deagan\'s. Sometimes things really do happen for a reason, right?I really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn\'t possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I\'ve never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I\'ve just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepe\xc3\xb1o pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.Oh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them. I kind of wish it wasn\'t 2 in the afternoon so I could have had more than one...haha.I will totally make a point of coming back here again.'
