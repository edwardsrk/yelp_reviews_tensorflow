b'I had an appointment with the lovely Ana Parker last Friday.She is extremely talented and very easy to chat with.  She kept referring to my eye color when discussing possible hair color options which I thought was pretty cool!She gave me a feminine and flattering pixie cut and fresh color with great dimension.I love it and have gotten so many compliments.The salon is very zen-like and chill.  The two receptionists I spoke to were very polite and helpful. Overall, I had a fabulous experience!'
