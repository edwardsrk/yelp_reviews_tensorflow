b'Calling all matcha fans! You need to visit this place. Tsujiri in North York has 2 floors. The bottom floor serves dessert, and the top floor is a sit down restaurant.I visited this location for a meal. The waitstaff is very friendly and very attentive. I started with the o-matcha cappuccino. It was served in a bowl. After first sip, you can tell that they use a high grade matcha. Very earthy in flavor with the sweetness of the frothed milked made it very enjoyable.Now what to order to eat? The menu offered lots of good selection, that it was so hard for me to chose! I wanted something light and decided on the matcha unagi poke bowl. I enjoyed this dish very much. The soba noodle was nice and firm and chewy, however I wished that the noodle had more of a matcha flavor to it. Now for dessert, I chose the pancake platter. It is a matcha pancake souffl\xc3\xa9 served with a side of matcha ice cream, burnt matcha ice cream and whipped cream. The pancake was nice and light. It was filled with matcha flavor. The platter also came with a syrup, which is really sweet. I just added a drizzle to a small piece to try, and it was enough. I will definitely visit this location when I am back in Toronto for a visit.'
