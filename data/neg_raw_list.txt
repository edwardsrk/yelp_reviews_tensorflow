I am actually horrified this place is still in business. My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said "you know what? That's fine.", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.Bottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!
Dismal, lukewarm, defrosted-tasting "TexMex" glop;Mumbly, unengaged waiter;Clueless manager, who seeing us with barely nibbled entreeson plates shoved forward for pickup, thanked usperfunctorily for our patronage;We're from the Texas Hill Country;down there, we jail critters who serve up grub this bad,for their own protection.Never, never, NEVER again(Back to Yard House for real food)
If I could give less than one star, that would have been my choice.  I rent a home and Per my lease agreement it is MY responsibility to pay their Pool Service company.  Within the last year they changed to PoolServ.  I have had  major issues with new techs every week, never checking PH balances, cleaning the filter, and not showing up at all 2 weeks in the past 2 months. I have had 4 different techs in the past 4 weeks.   I have emailed and called them and they never respond back nor even acknowledged my concerns or requests.  I cannot change companies but I'm required to still pay for lousy or no service.  Attached are a couple pictures of my pool recently due to one tech just didn't put any chlorine in it at all according to the tech who came the following week to attempt to clean it up.  Please think twice before working with these people.  No one wants to work with a business that doesn't return phone calls or emails.
10pm on a super bowl Sunday and they're already closed?? Weak, no wonder the hard Rock is dying off...
Tried to have my car repaired.  Even made an appointment.  I was told that all my appointment was for is to meet the service advisor, not get any work completed on my car.  Such a waste of time.  Even talked to the Service Manager, he didn't care.  Since that was the attitude of the service department, I can only expect that from the mechanics that would have worked on my car.  Went to another dealership, made an appointment and my car went in to be repaired.  Not told to come back later and they might get to my car. Very poor service.
Just... not good.  We want it to be - we have been several times hoping, but the experience is always at best, lackluster.  The food is not great, very run-of the mill on a good day and the serve staff though very nice is always - and I have never had the same person twice - always totally lost and under-trained.  It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service.
Horrible- Unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. The restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. Needless to say, I talked him into driving up the road to the other location. This one is unacceptable.
There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.
A margarita in clear plastic dickie cup??? Wtf?? The drunkin shrimp plate should of been called the goldfish feeder shrimp platter..
The tables and floor were dirty. I was the only customer on a Saturday nite and  the person working the counter ignored me I had a corned beef sandwich. I took three bites  and threw it in the trash
Passed by here after we went to raijin ramen and thought everything looked super cute. Bought 3 bread, the charcoal salted egg, an almond croissant and a coffee walnut bread. All three, after discount came to almost 20$. I was quite excited but upon trying them all, the croissant was pretty good (but I've had better, ie nadege, etc) but the other two were very mediocre. The salted egg bread was very one dimensional as the bread itself wasn't very flavourful. I thought it would be closer to a moon cake concept where bread is a bit sweet and counterbalanced the salty egg yolk but instead the egg yolk overpowered everything else. The walnut bread was also very weird as the coffee had a weird after taste. For the price I would def not come back.
I can't tell you how angry I am right now.  I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.Today I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.I pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!I have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.I called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.And NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.I can assure you, I will NOT be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.  MAKE IT RIGHT, HUNTERSVILLE FORD.
Worst pedicure ever. First, waited over a half hour even though we had appointments. Then, the girl rushed throughout, made rude comments and talked and laughed with her other coworkers in a different language. Pedicure is chipped not even one week later. Will NEVER go back here. Worse experience.
We drive by Fruits and Roots almost daily and we finally decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the only good thing I have to say about the place is it has nice decor. We walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. We assumed she would explain the menu but nope! My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so aswe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. Tome the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!
I had an oil change at the 15515 N Scottsdale Road location.  When the car was delivered to me, there were two engine warning lights on that had not been on when I drove the car in.  The technician said that the lights were on when he got in the car, which was not true.  I took the car to the dealer who said that a sensor light had been left unplugged when they removed the air filter.  I should have read the many bad Yelp reviews prior to going to this facility.
The absolute WORST apartment complex I have ever lived in. Moved here from out of state. Hoped to find a decently priced apartment until I got myself settled in. Wow this place has been trash. Landlord is only here half the time, so those of you with a full time job, forget ever trying to communicate with her! Doesn't answer the phone or call back. Place can't even get with the 21st century and splurge on email communication. Rent past due? Noise complaint on an animal? Anything, Don't worry, you'll be singled out with a cheap ass piece of paper taped to your door for the whole complex to see. As far as CAM Properties as a whole, also trash! They also refuse to give callbacks. After hours "emergency?" ha, yeah right! Scottsdale PD had to be called when I had troubles after hours because CAM's "emergency after hours hotline" didn't answer the phone! I will never ever recommend anyone live here. The bugs invade the units like crazy - cockroaches, spiders, lizards, you name it. They say they spray before you move in, but do not perform any follow up procedures. They tell you if there's bugs in you apartment, that's all YOUR fault. Ha! I cannot get out of this place fast enough. The only upside is the utilities are included, however the price is still absurd for the less than average amenities and the horrible customer service.
I ordered a pizza at 4:49. Got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. Called the store. They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD.
I went into this store yesterday and it was horrible!!! It was sooooo dirty. I'm talking there was trash everywhere!!!  Not only that but it smelled like trash! It was 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon so I completely understand it being a little messy but the store just looked horrible!!! Not to mention the were out of pretty much everything on the store. I honestly will probably start going down the road to the next Smith's.
I went up too my storage unit at the Uhaul facility on 1/9/16 and when I opened my unit door I noticed that there was boxes pushed too the side ... I noticed that three pieces of furniture was gone out of my unit and I notified the manager of that facility about the missing items... And the manager told me I had too file a claim with the Uhaul company ... I couldn't believe that the manager wouldn't look into it making me feel suspicious... I will never use their facility ever again can't trust their company....I called and they have never returned my calls
This place is clean and a great price the other places around is are horrible and have undesirable types (I.e. hookers) not here safe and quiet no bedbugs a huge plus would recommend it to anyone unless you are from the Phoenix area they will not rent to you unless you live more than 30 miles away after our 3rd stay we were informed of this policy such is stupid and discrimination of Phoenix and surrounding area residents so I'm going to file a complaint with corporate and talk to my lawyer!
The worst hotel experience I have had...we came here tonight, and the bathroom shower is visible to he whole room. Then we needed extra blankets and called down, they said they were all out. Then we asked for water botlles, and they said they were all out! Then to too it off, we asked a cot, and to no surprise....they were all out! What bull is that?? The next two nights better be better...
I went to a Spring Training game here on Monday 3/17/14.  The stadium is just off the freeway so I arrived in the area about 75 minutes before the game.  The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.  I waited almost an hour to get to what I thought was the parking lot only to find out it was the parking for the local Marriott.  People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.Inside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.
We got there by 5:30pm and most of the dishes were cold, as if they been sitting there since noon.  They never refilled our drinks and tried to rush us out.  I would never eat at this place again.
I purchased the Groupon and I honestly shouldn't have. I could've painted my nails better at home and saved $30. It was a rush job. The nail polish isn't even covering the full nail on some nails and other nails, the polish covers the entire nail and a lot of skin too. I had to ask her to clean up the nail polish on both my hands and feet. A customer should never have to ask that question, the nail tech should be able to see that themselves and fix it. Well, she cleaned it up... and there is still polish on my skin surrounding my nails. Needless to say, I won't go back.
I used to go this office, but as other reviewers have noted, they made a pair of glasses wrong (one lens blurred, could not read with that eye), and then told me, well, your other eye will compensate so you can still read. Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was..."Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now."  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts.  Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)
After being a regular at Veggie House i thought it be cool to try Chef Kenny's. We went there a couple times and usually had a great experience until most recently we ordered spicy crispy beef and it came out cold and we told the waitress. All they do is bring you hotter rice but pretend not to hear you about your request. I called back to share my experience and was in shock. They actually put Chef Kenny on the phone which At first I thought was cool. Completely different than I expected, instead of being understanding the owner himself was very rude and told me next time I come in and of this happens to let him know but that's there's nothing more he can do because we already left. I'm sorry but there will not be a next time because I'm going back to Veggie house where they treat customers with respect. I also unfollowed Chef Kenny on Instagram as well.
$28 for a 15 minutes pedicure with used tools? I would never come back. The place seems new and having 50% back so my friend asked me to join her for a pedicure day treat. As soon as my friend and I got colors and sat down, there were three other customers came. There are not too many technicians working at this salon so they started rushing through my pedicure to get to the next customer. I did not say anything because my friend was beside me so I don't want to make her feel bad . The technician finished my pedicure in 15 minutes. After that, she got her small basket and ran to the next customer using the same tools that she used on me. The tools did not get washed. I was thinking the tools she used on me was already used on someone else. I hope I won's have any infections. I would never come here or let my friend come here again !!!
the most low quality catering in persian catagory. we had party on persian new year and every one paid for the food to be cater through this place.the food was not even enough for everybody and the quality was bad.I feel so bad for this business,
Table of 3 on Saturday March 25 around 8pm.. Well the service was terrible. . the host this night took us to a dirty table. . that waitress brung one glass of water when clearly all 3 were empty. Her hair was too damn long and should have been pinned up.. She reaching all over the table and my food.. I couldn't enjoy my meal i was pissed... First time at this location and will not be returning
While Cox maybe overprice and give crappy customer service; they are HEAVEN sent compared to these jokers. I called to get a quote, I made sure to ask him that no service will be started. I didnt agree on a price or speed. They started the services anyway. I called to cancel after I got notified of a pending bill. $151 still. If you like your a$$ , stay away. If I could give negative stars I would. I think they paid someone to write the 5 stars reviews.
Seriously, where are the vegetarian options? All the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. I have heard that this place is good from my friends but I can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. Vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. Sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. There are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. I'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian/vegan menu in place.
SCAMMERS!If you pay your tab in cash...make sure you DO NOT forget your card (credit or bank). If you do, when you go back to pick it up, they'll charge your card for the total amount of your bill...AND...you may find additional fraudulent charges like I did. In the day that management had my card someone purchased an item from  Barnes and NobleCredit and a Credit Report. Now that's customer service.
I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted "Speak"... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry "what the hell are you talking about?" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.Why would I ever set foot in a business who can't even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.Update* In response to the reply.A. Of course you are " lost why I feel that way." You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting "Speak" and reply to questions with "what the hell are you talking about"'B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California. I ONLY asked for a specific type of bond, (because not all bond companies are able to provide this specific type of bond) and your reply was "what the hell are you talking about". After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%. I only included my experience with other bail bonds companies in my REVIEW to highlight how easy it was for me to call another business and not be treated so rudely. C. Thank you for letting me know how poor your customer service is so quickly. Made the decision to go else where easy. I write this in hopes that someone else will not get stuck with your company before they get a taste of your horrible customer service.
We regularly went to Marche Bacchus for many years. The French food was excellent without being too expensive. I used to eat their filet mignon. They changed their chef and booom, no good anymore. Because we love the ambiance so much, we still went and had their pate, french fries and their wonderful crispy baguette/brea that is the foundation of French food. Now they changed their pate, taste like the one at Vons, they do NOT have their crispy bread anymore, but a mushi bred like in any cheap restaurant. The American owners who bought from the French owners DO NOT UNDERSTAND what French food is. The ambiance is stil great, the service is amicable but the food remind me of Mary Calenders. Shame on you for not maintaining the quality of food we had when you took over.
High price, low quality and bad taste. It's not Chinese food nor American food. Don't recommend it.
With many eateries to chose from on queen street we decided to give this place a try seeing how there is usually a line up outside....after waiting 20 minutes outside we were seated at an extremely small stool table.. our waitress took our drink order and it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered 3 dishes and an appetizer. An hour later our food still had not come. We flagged our server down and she said it would be 2 more minutes. 10 minutes after that our food arrived all at the same time...including the appetizer and there was barely any room on the table... I was starving by this point and I decided not to make an issue of the extra long wait time and dig right in. Now I never leave any food on my plate...ever! but in this case I could barely get through a few bites of each plate. The hot dishes were lukewarm and tasted like a 12 year old skater boy carelessly threw some canned ingredients together mixed in with cigarette butts. It was quite literally the WORST food I have ever eaten in my life. My husband just ate a few nachos. I mean imagine me, a pregnant, starving  food loving, happy go lucky person who never leaves food on my plate and I just coudnt eat this stuff. I chose hunger over this food...and im PreGnant!When we were done fidling with the food we had to wait another 20 minutes to get someone to flag down our server....finally when she came we had to lie that we are catching a flight just to get the bill at a normal speed. By this point the whole thing was comical....felt like a joint run by teenagers...absolute joke of a place. A lesson well learned...just bc there's a lineup...it doesnt make it good. I actually just got a yelp account to specifically write this review...thats how bad it was. And I eat out several times a week so thats saying something people.
DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!!! I wish I would have looked on here first as now I can to attest to the fact that this company is a total scam!!!  Their website looks so professional and said family business so I figured they would do a good job!!!  I was just charged $760 to rekey 6 locks!!!!!!  Total scam!!!  I am sick at my stomach as I had my elderly parents there to meet them and they totally got taken advantage of!!!!  At my own house in Colorado I had 12 locks rekeyed by a different company and paid $240!!!
Horrible guest and hospitality. Wish I could give a 0 or a negative star. I once showed up with shorts and sleeveless tees and the management got pissed off because of that and asked me to leave. Worst place ever and would never recommend to anyone.
Came here for happy hour since it indicated the times and stated it was everyday so I decided to spend my lunch here. I got here at 3:12, sat at the bar by the tv's and then proceeded to wait for a hello or a welcome that didn't happen until finally about two minutes later. I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender? It's slow but it's also Memorial Day weekend and you should have enough people working. I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register. Anyways back to when the woman came to me she apologized for the wait which I didn't care for at that point and proceeded to order my food. Overall the experience I was expecting wasn't a good one. The food was great and a bar with great food but when the service isn't up to par it deserves a low rating. I work in high end retail and know me and many of my co workers and friends around the mall would like to be treated just like any other customer and be given a great service when we go to eat for our lunches. We work in the service industry and will treat our local clients with the same service we do our tourists. Since this wasn't the case I'll be sharing my experience with the rest of my co workers and friends who work around the mall.
I am only giving them a "1" rating because it's the lowest available.  We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)  I'm doing this review in the hope of saving anyone out there who may be considering hiring these people for ANY reason a lot of time, headache and money.
My wife is Brazilian and wanted to show me Brazilian BBQ.  She searched around and was told this is 'the' place to go for BBQ.Unless you're going to fill up on side dishes, don't expect to get any value for your money at all.  The place suffers from an identity crisis, part night club part overpriced buffet.The food is entirely average, nothing spectacular but what absolutely stands out is the fact that every portion of meat I was given was entirely bite size, I literally had already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  I often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.The meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (I like rare, this was nearly blue).  As I'm from Texas, I've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and I can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of cornmeal.We ordered caipirinha's and it was like drinking lime flavoured water with ice and a 1/4 shot of Chacas.What really gets me, is the $43 per person price tag they charged us for this.  I honestly walked away feeling like I just made a charitable donation to the restaurant on my way to McDonald's.
Really filthy silverware asked for new set  just as bad  asked for ketchup Disgusting!!! See photo. Italian beef so-so. Fries were good. But fries don't make a restaurant. Where ever this chain started they need to go back.  Hate to see the kitchen if what they bring out is this bad. There's so many restaurants that take pride in cleanliness,this was certainly Doesn't!!! If you go don't say I didn't warn you.
The quality of food been going down hill in the last few months.  I ordered the lettuce wraps and a chicken dish take out.  When I got home the lettuce was slimy and soft.  I ended up throwing it away and ate the meat portion by itself.  The previous time I ordered lettuce wraps​, the lettuce we're too small to wrap the meat in.  Also the entries seems to have more rice and less meat.  Like I said earlier, quality is get worst.   I'll give Pei Wei another chance in a year, that will give the chain chance to fire the cooks or whomever prepares the lettuce.  Maybe management will change also.
If I could I could give 0 stars I would. So we show up around 5:30pm on a Monday. Place is pretty empty. Ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. Ice was already melted in my drink. Ordered apps and meals. We did not get out food until 7:30. We waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. BTW my pizza was cold. And there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. Also I ordered a Calzone which was not a Calzone. Crust Chandler Simply Italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. What a rip off. Just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. I was with 4 people. That's 50 people in day. I think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good Italian is. It sad that so many people accept this.
The building is lovely.  The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.The full story.Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her "no", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.So. The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......
Problems popped up after we dropped off the vehicle. This location doesn't have an after hours key drop box. In the past, we simply left the keys in the locked vehicle.On Sunday we parked the SUV in a spot directly adjacent to the front door. On Monday at 5:45 pm; I received a call from  them asking where the car was. After they figured that out; they claimed not to have a spare key and we would be charged continued rental until WE found a way to actually put the keys in their hands. Or we could pay a $50 fee and an extra day rental and they would handle it. After demanding to speak with a manager; we were told that they would drop all extra charges this time.Looked at our checking account on Tuesday. Found out that they had debited our account for the rental plus the initial deposit. (The deposit is never drawn at the end unless there were damages involved; there weren't.) Had to call our bank to contest the extra charges. The bank handled this for us and we only paid the agreed upon rental price. This was the ABSOLUTE worst rental experience we ever had.
Went to the drive through just for an ice cream cone and I was informed that they weren't selling ice cream. When we pulled up to wait for the car in front of us to get there order we saw the worker hand them an    Ice cream come..
Bad service, reeeally slow chefs. We were the first guests in the restaurant, and after an hour or waiting for sushi/sashimi, the waitress told us they hadn't even started our order! When did 'sushi making' start takin so long???  We told them to cancel our order and bounced. Don't even know what the food quality is like but I can't wait an hour to find out.  There are better Japanese restaurants in Henderson if you're willing to drive out of the hotel.
bop is so over-the-top ridiculous. the prices are outlandish for the very little fabric you're actually buying. i've been in there a couple of times and feel like i've entered an alternate world: a land where it makes sense to spend $80 on a tube top covered in cheap rhinestones, a land where the employees believe customers should be discouraged from buying their clothes by sending them sneering glares, a land where they forget their neighbors are pizzeria uno and fair trade coffeehouse. ugh.
I have been using Handy's service for three months now. I will admit that I had 2-3 really good professionals clean my place. However, the others were just OK...Several of them would leave after 1.5 hours even though I paid for 2.5 hours. I could understand if there were not anything else to do, but there was (for example: mopping the floor.)I have had a couple of professionals who were very rude. The last one was scared of dogs even though it states on my profile that I have a dog, and he will be with me at all times. BTW: I have a 10 pound Chihweenie who is very sweet and likes all people. The last person kept complaining that there is no free parking--well I live in downtown Toronto. What do you expect? She stated that she had tried to call me and text me. However, I showed her my cell phone, and there were no contact from her.I don't get the same pros each two weeks. I am allowing a complete stranger into my apartment each time. I have decided that I will cancel my service as of today. I am truly not satisfied with the unprofessionalism, pros coming late and leaving early, and jobs that were done half assed. I am not asking for much. I am asking to clean the counters and mop the floors. I don't think that this is too much to ask.
The hostess was a complete b&%$#!Couldn't handle seating/reservations at all.Waitress was efficient, but very cold.Definitely nothing like I had heard. No fun, no laughter!  Seemed like everyone was just... there!
The copy and print center here is just so horrible. They have no care and concern for customer service. This department always handles shipping too. It should be a walk in and walk out kind of thing showing up with prepackaged boxes- wrong! Seriously UPS shouldn't allow them to represent their brand. It makes UPS look bad. And the store manager just doesn't care. Mention it to him and he'll just say their short staffed and not even offer to help.
I placed a custom order on 30 August. I was told it would be ready in 2 weeks. By early October I hadn't heard anything about it. I contacted Carrie Hood and asked for an update. She apologized and said it would be ready that Saturday. I messaged her after I didn't hear back from her about my order that Saturday and received an automated response. I have since messaged her several times and have received the same automated response. On November 4th I sent a message asking for a refund and again received the same automated response. This morning I attempted to contact Rugged Moose Decor again only to learn that I have been blocked. I was using Facebook messager to communicate with Carrie hood. Now I can no longer reach her and I don't have my order or a refund. This company is a scam.
The good food is not worth the hassle of dealing with the lady at the window she treats the customers like dirt. On one visit I asked for my change and was told no you don't get change and had the window shut on me, the second time I paid for and didn't receive my side of sour cream and when I asked her for my side she demanded I dump my bag of food out at the window and show her there was no sour cream. I plan on never returning to this location as she is always working when I drive through.
I got a French manicure and pedicure done from here a week ago. When I came home, I noticed that my heels were all scratched. Moreover, the French manicure started peeling 2 days later. When I went back to show them my nails, they said they don't guarantee regular nail paint and were least interested in attending to my concern. It would have been better if I would have not paid extra money for the French manicure and painted my nails myself. Would strongly dissuade anyone from going there for the service and attitude towards their services. A customer pays for some level of satisfaction and service which seems this place is drastically lacking!
The one time I came here for myself, my Arizona Brown spider bite was diagnosed as a staff infection. Either way I would have gotten antibiotics, but the misdiagnosis turned me off from this hospitals expertise, especially after a friend who is an army medic and an EMS team diagnosed it right.
I had explicitly explained to your manager that 1) I didn't receive an email - so I didn't see this fine print that you speak of; 2) I'm in the process of relocation, so I don't have my license transferred to NV and still work in both NV and CA.Maybe the reason you boast not being a crowded gym is that you won't let anyone use your facility without these crazy conditions that I and others speak of in reviews...Additionally, you have one shower stall with a huge rainfall shower head; not everyone wants to have water falling directly on their head and no where else...Anyway, thank you to the GM for being such a jerk; this allowed for me to see that there is no flexibility whenever there is an issue that may arise with your patrons. The reason I signed with 24? Their staff was understanding of my situation and totally accommodating.  Yay for them - love them!!!
stopped in there for lunch ordered 2 item combo lemon chicken and ginger beef  got 5 piece of lemon chicken which was very lightly flavored  and got 6 pieces of for lack of a better term ginger beef there words not mine because there was no ginger to be found it was bland and cold . the chow mein was pretty good but really do not be so cheap im ordering a meal not a snack pack guess i lucked out not being to much did not have to endure there food if your looking for chinese foood or even a reasonable facsimile of this is not it do not waste your money.
Usually the first thing I say when I walk into Monday's is "God damn it!  Why am I at Monday's?"  I hate this place.  Way too crowded.  Shitty music.  No atmosphere.  Stay the hell away.
Bad 1st experience! Charged for something I didn't ask for or receive. The young lady at the drive thru was rude and incompetent, it's just coffee and a danish. How do you screw that up? Will never visit this store again especially if she's on the window. Bottom line, put friendly people on the window who can place an order and swipe a card.
I stopped in because Harumi Sushi no longer serves dinner options, only sushi. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by a nice woman. After glancing over the menu, I chose the lasagna, which comes with sourdough bread. I wasn't in a dine-in mood so I took the order togo. The restaurant was clean and I only waited about ten minutes to receive the meal. However, the clean environment and short wait time cannot make up for the bad taste of the food. The lasagna was horrible!! It taste extremely bad and I don't know if it is just me or not but when did lasagna start being made with carrots? Moral of the story is, I will not be returning again!
Walked in the door and my 9 year old pointed out that the place smelled like a bathroom. I shrugged it off and told her they must have been cooking a lot of eggs. I should have listened to my kid.Ordered a specialty margarita that looked nothing like the picture and tasted like a watered down regular margarita. The waitress, who was doing double duty as the hostess, explained that all the bartenders "do them differently" and offered to take it back. I kept it, as I'm always afraid to send food back, who knows what I'll get in its place. Luke warm, bland food. So disappointed as I have been to a location in San Diego where the drinks and food were great. Oh well, we had to use our coupon...
When to Grab breakfast as I do everyday. Get to work open my box and it appears that my food looks trampled and thrown away.Not what I expect from Chick-Fil-a.  This is probably some of the worst looking breakfast I have had in awhile.
This place should be rated less than zero for customer service. We had a horrible experience with the buffet. Couldn't tell you about the food. We got in the line at 9:59 am and were told they were closed when the sign said they served until 10:00 am. That might have been ok if they weren't so rude and when we walked away the cashier actually laughed! OMG! I called to complain to the food service manager. I was told he was in meeting. Not even offered someone else or voice mail. I guess the lack of good customer service starts at the top. Too bad since it's not a bad place otherwise.
This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. It was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). We started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. Then, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. For entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. The 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. And my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal "Mexican food" places - I know this place is supposed to be "New Mexican." I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.
There is no way this place deserve a high raiting on yelpThis is the most unprofessional and disorganized range I ever been to. I gave it a chance as it was close my home but I really regret I didWe arrived and immediately put our names on a list, upon asking how long will it be, the lady behind the counter replied, 20 to 30 minutes. That's ok I'll wait a bit and see what happensI go and observe the range, only 7 spots, seems small but I'll deal with it. I see three lanes open up, range officer says over the radio, three lanes are open. 15 minutes go by, still no one in the lanes. The place is packed at this point.Other customers are getting irritated. I go back and ask how much longer, she tells me 25 minutes. Another customer starts yelling "there are three open lanes back there, what's the hold up" she replies that she didn't know, after I observed four radio transmissions stating three lanes are available and one range personnel coming to the counter to say three lanes are open.At this point, I had enough, got up and left and proceeded to range 702, where I started shooting within 5 minutes of arrival. Do yourself a favor, skip this place, unprofessional and a waste of time with a horrible set up
So I was waiting  to check out and the lady who took me was very rude she needs to be trained to do her job right if she does nt.  like her job than leave.  She  was a lady maybe in her 50s she had black hair . I was asking her how much was each items I had a budget and I didn't want to go over and she said well that's why there a machine on the register to tell you how rude of her to say that to me . I felt like it was a bother of her having me there there fore I will never come back unless you want to have bad customer service
Worst Experience Ever! The customer service reps were very unprofessional and I was unable to get contacts, even though I had a prescription already written up. I tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive. The company needed doc's approval, but was declined because I didn't go through the check up process that I wasn't notified about to make sure the contacts suited me. The entire process just to get in for an eye exam before was even more ridiculous.
Actually my name is Aaron Sloan. My ex-wife was Erin S. Just clarifying so they know exactly who posted this. I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on.      He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total.     But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS! I have driven Uber employees there too many times to count and as well as them? I tell ALL of my riders to NEVER take their car here no matter what.
worst company I have ever in my life dealt with all way up to management I will never in my life use this company ever again .and will tell everybody and companies I know not to use them. matter of fact every time i see their trash cans I'm gonna leave a note for other people about how they scam people and let their accounts drag on when there to be closed months ago .  use a different trash company
The menu is too large and they can only make Vietnamese food. We ordered Singapore noodles and vegetable fried rice, neither dish looked or tasted line their name sakes. It looked lime they didn't fry either one.They brought our dishes out one at a time with 15 minutes between each. My wife asked for the Singapore noodles not to be too spicy and they cooked it without curry.We will never come back here.
From take out box right to the trash can. I've had Persian, Arminian, Turkish beef Kabob before & I know my middle eastern food, but this thing was absolutely disguising! The minced beef (koobideh) was dry, not hot & very herbal. The rice stank so bad I didn't even touch it. I wonder how they managed to screw white rice like that. I don't even recommend this place to my enemies!
Extremely bad service:WARNING!!! Do NOT eat here!Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: "sorry, we can not honor that..."Naturally, I asked: "why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it."This is the restaurant's response: "sorry, but we haven't done that for a while now.""Not for anybody?""Yeah...not for anybody."Well, that was the end of it.End of conversation.End of trust.Do you want to help stop this cheating restaurant's dirty practices?If yes, then please find your food elsewhere, in a better place, with way better ethics.Thank you.
I've been here several times over the last 3 years and the food is just okay! Nothing spectacular and highly over priced! I can get a better meal at  Taco Bell and for way cheaper! The service is good but other than that go somewhere else Downtown! Don't waste your money here!
As soon as we came inside the room, found our first roach.... and there's nothing they can do about it. Never staying here again. SO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU STAY HERE.
2 words: RIP OFFI made the mistake of booking an appointment AND paying up front for a package before reading any of the reviews. The girl who sold me the package asked me what areas i would like lasered and i told her exactly what i wanted to be done (i have done numerous laser treatments in the past) so she told me that this package would be perfect for me. Later when i go in for my appointment they tell me that i have to pay extra for this body part and that body part! Not only did they sell me the wrong package but they refuse to refund me my money and want me to pay more that i initially anticipated. They never sent me a reciept (as the purchase was made over the phone) and the laser technician literally spent 10 minutes with me for full legs and bikini and face! They are in the business to scam individuals who are new to laser treatment and have no idea what to expect. All i can say is STAY AWAY
Initial experience left a HORRID TASTE IN MY MOUTH and I never even tried the food!!!!!Just had an -interesting- conversation with the girl who answers the phone, Amanda. WOW.After being asking what I was calling for (catering an event, duh!) I told her what I needed, I was put on hold, phone was answered again by Amanda who acted like she hadn't just talked to me 6 seconds before and asked the same question again. Her absolutely lack of professionalism quickly wore down my patience. I felt like I was dealing with a 15 year old!!In the middle of asking me what our date was for our wedding, venue, etc., she blurts out "Oh, you know there is a 5k minimum for December. You know that, right?" I was baffled by the way she said this, as well as there was no surrounding explanation or context... When I asked "Why?" She laughed at me and then said "Well, thats just our policy." Okay, that's fine. There are much, MUCH better ways of presenting this to a prospective client. Also, you probably shouldn't say it to someone when you don't know what their budget is or how much they are willing to pay. Moreover, the condescending, rude tone in which you say things like that have a lasting effect. They don't know that they are on the preferred vendor's list at my venue, they don't know specific rules or things that the venue already provides and this girl seems to have no grasp of how to get details from someone without asking the most idiotic questions. If someone keeps saying "We just require a plated dinner, no other services from you." You don't need to keep asking things like "what about cake, what about a bartender, what about hors D'oeuvres?" "NO! Just a plated dinner." Total incompetence, lack of professionalism, rude, and absolutely not a business who I would recommend working with after this brief and exhausting exchange. I wanted to book a simple consultation to try to talk to a coherent adult about food, do a tasting, and then sign a contract --TO GIVE YOU MONEY--! To the owner of this business: (Before I completely wrote you off as my potential caterer) I requested that when I got my call back, I would like to deal directly with the owner, Jennifer. Amanda rudely asked "Why?!?" I told her that I would like to deal with someone who knows the venue that I am booked at, (considering you are a preferred vendor there). I would strongly suggest getting someone else who knows how to deal with customers, has a better "table-side manner", and knowledge of halfway decent customer service. I have had much more pleasant experiences with call center employees.
After hearing about people rave about this place I decided to try it out for myself he other day. Went online and saw the menu, saw the "famous Sonoran dogs" and immediately wanted that to try. Saw that they had an option to order and pay online to avoid the line and pick up quickly. Heck yeah I'll take it! Ordering through a phone call or going in would be better. Put my order and a couple co workers order in online and paid. 25 bucks gone. Another co worker left to get the food and went to the counter to pick up order. Luckily he made it just as it started filling up with people. The employee at the counter didn't have any idea what he was talking about when he said he was there for an online order pickup. Luckily I printed out my "invoice" as they call it and sent it with him. Had it not been for him having that paper they wouldn't have taken the order. I get it, sometimes technology doesn't work right and you get missed. They realized and said sorry and made the order quickly. Now for the food.. we were all excited to try this place as it was new for us all. Every single item we ordered was made incorrectly. Whether it was missing an item that was checked off on the invoice and paid for or just the wrong ingredient. There was absolutely no flavor in any of the food. It was literally bland from the tacos, to the burritos, even the "salsa" was bad. If you don't have taste buds then this place might be good for you. I on the other hand don't wanna do it again.
The village is one of the worst places to live near the UIUC Campus. Their staff is very unprofessional and they have no empathy toward any of their tenants. They provide late notice about everything while expecting you to pay on time. I have never seen such horrible customer services and treatment toward tenants. DO NOT LIVE HERE. Don't get sucked in by the low promotional fees. They don't last and at the end of the day the head ache isn't worth it.
BEWARE: There is a guy who works here, tall, glasses and painfully forgetful. I've gone here a total of three times in the past month for a quick fix with my siblings and he's gotten our order wrong each of those times. He must be new, but he does seem genuinely sorry after he adds or subtracts something from our order.Regardless, he's not why I give this McDonalds 1 star.This place is usually jam packed with teens by 1pm during the school year and during the summer, just can't catch a break. Location is usually messy and has THE LOUDEST DOOR EVER! Service is mediocre to the max, then again, this is McDonalds, no 5 star review here.
This review is not for the food or dining, it's only for the reservation & host/management experience.  In short, making a reservation means nothing!  I reserved a table for 4 on Saturday night at 7:15pm to welcome my colleagues to a nice meal while staying at the M Resort & Casino.  It was crowded when we arrived, and the host snapped at us saying it would be another 30 minutes for our reservation. I asked if we could go to the bar while we wait, and she said there was no room there either.  So we went to a Casino bar & came back 30 minutes later, and the manager told us it'd be at least another 30 minutes.  They weren't at all polite, they acted like we were being a pain for coming back. SERIOUSLY?!  So I asked them to take my number down & call me when the table was ready, and she begrudgingly did.  Well, they NEVER called me to say our table was ready.... good thing we snagged one at the Burger & Brews place next door.Clearly, Anthony's doesn't know how to manage their reservations.... obviously an OpenTable reservation doesn't guarantee you a table.  We were super let down because the menu looks great, but I can't comment on that.
My friend and I were there this afternoon at 6 PM May 25, 2017 we ordered cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwiches barbecue chips and waterMy sandwich was not fresh the bread was stale it had chopped apples no Pecans. They had no barbecue chips even though they were displaying them they only had one salt and vinegar chips and they had no bottled water of any kind. The beverage cabinet at the front by the register was completely emptyThe only good thing about this meal is I ordered a peanut butter smoothie and that one was fine. My friend ordered the same sandwich that I did instead she was delivered and Apple turkey sandwich that was very dry. No chips we had to go after the chips and they had no water and no napkins with our meal or on the table. The only beverage they were offering was soda, and smoothies. I definitely will never return to this topic and a smoothie's café
After writing my previous review, I was contacted by a Midas rep who offered to submit my complaint to head office. I appreciated someone listening and trying to help, so I agreed. I later received a call from the manager at the Midas Ringwell location around June 6 or 7. He didn't know why he was calling and it seems that he was just told to call me without any details. I explained the situation, and he told me that parts rust and that's how cars work. I asked if it's normal for parts to rust and seize after 5 months of use, and he didn't have anything to say. He then said that I could have brought the car back to them so they could "fix" it (actually do the work this time), but I told him the work had already been done by my regular mechanic. He said it was too bad, because they have no way to compensate me. I explained that this was fine and I'll just continue to tell everyone I meet what thieves they are. He offered to have the regional manager call me, but it would take a couple of days because they are busy. I said this was fine, but it's been a week and a half and I still haven't heard from them. It's interesting to note that he never denied anything I was complaining about.
I purchased a Samsung fridge from Lowe's in 2014. A few months ago, I began having an issue with the ice maker. The ice smelled bad and tasted worse. The water still tastes amazing and is odorless. I replaced the filter and thoroughly cleaned the fridge, emptied and cleaned the ice bin several times to no avail. Chemical type smell, similar to freezer burn, but different. Emptied the entire fridge (as that is where the ice maker is located), nothing helped. Looking at Google, I discovered this is a common problem. I contacted Lowe's as I have a 5 year warranty, and they sent Buy-Rite.Tech showed up and used his laser thermometer in the fridge, drink drawer, and freezer. I explained that the issue was the way the ice was tasting/smelling, and not with the temperature. And also that it was a common problem reported online in reviews, etc. The tech told me there was no solution, but that he noticed dog hair under my fridge. I took 5 hours off work to wait for the tech to come for 5 minutes and tell me there was no solution. Very dissatisfied.
I'll give this place one star for the music, I would never eat or drink here again, ever. We went in for the 2 for 1 margaritas, which ended up being $11.00 each, even with the 2-fer!! Yeah, the server said they were regularly 22 bucks each. They came in small plastic cups for a nice touch, they weren't bad but the food was horrible. We ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  I went the safe route and got the street style tacos and I'll tell you any Taco Truck in California is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, I ate half of one and gave the rest all back. Ew. Actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn't eat Mexican food for a while, that's how bad it was. Oh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when I went up for the "Mas Tequila" shot at the bar. Seriously..
We ordered almost everything on the menu. Because we love sushi and hibachi and were excited for this restaurant to open. Only to be disappointed. The quality of the food and the flavor was not there.
I wasn't aware that it's a state law in PA for phlebotomists to only be allowed to try taking blood three times at one time. Whoever the woman was that I was assigned to could not find a vein to get blood. This was important for medical reasons to get done and she was very unprofessional and rude. I recently moved to PA from Ohio, so I didn't know a phlebotomist here can only try three times. I kindly said to her 'can I ask why you can only try three times?' And she gave me a nasty uncaring look and replied quickly 'because I'm not a doctor'. After I left, all I could think was no shit you aren't a doctor, it's not a doctor's job to take blood, it's your job( a phlebotomists' job). I thought it was very unprofessional. I've never dealt with someone in the medical field that didn't truely care or have passion for helping me, especially if I ask a question. I don't remember her name, and if I did I wouldn't put her name out there. I just wish people would stop and remember the reason why they chose that field. Yes, money is great for most of the opportunities, but you really have to care and want to make a difference in order to be successful in the medical field. Even if someone asks a stupid common sense question, just remember there is a reason they are choosing you to ask. If someone asks me anything, I feel honored because they care about my opinion and what it is I have to say. Just saying, sorry for rambling!
If I could give this place negative stars, I would.  It Sucked!  My girlfriends and I were given free entrance and we were promised free champagne if we showed up between 11:00 and 12:00.  We showed up at 11:40 and they were out of champagne, and didn't offer us any other free drinks as compensation.  That sucked since the free champagne was the only reason we were going.  Then I asked for a water, and they tried to charge me $5 for a bottle of water.  They wouldn't give me tap water until I lied to them and told them I would vomit if they didn't give it to me.  Seriously - what kind of a place hands out free champagne until it's gone, but won't give out free water?  It's like they want people to get out-of-control drunk.  And to top it off the bouncers were jerks.  Please don't go there - it's a waste of resources.
I came in becaue I work around the corner and I always used to come in for lunch. Had the French dip or should i say a bread sanwhich. It would have been nice if the food came to me atleast warm. And if they are going to serve full size sandwiches probably is a good idea to put enough meat in there so you don feel like your just eating bread. I'm going to have to pick a news lunch place.
I wish I could leave no stars. I waited in the drive through for 15 minutes even though there's a 60 second guarantee sign outside. Got no apology. Said to the girl 4 times what I wanted and assumed she got it right...which I should know better than to do. Got home and all of my stuff was wrong. I drove all the way back & got no apology and was told to wait in the drive through line again. Which took another 15 minutes. Never coming back. I'd rather drive to Henderson to get good service.It isn't my fault that you have a mediocre job and hate your life.
Only giving it a 1 because you can't do zero.  We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   Pops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    So not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get "close" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   Also it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.  Not a happy experience.
Ordered on Ritual but was not rdy when i went there, the worker doesn't seem to be well trained and it was obviously too busy for the one worker. So not really the employee's fault. Onto the food, $15 for a plate... And it wasnt even that much food. This place not aight
Roach by the kitchen door... Considering floor was filthy, makes sense roaches a hanging out. Must note,: roach was on the back squirming around like it was dying and after the staff was notified, they came and swept it up.
A little grossed out sitting here, already ordered and look up to see waitress chomping down on corn on the Cobb. Grabs a napkin wipes her face and then walks into the back kitchen where I can see through the apron her preparing food. Never washing her hands.  Yuck yuck yuck.
Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there. There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums. Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. No excuses.It also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards
Well even though the staff was decently nice when my fiancé and I brought in his car to check why the AC was not working and have ONLY the ac checked we were told that the cabin air filter plus numerous other maintenance items needed to be done. They said as soon as the cabin air filter was taken out the ac worked beautifully! So great you found nothing wrong with the ac just do the filter and other things! Well less than 24 hours later low and behold the ac started to malfunction... Again! We take it back to check it again and get told they never checked the rest of the ac system and now we have to buy a $300 blower motor and that is before labor! We had spent every penny we had already on the other work because we trusted that the tech did his job. Boy were we wrong. Now here we are an uber driver who now can't work because it's 115 degrees out and his ac only works sometimes. How do we pay our bills? No help, no caring, no claimed responsibility on their part and we are left with nothing. Thanks for destroying us!
Went in for an estimate to add Bluetooth phone capability.  They told me I had an amplifier with optical cables - WRONG.  They told me I had to replace all my speakers - WRONG AGAIN.  Estimate came to $900.  Went to Soundwerks and Sun Valley Stereo.  The Soundwerks guy actually spent the time to remove my stereo to see what I actually had.  Both estimated around $600.
I grew up going to this hotel and wanted to try and start the same tradition with my family and son.  Boy oh boy has this hotel gone downhill....was so disappointed.  There were many problems:1.) Check in took 2 effing hours, we didn't get into our room until 2 am2.) Be careful, you don't want to sleep on the side where the Cromwell hotel is...their rooftop club will keep you up all night long :(3.) This hotel is no longer family friendly, it's more fitted for 21 year olds.4.)  Was super sad about their new Go Pool crap, use to be open to all guests, now only 21 and over and more of a club now with super loud, annoying music5.)  Families are now asked to be shoved into their tiny beach club pool, so ridiculous and insulting for families.6.) DO NOT try to be in the lobby when the party pool closes at 7 pm...drunk people everywhere7.) The rooms are renovated,  but so ugly and they did a really bad job8.) Elevators are scary9.) The buffet used to be amazing...it's terrible nowI was very disappointed and sad that we will no longer be carrying on the family tradition at this hotel...can't believe I wasted money there.  I wouldn't even stay here if it was just my friends and I, terrible.  So mad my son had to endure this icky hotel.
A lot of the 1 star reviews seem to be about the portion size of the meals and I have to agree. But my main issue was the service. When our server came to take our ordered I let her know I wanted a tempura roll and a bowl of the ramen and her response was "That's it?" First of all, what would be the issue with ordering that for two people plus drinks. I find it extremely rude to question the lack of portions for my order. There is a warning about the volume and the vibe of the restaurant before being seated. My boyfriend and I thought there would be loud music but the restaurant MC was more annoying than entertaining. I would definitely not go back.
I like Church's better than other fast chicken places, but this location is horrible. The first time I went, I waited in the drive through almost 40min. By the time I got to the window, they were out of the food I ordered. I waited a year before trying again. Second time I waited almost 20min in the drive through. The chicken sandwich was not good at all. Won't be back.
I would not recommend this place. We went on 7/2/16. First the chips were stale and the salsa had no flavor, watery. My husbands Michelada was not cold, he had to ask for ice. His fish ceviche was boiled instead of cooked in lime and his tostada was warm not cold. He ordered shrimp and octupus cocktail they gave him shrimp and oysters, it also smelled bad. My mexican plate was also not good. The beans had no flavor, the enchilada & chile relleno were not good. I was only able to eat half. My sons fries were over priced.  The floor was dirty, at the entrance, that should of been our first clue. We went because we heard promo on spanish radio. Thought it would be good. This is my first review and for the first time we wished we would have asked for our money back. We are definitely not going back.
This was the worse experience I have ever had an urgent care facility. The staff was subpar the doctor was rude, inconsiderate, and my discharge papers listed symptoms that were undescribed by me. When I refused to sign the discharge papers I asked to speak with the physician. The doctor begin to explain to me that I gave a vague description so he decided to list just something on my discharge papers and that it didn't matter what it said. I explained to him that I felt uncomfortable signing my papers being that my symptoms though vague  they were given to him and the symptoms listed on the discharge papers had nothing to do with the way I felt and that I am concerned.  The doctor became angry and I rate telling me that I can go and see someone else but good luck with that! I told him that I will be reporting him. .., I am shocked at the type of treatment I have received here . I will be making this less that acceptable treatment I have received at the Urgent Care Extra known by all. The Doctor I saw today was Dr. Timothy Eichenlaub ( bald guy with bad teeth and an adittude to match).
ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY. If I had negative stars OH WOULD I USE THEM. ALL I am trying to do is change my damn delivery address. BUT NO apparently this is not allowed. You have to call in and sit on hold FOR FOREVER. I have called EVERY DAY FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS and have gotten NO WHERE. This is ridiculous. I have emailed Customer Service every day and still have received nothing DESPITE the fact that their website says that in 24-48 hours someone will contact you. This is complete bull. Now I am trying to cancel my service but this is impossible as well. WORST COMPANY EVER. STEER CLEAR.
We went to tour the Stetson earlier today. When we arrived we were told to wait 20-25 minutes for a tour because the ONE person working was assisting someone else. Luckily after waiting a few minutes, the assistant manager showed up to help us. We took a tour and the community seemed nice enough. However, the assistant manager who was helping us was completely incompetent. She did not know pricing or what was available for our time frame. She also took us to see an apartment and then we found it was occupied so we couldn't even see it. It looks terrible for the company that she was so incompetent and unaware of the community. At the end of the tour, she told us that she didn't have anything available at the end of July when we wanted to move in. We told her we would be in touch, and got up to leave. She proceeded to do a hard sales pitch (probably because her boss was around the corner), and tried to get us not to leave. We left with a bitter taste in our mouths. We looked on their site later that evening and found that there were several apartments becoming available in mid to late July. Guess we will take our business to one of the plenty other luxury apartments in old town.
I'm disappointed to see so many Yelpers give this place any more than one star. I would take Panda Express any day over this joint.I ordered to-go from their lunch menu: sweet and sour chicken with vegetable lo mein and rice ($8).It took nearly 30 minutes for it to arrive so now I'm rushing back to my office to chow it down. It's a good thing I didn't have to rush because the food was so bland I didn't even bother finishing it. I should have known it was going to be gross when my server pulled the lo mein out of a giant rice steamer. The noodles were not seasoned (btw- where were the vegetables in my vegetable lo mein?!) and way over cook. Maybe it was because the noodles have been sitting in the rice steamer all day!The sweet and sour chicken was pretty much non-seasoned, chicken nuggets swimming in sweet and sour sauce. There were some chunks of green peppers too but I couldn't get over the canned sweet and sour sauce that was infiltrating into my rice pile.The best part of the meal were the fortune cookies. Mine said-- Next time, drive a bit east and you will find Pei Wei... or maybe that Chicago Hamburger Company across the street will do too!Don't waste your money folks. Judging from the 4 people eating there during rush lunch hour, this place will be closed soon.
Ugh! From hostess, to 15 minutes for a waiter, to mediocre at best food (flautas were blandly acceptable).  Don't waste your time or money.
Five dispatches were sent for me and none arrive.  Confronted one cab driver who turned out to be nice. Told me that all the drivers had been told not to go to Oakland because the congestion was terrible.  She surmised that they were deliberately ignoring the call.  It turned out to be a ten minute trip and she received a nine dollar tip.  Dispatchers began hanging up on me. I was lied to several times - told that you couldn't books fares online anymore and etc. Very disreputable company with sleazy and amoral employees. Update July, 2018: why is Uber under attack? This is a perfect example of why I avoid cab companies.
I have been a petsmart customer for years. Even make a donation to their charity every time I shop there. Tonight's treatment by Chris and the cashier was unaccepptable. I was trying out different brands of dog kibble. Bought a high quality brand  a couple weeks ago. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Exchanged that for two different brands a week ago (Purina beyond and Hills diet). My dogs wouldn't go near the food. The Hills brand smelled awful. So I went to return the food. I walked in. Saw only one receipt was in the bag. I went to my vehicle to find the other one. When I came back, Chris is standing a few feet away from the register holding my receipt watching for me. I asked if there was a problem. His reply "well yeah." He begins questioning me why I am returning the merchandise and mentions I seem to be continuously returning items. His question felt like he was interrogating me. I immediately took offense to his attitude and demeanor towards me. I said, my dogs wouldn't eat either one and one brand smells horrible. And proceeded to say I only returned one bag of food previously. Never returned any items prior to that. The prior cashier who helped me last time let me know food items can be returned if the dogs won't eat the food. Chris continued his line of questioning asking me what am I feeding the dogs now. Am I exchanging for another bag. I answered his questions and I shouldn't have had to. It's none of his business what I feed them now. And I do not want another bag. I'm upset. Frustrated by his actions and I rightfully tell him so. Telling him how I feel he is making me feel. I grabbed my receipt from him which he was holding onto tightly showing I am not liking his service. handed it back to the cashier and Chris continues to tell me, he is allowing the return. Absolutely right he is. Their no hassle free return policy was a huge hassle. I'm clearly unhappy and Chris continues to be a condescending on purpose by asking if there anything more he could do for me. I responded with after they way he treated me, I'm going to ask him for help. He continued his belligerent responces in which I told him to stop. How dare he treat me with such disrespect. As I'm walking out the store he continued to berate me with have a nice day. That is unprofessional. Awful customer service. Petsmart has lost my business for good. My treatment doesn't end with this review. I will be following up with the store manager and their head quarters.
I visited this restaurant last time in 2015 and gave low rating then. Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.
I'm over 30 years old and I'm a big girl. You can just imagine how many buffets I have eaten at. I have NEVER been charged for not finishing our food. I can understand if it was a whole roll of sushi, or if it was self served. Nope. The food was served to us, not knowing the size of the portions. We couldn't finish the plain noodles (no meat, no veggies) and fried rice that we ordered because we thought, being carbs, it would be smaller portions. Nope again! Then BAM! They charged us for NOT FINISHING our noodles and rice. Wow. Not coming back here. I'd rather go and drive an extra 10 mins to Oyshi or Goyemon after this!!
Absolutely terrible service. Ordered take out, showed up at the time they told us it would be ready. Sat at the bar for 20 minutes without a server or bartender asking us if we wanted a drink or talking to us at all. Over an hour after our food was supposed to be ready, the guy, supposedly the owner, comes up and hands us the bill. It was very overpriced. He didn't apologize and didn't explain why it took almost TWO HOURS to make 4 people's take out Chinese food. The food was also terrible quality. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, I'd give it a three at most. I had beef chop suey that had very little flavor, and my brothers both had chicken chow mein that had almost no noodles in them. The staff was inconsiderate and there was no excuse for their tardiness, as there was maybe 5 other patrons in the restaurant. There are many other good Chinese/Asian restaurants in the area, and needless to say, I will not be coming here again.
Chips and salsa sub par.  Cheap tequila in the margarita.  Green chile enchiladas were saucy and too tangy, without any real definition between ingredients.  Atmosphere open in a bad way--one big room with a bunch of tables.  Overall, dive quality food at Scottsdale prices.  Will not return.
This hot and ready pizza was definitely not the greatest.  The pepperoni is clustered around the center.  The sauce has a spicy kick to it, and neither my children not myself liked it.  The crazy bread is tasty though.
if i could give them zero stars i absolutely would.   i closed my personal and business accounts after 13 years   Bad service. Understaffed.  Sad to see a formerly good bank in decline.   Stay away from here unless you enjoy long wait times  corporate red tape and frustration.   Last and final visit i wanted to get 1000 cash and there was one clerk. 1 person in line ahead of me and it took 23 minutes.  ridiculous   Bofa. you need help. fast.
If pretentiousness had a capital, this place would be it.  Went there with family to go hang out.  Apparently, there's a dress code there which prohibits Nike Shox.  According to the bouncer, they are trying to foster a business casual dress code.  Ok, fine.  More on this later.  Luckily, I live close by and grab some nicer shoes and it met the bouncer's approval.  Unfortunately, he didn't mention the cover charge, which took me by surprise when the cashier told me to fork it over.  Even though it was $10 for locals, who ever heard of charging people to get into a bar?  Whatever.  I pay my way in and met up with the gang.  Service was slow, music was way too loud and for $8 for a domestic beer did not impress me.  Remember that policy about the business casual dress code?  Funny thing about that.  As I was out on the patio, I happen to spot a guy in shorts and tennis shoes wandering abouts.  Selective enforcement perhaps?  In short, it's over rated and overpriced!
It has slowly but surely gone downhill. Friday night and it's empty so I think other people are thinking the same thing. They messed up every dish we ordered.
yo, this location is as bad as these other reviews make it out-staff didn't know menu/ specials that we came for-dropped one of our orders on the floor in front of us -packed so that my food all fell out of containers into bag anyway-one order of mashed potatoes didn't even have gravy-lobby a mess-watched someone order and pay for a large order of spicy only to be told they don't have any -no napkins/ utensilsall of these seem minor but all in the course of a 3 minute stop? naw. just go to a different location. this one apparently doesn't even participate in the monthly specials/ promotions which is the reason I go to this chain in the first place
I was very excited to order from Mr. Falafel this evening.  I placed my order around 4:30pm directly on their website. Anyway, it is clearly marked that they deliver to the H9R area.  One can also find this restaurant listed on the Tasty Boom food delivery service as well.  I have double checked that I am indeed part of the delivery zone.  I received an order confirmation from Tasty Boom (as they are in charge of all the online orders).  After waiting for an hour and half I called the restaurant's direct line.  The person who picked up told me that a representative from Tasty Boom was supposed to call me because they had decided to cancel the order.  I never received any phone call, text, or e-mail stating that the order had been cancelled.  The Mr. Falafel employee also asked me, "If I just placed a bunch of things in my order to make the minimum?"  I then explained to him that I ordered what I wanted.  Also, I am not sure why "what" I decide to order is any of his concern as long as I meet the delivery requirements.  I expect that even if I was just ordering extra things I still would expect the food to be delivered.  I then called Tasty Boom and they told me that the restaurant had chosen to cancel the order because they felt like it wasn't "worth it" for them to deliver.  I would like to note that the website states a $20.00 minimum and my order was $25.00.  Also, the restaurant is located on Saint Jean's Boulevard and is a less than 10 minute drive from my location even with lots of traffic...what a joke and what a waste of time.
I dropped my car off at fabulous Freddy's yesterday while I was getting my hair done. When I came to pick up my car I noticed the back still had some dirt on it. I wasn't going to make it a big deal and was just going to wipe it off at home but when I got home I continued to look over my car. The cup holder was never cleaned out and other parts of the car looked like they were never wiped down. I have a really nice brand new 2016 BMW and I was highly displeased :(. Save yourself the $27 and do it yourself.
Empty restaurant at 8pm, bar closing, no chef cooking and absolutely nobody in the restaurant.  We made the mistake of staying.  Fish restaurant with two choices of fish, but mostly fried.  Stay away
Hmm.. I never write reviews on here, but I felt I had to with this place.First of all, it was expensive for the quantity that they give you. If the food was actually good and they had the atmosphere to match it would've made more sense to me. That was not the case - the restaurant was basic and to be honest, pretty run down for a restaurant on King West I'd expected better. The staff was rude with answering any questions and when the food came the ingredients were old and tasted like MOLD. I didn't even finish it before the waitress took it away and didn't think twice to ask why I left it (most staff will ask if you enjoyed the food at a good quality place - not here!) I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone in the area AND I agree with the post about food poisoning I was sick for two days after eating here!!! YUCK, disgusting. :(
Pulled in for an oil change. Have no problem waiting. Dude is posted up against the wall doing nothing, sees me, does not acknowledge me. Drive around to the other side. Roll my window down. Looks at me, still nothing. See another guy who's actually working on a vehicle who I believe was on his way over to acknowledge me, but i had already started driving off. No worries, I'll spend my money elsewhere.
Hour wait even with reservations. We made 7:00pm reservations for a party of 2 and did not get seated until 8pm and that was after having to ask the host several times, and then finally for a manager. It took at least 15 minutes for the employees to find her. This location has just really gone down hill, I've been to many Benihanas throughout the country from locations in Atlanta, Detroit, San Diego, and this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Benihana's. It looked as if they were short staffed there were at least 4 grills that were not being used. One positive experience was our chef Joseph made the food delicious and of course entertaining. The manager did seem understanding and apologized and was willing to try and make our visit better. But, still will not be returning to this location.
Got take out sushi today - half of the avocado was brown - like really brown.  If this is a sushi place you would think the products they use in AVOCODO sushi would be fresh.  Or at least call the customer & say that the avocados aren't good - would you like something else.  Not just send the product on it's way - my hubby picked it up - so not sure if he even looked at it before taking it.  I would have taken one look & refused it.  Got all the way home & it just looked gross - feel really bad cause my little daughter was the one that wanted it .  We picked out the good ones & tossed the rest.  Now - saying this to the manager - he didn't even offer a refund or an apology - second manager did - & offered an apology which the first manager didn't even offer.  Really disappointing.  Feeling sick  with stomach pains - which is what prompted me to call.  Very disappointing.
I really liked Sakana when it first opened, I went there for lunch a couple of times but because the 'word wasn't out' it was very slow, I was immediately seated, the service was quick and the sushi was good.  You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.
Waiter was good but the steak gorgonzola was a small portion for the price and where me and my wife was there was several nat's flying and went into my food we had to move got the food there was comp or anything spent 50 dollars for bug food afterwards my wife went to talk to the manager saying we will not return he asked if we paid and we said yes and he sorry we can't do anything have a nice day stay away if you want bugs in your food unless you don't mind paying the money for bug food I will never return to this one I'll drive to go to my other one
I don't know if this is the correct PODS location, but this comment is about the entire PODS company, not a specific location.The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, "Oh yeah. The container arrived last week." It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.
NFL football on and I'm listening to Casey Kasum tip hits from 1978. What is the target demographic? This isn't the only time I left due to terrible ambiance. I'll keep  giving this place a chance because of the happy hour pizza and wings. I hope they will find an identity.
If you like the way cake mix from a box tastes then this is the place for you. I felt like I could've easily made these at home.
Please thank your head server for telling us to sit far away at a table far away from everyone because according to her our 2yo twin boys are loud. We had just walked in for 20 seconds! Her actions made it possible to have an excellent dinner at Bachi Burger. We have been there three previous times with the worst sounds made being the little soy sauce dishes being tossed on the floor. We were seated at the last table in the restaurant closest to the restrooms at the time. The same person sat us that time as well. She is a shorter Asian woman with glasses. Our boys are not children who cry throughout dinner, in fact they do not cry at all when they are out eating. Because they love food!They are the type who flirt with the other very friendly tall server and wave at the man who brought our iced teas. You lost repeat customers who will take every chance that we get to make sure everyone knows what kind of a person you choose to employ. Very rude and poor customer service! I have never had heard anyone works in service industry would talk to customer like that.
I'm surprise this place stays open, I assume it does good business since it's conveniently located on the strip.take my advice and save yourself and eat somewhere else.-they charged ridiculous prices for Mexican food. Expect $10-15 per person for a small plate. I order the 2 combo with rice, beans, chicken soft taco and tamale. It was not filling, and definitely not tasty. -chips and salsa was below par. -the guacamole was $10!!! for a small serving. The waitress did not bother telling us how much it was. -incompetent workers. Seriously, how hard is it get hot water? first time, you brought out cold water. We asked for hot water.-Don't bother asking for suggestions, their not at all familiar with their menu!
Horrible place to watch the NFL playoffs!! With about 25 tv's they only have 5 tv's with the game on. Thought this is supposed to be. Sports bar!! Not coming here again to watch any NFL games. Even asked the younger owner and he wouldn't change the tv's or put the sound on to at least here the game.
Frightful experience. The front staff was very unhelpful and gave me the wrong results and when I pointed out that I was given the results for the wrong hip, they gave me the run around and insisted they had done the reading on the correct side.  Absolutely no concern for the patient and told me to drag myself over to my primary care and have them sort it out.  My primary care doctor was appalled and promptly had the receptionist call them to insist they re-process the results on the correct hip STAT!  If you have any work done at this place, make sure you double check the results. Good thing they're not surgeons - gulp!
Spent over $30 trying to order a new 52 comic book with a hard cover from this store. I attempted to cancel this order via phone today during business hours with nobody answering at all, three weeks after placing this order with nothing to show for it. When I arrived to the store in person to cancel the request, they claimed it could not be done; their reasoning was nobody would ever buy the hard cover of this book, at a COMIC BOOK store. This comment was than followed up with the idea of getting a fraction of the money back as store credit...Got the same hardcover book for 12 dollars on Amazon in two days.My bank agreed, I had every right to not process the transaction due to lack of service, and it was canceled on my behalf and determined to be fraud.
Terrible interaction with the local community.  Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. Neo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.Yesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.The unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was "Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  " if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said "Let's take the disabled veteran out of it".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a "Show of Force." We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  Neo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are false. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. Secondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  Lastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  The entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire "rigged system"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. I asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.Additionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said "thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.
Dos Mas has to be one of the worst Mexican food restaurants we have ever been to. So where do I begin, we got the menu and there was not much of a selection. So we decided to order from the appetizer side and had the Mini Chimis, rice, beans anda quesadilla. The server brought us some chips and salsa. The chips tasted like old oil and the salsa was clumpy and watery. We got our quesadilla and Mini Chimis. The Mini Chimis had no flavor unless you call the taste of oil flavor. The beans also had no flavor and the rice was under cooked. I would like to say the only thing there that did taste good was the water but that was before the server put her finger in my cup to refill it. Can't say that we will ever make it back there..
Boo!  I was excited to use my groupon for this nearby salon in upscale Dana Park, unfortunately I was quite disappointed.  My first visit I waited on my hairdresser well past my appointment time and was disgusted that the previous client's hair was still on the floor around my chair as well as on the chair.  Then I was covered with a dirty apron, also covered in hair.  I decided to give them a second chance and again was disappointed.  I struggled making an appointment and when the receptionist finally offered an available appointment I was told that they could not take any groupons for that day.  I did finally get an appointment and when I showed up, I was told my appointment was for days later!  Then the hairdresser said I couldn't be accommodated because she had paperwork to do.!?  Too much drama, hassle, and lack of professionalism.
Before I get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a little bit of background.  I "Yelped" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  My boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.Okay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.  I, for one, will be spreading the word and NOT in a good way.  Sincerely,A very disappointed EX-patron
This last year, I finally saved up for the down payment on a car. I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.I was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. Unfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. The weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).My brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? My experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.
So..... - they sold me a car with a bad clutch - the car only had 40k miles - took it back a couple weeks later when I started noticing it, I noticed it the first day I had it, but was like "maybe it just delays a little, it has such low miles" - nope - bad clutch - service told me it was going to be $160 to look at it - I talked to the salesman and finance - they blew me off like nothing - So I drove it as long as I could with a screwed up clutch - the clutch was $1200+ to fix at the dealer - I got it done at a local shop for just over $1000... #1 I and nobody I know will every buy a car from them again - #2 that is what I get for buying a foreign piece of crap - I will only buy American or Toyota (they are mostly made in the U.S. anyways) - Oh and free car washes?? - yeah if you have an hour or so to wait
Honestly the looks the girls give my fiancé and myself when we come in for each appointment is disgusting, to feel judged and looked at a certain way for absolutely no reason bugs me to no end, they don't know my life they don't know her life they don't know our ages or one single thing about either of us, to add on to that we have had 3 reschedules for 2 appointments now, 2 reschedules for one single appointment in which we were pushed out one week further and again one week further until they got their stuff figured out and can successfully schedule a consistent appointment schedule, we had our first ultrasound today and the woman who did the ultrasound was just an angry woman in which you are putting your trust in to measure and check your babies health and anatomy, she was rude to my fiancé when my fiancé was asking one simple question she replied with I need to focus right now, just let me do these measurements, to add to this whole ordeal, the environment of this office is just not good at all, who watches murder shows on TV with children present in the lobby and blood and gore all over the screen? We were anxiously anticipating an answer on the blood work we did from our last appointment and was not given a single answer and why you ask? Because they showed that we missed our appointment to get it done and we were told that we needed to get it done ASAP, well if you guys actually communicated to the lab office and did your paperwork correctly you would have seen that we went in a did do the lab work just as you told us to do so, we do our part as parents and are consistent with our things in life, don't try to blame us for missing an appointment to get the most important lab work done, which was testing for Down syndrome and other birth defects, would have really loved to know the results to the blood work for our first child. Thanks! One last thing, to the girl who has the short black hair at the front desk and the dermal on her neck who keeps giving myself and my fiancé dirty looks, if you don't like what you do then get a different job and quit staring you may be unhappy but don't make everyone's life as miserable as yours, all of these reviews speak for themselves I would suggest going somewhere else, ANYWHERE else than this place, I would avoid this place at all costs, save yourself the headaches and anger from the disrespectful girls at the front desk
How can this place still be open !!!!I order a large ox tail $16. Plus tax .To start off food was warm looks  like food inspector  hasn't been there for a while .A few pieces  of meat that was very plan tasting. Worst that I've ever had .  There was no spice bottle around  . There a great place just on 10  or sure what made me even go there .I blame YELP for my bad decision . See picture  of my shiny oxtail .
I haven't been to this place in years, although it's painfully and tauntingly close to home.  Reason being that the service sucked, and the food was marginal.But, Ari was closed last week when I had an afternoon craving, so I thought I'd give EE another chance.BIG mistake and waste of $25.I order tempura and sushi to go.  The sushi was beyond aromatic (smelly) and the seaweed wraps were so stale, I couldn't get my canines to rip through it to even chew the food.  The tempura was made in what seemed like pancake batter, it was so heavy and unappealing.  How hard is it to screw up something fried?  Ask EE.Basically ended up taking a bite of everything, and then throwing all of it out.Never again.
WORST SERVICE EVER . AVOID AVOID AVOID I came here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation for 10 .when we arrived we got two tables one got all you can eat and another got the woonam and couple choice. Each one you can choose 3 meats and get soy bean soup. So while we were ordering our meats ( that was available on both sections ) she was saying how we choose too much from one list , so we ordered 4 meats and two portions of two of them.- we asked for water, received it after 20 minutes of asking and we never saw them again -asked for soybean paste never got it As we started getting full I noticed that we had only gotten one soy bean soup and nothing else, later when I had to go pay I asked about our soups and she said "oh, you didn't get it, I guess I left it at the wrong table " like wtf? not even an apologize.After we received the check and people pulled out cards and cash she started to sigh and look annoyed so I just paid and left. It wasn't until after we paid and left we realized we never got one of the meats. This is out raging how horrible the service is , the food was good but it can't make up for how horrible the service was .
Garbage! How do you mess up breakfast? Was on vacation in Vegas, tired from a full day of traveling, just wanted something quick. The eggs were mushy,Taste like instant eggs with powdered cheese. One slice of toast, burnt on one side and not even brown on the other side. And to top it off the potatoes were French fries. Please don't waste your time and money eating at this place.
I'm writing this based on the service and not the food... since i didn't stick around to taste anything. My partner and I wandered into this restaurant and were seated almost immediately. The restaurant was 1/4 full and that may be an exaggeration. I noticed right away that the wait staff looked disorganized. Eye contact with several of them was made in hopes to get a greeting and drink order in. Ten minutes later, new guests walked in and were greeted/served, while I sat around waving my hand to get attention. Nope didn't get any. Walked right out of there.
If ZERO stars were possible this gym would be getting that from me. My husband went to this gym today with the 14 pass and at the end of his workout inquired about membership. The lady he spoke to was extremely rude. She told him that he should not have come in without checking with someone first ( mind you that the staff does not show up till 9am and he began his workout at 7am). After scolding him for being at the gym she asked him to leave and said that they were very selective in the people whom the allowed to join their gym. I'm not the type to write reviews but obvious racism is a very good reason for me to break a habit. The lady was very condescending. She is Caucasian and my husband is Latino.
SCAM!!!!! Bunch of sales crap and no you get nothing for free accept $5 for valet parking after wasting over 2 hours. Tickets are crap don't buy into u wining on the radio.
horrible.   Never again.  I booked this through the airline  (Allegiant). waiting no less than 50 minutes so far and no hope of the shuttle in sight.  I've seen a one driver go by twice, we still wait.  I came to Vegas for some much needed R&R.  So far I can't get away from the airport.  Call Uber, probably about the same pride.  Never again for this outfit.
I've been dining at Pei Wei locations all over the Valley for years and years. After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. A few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  I called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.A month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.Tonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.  And as expected, no sauce for the crab wontons, no napkins, no soy sauce & no fortune cookies.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon - at least not to this location - they really need to get it together.  We're tired of the issues every time we eat in or get take-out from here.
Wow, sooo disappointed! Our first time here and the brunette waitress at the bar had no personality and was very unfriendly, obviously hasn't smiled in a very long time. Pretty sure it's the same one in the other reviews. We waited 45 minutes before anyone came back to see if we needed anything. Would of been great to have a couple more drinks and another appetizer but apparently we had our invisible attire on. We like to find places for work events etc...but will never come back again. Too bad, the atmosphere was great but the service is terrible and so is the bartenders attitude. Tried to contact the manager Sandra, had to leave a voicemail.
I was craving a bagel sandwich but was pretty tired of TH's, so when I saw this place online I was eager to try it out.  The other reviews didn't hurt either, so I made the effort to go there.I cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).  Salt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.   The presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.There is a sign on the wall announcing a change in management, which I could possibly have forgiven their lack of knowledge of menu prep if the changeover date wasn't listed as 2010!!The people serving me were Japanese, and I suspect they don't know anything about Jewish deli at all.  They really should stick to what they know best, and that isn't deli any way shape or form.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
I had heard good things about this hotel but in my first and only stay it was pretty miserable. Vending machines on my floor didn't work the entire 3 days I was there. Internet was down more often than not. Room service unavailable because ovens were down. The 45 minute fire alarm at 3 am was the icing on the cake. I would not recommend this place to anyone ever. I'll make sure my company travel agent also takes this off the list.
Absolute WORST EXPERIENCE. I do love Hooters Wings, but won't EVERRR GO BACK HERE. Extremely EXHAUSTED I DECIDED TO GO DOWN TO THE HOOTERS RESTAURANT. Unbeknownst to me it takes over 45 mins to get a 10 pc wings to go. So I thought. After waiting over 40 mins while sitting at the bar, I asked the hostess "does it normally take this long?". She replied "what did you have?" I stated a 10 pc Hot. She turned grab a bag and said "well we didn't know where you went"........ ummmmmm at the same bar you brought my water and receipt to. ON THE SAME CHAIR!!!!!! I asked for the Manager and Mikey comes up and immediately starts to explain how long the wings take.......I'm looking really puzzled now. I'm focused on the customer service aspect of being notified that my order was ready then handed a bag with cold wings. I verrrrrryyyyyyy calmly stated Mikey I'm simply providing feedback on my experience and food takes time to cook I understand that, HOWEVER BETTER POLICIES SHOULD BE IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO YOUR TO-GO CUSTOMERS.
DO NOT SETTLE! KEEP SEARCHING! WASTE OF MONEY!This hotel was NOT what I expected for a Las Vegas property in the center of the strip. Do not be fooled by the lobby, the rest of the hotel is old and outdated?Hallways smell, scuffs and dirt marks on the doors, directional signs missing from the wall, moulding was breaking off. Inside the room, outlets barely work, furniture was chipped, my dresser was missing a top drawer, vents clogged with dirt. There are about 15 elevators and only about 5 were working! The pool is nice....but all vegas hotel pools are nice.As much money as they make daily; there is NO REASON this hotel should look like it did. I will NOT stay there again. Keep searching for place to stay. I've stayed at Super 8's that were better than the Flamingo!
I love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  Carnevino in the Venetian put me off making fun of Mario Batali forever.  His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help.   We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis.   Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  Sorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.
I know you're salty because your food tastes like it, chefs are creepy and sweaty mixed with frump and seems very unsanitary, waitress is a huge snail yet there is no escargot on the menu? everything sucks.. looks so dirty i swear i sat in the chair and dust flew up. if I could give zero stars I would, 1 even seems to be too much. Party of four wishes we would've went to our regular Ballentines spot for a steak and fries.
Very very unprofessional place. A few weeks back I got my hair cut by Mustafa and It was wonderful as he gave me exactly what I wanted. Came back again yesterday to get a bang trimming and they were clearly NOT busy at all but I heard the receptionist say "give her a few more minutes" and we waited like 20-30 minutes. The hair stylist I had was exceptionally rude for no reason and cut my bangs way shorter than I've asked and even handed me the straightener and told me to straighten it myself if I wanted to so bad. Like ? Are you kidding me? Bang trimming was free but I would've been happy to pay if they were to even remotely try to do a good job. Receptionist was always rude to me no matter what as well. Never EVER coming back to this place. This place is a gamble and really a hit n miss with their service. I used to tell all my friends about this but I'm telling everyone to NEVER come to this place again.
Got a response from the manager via Yelp. He asked for my phone number so he could talk to me.  I promptly responded and gave him my phone number to call me.  Well, it has been a few days and no one has called me.  Is this some sort of scam to get my phone number?  Or do they just don't give a shit about their diners' opinions of their restaurant?  Once again, I reiterate my point: this restaurant sucks big time in service and management.
I was sent to Vision Source South Hills for a second opinion. I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: "patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.
I'm loathe to have my first review be a bad one, but I feel sort of compelled to write this review.On a lovely holiday Monday, after some frisbee in the park, some friends and I decided we needed some food.  The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  Well, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.Now, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  First we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  The good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.Needless to say we won't go back.  There are too many awesome restaurants and patios to waste any more time there.  We did enjoy the beautiful sunshine though : )
Not worth it. My friend and I both felt sick after ordering take out. I suggest going somewhere else...
The artwork is great.  Very striking and captivating images that seemingly pop out of the frames with the vibrant  hues and colors.The studio and it's salesmanship/service is decidedly less than impressive.   I ordered two pieces, Gorillas in The Mist and Tree of Truth.  The original art dealer who made our transaction was let go for untold reasons and was replaced by someone else(Mike?).   I only know this because I called to get a follwup on the delivery of the photographs because I have yet to hear from the guy who took over the account.  I think if someone took over the account, they should be taking the initiative to notify the customers of that change.  I basically had been getting no response from the emails I sent to my original dealer, and I had to call to find out what happened.About four weeks later, I received the Tree of Trurth(alternatively called Wisdom Tree).  However, it was only by accident that I received it.  I stopped by my local USPS office to pick up an article by another merchant, and to my surprise the clerk brought me a package from the Rodney Lough Studio.  I have no idea how  long it had been at the USPS office, because I was never notified by Mike, or frankly anyone from this Las Vegas studio that the piece had been shipped out.  I wasn't notified by USPS either, but we all know and expect crappy service from the USPS - the main difference is that I didn't pay USPS thousands of dollars for a certain level of service.  I am left wondering:If Rodney Lough Jr. Sells their pieces of artwork as being something of value and something to treasure...Why would they send it via the UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE like its junk mail?? Why not give the customer at least an email notification that it has been sent out???I wonder if the people at the Peter Lik galleries provide better customer service?  Something that extends beyond the swipe of the credit card?  I am glad the Wisdom Tree was not lost or damaged in the USPS office, but I certainly expected better service than I have received.  Still waiting on the Gorillas in the Mist....hopefully it will be delivered to my door like they originally promised, and not by USPS.
Arrived at 130pm for lunch. Seated ourselves on the patio as usual. We frequent this location. But not anymore. It's 212pm and and we have received chips and salsa, and a menu but no service. No order even after my wife went in and asked for the server. Seems the place is back to the ridiculously bad service we have had some years ago!Good luck.
I live around the corner from here and thought me and my daughter would give this place another try as our first visit wasn't so great.. Turns out the second visit wasn't much better. I will say the patio is what got me to go there.  The service is disorganized and slow. I ordered the nachos with cheese and salsa. Adding guacamole and sour cream is a add on (3.00) and adding meat is 4.00. We also ordered calamari. Nachos came before the drinks and were served with all the ads ons ( that I didn't order ). The drinks came and they were great ! Then came the calamari which was deep fried to a crisp. My daughter who loves calamari actually gagged on her first bite. The salt was intense. We waited another 20 minutes before a server came back and told her I would like the bill and I would pay for my drinks, she said sorry brought me the bill without the food on it. I don't usually dictate what I'll pay, however I wasn't paying for that food.Unless I was simply going for the patio I would never chose to eat here.
If there is negative rating, I will choose for this place. We came to this place with group of 5. After we finished disappointed dinner, we asked the waiter for the bill, they add 15% tips on top of it WITHOUT notify us, then we tiped them again, before we left the restaurant, one of our friend figured out the number was not right, so we asked the waiter for the receipt, he told us "Sorry, we don't have your receipt anymore after you guys paid", then we asked if the bill add tips already? The waiter did not willing to response and just told us" I don't know" then walked away. What a shame.All in all, very bad experience, their cheap price come with the consequences. Cheap quality of the broth and food, especially their "famous" lamb slices, bad services, unethical business conduct.Will NOT come back agian.
Food is ok, not happy with service, my waitresses name was Rihanna or something, she was very rude, got our order wrong then didn't seem to care, i suspect she spit in my sauce.
Explain to me why I need to pay for parking when they do NOT have enough spots, they do NOT enforce parking, and we had a handicap guest with us and no handicap spots were available because NON HANDICAP vehicles were parked in handicap spots.  Mangement basically laughed in my face and did not seem to care.  So not worth it NOTHING worse then RUDE STAFF!!!!
I gave this place 2 chances. i love japanese food and really wanted to love this place because it is close to home. I was underwhelmed the first time and disgusted the second time. the food was tasteless and not what the menu stated. Soba noodles are not white, they are buckwheat and are beige at the lightest and brown at the darkest. When I called (i had delivery) to tell them that I did not get what I ordered, I was told that it was correct and I was wrong. Food was tasteless and service was Awful. Do not waste your money or your time.
Absolutely AWFUL!!! The most incredibly unprofessional establishment I have EVER been to. Not only are their prices stupid expensive but they do a terrible job! I think it is pretty pathetic when i can do my own nails and they look much better than someone who is supposed to be a licensed professional. When I went the other day not only were my nails not straight but the technician (Her name was Lin I believe)  flied the skin off the sides of my fingers and made them BLEED!! When i said "uhm I am bleeding" she wiped the blood off (not gently) and tried to act as if it did not happen. I was still charged full price even after being injured! I walked out literally crying because my fingers were burning in so much pain. Later my fiance and I went back to speak with the manager/owner about the situation and he LAUGHED TO OUR FACE!!! He did not apologize, all he said is that he would fix it, but last time I checked you cannot just magically heal someones cut fingers. When I asked to see the license of the technician he said "I do not have to show you that". I find it highly likely that he refused to show us the license because she probably does not have one. There is so much more I could say about how awful they were but I think people should get the idea. I WOULD NOT EVER SUGGEST ANYONE GO HERE!
I came here on a Saturday and the service was horrible. There was no refills on the bread, the food took over 35 minutes to be served. Mind you, I only ordered a sandwich. Please stay away from this place, especially if you're used to good food, service and atmosphere.
I have been going to this restaurant on and off since we moved into the Richmond Hill area 16 years ago. Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.Frankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.
Hard to explain how bad their Shrimp Pad Thai is. But I'll give it a shot. Imagine cooked rice noodles and cooked shrimp. That's it. No sauce, no flavor, no complexity, no effort, no passion, no purpose, no sustenance--need I say more? I have no clue how this passes as Thai much less a restaurant. I would ask for a refund but I'm going to pretend this experience never occurred.
Used to be a good place. Has gone downhill the last few years. I already know their pizza is not good anymore, it was when they first opened, but I was in the mood for pasta and decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves . I ordered to go and when I got their at 8 pm on a Saturday night and there was only one two person table and no other people in the restaurant, I had a feeling something wasn't right. Spent $23.17 on two pastas to go. One the was spaghetti with meat sauce, I would compare it to a can of Chef Boyardee. The other was a pesto pasta with chicken, not very good either. Threw them both in the trashAfter this meal, I also threw my Streets of New York takeout menu in the trash
Ripoff is the only to accurately describe my experience.   To further explain the price was too high for what you got in return which was overcrowding to the point inhibiting participation.  The experience could all be had on wii and a local gym.
We were seated immediately but sat with our feet in the water for 15 minutes without anyone saying a word to us. After our water got cold, we ended up just getting up and leaving. It wasn't until that time anybody said anything to us. Poor service. Would NEVER go back.
I don't get all the good reviews about this place. I came to this place too many times because all my colleagues come here because they don't want to walk outside of the building to have lunch. But if i had the choice, I'd go anywhere but here! They have a lunch menu and i tried all the plates on it in order to find something decent to eat but everything is disgusting. If you want asian food, this is NOT asian! The pad thai taste like spaghetti. Service is ok. Prices are high for the poor quality food. I don't recommend this place.
I tried the cheddar poptopia gourmet popcorn and I was disappointed to say the least. I found it to be tasteless and greasy. Normally I get regular movie popcorn with the white cheddar cheese seasoning, but the movie theatre ran out  (again). I expect at $6.50 for a 125g bag it would  taste "gourmet"...not so much. Suffice to say I will never buy this brand again.
I wish I could give this place 0 stars. By far the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. Typically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. Next, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.Lastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.After all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.If I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. In the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little. Definitely learned my lesson and going to spend the extra cash to stay at a real hotel next time.
We had breakfast at the D Grill. We were all too tired to trek to another GOOD place to eat for breakfast. Plus we had to get to our convention early.How can you mess up breakfast? I mean really? overcooked eggs, burnt coffee? Hard as rock toast and cold?My over easy eggs were fully cooked hard egg yolk inside.Our party were all smiles when we finally leftWe returned the food back 2 times and it still came back horrible.They wanted to comp us for a free breakfast for the next day. We declined, nope not again!
This is BY FAR the worst airport in North America. As a Diamond on Delta I've been thru well over 60 airports and this hole wins by a mile. There is nothing good happening here and I feel for those employed having to work here on a daily basis.
Used to be good, been here a few times on previous Vegas visits however, this time we both got sick. Our friends went there the next day and they too got sick. Something not right.
I came here Christmas Day 2017 to grab a few items the cashier didn't acknowledge me I asked how she was doing she ignored me was absolutely disrespectful. And I came back 15-mins later to return one of the items I bought, I  was with a new cashier and the original cashier made a scene asking if I was ok I had been sniffing my nose but her co-worker who was making a purchase tells me that the original cashier who rung me out says I looked tense. It was humiliating, customers began to stare and I got the manager involved. I was in tears over this. NOT everyone who does returns is a criminal.
Dropped in on a Saturday night....thankfully prior to the rush beginning. We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc. We will not go back
If you lost your ass and hungry ass a homeless person.... this is the place for you! The selection and quality is absolutely horrible. I would not go back to this dump if it were $4.99.
I was also scammed in exactly the same way described as Faith!! Unbelievable! I feel like an idiot!  The sales girl pretends she sees the Beverly Hills Dermatologist who developed the product walking by and she asks him to consult. He pulls out all of these little lights and meters and tells you how Susan Sarandon, Mike Tyson And Gov Browns wife are all his customers among hundreds of other stars and reads emails from all his satisfied customers. I googled him when I got home and there is no such person! He says he is Mica. The most elaborate scheme you will ever see. BEWARE!
Needed some batteries replaced for a couple watches and I live close so I walked down. I showed up 5:20 (40 minutes before closing tim)e. Their open sign was on but the door was locked with a sign on it that read "Out to lunch. Back at 5:30." I thought that was weird to take a lunch right before closing time, but it was only a 10 minute wait, so not really a big deal. I waited until 5:55 and no one ever showed up. A few other people also came by but, just like me, were unable to get service. One of the people said they came by much earlier and said the same sign was up then too. Can't be good for a small business to turn away so many customers.
I was incorrectly billed $11.52 for fuel charges.  When I called to dispute the error, I spoke with Lian Santon.  At first she told me the charge was because the company undercharged me for the vehicle.  When I explained that I made the purchase through hotwire, she then switched the reason for the charge to me upgrading my vehicle at the counter, which was incorrect.  After being placed on hold for a while, she told me the fee was for fuel, yet I brought the vehicle back on full.  After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.  This is pointless to me because if an associate entered a fuel charge in error and the transaction happened weeks ago, it would be difficult to remember this particular transaction given the large volume of rental returns that have taken place since then.
They don't want your business so if you call don't be surprised if you are put on perpetual hold. They will not pick up. Must be sorely understaffed. I am sure the food must be okay since it's Pizza Hut.
Hands were done great by Steve. Pedicure was done by another lady and it was a total fail. She used a drill to sand my toenails down, that dam cheese grater looking thing ripped my heels to shreds and polish was freaking everywhere!
The signage really does catch your eye as you drive by on Sheppard Av. PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here. The moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).On to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.Ariel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I'd rather repress.
They treat patients like an ATM. I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was "pay up or get out" - the officer manager specifically said "we do not do payment plans". They wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain ===== Addendum 7/1/16 Yep ... These lying SOB's billed my insurance Lying , cheating dishonest !!!!
Total ripoff.  The supervisor was sent out because the first guy they sent (twice) couldn't clear the clog.  He poured some chemicals down the drain then gave us a lame story that my pipes were old and we would need to tear into the walls and floor to replace the lines. My husband went to Home Depot and bought a $14 snake and after about 15min had the clog cleared. They still charged us $135 and when i called them to tell them we cleared it ourselves, they just said "that's great". Really???  Buyer beware!
I was told when I signed up the gym was supposed to be open in january, never received a call that they had postponed the opening date.I had cancelled my membership with my other gym and now i have been left without a gym for a whole month. I had to call them in order to find out. Haven't even started going to the gym and already dissapointed.
Awful experience. My girlfriend gifted me an Amazon local deal for an ultimate detail valued at $275 dollars.  I made an appointment for 11 am during my lunch hour so as I can drop the car off and pick it up by 3:30. Long story short, Diego from the shop and his coworker told me that I would need to pay $55 extra because there was dog hair in the back seat and I would have to leave it over night. I told that that that's not possible so they said to get a refund on Amazon and that they could not help me. I wasted time and gas to bring it to the shop and my buddy from work did the same so as he can drive me back to work. Unprofessional outfit with unrealistic value for money.  They also expect a tip on top of the $275 value that the voucher is for. Ridiculous and definitely not worth the money.
One Star because I can't give it negative stars. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. This was the worst "experience" of my life. Disorganized. Pathatic. No one knew what The hell was going on. Half the electronic features weren't working. 3 VIP tickets and gave us nothing extra. Weak ass "hands-on activities". Wish I would've have listened to the guy in ticket line telling all of us not to do it and get money back. Marvel should be ASHAMED to have their name on something so amateur and embarrassing. Save your money. Buy an action figure and play at home.
No need to review this fast food chain in detail -- but it generally is one of the more healthier choices out there.  Unfortunately this location is *extremely* chincey on both the vegetables and the meat.  More so than any other location I've been to.
I'm reviewing the Minute Clinic here. Imagine feeling ill, checking in on the kiosk, and waiting an hour, and knowing you're next in line. Only to be cut by an entitled woman in her mid 20's and her mom, who had just spent the last 15min chatting it up loudly in the waiting room. Coming here was a huge mistake...
I'm very upset with how this whole clinic works all of them, you call one number for all locations so your never able to get through with the medical assistant at the location you visit. They take forever to give you a call back and the customer service Representatives are mostly nice but when you haven't gotten any calls back after being told to keep your phone by you someone will call you in a few mins and its been four hours!!! Its very disappointing. And they all give you the same run around and at this point your a bit annoyed they have sarcastic attitudes. I've been waiting since 9:30 am and its now 2:00 for a call back for a simple precipitation and nobody can give me a answer. After my first trimester I am leaving this place. The first nurse I saw was nice but not a people person which made my first visit uncomfortable. I suggested things to her to make my blood work done, she should have just brought it up. Anyways I hope to have good things to say but at this moment I don't and am very displeased with the service everyone's experience is different this was mine.
WOW that is really all I can say about this outfit. I went to the Full Service Plumbers website and when I read "There is no job too big or too small for our highly skilled team of plumbers" I thought maybe this the the plumber for me. I was going to have them install a brand new bathroom. I clicked on the link on their website that stated "Have a question about a possible repair? Not a problem click here".  Well I guess it was a problem because the response I got to my request for a quote on the job was (this is a quote and the full response) "sorry we are just too busy to get to it . thanks"  I replied "I will remember that for future reference" Their response came back immediately and it was (again a full quote) "Good"As I said in the beginning WOW!!!How about stating something along the lines of "We are sorry for the inconvenience but we are busy at this time of year but you can get to this in such and such a time-frame"? How do folks like this stay in business. I will never use this company, when they slow down in business maybe they will hire someone who can properly answer requests for their services. I am very sorry I was a bother to this company no worries I will never call you again and fellow Yelpers should not either!!!
Advertised specials are in very short supply. All the advertised products I wanted were out. This was not the first time. A Coke promotion of a 24 can purchase gave a free 1.75 liter simply orange juice. As no 24 can package was available, I picked up 2 - 12  packs of soda. No manager or supervisor would honor the promotion. As these disappointments happen too often, I have finally made up my mind NEVER to shop here again.
Seriously?!??? How in the world do you get rid of the red pepper asiago chicken Cesar salad?!?! The whole reason i kept coming back... Now i wont be back unless zupas brings it back!!!! You don't have a Cesar salad!!!!
No customer service as the "help" wander around doing nothing. One star for having a greeter that says nothing.
AMC Westgate, it is really disappointing on how you defuse a bully!!!!SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We arrived 35minutes early for the movie, & after the movie started this man & his wife came & wanted us to move from our seats so he & his wife could sit there.We said no!The man started threatening us.I got security, explained the scenario, they came  & let me say.... They asked us to move so the other couple could sit there, & since we didn't, they were offered movie tickets for there inconvenience.The guy sat next to my husband and kept shoving himself into his space of the seat, it was either leave or this guy getting hurt!Management gave us a hard time on getting reimbursement......WE WERE NOT REIMBURSED OUR FULL AMOUNT!We should have moved, so what that we got there early for a seat.It was Unbelievable!SHAME ON YOU!
I took my car to Ganley Lincoln service department to try and find out why horrible gasoline/raw gas odor were entering the cabin of my car, likely coming in through the HVAC system.  I suspected a likely fuel leak somewhere near the firewall but could not locate one.   I took my car to Ganley  Lincoln Service Dept. and paid the $129 diagnostic fee (steep!).  Service advisor Beth P called to inform that I needed $1900 in repairs as the exhaust manifold gaskets were leaking and had a bad seal. Yikes!!   Keep in mind this is a 2007 Lincoln Town Town in meticulous condition, always garaged, and only 65,000 miles and has barely been driving in winter. I was quoted $500 a side for new exhaust manifolds and bolts at another service facility.  However,  the mechanic of 20 years said he has never seen a town car or crown vic needing new exhaust manifolds at 65,000 miles.   He did some further research and discovered the left rear cylinder spark plug was not seated properly and only needed to be rethreaded.  Total cost was $75 for retap and INCLUDED his diagnostic time as well.   Problem was fixed!!!I know enough about engines as well to realize that $1900 sounded sky high and didn't think the new manifolds solution sounded correct.  Good thing I went with my gut and got a second opinion.   I would have been out $2000 in repairs and the problem would not have been corrected!   Stay away from this service department.   Far far away... unless you don't mind paying $2000 for repairs you don't need!
Waited an hour just to get someone to cook at my table and there was one other party, last couple times I have been here service was not good, I hope management can get it together sometime soon.
Sadly disappointed on my last visit. We sat at  rooftop bar & service was terrible except for one waitress. Wish I had gotten her name because she knew exactly how to take care of her customers!  First, took forever for the waitress to even take our orders. Then, when the food came over (after we asked for it because it took too long) waitress was in a hurry to put down our plates that she spilled all the drinks!  Water & other drinks soaked our clothes, phone, and purse. The waitress ran off quickly to get towels & came to clean up table. Never once asked us or gave us towels to dry...other customers had to until we asked her. Mind you no apology for the spill. The manager even came over to clean up with no apology but rather cracked jokes!  Moved to a new table & she quickly drops off more drinks (on the house) & almost spilled them all on us. Thankfully the new waitress took care of us.  I mentioned our meal should be on the house, when  manager comes over to say they can do the drinks only. After all, it was only water!!  The nerve!! We had to tell him it was drinks other than water. Poor customer service from manager and waitress.  Had to ask to comp dessert. Not recommending to anyone!
Worst place I've ever been , they don't care at all about you. It is badly run and badly organized, just terrible truly terrible
Went here to grub but was disappointed. The Baja chicken rolls were flavorless and the fried pickles were rock hard salt licks. Even their ranch dressing was a solid. lump.Never eating here again.
Awful Awful Awful!!! I made an appointment to get my hair colored and the front desk women recommended a specific stylist based on what I wanted. I arrived with a photo of the type of color I wanted. Also described.... Darker color at roots, golden color towards bottom no stripes. What I received 2 hours later was ashy dull highlights all over the top of my head, the bottoms of my hair looked so broken and dead, when looking at back of head there were 2 dark stripes down length of my hair that went from top of head to bottom which is very long to my mid back. I was embarrassed and just wanted to leave salon ASAP. The following day I found a new salon to fix my hair. They described my hair as looking like cousin it. Every stylist in the salon was astonished as to what was done to my hair. They actually stayed open late and arrived to their Christmas party late in order to fix the mess made of my hair.  The stylist took photos of before and after photos of my hair to send back to etch to ask for refund. I did this the following week as I had a lot going on with Christmas and family in town. I spoke with Emma the salon manager at etch... She informed me that they stand by their work and since she didn't see my hair in person, and since I waited a week they would not be refunding my money. I will never ever go to this salon. I strongly suggest that you don't try this salon not only do to the poor work performed but also do to the incredibly poor customer service.  I spent $200 to ruin my hair at etch...and another $200 to get it color corrected at snap dragon salon.  Thank goodness for snap dragon!! They saved me!!
Prices are in line with other theaters for tickets food and drinks, I like the concession set up.  The theater seats are designed like a medieval torture device.  I have gone her twice and had to visit my chiropractor the next day.  Good theater sound and close to home to bad the chairs are so terrible.
So disappointed in a floral arrangement I had sent to a funeral. Flowers looked like something you would pick up at a grocery store. I will not use them again.
NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!This place is a complete rip-off and has the WORST customer service I have EVER come across.We went there and asked what package we needed in order to have the interior of our new car cleaned out. (not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.I had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.Please head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.
If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered breakfast for 5 people and they gave me 1 fork and 4 napkins.  At a hotel so can't exactly go to the kitchen and get utensils. Can't even give them the excuse they were busy. Literally no one there.
Worst Thai food I've ever had I ordered scallop asparagus and shiitake I couldn't have more than 2 bites... It was tasteless and after I had the first bite there was a paste of oil on the top of the inside of my mouth it was so gross!! Also the scallops were like rubber so chewy!!.. I also ordered basil noodle with beef it had no flavor the only thing that was decent was the BBQ chicken from the grilled section... And I asked to get some peanut sauce for it which I didn't get.... I'm never coming back!!
Montreal, what did you do in a previous life to be punished with such crummy bagels? Seriously, eating these bagels made me want to start a public service campaign called "It Gets Better" and I'll recruit people in other cities to show you how good bagels can be. This bagel shop must be build on an ancient Iroquois burial ground.  Seriously, on a weekend trip to Montreal, I had a goal to try these legendary bagels. These things are shriveled up, flat and taste like someone left out the salt. Matzoh Bagels. Blech. 4 hours later, they were inedible.  I love bagels. I've had bagels in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and I've even taught myself to make really good bagels at home (Google "Peter Reinhart Bagel recipe"). These Fairmount bagels were a huge disappointment. If I made a batch of bagels that came out like this, I'd toss them out and try again. Hope I save some other bagel loving visitor from shlepping up to this shop.
Food is consistently good here. Portions are adequate, but the service can be slow.The space is tight, and parking can be an issue in lawrenceville.
If I could give negative stars I would! These people are very nasty, rude, uncivilized scum of the earth. They towed my sons vehicle and he is a MARINE OVER SEAS I got the paperwork they requested and they still will not let me get my sons vehicle back! Trying to charge me almost $900.00 and it increases daily! I can not even start to tell you how horrible these scum bags are! I am filing several complaints against them with who ever will listen, DO NOT TRUST THEM!
I'm convinced that the Eaton Centre is the modern incarnation of Dante's "Inferno". As in, it is hell. Pure hell.Believe you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). 2) It is said that "variety is the spice of life." Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? 3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.For decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.
THE WORST!!The line up is outrageous just to get a number, you still hve to wait to be called after that. The line has over 50 people in it and there is only one staff member handing out nunbers. The other staff serving thise w a number are just sitting there. Super under staffed and slow. Never coming back here again!!!
They sent us coupons to try them out. Printed on the coupon is their hours. But in the one month that the coupon was valid, they changed their hours. Now closed on Sundays. Not happy that I drove all the way there just to find that they were closed. Not likely to go try again.
2 servers on a Saturday night? Place is packed and the table next to us just waited 15 more mins additional than us when we all ordered drinks at the same time. Food took a while to come out. Sorry Hard Rock, your service sucks.
One of THE worst pizzas I've ever had. The cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. Absolutely no taste. I don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. Maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings.
My friends and I were very excited to have brunch in a nice French restaurant while in Las Vegas. However, our experience was quite disappointing.The 20 minute wait to be seated was completely reasonable. But the 20 minute wait to get our order taken and then the 40 minutes it took them to prepare 2 sandwiches, a bowl of soup, and one pastry is unspeakable for such a high-end restaurant. We were wondering what took them so long to prepare our food and then realized it was so they could turn a "medium rare" steak sandwich into an overcooked piece of wood. We probably would have sent it back, but it would have taken another 40 minutes and we were very hungry by that point.Our waitress did not offer much detail or information about the menu to our group, which was clearly not well-versed in French. She was also very slow to refill our water glasses, and when she did, the water was lukewarm. I was wondering if this was a French thing, but saw that other tables were offered pitchers of ice water.Glad I decided to eat an egg and cheese biscuit in the Venetian food court before heading up and waiting an hour to eat a $10 cup of soup in Bouchon.
Awful!  Went to AT and T bc my pictures are fuzzy and was told phone was defective- the lens.  Went to this store and although they had people swarm me anytime I looked at any product - NOBODY could see me about my phone.  Service after the sale of my six plus= zero.  This is exactly why American companies are folding.  Worship the dollar- big bucks.  The customer is last!  The atmosphere in this store is equivalent to a used car lot meets a strip bar.  Never again!  Sorry Apple- for being such a "liberal" company you love the dollar- but care little for the people unless one waves $$$$$$$$$ in the air.  Your store is a big silver pile of dung -
Worst Chinese delivery I have ever got. Food arrived in a small bowl size for $12-$15 each. Delivery took 45min and had no sauce or utensils. Food was poorly seasoned and some vegetables were raw in stirfry.
This "was* my go to steak house place in Vegas. I come very often. This is my anniversary weekend and this place just ruined it. I asked for a certain bottle of wine per arrival....and once arriving I was told it wasn't available anymore. They has a different bottle as an alternate. Fine. Once getting the bill I notice it's a good $25 more than the bottle that I usually order. I ask then about it and (what i assume is the manager) comes over.  He asks me if I was made aware of this by our server. I inform him I don't even know how are server was because we've have at least 4 people serve us. Which is not the norm when we have our usual server serve us. He informs us that hes going to ask the server if she informed us. If she did we would be charged accordingly..if not he would fix it. He finally came back and told us that she had informed us in which we said we would that's impossible. End of story they weren't going to discount us a dollar and we're paying whatever they say because they said so. I haven't even mentioned that not once did we get our wine refilled.....and we had to wait 1 hour to get our order fulfilled. Worst experience ever. Especially for a anniversary. I never not come here on my visits but this could be the last time I ever come here. I will reach out to the higher above. This was just unacceptable for a $200 meal for 2 people
If your Open sign is on, it's twenty minutes until your posted closing time, and all the lights are on, don't look at me like I'm an idiot for wanting to place an order. (The floors were already wet and they'd been in the process of closing for awhile judging by the bleach smell.) Seriously, I wonder if the manager knows about shutting down a full half hour before closing.
Wandered in today to watch some of the Steelers game. We ordered some spinach and artichoke dip which came out with greasy tortilla chips and was cold to lukewarm. We asked if they could heat it up and after waiting another ten minutes we were given another batch of lukewarm dip. I was starving so we stayed for some Mac and cheese which again was... You guessed it... Lukewarm. Since no bartender felt compelled to check on us at any point, we let sleeping dogs lie, cashed out and left. Will. Never. Return.
I like the food here. They are not American Chinese food and really delicious. However, the service is not good. I ask for less spicy several times and the waiter always promise but the food is the same as before. Another issue is that it is always full of people and you might end up sitting with strangers together. Since the business is so good, I think they don't really care about customers. For example, if you ask for some drinks before the meal, they always forgot and you need to push them several times. I hope they could increase the number of tables or rent another bigger place, so I don't need to wait every time. Hire more waiters. Work on customer service.
Let me start off by saying i am a local and brought some friends from out of town here.This is by far not only the worst IHOP I have ever been to but the absolute worst  restaurant. We asked for one extra mozz stick so we could all have an even amount. The waitress didn't say it would be extra just said she would see If she could get us an extra one. When our meals came they were cold. My hashbrowns tasted like they just chopped up a raw potato and put it on a plate. Our waitress never came back to see how the food was and just brought the check When we went to the cashier she was too busy talking it up with a coworker to help us. Her coworker said "you have a customer" and she said "oh do I?" And continued her conversation. When I asked her about the extra food charge she was complete bitch. Needless to say I will not be going back. I wouls give zero stars if I could.
My review was filtered and I guess this one will be, too. This place has terrible, some of the worst - in a town filled with bad service, I've ever had. And the food is not good. Look at all the filtered reviews before eating here.
All these people care about is getting paid. This is not a review by someone who has only been there once. I have taken 2 dogs and a cat there for years and spent thousands of dollars.  They are condescending and do not communicate with each other.  They are not good at checking previous history of our visits.  I am glad others have had a positive experience but every time I go in there it makes me cringe inside. My wife did not share my opinion and that is why we continued to go there. After today's visit where they were rude to her and accused her of being a bad pet owner she finally agrees with me. We will be switching vets and would not recommend this place to anyone
I don't know why I bother. After a log day at the park and really no urge to cook I figured why not and have some fast food. Being vegetarian really the only place to go is Burger King. When ordering my childrens meals I specifically asked for no pickles and no mustard and not to any surprise when we got home of course there was pickles and mustard. For my vegetarian sandwich I asked for mayo (which they charged me .75 for) and yup that wasn't on there either. The person taking our order must have been doing something else brig the fact that I had to repeat myself 6 times and then drive thru girl well let's just say her attitude wasn't any better. No smile, no hello, and no here's your food. Needles to say I've been staying away from fast food for a reason and Burger King you pretty much proved my point.
Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing  fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500$ Horrible customer service and untrained staff. I proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing!I'm also reporting this store to the BBB.DO NOT GO HERE!
What a cluster fuck parking! ZEROstars.... They need a better system on how to handle the crowd of cars. Been sitting in my car for an 1 1/2 hr waiting to be directed to where to park! So glad i got to watch the concert better yet so happy i got to listen from the outside!
It was a truly unfortunate situation, I was visitng with my sister (she resides in beachwood)  and my 2  children- ages 22 mo and 4. We were literally thrown out of the store because the kids were touching the toy cars in the plastic bins.. It was UNBELIEVABLE ! They threatened to call security. We were flabberghasted, AS adults, we were simply standing there, toys in hand waiting to purchase our items. Prior to this, the "salespeople" were following others in the store while :"rearranging afte each customer had moved an item. even slightly. It was CRAZY, totally inappropropriate and RUDE especially in a TOY store. This place will be out of business within a year. NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE. In this economy, I wonder how they will survive, as nobody (the day after thanksgiving) was buying anything). TERRIBLE STORE CUSTOMER SERVICE- DONT SHOP HERE!!!
In Las Vegas and this is by far my worst shuttle experience. We waited almost an hour for our shuttle to come! Then when it comes time to load up and head out, the driver takes his precious time counting and collecting luggages. He had us wait outside, which was absolutely ridiculous when he could've simply opened the door to let us sit in there and wait for him to check us in. Not only was it already HOT, but now we also had major hot air blowing at us from under his bus! He checked us on the bus one by one, again, taking his precious time! I can go on, but I'm already too pissed off so in short, we were the last ones dropped off and the "dropping off" of people was not efficient AT ALL!! It was RIDICULOUS!!
Come on, Safeway.  You are pretty much the only game in town for downtown right now.  You would think your corporate office would recognize this and remodel and class this place up a bit.  You have people who have money to spend living all over downtown Phoenix now.  The store needs to clean up its act, improve its customer service and cater to a new demographic emerging downtown.  If I had a new better choice downtown, I would never step back in this rundown location.
This place is so small and business is run by dumb ass illegal mf horrible prices better off saving gas and time in the sun to just go but part new never goin there again
This Registration is so scam the people.. for advanced road test to came here.. I was in lineup and didn't know to line separate for road test line. guy don't want to give me appointment and have rebooked again mean pay again $150. No any negotiations.. Indian guy was so harsh with me too.. n lost $300 huh... they were so bad service and kind so fishy.. no deserve to one star either.
If u want pho there are better one out there for that price.If u want pho there are better one out there for that price. I had the special, the beef and the beef ball taste a little funny. Maybe the happy hours are great like some of the other reviewers said but if you want pho I have to say go elsewhere.
Ordered online at 5:45pm to have our food delivered...still had not received it by 9:45pm. Went back another day  to pick up a to go order.. waited an additional hour and a half in restaurant.. food was alright, will try again in a few months when they get their system down.
Do not waste time and your money. They done less shot laser each time because they want to charge you extra for more treatments time. First time they used soprano(Alma) it works with heating the second time they used another laser instrument that work by shot,so how can get a good result in this way????
This shit is ass!! Worst one yet!! Food wasn't good, horrible quality! Bread looks like it's on crack, not even soft or toasted. 2nd time & its ass.. only go if the other one is closed
In most cases bacon makes everything better. I got bacon cheese potato. They were so dry and bland even the bacon could not make these edible. They went in the trash.
Terrible. Tried for the first time and was extremely dissapointed. I got the phoking pho bo and it barely had any noodles in it... like a couple strands. Mostly bean sprouts- how cheap can you be with rice noodles??? Paid like $10 for this and was not even full obviously. Went over to the Mexican place next door to make my lunch more fulfilling for a better price. It's like I basically donated $10 to their cause.
This poor rating is for the guy that runs the headlight restoration. A couple of months ago I stopped by to find out the cost for restoration...he comes over and gives me this full load of crap that I need to have this service done to remain safe while driving at night and he just wanted to help; didn't want me to have to replace the actual lights because it would cost close to $200.00 and he could do the restoration for $150.00....I advised him we can replace the headlights ourselves for much less and that his quote was extremely high. I always wonder if these guys truly believe that woman actually fall for this tactic. I went to the Walmart on Lake Mead off of Rancho after leaving the car wash and they completed the restoration for $29.00....the headlights are like new and the service department was great.
Very disappointed with my experience here. My fiancé called the Casino and were told that our $35.00 parking fee would be waved for eating at the buffet. (We were only visiting for dinner). When we get down to the buffet we had to wait in line for about an hour and there were empty seats everywhere. So I decided to go up to the front to ask about how long it might take and the hostess basically ignored me and turned around and started yelling to her coworkers about how annoyed she was that "people" kept coming up and asking her about the wait. Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our "not so good experience" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait.. That's the only reason we parked there when we could have just payed $10 in the next parking garage. So $75 for a not so great dinner. We definitely won't be returning any time soon. I'd say the casino should step up there game in the dining department.
Many people who reviewed that place say that they have been in California or Texas, that they know what good burritos taste like, etc. Well, I have also lived on the West Coast, been to CA and TX, and I was quite disappointed with this burrito place. I won't say I was surprised, because we live in Montreal and it's so hard to find good Mexican or Tex Mex food around here. But the service was slow, and I was not impressed with the food. For example, the fillings were not evenly placed in the burrito, so there were bites with just rice, nothing else. Don't waste your time and money there.
Worst food experience ever.  Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money somewhere else.
Went excited to try trivia with some friends. Got there an hour early, and tables and bar were full. It took 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge my existence. Finally the bartender did, and when we asked about trivia we were told "Well everyone here is waiting for trivia so it looks like you're out of luck." Walked out. Will never return after service like that.
Day five of my journey to get my carpets cleaned.  Friday show up at my door because they wrote the wrong number down and were unable to contact me.  Reschedule for Saturday and they send a truck out that is unable to reach my apartment.  Saturday round 2, send a truck with the same equipment that was unable to reach my apartment.  Call office girl who made mistakes refuses to talk to me.  Reschedule for Tuesday and I waste my entire day off waiting.  Quoted 2-5 and I get a call saying that they are going to be 45 minutes because they were on the other side of the city (@4:30 5 minutes before the 30 minutes they quoted when we called to confirm).  But it's ok because when they screwed up on Saturday they assured me it wasn't my fault which I'm sure they will tell me again.  THANK GOD...I have to sleep at night and all.  So here I am 40 minutes after they quoted me 45 more.  All I want is my damn carpets cleaned......if you don't mind wasting 2 of your days off and a lot of patience call them, their prices aren't bad.  But if you value your time rent a machine and do it yourself.  At least you'll know it was worth it and the only person holding you back is in fact you.
Terrible Company!They lie about where you are going to be staying even though they send you out a confirmation.  Don't believe a word that Louis D'Amato says!
I went to use the ladies' room and had to wait for a very long time. Finally, the person in the restroom came out and it was a MAN! He was an employee of the restaurant and was not apologetic at all.
This place is packed and the rounds take over 5 1/2 hours.  They do a good job of marketing, too good.  So that all the hackers and everyone under the sun show up.  I have no problems with hacking since we've all been there.  I do have a problem with no marshal regulating play, the starter not effectively staggering tee offs and people so drunk they can't even stand on their own two feet.  Consider this place a really pristine muni course, actually you're probably better off at a muni courseThis was a weekday, I heard weekends are a joke
If you wanted to make an embodiment of all the stereotypes that are wrong with the fitness industry, that embodiment would be LA Fitness.We have had a number of issues with LA Fitness. To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.I spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.When we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.We went to the gym on Stapley/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.When we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. "That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say."  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  I chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.Throughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.  The service has been terrible, we have been continually lied to, being scolded and talked down to by a person whom I paid $100 per hour to work out with was the last straw.  I will not miss LA Fitness.  My best recommendation is to avoid LA Fitness.
Low end chain Mexican food, coupled with bad service and cold "sizzling" fajitas earns this place one star.  Salsa is usually the first indication if a Mexican restaurant is going to be any good - the salsa was very bland and it just went downhill from there. We should have known when we went in and the place was mostly empty but we were really craving Mexican.  A real shame because it is in a super location.
Actually I wanted to give them zero star....worst customer service in all GTA. Placed order in advance and then also have to wait for eternity for our food. Food arrived was also cold and wasn't close to average Indian restaurants.
Went to this location. Signed up the day before. My name was not on their "check-in" list, but I had my email confirmation. I have donated to United Blood for many years. I was excited about donating because after traveling overseas, I was not allowed to do so for a year. Today was my on year anniversary, meaning that I could finally donate blood. I monitored that date for a year, looking forward to the next time I could donate. So, I get there, my name i snot on the list and they say they cannot take me in because I am not on the list! So, all my preparation: eating well, being conscious about not doing certain things, spending time on the prep questions, waking up early, driving all the way to the donor center; nothing mattered. She didn't even seem honestly apologetic. She (Della) just said "sorry", without truly caring. She even offered e a voucher for a burger. Ha! I was there ready to give whatever blood kind they needed the most. All the beds where empty! All of them! I sure hope this doesn't happen at other United Blood donation centers. What a shame that would be. United Blood, specifically this center, need to remember how much effort their donors put into each donation and they need to focus, get their act together, and remember what their purpose and commitment is. For me, I am very disappointing. I will continue to help, but seeing this; it will not be with them. Tip for donors: call before you start your drive to the center (even better, before you start your prep questions).
Today was my anniversary. I called this morning for a delivery of flowers, explaining that my girlfriend leaves work at 3 and I wanted her to experience the moment at work for a while before she had to leave. The delivery came exactly at 3, despite the fact that they are literally across the street. The cost was just short of $100 and the offered me $10 off for failing to deliver it on time. I will never use their services again, not for these prices.
Stopped in today to see if they could fit me in for a walk-in pedicure. The young man at the desk said yes, and within a couple minutes had me go sit in the pedicure chair with my feet in the warm bath. I sat there and no one came over to start my pedi. As I looked around, all the techs were busy. I sat there for 25-30 minutes, now the water was cold and my feet pruney. None of the techs even appeared close to being done with their current clients, and no one had ever told me they'd be with me soon. I decided to leave and as I gathered my things, a tech asked me if I was leaving. She told me she was going to do a manicure, then me next. I told her I couldn't wait that long, that my water was cold, I'd been sitting there a half hour. I told her it's ok to say they don't have time, or just have me wait up front, but they shouldn't have sat me in a pedi station with my feet in water waiting for that long. I won't be back.

Seriously?They didn't even offer to pick us up. We were just expected to go to them after they messed up."I'm on my way.  We'll do our best to get there at or just after 12:00"Didn't look like we were going to make it, so I called to beg them to wait for usNo answer.  Seriously!?So we just drove home.  Forget it.  We'll take our business elsewhere.Simple suggestions to avoid this in the future:  GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT LOCATION AND PHONE NUMBER TO START WITHhow hard is that?
This has to be the worst show I have ever seen. It has no business being on stage at all but if they do have a venue then it should be an afternoon show billed for children. The children in the audience were the only ones gullible enough to fall for this crap. From start to finish every trick was flawed. It was almost a "behind the curtain" show because you could see how every trick was done. The "grand illusions" were they same tricks you've seen a million times but this time they are so much worse. We should have walked out but it I wanted to stay to give them a fair review. This is only a go if you bring your elementary school age children. This is like the entertainment they used to bring into my school as a kid on assembly days.
Didn't care for our square fish or the sauce. Both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night.  I won't be returning.  I don't understand the appeal at all.
The service was terrible. The line was 10 deep and employees were moping around like they hated life.
I do not know much about their services. Strange, I know, but let me explain.I made an appointment on a Monday for this location (which is a good 30 minutes away) for the following Friday. Even though I was not sure it was going to be open (Friday was the day before a holiday), they told me they were and confirmed my appointment. That Friday I drove to the location and waited for the doors to unlock so I could take care of my bothersome cavity. I waited. And waited. And waited. Yes, you get the point.Big surprise, they weren't open. Nobody had given me the courtesy to call, apologize for the scheduling mistake and reschedule. So instead of booking another dentist to take care of my increasingly painful cavity, I had to wait almost another week to get into a stellar dentist who confirms their appointments ahead of time and are very friendly.P.S. 4 days after the missed/accidental appointment I received a call/voicemail stating that they got my message and if I was interested in still obtaining their service I could call X phone #. No apology. I didn't expect champagne, catered breakfast and a red carpet as I walked into the office, but a simple apology for THEIR mistake would have saved my business and resulted in more referrals. Sorry Absolute Dental. Fail.
Was told 30 40 minutes for a table. Hour and 30 minutes went by and still couldn't get seated. Very frustrating! The young  girls don't know how to do there own job. Don't fall for the 30 to 40 min wait time that they tell everyone!
My wife and I tried to eat here, but we couldn't get the staff's attention.  We entered through the main entrance, saw the "seat yourself" signs, and sat ourselves outside.  We're both easy going so this is fine.  We looked through the menus, decided what we wanted, chose our drinks, and tried to make eye contact with the staff.  The last straw was when, after 15-20 minutes of sitting there without any acknowledgement, the manager came by and looked at us, instructed the busser to do something with the fireplace near our table, turned on his heel, and went back to hanging out with his employees.  We were looking for some sort of hint that he would send someone over, but we did not get it.The worst restaurant service experience I had in Paris was better than this.  I wasn't even mangling the language and we felt like personae non gratae.  We ate at Lucille's Barbeque around the corner instead, which was great.
For a place that has "burger" in the title, they sure don't serve a good one. I've had better burgers at McDonald's!
Took my friend here after her grandmother passed away. She wanted to get her feet done, the lady ran her water too hot and never adjusted her temperature when asked. After 20min of waiting another customer walked in and she made my friend get up to do the other girls feet. It was a very uncomfortable feeling for me being that I was already getting my feet done and she wasn't.
I'm 90% sure the owner of this burned it down rather than doing the right thing and selling it or closing it and now he isn't giving his employees money that was raised for them to get them through the holidays. This guy is a total sleeze ball!
Scheduled an appointment for a couples massage for my sister's birthday about a month in advance. We needed a Saturday appointment since I was visiting from out of town, and Donna asked for a $30 deposit, which isn't unheard of for spas. I received an emailed receipt for my deposit and confirmation call the evening before our appointment. The morning of our appointment I was contacted by Donna through text that her daughter had gone into labor and she would have to reschedule. Since I was visiting, we were not able to reschedule and we had to cancel. I asked if the deposit could be returned to my card, and Donna stated that her card processing system was down but she could send a money order.  This was 3 weeks ago, and I have yet to receive the money and have been unable to get in touch with her. Definitely do NOT recommend Donna!
These people were actually quite rude to us when we were customers. Literally treated us like thieves when we came in to transfer a phone to another.
It's always good to see a new restaurant in town, and this morning we tried the recently opened Kimmie's.  Unfortunately, the food and service were awful.  We will not be back.  When we arrived at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was not crowded.  Even so, the service was very slow.  There seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  The waiter seated us and then vanished.  My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  The coffee was fair -- not great.  We eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  After a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  The busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.Our meal arrived quickly.  The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  Needless to say, we skipped the jam.  We asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  He was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  By this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.My veggie omelet was so greasy that I couldn't eat it.  My biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.My husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were OK -- nothing special.  The bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  The sliced tomato was good.The menu is enormous.  Based on our experience this morning, I would guess that most of the food is precooked, prepackaged and just heated in the microwave or otherwise warmed for service.  Icky!If you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).  For bagels, try DJs on Palisades in the Safeway center.  We would suggest steering clear of Kimmie's.
Awful service!! The floor boards I needed were in reachable, walked around to find help and a group of employees were standing talking, when I asked for assistance with the floor boards they all started at each other as if to say "I'm not taking it, you take it" after a good 30 seconds of silence, one finally came to help. The board on the top was VERY damaged so I asked for the one below and and the other 3 I needed. The associate did not say ONE WORD to me the entire time!!!! Rude!!Then, I went on to find a ceiling fan adapter kit I asked another associate for help and he stated "I don't work in this department, I don't know what you'll be needing, but I'll look" then I asked about the kits and he says "This is all we sell." I had to ASK him to try and find someone in this dept. to assist me and answer the questions I had....Absolutely nuts!!  I will NEVER go back to this location....in fact... I'll just go to Lowes!!!
Portions are incredibly small, It won't fulfill you. I order a mix plate so I can get a decent portion, but it is never enough. Supposed to be Beef shawarma plate, not rice and salad plate with sprinkles of beef on top. Never again
Their standard excuse for everything.....we are undergoing renovation.  When it comes to having no working light switch in your room and the over head towel bar falling on your head in the shower that is NO EXCUSE.  These rooms should not even be rented out.   (Especially at $100 and $190 a night) In addition, there was no available hotel parking for hotel guests (not even valet parking) and the bell hop that was supposed to help us with our luggage (before driving the car  to Ballys to park) never showed up.  Try asking to speak to a hotel manager......after 10 minutes they are still on the phone (probably avoiding speaking to angry hotel guests).
I'm consistently frustrated by how difficult management makes it to eat here.  When I called ahead to make reservations for our party of four, I was told that they do not accept reservations for parties of less than six people, but that we would be fine if we got there by 6 oclock.We arrived at 530...and there was a 30 minute wait. I'll never go back- I prefer dining at establishments which respect my time.
Disgusting!wow!!If rude and conceited behavior were highly valued, this place would rock the town.The very strange, cold reception that I received from the 50-plus-year-old Nazi woman, who seemed to run the front counter, would offend nearly anyone who has considerable customer service skills. Five stars if nasty treatment is what you're looking for. I was immediately turned off, and would hate to give them any of my money. Or my plumber's money.
This is an atrocity of shuttle service.  Bought roundtrip tickets from airport to hotel.  Waited about 15 minutes on the airport, which is ok considering this is a pooled shuttle.  However, the returning trip was horrible.  I waited 15 minutes, didn't see the bus, so I called and they made some excuse about the "strip being closed".  Seriously?  Why do I see other shuttles coming to the hotel?  The guy said the bus will be here in an hour.  I decided to take one of the other shuttles that were coming and got in their line.  About 20 minutes later, the original bus showed up.So the shuttle was about 40 minutes late, and they some excuse that it will be 1.25 hours late.
My review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. The food is just ok, nothing to write home about. Secret pizza at Cosmo is better.The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. SHAME ON YOU manager on duty Sunday 1:30AM for lying about calling security.
I keep receiving calls from 602-258-2371, even though I have asked to be taken off the call list and have never done business with Western Dental.  The most recent request to be removed was given yesterday, and I received a phone call again today ... which I again asked to be taken off their call list.  I now have the phone number blocked.  This example of administrative ineptness will prevent me from seeking out Western Dental for actual business.Update:  Thank you to Cynthia for the reply below.  However, I do not wish to share personal information with a company I do not and have never done business with, and the phone calls I am receiving from Western Dental ask for a different person than me.  Having spent nearly 5 years with metal train-track braces until the age of 17, I have an aversion for dentists and have not seen one in 20+ years.  I also have only owned this phone number for 4 years.  Therefore, I am confident you will not find my name or birth date within your records.   Yes, I still have all my teeth and the money my parents spent every month over those long 5 years has not gone to waste.  With my repeated requests (including twice in the last two days) to remove my phone number from Western Dental records and now that I have blocked 602-258-2371 from my phone, I do not expect to receive calls from Western Dental.  If Western Dental chooses to call from a different phone number, rather than following through with removing my phone number as promised, then I will be glad to update this post again with those calls.
No matter where I am in the valley, when I'm craving donuts this is where I go because the donuts here is the best. Apple Fritters, crisp outside, soft gooey inside, donut holes that are completely covered in glaze, and their burritos are pretty delicious.*update* Today 09/02/18 I experienced the worst service ever. Male working at 530PM when I arrived, worst attitude, refused to listen to what my party and I said, placed donuts into box that we DID NOT ORDER and looked at us like NEXT? No matter the fact that I told him we dont want THOSE, he stood there and asked AND? If it were legal, I would have jumped the counter to beat his stupid ass. Told him to shove his donuts up his ass and his response HAVE A GOOD DAY.
Ayant déjà été aux États-Unis, j'évitais son ouverture à Laval comme la peste. J'ai quand même dû y aller pour faire plaisir à une amie. Un mot : MAUVAIS, tout est mauvais, les pâtes, les pizza, les frites, TOUT!!!! Je suis assez ouverte pour les restos et donne la chance au coureur, mais celui-ci est à ÉVITER. Faites quelques pas un peu plus loin dans le Centropolis et vous aurez une dizaine de restos qui vous regardent en pleine face.
I ventured here about 6 months ago.  The atmosphere was nice, albeit a bit loud. There is plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs inside, though outside it's very tight and the tables are all very high.  The parking was ok, though I always seem to have to valet since I meet my friends right after work across town, and parking is gone around 7pm. I ordered a couple of the appetizers, the chicken lettuce wraps, which was putrid. So bad.  I left it. The other was dumplings, which could've been reheated. I read some pretty bad reviews on here about the food so, I had very low expectations but, a friend of mine likes the spot, so I went along with it.  Truly though, this is one and done for me.  I can't recommend it with so many other nice options in the area.
AWFUL AND RUDE!!! April is a miserable person and god forbid if the phone rings or she has to actually have to work. I have an 11 year old little girl who is very self conscious about her hair and April kept rolling her eyes and made my daughter mortified and embarrassed because her hair was knotty. She even asked me to brush my own daughters hair because it would take too long for her to do it. Here is a little advice April, get her wet and spray some detangler in it and it comes out. Needless my daughter was hysterical and I promised her we would NEVER go back there. I  disgusted this woman has no compassion and clearly is lazy and doesn't want to work hard. If it was possible I would give NEGATIVE stars, please my fellow Vistancia people go to the lake pleasant one!!
The food looked good from where I was standing... but unfortunately, I was unable to actually taste it.  I walked in there with my friends last night expecting to get a decent burger.  When we waked in, we stood at the front of the restaurant for over 15 minutes waiting to be seated.  It seemed as though workers were walking by us trying not to make eye contact so they wouldn't have to take the time to seat us. Needless to say, we walked in unnoticed and walked out unnoticed.
So Yelp took of my review over this Hyundai dealership earlier because its seems kind of personal. But my thing is, I think everyone should know what kind of person they are going to deal with here in their sales department.  They have bait and switch guy in the internet department, inexperience green peas salesperson and douche bag sales manager. If you are still going to this dealership to get your hyundai. Well, you have been warned. You can take of my review again Yelp if you think it doesnt fall within the guidelines again.
The people here are extremely rude. No one will even bother to hold the door when you're right behind them. I tried multiple times to book classes online and couldn't get anything to work. The staff doesn't seem to know much about anything either. Took me 3 tries to cancel my membership, which I rarely ever used.There was one really nice girl from North Carolina who worked here though, she really tried to help, but that's about.
Do not stay here under any circumstances. The hotel specifies that you should call ahead if you're going to be arriving after hours. I called the front desk early in the afternoon and got confirmation that we could arrive 15 minutes after their closing time. The woman that I spoke to was sweet and assured us that it'd be ok. I then called around 11pm to confirm that our plans were still good, and was told by the male manager that not only did they have no record of my call, but that under no circumstances would they wait 15 minutes after closing for us to get there. This is after we've paid them. So I asked for a refund, and they said they wouldn't refund me because there wasn't 24 hours notice!!! Meanwhile, the hotel manager was being flippant and accused me of lying that I'd called in the first place. He claimed that they had no female receptions on their staff!!! When expedia called to get a refund, a female manager answered the phone and said that they had no male managers on their staff!!! Unbelievable! I fully intend to pursue legal action against this hotel if this matter is not resolved soon.
Wow. And this is not a good wow at all.Did NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.The waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only "amazing" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. Considering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to "work" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.There seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. Now, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.That's where the wonderful and awfully helpful /insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert/coffee/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?The waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.The one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.Final report: More style than substance.
2 of us went May 28 @ 9:35 pm at my suggestion as I'm a Mexican and Tex/Mex food aficionado and remembered having enjoyed the place a couple years ago. There was only one other table occupied and the waiter returned within 1 minute to ask if we knew what we wanted as the kitchen was closing in 5 mins, giving the impression that he would be just as happy if we left. Posted closing time is an early 10 pm. Unfortunately, we stayed...I sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. When I went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. Classy, eh? After some mediocre tortilla chips and salsa, we both had the combination platter described in the previous review and guava margaritas. All of it was utterly bland, so I asked for some Tabasco. The server informed me there was no Tabasco and was walking away when I called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. He grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there ASAP. I did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. The lights were very bright, so I asked another server if they could be turned down. After asking if I wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. By this point the place had less ambiance than your average McDonalds at 3 am. No one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). The hot sauce I'd begged for added the only taste. The 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. I know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in Toronto for less money. The margarita was ok, but it wasn't enough to make this joint acceptable.
If I could give negative starts, I would. This place HAS THEE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! They discriminate against people of different color and did not even try to hide it! The manager, was not helpful at all. I would put all of the rude people on blast if I knew I wasn't going to get filtered! I will be contacting Hastings Law firm for the horrible horrible weekend I had with my family there. We even booked the mediterranean suite because it looked to fabulous. Later we found out the carpets have not been washed for how many years, mold in the restroom, and just plain horrible. The worst part? RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS and BABY RATS!!! Ewwwwww!!! I felt bad for people who were having thier wedding held there because as soon as I saw the rats, I didn't even want to leave my room. Maybe I should call the health and food commitee to have them check out the place? Sad part is, Green Valley Ranch was my ALL TIME fav spot to be in Vegas. We started going there when it first opened... When I was about 18! I'm 30 now... Green Valley had a special place in my heart. Up until now, I have never not once felt discriminated on until I went to Green Valley recently. What a horrible mess it has become. One more thing. The chlorine in the pool is to strong! I didn't even dip my head in the pool and my eyes were watery the WHOLE time while watching my son.Sorry but this place SUCKS. They couldn't even admit they were wrong. Horrible place to not be a great customer service person!
this kfc is no longer a part of the major kfc franchise and it is really obvious because for one the customer service is the very worst! yes don! this means you! you served us some nasty ass burnt chicken and didn't even give us a receipt with our order. when we got home we opened the bucket and it looked like the chicken had been burnt in a fire! it was old, really dark and hard as a rock. so we drove all the way back to return it and don had the nerve to tell us there wasn't anything wrong with it! well, i'm not serving that crap to my family.. matter of fact i don't even think they are using the 11 herbs and spices cause it didn't look anything like the real kfc chicken. anyway do not go to this kfc.. we tried to call them and the number on the internet is disconnected so i asked don for the manager's number and he refused to give it to me.. he told me i had to go back the next day and talk to the owner.. this kfc should be called kentucky fakeass chicken!
I found a piece of glass in my water!  So be careful when coming here...The food is ok - it is a little on the salty side.
This review is for Katerina. We had an email dialogue before I came in for the cut. I told her I wanted to cut off 1.5 inches max. Very clear. I came in on the day. She was very standoffish and rude. And she looked at my hair and said because I already had layers. I had to cut off closer to what she held up which was 3-4 inches. Otherwise it wasn't worth her time. Such a waste of my time!! Are you kidding me? I even sent her photos of my hair so she knew exactly what she was getting into. I told her what I wanted and she just wouldn't listen. Walked right out. Very rude would not recommend. Went right around the corner and went somewhere else.
Just awful. I came here to get a daith piercing and the bead fell out 2 times. Came to get my jewelry changed after they said it'd be free and they charged me but no surprise the bead fell out of my new earring. The girl who did my earring change had no idea what she was doing she clawed at my ear with the pliers for 10 minutes. She had no idea what she was doing. I'm wiring this review as I'm waiting the get my bead back inside of my earring and the girl is helping people who walked in 5 mins after me. Employees are just sitting around when people need help. Unprofessional atmosphere, smells like smoke inside the building, no one will great you when you walk in, etc. just awful..  never get a piercing here.
Went here today arrived at 7:00pm I had my order in by 7:10 didn't get my food until an hour later I'm typing as I wait to 7:58pm. It does not take an hour to make a burger. It was not even busy. The server was nice but the place STANK, disgusting. Never coming again.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE
It's quite sad. But no surprise to why DQ is filing bankruptcy with this kind of service. If you don't want to work around people, don't. But don't take it out on my kids and I because you hate working here. Food made wrong, reminded several times our ice cream order and still got it wrong 3 times. And then got pissed when we asked for the right ones... figure out the simple stuff and the big stuff will take care of itself. Not very complicated to treat people like they matter.
This isn't the place to take your vehicle.They were suppose to front end alignment, front brakes. And change my oil with supplied oil.Got a call from Russell that all my rotors and pads needed to be redone. 1100.00, told them to go ahead, the oil was changed, with some new bolt put in as a drain plug (it is now leaking) they didn't put the spacer back on the right rear wheelWhen they did the brake job. The had billed the alignment, after I got there and asked about it,They removed it from the invoice cause they never did it, I'm not done. The day after they did brakes I went to California. The from end was rattling a little more so when I stopped forGas I reached in and the top shock bolts were loose(I had asked them to check the front shocks, and was told they checked them  and they weren't leaking and they were fine. I own a construction company and was looking for a "honest" place to bring my work truck to as well as our personal vehicles to. This is NOT the place to bring any vehicle to. I have never written a bad review before this one, but what happened here isn't fair or the right way to do business.
Food was decent, but if you want a martini, STAY AWAY!!!!! We ordered Plymouth gin martinis and we're disappointed in how small they were, but that turned out to be the good part. When the bill came, they charged us $19 each!!! That's right, it's not a typo, $19 each. We've been to a lot of great restaurants throughout Cleveland, the US and Europe and NEVER have paid more than $12 for a martini. I don't know what their other prices are like for drinks, but I'm guessing they are overpriced as well. So if you want to enjoy a drink with your meal and particularly if you want a martini, I strongly recommend you STAY AWAY from this restaurant.
I felt like I was in a used car dealership getting the hard sell.I recently broke a tooth. I have no insurance and I'm only employed part time at the moment, so money is tight. I know exactly what I need is to get the tooth pulled, plain and simple.I should have known something was up when I made the appointment here and couldn't get a straight answer regarding a price for a simple tooth extraction.I went in and used their $39 exam/x-ray/cleaning special, got the xrays done fine then the dentist saw me. He immediately started pressing for me to get a crown that would involve a root canal, tooth shaping and the crown. I told him several times if I had the money I would get a permanent implant, but I can't afford it so how much to just pull it?Well, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) She details all the options from crowns to partials. Thousands of dollars she's quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.OK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don't have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their "discount" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!Well, needless to say I said no.Even though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither. I should have demanded it, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.Beware, these guys are only out to bleed you dry.
Disappointed in their shoe return policy.  I will not shop for shoes there again.  Other high end stores will accept returns even after you have worn the shoes if they don't fit or cause blisters etc.  saks refused to accept a return for a defect in the shoes and doesnt even have a shoe repair person to atleast fix the defect.
Do not go here, the place is awful, & the workers are theifs, they steal from cars & blame the customers, Do not go here at all
I didn't HATE the place! Hate is a strong word but I wouldn't come back again for its food! My friend says that people come at night and drink. I came here during the middle of the afternoon and I didn't enjoy my experience here. Food: They had a lot of asian fusion. I for one, despise Asian fusion cuisine! It's just weird... if i want Asian food, I would get asian food. Unless I have no other alternative... I ordered a burger there and it tasted OK. Not something i would pay that much for again. The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. Service: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. The atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated. IDK if that's intentional or not.
These people are liars and scammers!!!!  I requested a quote, which they gave me ($39 to clean an 8'x10' carpet, and $39 to clean a three-seat sofa), and then they followed up with multiple calls to try to book the business.  I thought they were motivated and eager, so I booked them.  They LIED about the service, they LIED about the price, and when the rug cleaner showed up at my house and told me the REAL price ($499 for JUST THE RUG!!!) , I called the office and spoke to them on speaker phone.  The cleaner, who could hear the entire speakerphone conversation,  could hardly believe how RUDE and DISHONEST the rep (Natalie) was to me.  They don't even send their own people; the cleaner drove a truck with the logo and phone # of a different company.  THIS company just LIES about prices and services, and then outsources the work.  I hate dealing with scum like this because they waste my time and give other honest companies in their industry a bad name.
I have never written a yelp review. Ever. This establishment forced me to. I honestly don't have high expectations about ordering food at 11:30, but when it comes two hours later, and after a shakedown by the delivery guy by phone after calling justeat to get a refund, I feel like the only Greek I got had nothing to do with food.
I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted "Speak"... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry "what the hell are you talking about?" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.Why would I ever set foot in a business who can't even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.
Another place that goes downhill. This place has gone down from 5 stars to 1 star. Food quality is not the same anymore. Dried overcooked meats is just a no no. It seems they keep everything precooked in the fridge and just heat it up. Not the same quality from 10 months ago. Seems they have tried to save money and its costing them points on the taste department. And the service...JUST HORRIBLE. Crancky ladies taking orders. Give you attitude and make you hesitate to ask for something. That itself makes this a 1 star. Bring back the quality and employees from before!!
The food is terrible. We tried the dim sum. We were disappointed and overcharged. We won't be back.
This place was really bad food was awful my fries were cold. The place was dirty no one table was wiped off.
From the hassle of having my receipt checked for bagged items to not knowing the products you sell was one thing but being carded for a video game at 30 is down right stupid. Then the clerk said "well you can never know these days" are you kidding me, you can't tell the difference between a 16 year old and a 30 year old? To make matters worse, we had our child there. What are you telling me, I had my kid at 9 years old?
We stopped in for late night tacos tonight at 12:05. Sat at the outside counter for fifteen minutes without being acknowledged. There were plenty of people in the kitchen putting tops on containers and such. Specifically, there was a chef in a blue and gray shirt that looked at us three times while working an arms length away and didn't acknowledge us once. Finally, we went inside to ask for service and was told late night service wouldn't start for another 30 minutes. I expect more from a Richard D restaurant. Very disappointing. I hope others don't have the same experience.
This place used to be amazing when they had the original owner from when they first opened. From awesome soup noodles to amazingly priced $12 ayce hotpot, I loved going here. This all changed roughly 3-5 years ago when the ownership was transferred. Speechless now.
I am an Ubereats delivery driver.  I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  His response to me was "You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  So, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  I will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.  Read these yelp reviews very carefully.
My wife and I have lived in Madison for 6 years now and we are certified foodies...eating out in Madison-area restaurants 4,5...even 6 times a week...rarely have we both experienced worse food than what we did here...one snowy afternoon.We started with Tom Yum soup, which was pretty good, actually. But that's it!I had the curry squash with chicken which everyone seems to love and my wife had the ginger chicken....the taste of the sauce was at best worth 3 stars...but the chicken was probably a week or so old..and I have no idea what they did to it when they cooked it...but after one bite, neither of us touched it again...my wife actually had to to spit it out on a napkin coz she would have had 2 puke otherwise. The ginger chicken had enough ginger in it to make the Gingerbread man feel repulsed!We barely ate half of what was given to us...mostly the sauce and veges and politely declined boxes for the rest.
Pretty disappointed today. Paid a little extra to get the tires done with the wash and for the most they do a decent job but when you pay $35 including tip and 1 tire and rim look good while the rest are half assed pretty piss poor especially now that cobblestone is taking over.
They took calls, texted, and handled money wearing the same gloves they were making my sandwich with. That was enough to freak me out. I had the caprese sandwich, it was nothing special. They're ok people, but lousy and unsanitary sandwich makers.
The b7 I ordered looks/tastes nothing like night market fried chicken tender in Taiwan. Vegetable on the side is over cooked. My friend and I have diarrhea after eating at Phusion Cafe...
This company has horrible customer service! I got Moxie to spray my house. They assured me that their chemicals were safe for pets and children. Two days after they sprayed, my cat got very sick. She passed away a few days after. I have contacted Moxie and they are forcing me to pay the $150 cancelation fee. They KILLED my cat and I am expected to pay to stop this service. What an awful company!!
Laser treatments. Let me start by saying if I could rate this place lower than I 1 star I would. Nothing against the staff they were very kind but there is no knowledge base. The establishment takes advantage of potential clients that are new to the world of laser hair removal. When I bought the package I had never done a laser treatment before and had no idea what it would entail and they took advantage of that. They rushed my session. I now currently go to a different med spa and it is like night and day.To gain a little bit of perspective, at silk med spa I did 2 large, 2 medium and 2 small areas. I was in and out of the place within 15-20 minutes. I'm doing the exact same body parts at my new spa and it takes 2.5 hours. The attention to detail and knowledge is simply not there. I'm making this review because I'm so sad by the amount of time wasted at silk med spa. Anyone who does laser knows that every session counts and it's a process, I wouldn't want anyone else to be ill informed like myself. Huge waste of time but the silver lining is that now I really appreciate the professionalism and good service from my current spa.
A bunch of people came together and said, "what can I include in this show to make it look like we're trying too hard? Let's just add sex and penis jokes with zombies because people love zombies and sex!" Who though this would be a good idea? Tacky middle school penis jokes, unoriginal racist blacks and asian jokes, and overall poor storyline. The host is supposed to carry the show along, but instead I felt he stalled the momentum of the show. There were times I seriously wanted to shout out, "Get on with it! We get it, they have a penis!'' They poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. They created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. Zombies loves sex. Zombies love sex. There, I just told you the whole show. I honestly couldn't understand the singing. I don't know if it's because of my seat but I had to seriously concentrate to understand what they were singing about, especially the host. Fast talking and slurred singing doesn't make for a good show. I've been to multiple musicals and shows, I've never had to concentrate so hard. The storyline was lost on me. The theater is a long rectangle so the seat just continually goes upward instead of outward like most theaters. If you get stuck near the back and at the left end of the row, there's a huge block of wall that juts out blocking your view. You'll have to encroach on the people to your right to get a better view. The only good thing about the show was that they had a live band. I'd rather listen to the live band play for 90 minutes than slurred singing and overused sex jokes.
California Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. Before I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. Recently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. The pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. So we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.
Went here for lunch with my boyfriend today. The green beans, crab puffs and chow mien were good. But we had two serious issues while we were there. The first being when we asked for a straw and the waitress brought out two loose straws, not in paper protection, that she was holding in her bare hands (no offense, but I don't know where those hands have been!) and second when my boyfriend had to go ask for out check as it was time to leave me no one had come by to even ask how we were doing and the (bad enough right) and the lady standing behind the counter directly in front of the kitchen, was plucking her eyebrows. Which she immediately stopped doing when my boyfriend said "I hate to interrupt you but can we get our check please?" YUCK!!! I feel sick just talking about it. We will never go back here again.
Not usually the one to give one star reviews nor write any reviews at all but we tried to cancel our plan for months since our extra car has an expired registration and they kept telling my mother, who does not speak much English, that we could not. Turns out all we have to do was cancel auto-pay and it will cancel automatically. Very deceiving.
Wow I see a pattern here with the other poster. Gabe came out almost two weeks ago to give me an estimate to thin out my bottle brush tree. We agreed to this past Wednesday 6/14 to be out between 11:00&12:00 we agreed then about 11:00 he called and said a job went long they wouldn't be able to get there until about 2:00 and due to the temps that afternoon he said he'd rather not have his guys out. I agreed plus I didn't want them rushing or getting sick. So we agreed on today Saturday 6/17 between 7:00&7:30 in the morning. My wife called him about 8:40 to see where they were Gabe's phone was off. She left a message. No response about an hour later she texted him to say they don't have to worry about coming out today or any day. It's now after 1:00 pm still no calls. Wondering how they stay in business. Like the other poster we found their number in a My Guy flyer and yes I also thought these businesses were screened. They probably are. If their check clears to purchase the advertising space they are recommended. First time I paid attention to My Guy not going to make that mistake again. This is another business I have to give one star too because Yelp doesn't allow posts with no stars.Call anyone else do not call these guys.
The sales team (including the security guard) was not so friendly or helpful. I had to pull my car up to unload my cart (because you can't take the cart out of the store) and not one of them helped to watch my cart. A lady who stood by said that she would watch it for me. As soon as I unloaded my bags, the manager and security were quick to take the cart away without a "bye" "merry Christmas", "happy holidays", nothing. This place may have great items but watch out for customer service.....it sucks!
Despite other glowing reviews posted about this location, I cannot in good conscience give a good review.Vapiano is a European concept Italian restaurant with a hybrid operation - somewhere between a sit-down restaurant (but no wait staff), a cafeteria/buffet (lines at various food stations), and a fast foot place (counter service).  Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a "credit card" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.Vapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.After my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the "least buggy" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.The last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!As I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.Insects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.I give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.
We've been here several times over the past 10 years and have always enjoyed perfection. So we were surprised to be disappointed on our last visit. We were in a hurry to catch a Cher show at the Park, so sat at the bar, ordered a bottle of champagne and ordered our meal. My salad came lacking the cheese the bartender had said would be on it. I mentioned it to him and he expressed surprise but didn't offer to get some for me. No big deal.  Then the medium rare filet arrived medium well, and it was stringy, dry and tasteless.  We didn't have time to request a new one so I ate it. Next day, I wished I'd sent it back, but with the champagne and everything, I didn't want to kill the evening. So very very disappointed.
It is as awful as everyone says....if you can get some other people take a cab, otherwise go with one of the other shuttles, they have a much bigger fleet....ALSO NEVER BUY A ROUNDTRIP ON ANY OF THEM....you just limit your return trip and only save a buck.
Food is terrible, ambiance New Orleans decor, but not quite the right feel, service terrible, didnt have silverware for our appetizers, food took 25 min,  Strip prices, not really worth all the inconviniences.
So slow! I'm an ex-employee, these girls were so incompetent it was driving me nuts.
I've gotten better haircuts at great clips for $20.the girl had no idea what she was doing, and took 3 1/2 hours to cut mine and my friend's hair. and our hair is short. i have a mohawk. could it be that fucking difficult? apparently it was, because i walked out of there with a very uneven, too-symmetrical, crap cut.  the stylist lacked confidence and only after 3 hours of turtle-like speed cutting, did the instructor step in and finally finish my friend's hair. if you need a basic haircut, go here. this place is a glorified super cuts.
Horrible. Where do I start? I dutifully let the hostess know when I made my reservation that I would be needing the vegan menu. When I came and she was whisking me to my table, she pointed at a tray of desserts and said "You don't want to know about the desserts, do you?" Um, I guess not. It was several minutes before someone cane to take my drink order. Apparently, my waiter Roger was busy so this fella was going to fill in for a sec. Ok. I ordered the Dandelion cocktail and some water. After about 20 minutes, same fella came back and said "Roger is really backed up so I'll take your order." Mkay. I ordered the Buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer and the "red curry braised tempeh" for my entree. The cauliflower was really good. Then I sat there for an interminablr amount of time with an empty water glass, a crappy cocktail, and no breadsticks and watched a guy spend 30 minutes setting a table for 6 like he was Mr Carson and the Queen was coming to dinner. Did I mention the tables around me had bread? Then some guy with a ridiculous cart of copper cups asked me if I wanted a Moscow mule. No, but I'd like some water. At somepoint in this mess, my tempeh arrived and it was horrible.  When the person I assume was roger dropped the dessert menu on my table, I was Visibly ticked off. A manager of some kind came around to make nice since I was fuming. His excuse was that Mr Wynn was going to coming in for dinner. He comped my tempeh and I stormed out 37 dollars poorer. I hope for their sake Mr Wynn did not show up to that poor excuse for a restaurant.
This place is unprofessional in every way possible.It's really a shame that for a place that serves up very decent, authentic indian cuisine, that the customer service is so deplorable. My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? Ummm, say what? First rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. And here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. UM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. And it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out. But this place is not worth all the undhia in the world. It left a really bad taste in my mouth and we will never step foot in there again.
Bandwidth Violation is all I got from them.I have a family website with little to no traffic.  They took down my website.  Customer for over 10 years.  They refuse to refund my money.they want me to take down about 20 pictures, cause the pictures are causing their servers to breakdown with all the bandwidth.   Who are they kidding?I'm fighting for my 6 months they owe me and they are refusing to work with me.  On conversation number 6 now.  Must be really low to work as a tech there.  There is no way my 20 pictures are taking down their server on a family website that is not advertised on google.
I have had three experiences with little snips, one meh, one not-so-good and one downright terrible. My first time in I was just attempting to make an appointment, I stood there for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence, only then to be told someone would come help me soon. After another 5 minutes I decided it wasn't worth my time to wait around, it didn't seem like anyone cared that I was there. My second experience I actually got an appointment but the lady was snippy because we were a few minutes late. Ok fine, sorry I was a little late, but this set my two year old off on the wrong foot. We want this to be a positive experience for him and are expecting that out of a children's salon. He could totally read her negativity and was afraid to get in the chair, normally he is very good about haircuts. My third and final attempt to go to Little Snips I made an appointment and showed up on time only to discover a closed sign on the door. The sign said "will return at 1", my appointment was for 12:30. Luckily instead of just waiting I decided to call and the message on the answering machine said they decided to close for the day due to weather. Thanks a lot for calling and letting me know!!! I had no problem loading up my two kids and making it there on time, so I really don't understand why they closed. It is however, in my opinion, fine to close your store... but it is absolutely not ok to not let your clients with appointments know about it! Terrible customer service at this place! I won't be back.
Extremely rude coworkers!! Prices are overly too much! They don't accept cash AND you have to buy tartar sauce too ? Are you kiddn me? Never AGAIN coming back!!
Service is terrible. Me and my friends came on Tuesday night to order chopping board to be engraved. The lady wasn't specify the size and the place to be engraved, so a few minutes after we walked from the store, we returned and came back to give the specific detail (They really seems not to care). So the lady said it will be in large size and we agree that it's going to be engraved from left to center on the bottom left. The next day I got a phone call 9.30am, checking the spelling of what I wrote, because another lady who was going to do the engrave for my item, cannot differentiate a "T" and "F" , even though clearly, the F will consist of 2 lines. Ok fine. I picked up in the evening to find out that the engrave words are on the bottom center to right and it was so small. It was something not apparent and not what I was expecting, considering that I paid $66 for a chopping board. I was very disappointed. Funny thing is that the lady was persistent that she followed the order written on the note from her co-worker and then showed it to me that it clearly said "left to center". Not even a single apology, she just said "Ups" (realizing her mistake) and another lady offered me 20% coupon for my dissatisfaction for my next purchase. (I won't even come back after this). They are not trustworthy to offer an extra care of what the customer's requested and expecting.
So here's how my visit goes--literally like 4 mins. I need new shades and I have a AAA-membership--win win. Just need to pick them out and go, Ray Ban, ALWAYS Ray Ban. I do NOT need a prescription, just the glasses. Husband stays in car because I am gonna be that quick. Walk in, male associate is on work phone, I walk strait to the women's sun glasses. Try on a pair. Try on another pair. Older female associate walks in from her smoke break--literally smoking outside the glass as I try on the first pair--and says, "Have you been helped, we are closing in 15 mins..." and continues to walk to the other side of the store. My husband walks in at the same time and asks, "Did you find any?  Have you been helped?"  And my response is "NO!"  I understand that you are going to close in 15 mins. And that you have lives to live. However, I am a customer, in the establishment that pays you to sell their product. And today, you did a VERY BAD job. We walked out.  The female associate went and straitened the one glasses that I didn't face--and then spoke disgruntling to the other associate. Wow!!  I know it's only one sale for a large corporation, and my meager $200 doesn't matter. But today was BAD!!  3.25.184:40 pm7700 W. ArrowheadGlendale, Az
So I decided I will try then once again, and they prove again why I should continue to refuse going there.  I checked in and was told to pick out my gel color, then Casey told me it would be 10-15 minutes, which I was ok with.  About 10 min later another girl walked up and told me to pick out my color, which I had already done, then she walked me back to an empty station next to Cindy, who was doing another girls gel manicure.  I was given no other instruction but to sit.  As I sat there and watched Cindy do this girls nails, I noticed she started trying to hurry, which led me to believe that she was trying to hurry so she could do mine next.  Which to me is not ok, first don't sit me down at an empty station to wait and make the tech feel rushed and also make the customer feel uncomfortable that I'm just sitting their .  After another 10-15 minutes and knowing how long gel takes, I got up and said "I'll just come back tomorrow" which just to be clear, I will not be returning tomorrow, or any day after that.
I don't why there are 3 seperate review posts in yelp for this very same location. I have chosen the one with the most reviews.I brought my newly bought BMW 2009 328i to this place. I shouldn't have. My odyesy lasted two days. I had a dealine because the car will be shipped to Europe and I was to leave on the second day the car was at Napa. Day one part for my car did not arrive on time. Day 2, Steve the location manager went himself in the morning of day 2 to get the headgasket. The guys are friendly and trying hard, but seems like they are not good in handling imports. After the headgasket component was installed they basically couldn't set up the factory settings. So I had to call a tow truck and ship it to my dealer, who will be taking care of completing the last step. Still at this moment I don't know how much on top of my 1145$ !!! repair bill will be add up. To be fair they send me a 100$ voucher, for which I will have no use. Stay clear of these type of big chain places, which apparently can only handle certain brands/ years. I was under time pressure. Otherwise I would have found a BMW specialist.
I had a bad dining experience here and will likely never go again.  Oddly enough, I went in the first place because of good reviews I read here on Yelp.  Needless to say I was suprised with bad service, and burned food that was tasteless!  I had a grilled pimento and cheese sandwich with fries.  I know that the couple sitting next to me and my wife were not happy either.
I am really disappointed in the Friday night seafood buffet.  It used to be one of my favorite places to go because they used to have oysters on the half shell.  I always thought it was expensive but the oysters made it worth while.  The food choices have really gone downhill but the cost is still high and not worth what you get.  I was there on February 5th and only had a couple of items that fit on a small saucer.  I am not a picky eater and couldn't find anything that appealed to me.  I was going to ask for my money back, I'm really sorry that I didn't. Where did the oysters go???????/
I have emailed and called their office SEVERAL times in several months to take me off of their mailing list.  I get a card EVERY SINGLE MONTH from them.  IF I ever decided to sell, I would NEVER use these people.  I am definitely NOT recommending them to anyone, and I am spreading the word to friends, relatives, co-workers to not use them either.  THEY DON'T LISTEN!
How in the world does this place have a good rating on yelp? My failed attempt to find delicious Thai fried rice on the west side has started with TREMENDOUS room for improvement.  I ordered the Thai fried rice with vegetables and added chicken with a spicy request of 4 on their scale of 1 to 5.  This was the oiliest, blandest fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was so oily that I feel like my skin is oozing oil now, and I didn't touch my food with anything besides a fork and knife.  They must have misunderstood how spicy I wanted it because it had absolutely zero spice to it.  Stay away from their fried rice.  Maybe other dishes are better, but I will never know.  I need to go wash my face from feeling greasy now.  Blah.  What a waste of carb-calories, time and money.
First of all the owner needs to take a chill pill and let the customer decide on what they want to eat, instead of rushing them with try this , try this, try that...Ordered  a Large Pizza thinking it might have some desi touch to it...But it was the WORST EVER PIZZA i have ever had.  I think even a freshie would make a better Pizza than these guys...The Pizza dough was all soggy and very thin, not properly baked....It tasted like a thin under-cooked bread overloaded with cheese making it to chew a lot....The above rating is only for the Pizza at this place.... The owner claims to serve one of the best Nihari and Biryani. Will give it a shot in the future and update the reviews if any better...
Just got a haircut from here, showed a picture of Jensen Ackles as a reference for my hairstyle, my stylist was extremely rude and purposefully cut the top of my hair using a size 1 clipper (which is basically bald) because she was impatient with the fact that I was being picky about how I wanted my haircut. At no point in time was I rude, so this isn't a spite induced attack at the store, the store manager even agreed with me. But in all honesty I'm extremely infuriated because it seemed like the stylist (some Philipina woman) was out to spite ME for being picky like I dont have the right to be about my own hair. Xis is my usual stylist and does a fantastic job you should definitely go to this location for his quality haircuts and the others, but that one particular stylist should never be apart of anything customer service related whatsoever due to her impatience, lack for empathy, and unaccountabilty of her actions. Now I'll have to wait a good month or two before even considering to style my hair the way I want it. Thanks Great Clips
To be fair, I only went here once a few months ago. It was a Wednesday and not a busy night.  It's near where I live so I was hoping it would be good.  I will have to try it again, but it's difficult to try a place again and possibly have another bad experience when we have so many good places so I will likely wait until soemone I know recommends it.Service was poor.  Took over ten minutes to be greeted while staff chatted at bar and kept going to karaoke area.  Was not asked about refill when water and beer were out.  Food (noodle bowl with veggies) was greasy (not in a good way), salty (not in a good way) and bland otherwise. Area behind the bar was less than clean. I walk by often and do not see many customers, even college kids, so I suspect they still need to get their act together.  Hope they do.  Great location.
Poor management, period!!  Last week at 5:15PM, Tuesday, July 10, 2012, we were there for some sandwiches.  Most of the Asian items were sold out.  Today July 15, 2012, we went back driving all the way from Peoria and arrived at 4:46PM, and the sign said, "Hot Baguette" yum!  We went inside ordered our combination sandwiches and some hot baguettes.  The cashier told us the all of the baguettes had sold out already but the hot baguette sign still left on.  This is false advertisement, people.  Also, the ingredients they put in the sandwiches are inconsistent, and it's franchise restaurant, seriously?
Just waited 25 minutes for an ok burger and chewy fries. No apology, no explanation. No reason to do that again.
Paid $30 for exterior & interior wash...left windows smudged/dirty, dust on the dash, console area wasn't even cleaned. I won't be going back...
WORST Panda Express I have ever been to. I wanted teriyaki chicken but the chicken they had did not look edible at all. It was a pale brown so I asked if I could get fresh chicken. The girl said it was fine that it would take about 7-10 minutes. I waited 20 minutes for my food my mother was done with her food by the time I got my teriyaki chicken. And while I was waiting they ran basically out of everything that the line was out the door from just waiting for food to be ready.  And to top it off they were giving people who ordered after me teriyaki chicken before me! Do not recommended to come during busy hours!
Pizza is pure garbage. But what do you expect for $5??? Was not "Hot and Ready" when I walked in.
I've shopped here about three times because it is the closest one to my house but I have NEVER had a good experience. I'm rarely greeted, they never bother trying to help me find something and when I tried explaining I needed to exchange a shirt and return a dress because I was about to go to a funeral I was given the worst attitude, the lady looked so annoyed and actually mad at me. I work retail too and know that returns suck but the way she handled it was incredibly unprofessional. I also had my baby with me and she was getting fussy and she instead gave me store credit despite asking for a return. I'd rather drive twenty miles to the San tan torrid and feel welcomed. In fact, I was so hurt by the terrible service that I felt the need to call San tan and tell them how much I appreciate them because the Tempe marketplace location was so terrible. I will never be buying from Tempe again. I suggest no one else does either.
Attended a class, originally paid the fee to attend. I was told at the time, if you cancel within 5 days we'll refund. I called the instructor who advised he was in transit to California and would get that refunded for me. I travel a lot so i understand it's tough to keep up, so i sent an e-mail to the team listed on the website regarding my intent to cancel. It's been a month, i have not received my refund and have not received any communication.
This place has gradually gone downhill. Tonight was the last straw. We ordered 2 Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. The tracker indicated  it was out of the oven at least 15 minutes before the driver headed out. The sandwiches were horrible. The bread was hard, there was very little meat on the sandwich and what was there was leathery and hard. We threw the food out. I have requested a refund but have not heard from the store.Sherry Weaver#neveragain
I booked a FREE OFFER King non-smoking room about 2 months ago. We arrived today at 3pm and were told by the front desk that our room was not ready yet and go come back at 4pm. I asked what time check in is and she said 2pm. She said they were sold out last night and the maids weren't finished cleaning the rooms. So we hung around and went back to the front desk at 4pm. She told us the rooms still weren't ready and to come back at 4:30pm and that the rooms should be done by 5pm. We go back at 4:30 and after waiting around still another 10 mins, we got our room key. We go up to the room and it's a double queen room. We go back down and tell them we booked a king and they said they don't have King rooms because they oversold them and a queen is the only room they have for us. We were furious and asked how could they give away King rooms that we had already booked???!! She said to come back and talk to management in the morning. So we will. So in addition to all that, our toilet doesn't flush and runs constantly. The beds feel like cardboard. Then the noise outside is insanely loud!!! It's 12pm and the music is still thumping. This is crap even if it's free!!! I'd rather pay money for quality! No wonder they beg people to come back!!! We'll never stay here again.
first off i called and the guy barley spoke any english then i had ordered a pizza and had decided to cancel so 2 minutes later i called and canceled but they still charged my credit card so i called and ask for a refund and they pretty much told me too bad so beware of this and i would suggest romas pizza very good and family owned
Came in and order at 3.16 pm waited for 30 mins. Still haven't gotten our order. Hopefully next time when I come bavk, we might get better service.
I was there and was NOT impressed. A friend and I paid our 10.00 cover each and bought 1 drink (7 & Coke) another 10.00 each, did not see "LEAP FROG, TUG-A-WAR & SIMON SAYS, YOUNG GOGO BOYS" as stated told on their website. Just a dark room with loud music, a few people dancing. I have been to much better clubs in other cities, with many places to go within the club, better drink prices, and better entertainment. Very disappointed!
worst experience I've ever had with dr. Torres I found out I was pregnant in July  but ended up  having a miscarriage in September . few appointments that I had with him he was very cold shouldered and I didn't feel he was really listening to what I had to say about my pregnancy that far. apparently after my 1st blood tests my estrogen was low so he prescribed me Progesterone 100 milligrams once a day. things didn't work out so come end of September I ended up scheduling a D&C. at that appointment he expressed that I probably have an estrogen issue since this was my 2nd miscarriage. He didn't know that by now????? smh...already frustrated with this location & this doc I was told I had to get went a follow-up. I did & he didn't even check me (didn't undress), he only asked me a few questions anything wrong, if I was trying to get pregnant again right away, if I want birth control pills and that was prety much the end of the visit. This doc didn't seem to care about my well being and didn't care enough to take better precautions with my blood results. oh & while he was asking me questions before my surgery he answered a personal call in front of me...he was talking about his hurt hip, a trip aka vacation, that he feels better now & he got rest... then slowly walked out of my room. horrible!!! the waiting time for this location is 2hrs plus. I would not go to this location!!!!!
Beware they surprise you with a 15% gratuity without letting you know.I should have read yelp reviews before I came here.. Service: The service we received was NOT good. Our waiters were rushy and rude. My sister ordered a soda and those Chinese donuts (cold) for her soup but it didn't come until halfway through our meal. Food: Yes they have a large selection to pick from but majority of what we ordered wasn't even good. I would never ever come here again.
I realllllllly wanted some minestrone soup!So, we went out to dinner, ordered our drinks and food at the same time (I ordered chicken alfredo w/ soup and my husband order tour of italy w/ salad).Got our drinks shortly after, he forgot to bring lemons for my water (I won't drink my water without lemons). Shortly after we got our drinks we brought out the salad and breadsticks, which was great. BUT, not my soup or lemons!! After the salad and breadsticks are completely gone, out comes our entrees, STILL NO SOUP! I had to ask for my soup and when I got it, it was horrible. The waiter would disappear and hardly checked on us.I seriously HATE going to this location, every time we go the service is HORRIBLE!Definitely will not be returning to this location, I would rather drive 15-20 mins to another location then to have to come back here.
This place is aweful. I got a drink and sandwich and didn't even walk out with a drink. I was on a hurry and the lady didn't give it to me. Guess that's how they make heir profit. The girls that work there are lazy. Don't greet you, and aren't too big on wanting to serve you. Also skimped out on the toppings.
Depending on who is working that day, you can wait anywhere between 5-10 minutes to go through the Drive-Thru! The manager always looks like he is lost. The positive: The manager apologizes at the window. Last excuse I was given was "I have a lot of new employees this week." Ok- but every time I came through for the last 9 months? Something isn't right...Oh- a panhandler selling subscriptions to some news publication often frequents the drive-thru.Update- STILL the slowest DD Drive-Thru is America.
Fedex sucks so hard that they hand off our deliveries to the USPS. What was the point in using FedEx in the first damn place.
Ordered a specialty hot club and got home to find it had NO turkey or ham on it...just bacon and the dressings/toppings.  That's my mistske for not checking it before I left...the box DID feel awfully light.  Learn from my mistakes, CHECK YOUR ORDERS before leaving.
I was a former subscriber for 2 decades.  Cancelled paper with invoice and two subsequent  phone calls to "Customer DIs-service".  Declined multiple offers to renew at low rate. Yesterday, I  received a "Past Due" Notice backdated 10 days for issues delivered after cancellation, the reason for my calls.  Customer rep claimed that they sent prior invoices (never received) for these issues.  Today, I paid bogus invoice just to get rid of them.  This paper has steadily deteriorated both in quality and quantity of content over past 10 years.  The customer service agents are often rude and incompetent.  Now the paper has taken a hard line approach to collect dubious debts. Fortunately, customers have much better choices for news and events, so AVOID THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC.
came in to do a smog since the regular place I go to is closed on Sundays. Was told that there will be 2cars a head of me so I decided to wait. Next thing it was 2more cars ahead of me. Yeah probably will never come back. No customer service at all. Not to mention that it took one of the guys litterraly 5mins to do an oil change. Hmmmmmm??
I encountered a situation where the elderly couple we were eating with shared a few pieces of shrimp after one of them ordered the steak and unlimited shrimp option. OK that was our bad,  we told them that they couldn't do that and they stopped. We ordered another round of shrimp and the manager decided to come over to our table and instead of politely notifying us that there is no sharing, it seemed like she wanted to announce it to the other tables around us and remind us that it says that on the menu. We offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue,  but the manager just said it was OK and walked away... The conversation between the manager and the elderly man after that was not professional and was indicative of someone who did not have enough training to diffuse a guest situation. Side note: if you and any other party members order their all you can eat shrimp option you still can't share. I made sure to clearly ask the server this question to be sure there was no misunderstanding. This rating is not because of the "no sharing" rule, I now take issue with the Outback Steakhouse slogan. The food was decent, but the situation should have been handled better. I have had ample customer and guest service training to know that much. I believe more training is necessary for both management and staff. The experience was bad enough to negate anything positive about the food. I will not be returning and cannot recommend this establishment to anyone.
Ordered delivery for me and the kids. Two hours later, our meal arrived. I called to inquire after about an hour. Was told that the delivery was on the way. Minutes later received a call that it was being fired and would be delivered soon. Do you think it was on the house? Nope. Just got a piece of cheesecake and  20% coupon. Not good enough. Now, let's talk food. The meatball "panini" was a piece of French bread with a bland/acidic sauce. The meatballs were overcooked and dry. Not a pleasant experience. The pizza sauce was also watery and bland. You'd think that a place called "Sauce" would have figured it out by now. Not so.
What a horrible unorganized, unprofessional and very slow business! Took my Truck to get paint fix that was falling off that I got done here. I had warranty so I took it back. They said it would be ready buy that Friday I took it a Monday called Friday it wasn't done I has to go out of town so the owner said it's ok we can leave it her until you come back. Came back a Tuesday 6l8 days later went to pick up my truck wasn't ready wait until that Friday called him no answer so I went and he shows me my truck with a different color paint and said if I wanted to take it like that I could? ???  Is that a serious response so I didn't take it he ruined it he fixes it. He said well come next Friday 3 WEEKS LATER on little paint job on a door turned into 3 almost a month. Then my truck passenger blinking light is out, Why? And my inside lights where moved why? There is no reason to have to be inside my truck to paint other then to move it. Then I had just pump gas full tank, I now have a no gas. I do not trust these guys I feel they took my Truck on a joy ride and don't even clean off the mess I have paint splashes all over the truck and the owner still has the balls to say "I'll let you wash that" what the F
The food lacked flavor and was really bland!!!  I had the tandoori chicken and my wife had some type of masala. Both dishes didn't look the right and didn't have the right seasoning or taste. It's was a big disappointment, especially since she is pregnant and craves good Indian food.  My wife and I have been very fortunate to have Indian friends in LA show us great food, so we think we can tell what is good and what isn't. The only nice thing is the service was good. I should have known something was wrong when there were on four people ( two couples) including my wife and I.
View was beautiful and I enjoyed the roof top atmosphere. The food was absolutely horrid and the service was worse. If your into dried out awfully put together overpriced burgers with no sides your in the right Place. Our waitress could not have cared less about the service she was providing. It took almost an hour to get our ticket and refills on any drink were never going to happen. She added gratuity to the ticket which explains why she simply did not care about the service she provided. Horrible restaurant with a prime location.
I put my mail on HOLD while away on vacation. I returned home to crumbled mail that piled up in my mailbox. The Squirrel Hill Post Office apparently never sent my Hold Mail Request. After returning from vacation, I decided to stop by to make sure I didn't have any mail at the post office even though I still had mail delivered. I waited in line for 15 minutes for the man to tell me to go to the East Liberty location to check.  He was the only person working the counter and there was no sense of urgency as he waited on customers. I made my way over to the East Liberty location to find myself waiting another 20 minutes in line, again with only one person working the counter and she was extremely rude. I came to find out that I did not have any mail held, so Squirrel Hill never honored my request. What a waste of time. Never again!
No I no why all the Fridays have shut down..Walked in at 930 pm an the kitchen was closed also was there twice in the last year, food was terrible, didn't pay and walked out..WTF.  maybe take some pointers from Applebee's on food quality an service. Will never ever go there again..Shut it down
Be sure you know if you have to reschedule, there is a $25 charge if you don't reschedule the same week. They don't ever tell you this. "It's in your paperwork," they say. All ten pounds of it.
Worst service i have ever recieved in my life. Myself and a friend came in after work to relax and get our nails done. The person who did hers didnt understand almomd shaped, messed up on her nails and then blamed her... really? Friend ended up telling her to take em off and walked out. I wanted simple tips with black, tell my why my tips are dark blue and not black. The tips are uneven. Never again will i come here
Stay away. Over exaggerates and nit-picks using his limited knowledge.
Beer selection is good. Burger had no flavor. Ordered the peach and prociutto salad. Had 3 small pieces of prociutto and they were the un-edible fatty parts (couldn't chew it). Told the waitress who said the manager told her it was fat (duh!). Service was good.Not worth the $60 bill. Too bad was hoping this place would be good.
I would give them zero stars if I could. Terrible experience with reception and parking staff.
So I take my truck for a wash.  After they pull it out of the wash, it sits in the sun without being moved forward as cars ahead are completed.  Needless to say the truck was covered in sun-dried water spots.  I ask the have it run through again.  This time it's in the shade in line, but they take so long for get to it, it dried.   Once they do get to it, attendants do the windows, wheels, and inside oiling (I call it that because dash and arms rests are dripping with something oily).  The outside body of my truck didn't not get a wipe down.  Spotty, dirt, and bird droppings left on it that running through the wash didn't get.  Do not go here.  You'll be wasting your money and leaving disappointed.
Horrible food, worse music, inattentive staff and overpriced drinks. No wonder they closed.
Would not take my Entertainment Book coupons off of my phone, although they obviously signed up for that option since it was offered. Wasn't very pleasant when not letting me use it either. Work on your customer service and don't offer things that you're not willing to provide
This is my first post to Yelp. It has taken a lot for me to actually do this as I my self am in customer service. This McDonalds is horrible. It is filthy! I drive a lifted vehicle and you can see the floors and counters while I'm in the drive through , atrocious. I travel a lot and see a lot of drive throughs and this is bad. They're constantly out of supplies (Coffe, soda, ketchup).  I am currently sitting at a booth that half of the cushions are missing, no sign, tape or anything warning someone not to sit there. Because of convenience I try it once a month but I will drive the extra distance to another one. Please, someone raise the standards.OMG. I just checked my order. Took them 3 times to get it right......
I'm posting this review while sitting in the waiting room to see Dr. Waltman.  This is a review of just the front office staff.  I was asked to come to my 10:15 appointment 30 minutes early to fill out the necessary me patient forms.  I arrived 55 minutes early.  Provided my ID and insurance card then day to complete my ppwk.  After I finished I went to turn it in.   The girl in the front glanced at it and told me(rather rudely) I had to fill out the insurance portion.  I said to her that I thought that was why they took a copy of my card.  She gave me a funny look and said you have to fill it out.  I took the forms back and walking away I muttered.... that's a pain in the ass.  After completing them I handed them back to her and she said they'd call me.  About 10 min later I was called by a different lady to pay my Co pay.  As I was talking to the new lady the ride one interrupted our conversation by saying that I'm not allowed to swear in here, that kind of language isn't permitted.  Lol I'm sure I looked at her crazy because honestly I had forgotten that I even said anything since it wasn't directed at her.  I asked what I said and she said you called me a pain in the ass.  I told her I want talking to her and that comment was more to myself.  She replied with you're not allowed to talk like that.  At this point I'm getting irritated because I honestly wasn't talking to her and I had explained that,  so I told her... generally speaking if I were going to ball someone a pain in the ass I would look them in the face and straight up tell them that they are a f#%#ing pain in the ass.  Then I sat down.  Needless to say, this was not the best 1st impression they could've made on me.
Worst Mexican food that I've ever had. Ever. I have no other words to describe it. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Burgers is bland and tasteless, relies on toppings. So expensive. Hot dog is tiny and terribly salty. Fries are similar to Harveys, don't compare to New York Fries. Would not go back.
Ate all U Can Eat Hot Pot on Saturday night. 24 Hours later when I reviewed the photo I took, I saw a freaking FLY in my soup. It's probably in my stomach now.
If you didn't think this location could get any worse. You are wrong! Food absolutely disgusting. They gave us food that had obviously been sitting out for a long time. Our burgers... one burger had 2 too buns and one had 2 bottom buns? I'm sure y'all think you are being funny but at least serve me food that isn't sitting out for god knows how long.I swear their franchisee needs to get his or her shit together because they should just SHUT DOWN THIS DUMP! Or higher people who are messing up their business!
I had been to this nail salon a few years ago and they did a nice job. I had a particular design in mind this visit which included some intricate straight lines. The technician tried her best to draw the lines, but I was surprised the tools that she used, instead of a thin brush like I have seen used in other salons I've been to, she used a bulky thick brush. So all the lines came out thick, uneven, and wavy. I didn't really like it, but it was late and I didn't want to make a fuss. After a day, the lines really started to bother me, so I called to see if they would fix it being that I was charged $14 for design on 4 out of my 10 nails. On top of the manicure being $10 more than other salons, $14 for design, and leaving a 20% tip, they told me, they would charge me for fixing the nails. It's not about the money, obviously I spend money to get me nails done. It's about the lack of customer service that they offered. Think twice before going to this over priced salon that lacks good customer service and just wants your money. Thanks for actually responding on Yelp. However, it would've been nice to actually get this over the phone when I called, instead I was told there was nothing you could do, except charge me. The lines were thick and wavy, maybe you need to look closely at the picture to see that. As far as your 7-day policy, I called the very next day, so I'm not sure how that's comes into play. I ok'd the design cause we were already 2 1/2 hours in and like I said prior, I didn't want to make a fuss. My problem wasn't with the tech, she did a great job, besides the lines. My problem was with the management  not caring that I was displeased with my nails after 1 day and after dropping $70 in their salon. They treated me like I was trying to get something for free. If they had said, why don't you come in so we can take a look. Who knows I probably would've paid to get it fixed. But they didn't want to hear my side of the story. I love having my nails done, and always receive compliments on them daily. In turn I love to refer folks to the salons I visit to so they too can have that experience. But the way I was treated at this salon was unnecessary, so I had to address it. I wish The Nail Room much success.
Hey how about instead of throwing my fiod in my car you ask me if I want any condiments.   The ketcheup natzi at 11:30 on Monday May 30th was offensive and rude.  Plus NO  napkins.
I don't get why people are giving this place rave reviews. Sushi rice is overcooked and mushy in the rolls makes the seaweed soft. Sashimi isn't fresh. The waitress was chewing food while serving. So many of our food items did not come. Website says serves oysters on weekends, they do not.
First & last time I'll be staying here. Came for an event at the convention center & this was their hotel of choice. Two biggest complaints I had was the heat never worked in my room & I called about it but nobody ever arrived. Second, woke up in at 4a to hear a dripping noise. Water was coming up out of the sink & spilling over onto the bathroom floor & on my stuff I had sitting on the counter. Housekeeping came up but it took them calling their engineers a few time before someone arrived to fix it. Needless to say not a fun experience at all. You can tell this hotel has some age on it & needs to be redone. Other items of note - fridge had smelly food left in it from previous occupant, no free coffee in room, trash by the elevator never emptied & it reeked. I'm sure there's more but my tired brain is done.
My experience here was horrific. The service here is terrible. My green curry was so salty, that I had to ask for them to fix it. When they brought it back out, it was still salty. I asked again, this time I asked if I could exchange it for red curry. The waiter said,"No, I can fix it again." The third time they brought it out; they just added coconut milk and it wasn't even spicy anymore. I will never come here again.
This world is so frustrating sometimes. Went to Walmart to grab a pool float, well as I am walking down the aisle. I see a man and a stroller bent over with some pilers and a box. Well it made a noise and I booked it back, he threw down the pilers and put the box in the stroller. Leaving the security tag and the pilers . I followed him and went to security. Told him what the man was wearing. He said "oh people are watch the cameras they will get it if they see anything". So basically this guy walked off with what I'm guessing is a cell phone without paying for it.  In my mind I was weary because he had his kid with him. But SERIOUSLY! What is wrong with people. Do nothing about criminal activity and let him get away. I only wonder what his child will learn from him. Smdh basically they do nothing when informed of someone stealing. Your loss prevention isn't working
Terrible service. Mediocre food. We literally spent 2.5 hours here just trying to have lunch. It became a case of weighing how much time we had already invested vs. 'should we just get up and leave.' We should have left. By the time we were done, most of the nearby shops had closed. I don't know what took so long, as the sandwiches were on par with something a 5-year-old could have slapped together -- white bread, mayo, luncheon meat, iceberg lettuce. Our waitress  failed to bring salad dressing after two requests, so I went up front to get it myself. A bus girl said she would bring it. When she failed to, I went up front yet again and this time waited for her to bring it out of the kitchen. This experience has taught me to always check the yelp review first, not an hour into a bewilderingly bad experience.
I HATE THIS PLACE!!! I had the worst experience! I have a regular stylist who went back home to Chicago for the summer. I was approached about this salon and their new location. I called, explained my hair type and style and asked who would be best to serve me. The receptionist advised me which stylist would be best, and I booked the appointment. I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job. I should have walked out then, but I didn't. I told myself, "let's give the stylist a chance." I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures. I left in tears, she BUTCHERED my hair!! I was VERY disappointed, I will never step foot in that salon ever again! I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone! :(I have been to different hair salons trying to find a stylist that fits me. I was hoping to finally end this long search. This is why despite my initial interaction, I decided to give the younger stylist a chance. I honestly, was hoping to find someone I could rely on regularly. My current stylist is always in and out of town. She has done this for many years and this is no longer a job to her its hobby so she's not always available.This was a complete disaster, I left in tears and cried for 3 hours. I had to go to Fantastic Sam's near my home to help clean up the mess the stylist left me with. I wear a sassy short hair cut but not a MULLLET! With the extensive explaining, and pictures I for sure thought I would leave at the least satisfied or with something I could work with! I cannot do anything but wait for this disaster to grow out. I am devistated, and I would think twice, three, even four times before you take a risk at this salon. I will say this, the salon lay out is nice, and the atomosphere is upbeat however, the skills ARE JUST NOT THERE!!!
Great concept,  just not executed properly.I had seen this idea online and thought that it would be a great double date idea. Unfortunately it turned out to be a terrible idea.Pros:- great idea of "snookerball"Cons:- value. For the price that you are paying,  my group of 4 were barely able to finish 1 game. 5 minutes before the end of the game we were given our warning. -Service. A majority of the waiters and waitresses were just standing around. Hovering around the bar eating and doing nothing.  It was difficult to get our waitress to even help us out or place an order for food. -I have never felt so in the way. At our 5 minute warning essentially the hostess lingered around our lane and waited for us to break and told us we had to leave. We still had 5 minutes left, but that didn't matter. We still had food and drinks, but were told to hurry up and leave. -Food. Terrible. You definitely do not get what you pay for.  We ordered the nachos with beef. Order anything else off the menu. Save yourself the disappointment!
This is about the Buckeye location.My experience with this company was horrific. It is bad enough that your vehicle gets towed but then to have to deal with an agency that is dishonest, rude, unscrupulous and participates in the behavior of cheating the public , makes the experience that much worse. This company has a $50 fee to have your car released on a day it is closed or after hours. However, they do not tell you that even AFTER you ask for options on how to pick up your vehicle. Instead, they hold your car for an additional 3 days and charge you $30 a day simply telling you that it's not their job to provide you with  truthful answers to the questions you've asked. Great job DV TOWING, robbing the public and generating gain on the back of this cities residents. I will be going a step further and reporting them. I've already forgiven them but I hope that they will experience financial consequences for their poor business practices. As a public we deserve to deal with trustworthy companies, no matter what their occupation. No wonder their ratings are so low!
Horrible service. Rude people. Please don't waist your time and money going to this place.
The worst hotel experience that I have ever had!! I had reserved a room here for a weekend during spring training with my boyfriend and friend. When we first arrived we just dropped off our bags and left, not really looking around at the features the room had to offer. Later that night we came back to call it a night when my boyfriend called me from the bathroom to come see what he found. He had smashed a bedbug that was pretty big which was far from comforting. After this experience we looked on the floors and bed and saw at least 4 bugs running across the room and sheets. If that wasn't exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom. Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts. They offered to move us to a different room but at that point we wanted nothing to do with the room.  The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name. If you've ever seen the movie " The Birds", it can compare to the experience that my friends and I shared at this Motel 6.
Terrible customer service , overprice , only one mechanic at the shop , 3 weeks to fix my bike ; owner dale kieffer so rude I never come back again.... Yamaha dealer same price excellent service
I would give Neat Freakz zero stars because they are completely unprofessional! I made an appointment, confirmed over the phone and was sent a confirmation email the day prior to my appointment. At the very time they were suppose to show up, I got an email saying they canceled my appointment, stating I was out of their service area (not true according to their website). Now they won't even return my calls. Do not use Neat Freakz ever!!!
Pros: coffee is absolutely amazing Cons: service is terrible with hipster attitude, like they don't even want to serve you.  Watched a cockroaches climb all over the counter where the espresso machine is, if that's during the day, can't imagine what's it's like at night . Employee was very Blaise about it. Oh, came up from the basement. Their ordering system from the baked goods is whack. More often nothing available and then only really stocked for sat and Sunday. Honestly, the cockroaches were gross but it's a restaurant but the service is terrible.  Never a smile, kind of grumpy .
Be prepared to wait 45 minutes for 3 burritos!!! Oh and it'll also cost you a small fortune. This place was great when it first opened but it has gone down hill. Hoping the business reads the reviews and makes some changes.
This over weight cook is according to the "M" resort in Las Vegas has been DISALLOWED on their property since 2010 for declining  public interest in her Martini time show.
If I could give this 0 stars I would.Delivery took an hour. Pizza arrived cold and not prepared as ordered. Sausage is completely unseasoned pork topping.  Gross is the only word I can think of to describe this pizza. Save your money. You'll get better pizza from the frozen food aisle at Giant Eagle.
I HATE THIS SHIPPING COMPANY... BUYER BEWARE!!I placed an order with vitacost.com on 10/12/14 and I was very excited when they shipped it out that very night and received a "delivered" the very next day! I went to get my mail at the leasing office and they never got my package, in fact it is Memorial Day and no mail, no packages. I found that to be strange, so I said that my package says that it was signed for by a Robert E. and they claimed that no Roberts are employed.  So I called the neighboring leasing office and they said the same thing... weird. SO I called Ontrac and they claim that the driver delivered it and I should have it, just go to Robert E. I explained that we have no such person.  So her bright idea was "oh just call vitacost.com maybe they will issue you a refund or replacement." I said "I tried them already, since you said it was delivered, I am S.O.L!" and she then decided that she will ask the driver what happened and call me back. *Right like the driver is going to say "Yeah I lost her package, my bad." 2 days later I get a call back, she says "The driver says he placed it at the leasing office and it is there now."  I put her on hold and with my 2nd line I called my leasing office and nope sure enough, not there.  SO I asked her to have the driver call me when he is there so I can prove it to you all that you're at the wrong property.  The lady told me that she can't do that. But she will contact him again and call back. The next day, I get another call from Ontrac, this time they say that the driver is adamant that he placed a door tag on my unit number and left the package in the leasing office.  So I said "ok that sounds ok if the driver is lying out of his a$$!" She said "He swears." I said "I would like you to tell me... do I have an apartment number on my address?" She looked and said "Um, Oh, Um, No... there is no apartment number listed."  I then said "Then how the Hell did your driver leave me a Door tag???? He didn't, because your driver is a LIAR, since I know for a fact that my leasing office wouldn't have given him my apartment number!" She said she would call him and then call me back. 2 days later: I get another call, now from a completely different person, trying to sell me that last bit of garbage from the previous call, about the door tag nonsense.  She then decided that she would call me back. After 3 more days of no contact, I decided I would email them a letter of "WTF happened to my package!" I am still waiting for a response. However I did get a refund finally from Paypal.com of all places! I opened a claim and stated my case and they sided with me.
If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.I have been coming here since they opened about six years ago. I am always serviced by Robert, who is the only good thing at this place and he will soon see he is simply too good for the people he works for.One day, I decided to try the blow dry bar. I had a great experience with a nice girl. I then called to schedule another appointment with her and did not remember her name, so I referred to her as the white girl and then there were two other African American girls who work there.The girl that I usually saw was not there this day, so I asked if they had any other people working who weren't the African American girls because I thought they only did hair cuts and African American girls hair. Either way, it is none of their business why or who I wanted to do my hair. I am the one PAYING!I tried scheduling an appointment for my massage about a week later and the owner Scott gets on the phone and calls me racist and tells me that he does not want me to return to the spa. WOW! He then said he would call me back that day to talk further. He never returned my call. I had to physically go there and have the receptionist call him to give me a call. Talk about unprofessional. I never wanted to cause any problems here, but Eva, the owners wife, has not once acknowledged my existence when I'm spending thousands and thousands of dollars at her spa! And to think I wanted to be serviced by someone who doesn't even say hello to me or introduce themselves. Now I'm here to tell the truth about the sick minds behind this business.They rail people in with their promotions and then when you go to pay, they only will accept one gift card per transaction. Do not waste your money at this place. They are frauds and make false accusations.Also, the owner said he just fired an employee for making racial comments. What do you expect from a spa in the middle of FOX CHAPEL?! Every women who walks in that door has been fed with a silver spoon and more.
Ugh. I despise Kinko's. I despise everything about Kinko's. I don't even know where to begin. Buckle in, this is bound to be long winded.Once upon a time, I thought Kinko's was this magical place full of neat machines and free paperclips that was constantly full of cool projects and was hopping twenty four hours a day. Then I began to need to use them for my job, and that's just when all the trouble began. First of all, very few Kinko's, if any, are even open twenty four hours a day anymore! But that was just the initial crack in their facade for me. See, I used to be able to just email them a document as an attachment, and put instructions in the body of the email. Then I would follow up with a call to make sure they got the file, which they always did. They would tell me over the phone when I could pick it up, and the orders were always on time. THEN everything changed. They no longer accept email orders. They have created the most complicated and horribly bass-ackwards program on their website to upload documents. I understand why they did it, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just saying the program needs some major overhauling because it never ever ever EVER works right. Either I can't explain what I need to them through their structured questions, or it won't upload right, or the submit button doesn't work. Then, once I finally get it to work, I have to call them 20-30 minutes later. Generally, they still haven't received my file by my first call. So I call back. I'm left on hold forever, and when they return, they still have to ask a billion questions about my order because their system doesn't tell them what they need to know. It takes virtually forever.I really feel for the employees at Kinko's. I once worked for a copy shop, and I know how hectic things can get. That being said, I have never witnessed more incompetent help in my life. I don't blame any of the individuals that work there, Kinko's probably just has provided very little useful training for them. But still, I dread going in there. Even to simply pick up a completed order, it will take no less than 30 minutes.On top all of that, Kinko's is expensive. Needlessly so. Simply because they have a stranglehold over the copying business gives them no right to charge those ridiculous rates for various services. Blow it out your a$$, Kinko's!
First off a came in and the guy didn't acknowledge me, and when he thought it was a decent time to ask me if I needed help. I told him that I called for tires cause I had a flat then, the guy said wait a minute and helped a guy who just wanted air in his tire so I waited for them to finish and he said how can I help you again and I said I would like a tire, then he asked for my keys said have. I been here before then said you can sit down now. If I wasn't form another city I wouldn't have come but I'm in a tight situation so I had to bite the bullet. Never again tho
Left me in waiting room for 45 minutes, forgot I was there, had 5 minute interview because I had to get back to work and said they would call me , never did.
Maki my way doesn't even make maki! Worst sushi ever. The waiter / cashier messed up our order twice! Even when one was an allergy! On top of all that our tummys were not agreeing with us all night.
I go to Starbucks almost every day this is second time I have encountered rude staff and I will definitely NEVER come back at this location. someone should probably look into this...
Ordered fried noodles. NOT GOOD AT ALL. All I tasted was the OIL. There wasn't much but there wasn't any salt, soy, garlic, I MEAN NOTHING. That's why I was able to taste the OIL on the noodles. There wasn't even a soy sauce package in my bag. You want REAL, TASTY, HAWAIIN FOOD, CHECK OUT ISLAND FLAVOR off Durango. THE BEST.ok - Why did I call and spoke w/Judith (acting supervisor) and 2 THUMBS DOWN really now.  I told her that my chicken looked and tasted like it was from yesterday. And she totally didn't hear what I was telling her. She kept repeating that they use "fresh" chicken everyday. Please your a supervisor OF COURSE your gona say that BUT if the customer is telling you that the chicken is NOT FRESH ummm get a clue. Then she tells me that I have to bring the food back. OK WAIT LET ME THROW IT UP N BRING IT BACK. Hello this was my lunch time. I don't have time to take it back after work either. And she tells me that in order for me to get a refund OR another dish..I have to bring it back...wwhhaatt!!! OMG. Please hire a SMART, PROFESSIONAL supervisor that knows how to HANDLE these types of situations. I tell her that as a customer when someone calls and says there food is BAD it should be an AUTOMATIC thing to offer the customer a refund OR come back ANY DAY WITHOUT THE LEFT OVERS and pick something else. She mentioned to me that the reason why they ask customers to bring food back is because they HAVE ALOT OF PEOPLE CALLING IN and say THERE FOOD WASN'T GOOD...UGH HUGE CLUE, RED FLAG...Im not the only one..Get a clue Aloha Kitchen..IF YOUR GETTING ALOT OF PHONE CALLS, I would highly take it seriously on why your location is getting a lot of phone calls on how BAD YOUR FOOD IS...
I walked in this place with my daughter, after a few years having not eaten here in a while. Needless to say the place is still the same which is something one can appreciate in a small joint like this. However one thing we noticed as soon as we walked in, was a foul odour. This was very off-putting and it was combined with the odour from the sickly looking goldfish on the counter. Poor little fella. Lol. So we casually looked at each other and gave our "code nod" with our heads, to exit. We opted not to order from here. This place does not appear to be very clean. With all that said the food could very well be tasty. Take your chances.
First day, thought I would try them out. The concept is good, but the execution seems flawed. I don't really know what i was expecting - I guess that the sausage would taste a lot different from a cheap BBQ'd Toronto street food hot dog - it really didn't. They might be home made and (possibly) one would assume nitrate free, but they didn't taste that much different. Even the hot dog buns are the same as the ones you get on the street (i.e. the exactly the same - yes, that cheap-ass bread that goes soggy the moment any moisture hits it). Surely a gourmet hot dog deserves at least a home made gourmet bun to go with it? We had two hot dogs. They both came with a rather nasty creamy coleslaw that doesn't really work too well in a hot dog. A portion of fries was greasy and soggy. Tastier sauerkraut can be found in the supermarket.Service was fine and friendly - the place wasn't busy. However, they will need to move faster when there is a rush on.  The drinks on offer are actually more appealing than the food - very decent and surprisingly varied beer selection and home made sodas.So onto value - with tax these hot dogs are pushing $10 a piece (some are over that). Are they 3x better than some of the hot dog vendors on the street? No. More importantly - would we recommend this place or be going back? - unfortunately not. Overall just really disappointing. I know it is the first day, but there are some fundamental misses here on the taste side of the house - the service was fine. We had high hopes for this concept, but I think we will stick with the gourmet burgers for now.
the manager of megatunes breathes down my neck every tme i go in. i'm not sure whether he thinks i'm a shoplifter or what, but it's irritating.this store does have more good music than most else in calgary, but frankly i've been feeling a little cheated since i saw the edmonton megatunes! way nicer. no fair! regardless, i check sloth first and buy cds there when i can.
After coming to Vegas for five times now, Flamingo hotel has the worse customer service I've ever seen. After multiple calls for service request because our shower wouldn't work, they lied and said that they did not have any other room available so we would have to wait for engineer to come to fix the shower (when? Who knows). No one ever came to fix the shower and they finally switched us to a different room (no room available, huh?) They do not care whether you are unhappy with your stay or not. A girl named Teddy is extremely rude and should not be working in customer service. Also, the manager here could care less if u complain. So please don't waste your vacation and find a better hotel to stay at. They do not even deserve one star. Please save yourself a headache and do not stay here.
I wish I could give zero stars this place is awful and the staff is incredibly rude. I ordered food got the wrong order but didn't have time to wait another 20 minutes for a new grilled cheese so I ate it and they threw a fit that we complained that the food didn't come as ordered but we still ate it. They argued with us and then threw us out. Needless to say we won't be returning. Thumbs definitely down for this spot.
I think I may have broken a tooth on a rock in my mashed potatoes.  Service was great but......,
MOST UNPROFESSIONAL BUSINESS LADY I HAVE EVER MET!! This woman is VERY rude and charges EXTRA for everything including shoes with your tuxedo rental. She has everyone in the party come in for "measurements" then when you come back to try on your clothes NOTHING FITS!!!! Im pretty sure she does this on purpose because she charges for each alteration on your dress!! The men's tuxedos DID not fit so we had to wait while she did alterations. Her alterations are done half fast and are very noticeable. It is VERY HOT in her place and her dressing rooms are very dark. Trying on clothes in this place is disgusting because its HOT in there! She has her kids running around everywhere and makes her workers take care of her kids as well as take care of the customers needs! Her workers are overwhelmed and frustrated because ALL the customers are complaining to them because none of the clothes fits! Tuxedos are OLD and dingy! The white shirts have stains and some of the pants have cigarette burns in them! DO NOT PUT YOURSELF THRU THE HELL WE WENT THRU WITH THIS LADY AND GO ELSEWHERE!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE FRUSTRATION!!!
I am convinced that everyone giving this place good reviews must be confusing this with somewhere else, or its the same people that keep terrible places like Macayo's in business.  I ate here a while ago, and I thought I would give it a second chance last week. It was still bad. If a Mexican food place can't make refried beans well, I'm not sure what they can make. They taste like they are straight from the can. For a place that touts all of the other fresh items they serve, some effort on their beans would be nice.  The rice had little flavor. Tortilla was ok at best. The prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality. Also, not a huge deal but you need to pay 25 cents for a soda refill, this just bothers me.If you want great Mexican food in Surprise, go to Rito's on Reems and Greenway. Nothing in Surprise comes close, especially this place.
Huge disappointement.  Food was below average and lacked flavor.  The branzino was overcooked and tasteless.   The Bigoli was undercooked and ordinary.   The service was subpar.  The only thing worth while in what we ordered were the brussels sprouts and the "agrumi e ricotta". Perhaps our expectations were too high...?!?!
Not great customer service! Had a question about lighting and had to wait for 20 minutes while someone was paged to help me! Not impressed. The cashier was creepy...moronic grin on her face for no reason.
I went in with my mother that raved about this place  and we were both highly disappointed. The cups were very dirty and I was served food that I am allergic after making a point of what I could not have. I went to the bathroom and one of the server girls didn't flush the toilet or wash her hands. I felt so sick after seeing that after all the other events that transpired. On the way out the host had a nice nasty look that expressed happily holidays bitches I don't like working here by the cold door. First time in last time out.
We went to see Star Wars on  1/14/17 .... there were these two men extremely drunk talking and laughing through the whole movie and when someone tried to say something they were intimidating... I did not feel safe... I would not recommend this theater ... no ushers checking the theaters...
The worst experience ever!! The security guard was so rude and disgusting towards the guest I would never recommend anyone to stay here with employees like that. I felt so judged by my appearance and age because some have health problems and she wants to try and judge a book by its cover never stay here if you want to feel anything less of a human
It used to be a decent location, not any more. Staff likes to argue a lot with guests, steamroom is constantly broken, sauna is all over the place - hot one day, cold the other. Showerheads are being replaced with the most horrible ones, barely a leak on your head, not even strong enough to remove the soap. Oh, yeah, and they threaten members with "termination" in case if showerheads are removed, which, as you might guess, happens a lot and for a good reason. I guess they think they can win the war against their own customers? I hope they will be able to enjoy the spoils :)
The service is slow and not very friendly and the pizza tastes store bought. I've tried to eat here several times with friends. But it just doesn't seem to do anything for me. There's a Jack in the Box across the parking lot with hot food and friendly service.
This place SUCKS! The guy was very nice on the phone taking my order, but then 30 MIN later, I receive some call from Gary saying that they do not deliver to me. Thanks for letting me know when I placed my order and gave you my cc# already!!I don't know how the pizza is yet, from other location, because it has yet to arrive. Waste of time
Went in for Pho Ga with ginger sauce. Started to eat and then notice a bug in ginger sauce........It was a COCKROACH!!!!......UGG........waiter replaced with no explanation or apology....That ended our dining experience here forever......Where or Where is the Health Department????
This place really is as ratchet as it gets. Staying here for 3 nights and my room hasn't been cleaned. Nor have I gotten any fresh towels. Oh and I have a low-fi tube TV in my room? Really?
Solo diners beware: You will be ignored. I showed up this evening to a mostly empty restaurant with loud pumping club music and a deejay talking to himself (?!). The greeters were very nice and seated me right away at a completely empty sushi bar (?!). After five minutes of neither the sushi chefs nor a server so much as acknowledging my presence, I left. Clearly they're not interested in my business.
I ordered rice and beef. Te first was cold and without any seasoning and the second had more fat than anything else. My dog who eats everything would refuse to eat  that food. I would never recommend it to anybody. I selected one star cause it would not allow me to post without doing it. It doesn't deserve any.
There is absolutely no need to visit this place. Dry, from the box-like taco shells housed tasteless meat, uninspired toppings and ended up being probably the worst taco I've had in my life.The nachos were thoroughly bad. Gross cheese, and the chips were round! What self respecting Mexican serves round tortilla chips?The ordering process was painfully inefficient and the staff were not the friendliest.Why this place thought they could compete with all the solid places on Queen St. to get a taco is beyond me. I give them 6 months and they'll be gone.
I'd give it zero if I could. Wait an hour to get a half assed Dr visit. They just pawn you off to quest diagnostics and don't take the time to get to know you or your ailments. The staff has overcharged payments, lost payments, charts and literally had me wait an hour bc they didn't know I was sitting in the waiting room!Not the type of place I would entrust my health and that of my family.........
There are some well-qualified, very gifted physicians there -- but you pay a high price getting to one.  The clinic is the most impersonal place you'll ever have the misfortune of visiting.  You feel exactly like a part on an assembly line at CEC.  Horrible place.  You feel devalued.
Been here a few times. My husband likes the different tacos, I don't. They are all mediocre. Service usually sucks for mediocre food. Called for reservations for his birthday, when I wanted to add two more people to the party, I was told that I couldn't because seats fill up too fast. When I explained that it was his birthday, the lady could care less. Her response was "well at 945 at night we can seat that many people." My reservation is for 515. Completely ruined his birthday. And it's completely ridiculous. After this- will never return. My money and time is clearly more appreciated elsewhere.
Horrible Food don't waste your moneyThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.Loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. I looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.
Turns out to be just as shady as uber.  They lie about being insured just like uber, the drivers are virtually all the same nasty people who drive for uber and their surge rates are almost always on even at the slowest times of day.  I'll pay more and wait longer for a cab.  At least cabs have insurance and a live person monitoring the trip from dispatch.
This place does not accept debit cards?? They have to catch up with the times, this is Not such chinese village in china, they are 100 years back in time, wont come here again!!
Thought to try this place out for the first time so got to-go order of goat masala, chicken seekh kabab and garlic naan.hugely disssapointed, they made goat curry and chicken kababs unexpectedly too salty and naan was burnt/over cooked.I immediately called them up to complain and response for salty goat curry was that "We make it in huge quantity", what does that even mean and how is that an excuse or justification for salty food. Such a waste of money, this place is so not upto expectations at all!
This place has horrible service. I never get my food fresh, and whenever I try to order a shake or slushee the machine is either broken or they ran out of it. I always have to repeat myself whenever I order, even when I'm inside speaking directly to the cashier! I do not like this place at all.
Zero stars. We waited 30 minutes for our food and ended up getting our money back because they are totally disorganized and slow. They were messing up all the drive thru orders also. They also took away the free drink refills. I do not recommend this place at all.
Wow this jersey mikes has gone down hill!!!!!!!!I usually am a huge fan of coming here!!!! Location really seems like it's run down it doesn't smell clean like the other locations .The only reason why they're getting a one star is because they don't have pickles at this location!!Whoever the owner is of this jersey Mike's location talk to whoever you get your pickles from a talk them your customers want pickles. even the girl behind the counter said that everybody is complaining that there's no pickles at this location..Go do your job as an owner and get the damn pickles back
I was not a fan of this location or the staff.  The food was sub par, the service was lacking, and overall it was not a good experience.  For the amount of $$ per dish I expect it to be prepared better
Food was nasty, burger was dry and French fry's were soggy, that was just some of the food. We were charged twice for our meal. Took the server and manager 3 try's to get the bill changed. The manager actually asked me if I wanted to fight all the servers because one of the male servers was staring at me like a watch dog that wanted to fight when I went outside to wait for the manager to figure out her "computer" malfunction. "Just call corporate if you have a problem" is what I was told by the server that was standing with the manager outside as I was finally paying for our lousy overpriced meal. So that is what I will do, and I will be sure to mention that the manager asked, "what are you going to fight all the servers?" Professional management skills shined through as she told that same male who was obviously watching me as if I would bail on a measly $60 check to just go away like she was his mom! Never again!
2 bit hacks that can't keep a schedule, then talk to you as if you're not able to afford other options should you choose them. Needless to say I'm in business dress (suit) and they still assume as such. They refused to take my money no less. Apple has continually declined in aptitude, product development and dare I say it, innovation. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Ladies and gents, avoid this store and avoid these products. It's all downhill from here.
new location out front of Outlet mall. It is Roberto's not the best not the work just plain "a ok"updateThis location  sucks. The smell in this place is horrible, I went in today and ordered a bacon breakfast burrito...it was OK but they charged me $5 for it..I thought it was a special price on Tuesday...I guess not at this location, I am OK paying $5 for a breakfast burrito but this thing wasn't worth $3. plus the smell oh my was it bad.
Since they started delivery, in-person service has become very hit and miss. I've had 15-20 minute waits for my order, including one situation where they forgot to put the order in, and one where they forgot to give me my completed sandwich for 15 minutes. My most recent visit resulted in a sandwich with what I'd consider to be ingredients-gone-bad. I brought the sandwich down and returned it and felt like the manager in charge at the time was defensive and unhelpful. Since I can no longer trust the food, I have since not been back (nearly two months now). When Byte is good, it's great. But recently there has been more bad days than good, and I hear constant complaints  from co-workers about how good it used to be and how shoddy everything has become. I suspect Byte has been a victim of its own success, and doesn't really have the infrastructure to handle both delivery and in-person pick up. I'm really disappointed. The sandwiches can be really decent, if over-priced. But it's so unpredictable.
I use to love this place however I had a bad experience there on Saturday night. A few friends and I came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress (a stubby Caucasian lady) came over and we asked about their beers - she promptly turned a drink menu to us. Then we asked about the shooters they had and she rudely said "uh like all of them". Okay. I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers. It was apparent she didn't want to be there. Later on, the bill came to $46 so my friends put down two twentys and a ten. The waitress came over and said "you need change?" and we did not. I did not want my friends to pay for me but I only had a $50 bill with me. She saw that I wanted to pay for my own meal so she came over to me and quickly said "Your meal was $10, if I give you two twentys (from the pile) and take your fifty, then you have paid for your meal". Me, being a bit buzzed and tired said "Sure" and then she quickly took my fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away my friend realized "You know we tipped her $14 for shitty service right?" I was appalled - it felt like she manipulated me in order to get $10 more tip. I would be ok with tipping 30% IF the server was friendly and actually made it seem like she wanted to be there but she didn't. The waitress didn't come back with the change. I hate being played so I asked the other waitress there if we could have the change back and I would leave the tip on the table. We then watched as the other waitress talked to our waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about us. And boy, did she take her time getting the change. My friends were "too prideful" to stay and wait for the change but I'm quite sure she had no intention of bringing it to us. I use to work as a waitress and I NEVER would assume that I could keep the change nor would I ever manipulate customers to tip me more. The next day I called and explained the situation to a worker there and she took my name and number and said she would call back later - she never did. Obviously, a $10 loss isn't a big deal at all (even though I am a poor student). However, I don't like how she manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers. Really disappointing
I ordered a fruit and yogurt parfait and they gave me plain yogurt.... tried to call and let them know so they don't do it to anyone else and they didn't answer the phone the 4 times I tried to call..... how hard is it to mess up a damn parfait??
This place is a travesty. First of all, it's unclean. The cooking equipment needs a good scrub and the counter by the front window is so greasy the arm of my shirt stuck to it! Oh, and there were flies all over the place. Secondly, the cost is excessive. They want $12 for a four ounce piece of haddock [with chips]. That's about three dainty bites. They try to make the fish look bigger by pounding it thin, but that just means it absorbs more fat from the fryer. Thirdly, it's just not very good. As mentioned above, the fish is greasy and it's also overwhelmed by the batter. The chips are soggy, and as they cool down they seem to coagulate into a big, mushy ball of carbs. There was a highlight: the pop was really, really cold...good fridge, I guess. I was there several years ago, just after they opened and I seem to recall the product was significantly better at the time. It's basically a tired old place, and not worth a visit, even with the coupon we used.
Terrible. I don't write yelp reviews and if I could give this complex a negative I would. Roach infested shit hole. Waste of money. Fogged apartment 3 days in a row still no improvement  and I have only been here one week.
Chicken had a terrible and dry taste. The brisket was smoked for 2 minutes, if at all. I asked the person behind the counter if the lemonade was homemade and they said yes,  absolutely no way it was. Portion sizes are awful and they are not flavorful at all. I threw the chicken away rather than taking it home to my dog. I will never come here again or recommend it to anyone I know.
Very rude employees, rush you and judge you. My nails were lumpy and all I asked for was a simple almond shape and all my nails are different shapes and lengths, she also forced me to get gel. She also  wouldn't let me choose a longer nail.
I waited 2 hours for my meal to be delivered to be said by someone who didn't gave a fuck about the situation that my meal is never gonna be delivered! WTF? Fortunately I called because I had waited forever for my food!...and sorry guys but we're in Montréal here so you should have bilingual employees. Even if I'm French-Canadian I wrote this review in English! Nobody's speak my mother tongue there.
They were very fast in coming up with the estimates. However, when I requested for a callback for additional information so we can move on with the project, the receptionist told me that she doesn't have my file and would call back. I followed up a few times but never got what I requested. Not even a follow up call. I went with company who would like to take my business and actually got the job done right!
This place is just a waste of money.  Your bottle service girls literally girl away drinks to their friends thinking the table won't notice.  Wrongggg.  Tell your friends to stop being cheap and buy their own drinks.  Never going back. Update: I appreciate the reply.  Hopefully you can fix this problem.
Horrible staff.  Don't bother ordering online- they won't make it until you get there.Just go to moe's down the street
I was told to try this place by a co worker and i was really not impressed the corned beef was gristly and too chewy....maybe undercooked but the real kicker was the cockroach I saw ...yuck!!!!
We bought an ottoman and less than 3 months later the casters broke. The customer service to get it fixed has been terrible!!! We have called 12 times and it has been almost 3 weeks and we still have a broken ottoman!! We will NEVER shop there again!!
Took my daughter here for dinner on a Thursday early night. We got a table really quick, but had to wait for an over extended period of time for our waiter to show up to take our drink orders (20 min). We got our drinks again in an over extended period of time (10 min). We finally got our waiter back to take our orders, my daughter ordered the Salmon, and I ordered the steak ( medium rare and added a side of shrimp for $6.00).  The food took a bit longer than expected, but within a reasonable amount of time. Once we received our food, the disappointment hit! My steak was well done, not med rare, and the $6.00 side of shrimp were VERY TINY....  it was all just mediocre, in general but so NOT worth spending $50 on two drinks (1 alcoholic and 1 soda) for mediocre food and crappy service! Don't waste your money!
WORSE LUNCH EVER... Just went to pick up a shrimp burrito bowl for lunch and it was the worse EVER! It was freezing cold, things weren't mixed, there were like 4 shrimps and soo little lettuce.  The staff didnt look like they knew what to put in... I usually love the bowl at Chipotle's and Burrito Boys'... this was a very poor version... Will never eat there again.
Would have loved to meet her, but the rude office staff cut me off and hung up on me! Was told she runs 2 separate businesses- one for gyn only (was told I would not be allowed to mention the word hormones in my appt), and the second business for hormone management only. While I was trying to discuss if it would be worth it for me to come to a gyn where certain words are not allowed, receptionist cuts me off and says 'well ok thank you, good bye' then hangs up on me! Guess they weren't willing to listen long enough to get my business, definitely don't listen well enough to manage my care.
I stopped in at this restaurant for a quick lunch. I have never been here before, but knew it had been here for some time. I asked the male and female counter attendants about their slice pizza and was told $4.99 including drink. They told me the slice was 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I ordered a slice and drink. After about 10 minutes the slice was delivered to me. I instantly asked the server if this was the 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I was told yes. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The slice was mostly outer edge crust that barely done. The rest was a very small triangle. The sauce was sweet tomato-e. The cheese topping was a mix of mozzarella and provolone. The cheese was of poor quality and sparse. There was paper thin pepperoni on top.  It was not worth $1.00 much less $3.99 (without drink). Employees did not seem to care. I will not return!
SCAM....SCAM...ALERT... I took my van in on 2 March 16 and I had 29,700 miles.  My battery was dying so I made an appointment at 5 to have it checked out.  After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn't at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated " weren't the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.  WOW...I bought this van in Las Vegas in May of 2014.  We moved in June of 2015 to Pennsylvania and drove the van.  So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.  So doing the math, that's the front brakes losing 3mm and rear brakes losing 5mm.  Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don't think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don't really need them and I would have got them if it wasn't for my kids being with me at the time.  Either the techs don't know what they are doing or this is a scam...I bet on that it is a scam...stay away from them....
It was 108 degrees outside and the AC wasn't working. When we asked the owner if he had any extra fans he was EXTREMELY rude in the way he spoke. Soon after, when we got water, there was a bug in the water cup. It was disgusting. Even the food wasn't great. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!
Went to the presentation and spent 4 hours there.  Did not buy but told daughter and husband they need to listen to it...Thought it was good.  Went to use the travel gift but they can cancel on us within 3 weeks of the date!  We have to take off work and get airfare and then possibly (most likely after reading other reviews) cancel on us!  Shame on Wyndham!
We arrived for a couple of drinks after having dinner nearby.. Took more than 10 min to get waited on..had to flag a server.. Placed our two drink order right away.. 15 min later...NO drinks. At 20 min server hurried by to apologize and stated her bartender was so.... Busy..  After another 15 minutes we left.... No one stopped us.. No one cared.... Won't go back...what a waste of 30 minutes of my time.
Bad customer service!  No one at the front desk for thirty minutes.  Plus they left the phone on the counter so when I tried to call their number, phone just kept ringing and ringing.  :(
Worst experience ever.They sre selling uncooked and raw food and they call it Indian food.When asked they replaced the same and the Indian drinks tastes like medicine,they must be expired and selling without expiry on it. Never going to return back here.
Stay away. The rudest staff in Toronto. I spent $4K on a Cervelo; you think that would warrant at least some level of respect. When you walk in the doors, no one looks up to greet you, and Michael can't be bothered to help you with anything.I'd taken my bike in for a spring tune up, and was told that it would be ready two days later (Wednesday). Friday night...haven't heard a thing. Terrible service. I can't believe this store is still in business.
So yesterday I go about 515 in the morning to get a couple Vente blonde roast coffee's she says I'm out only have enough to make one if you can wait five minutes I'll brew another pot I said no problem next thing I know the 2nd cup is ready already I asked her did you order that while it was brewing or waited till it was completed she took it from the first few cups that went through the grounds so the coffee was so strong it was like drinking a cup of espresso mud so this morning I go in bringing the cup of coffee back that was disgusting no apologies no I'm sorry I explained to her when you pour coffee from the pot before it is finished brewing your first few cups will be very strong and not tasting proper more like Chickory. So needed be said I have to go back to either my a.m. p.m. or my 7-Eleven for my coffee
went here with the bf after he heard it was on diners drive ins and dives. The food was blah and the place was super crowded. I was almost touching the people next to me it was awkward. I won't go back there. I can't get over how flavorless the food was it was like eating a bowl of tissues.
Was here for the Yelp Burger week and did not have a good experience AT ALL. Forced 20% gratuity for a larger group. Very poor customer service also. I ordered the $5 burger special especially after the fact that we had to pay for ....gasp! water. It was a MAJOR turn off for me & I already didn't want to order anything else after that. While the patty was nice and juicy, the bun was a different story. I feel they could have at least toasted the bun lightly to give it a bit more texture. I felt like I was eating lunch in a cafeteria. It was also missing the so called advertised mozzarella cheese.I got to try some fries (regular and sweet potato) and felt it could have been crispier.Overall, I will NOT be coming back to Satan's little burger place again even if I were starving. Find something else around the area. Too much meat isn't good for you anyway.
Horrible experience. I always give places a second chance because you never know if the first was a fluke or not. My boyfriend and I decided to try Bonsai since we drive by quite often. The first experience was perfect. Our waiter was attentive, our orders had come at a timely manner and the food tasted really good. My boyfriend had the ayce sushi and was mentioning how this place would be our go to sushi. He mentioned how fresh the fish tasted and how quick we got our sushi. I ordered the salmon teriyaki combo bento which came with soup, salad, vegetable tempura, shumai, salmon teriyaki, rice, and California roll. The salmon teriyaki was delicious. I wanted more! Our bill was around $50-$60, but it was worth it and decided we would come again. Today, Our experience was less than great. We had come around dinner time, but there was only two other booths taken. We sat down and was asked what we wanted to drink. I don't remember our waitress' name, but we wished we had the male waiter instead. We had asked for waters with lemon. She came out with just water, and then gave us the menus and a paper ayce menu. She was about to just take the paper menu and leave, but I had to mention that I wanted to order off the regular menu. I told her my order and I had to repeat myself and point to the menu since she didn't understand "snow crab". I then asked for lemon for our water and then she left. Few minutes go by and she tends to the other tables, 5 more minutes go by and wave her down and ask for slices of lemon. She looks as if she understands by smiling and nodding and then leaves. 5 minutes go by and I get agitated since I have asked 3 times for lemon. My boyfriend and I see the male waiter and when we asked for lemon, he came back very quickly. I noticed he was tending to other tables that started coming as well. A few minutes go by and my salmon teriyaki comes with the rice. It was flavorless. I didn't order the combo this time and was just expecting salmon, rice, and a salad. No salad came and the teriyaki sauce was sunken to the bottom of the salmon. My boyfriend made a comment saying I was suppose to get a salad. The waitress seemed surprised and asked if I wanted a salad. When I said yes, she left quickly and I didn't have time to ask for extra teriyaki sauce. 30-40 minutes probably went by since being seated and my boyfriend didn't even get his sushi. We watched other tables getting their orders before us and even leaving before us! When his order finally came, his appetite was gone. We had enough of waiting and was just annoyed with out service. Overall, we give this place a 1 out of 5 stars. We had to ask 4 different times for lemon for our water and waited around 30-40 minutes for our food even though there was hardly anyone there. My boyfriend noticed that on the ayce paper menu it doesn't have a time limit like other sushi places. We concluded that if there was a time limit, then there wouldn't be any time left to order a second time. We are highly disappointed. I came home and started eating some apples to satisfy myself.
Where do I start!? We walked in to buy a few lamps for our house and immediately we're dismissed by the owner because of our covered beverage w had. There was no, "hi, can you please leave the drinks outside? " I was blown away at how dusty, crowded and rude this store experience was. No wonder he is known as the" lamp nazi" to fellow store owners. Good riddance sir.
My daughter bought a 250 scooter from a friend and we were hoping to get it checked out.  The guy was so rude, obviously doesn't realize that if you offer to help a young college student who just bought a foreign scooter (which he made clear was a piece of ___brand.), you might make a sale in the future,  especially when her parents are with her.  We ended up taking it to O'Reilly's Auto Parts and he help us with the part we needed for her mirror, NO CHARGE.  She thanked him and gave him a a card for free coffee at the coffee stand she works at.  I highly recommend going to a different scooter shop than Scooter Invasion.  No one deserves to be treated like that.
We came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in AZ. I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but I was unfortunately not impressed. The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food. The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix. And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot.
Placed an order online, qualified for free shipping. Got an email the next day saying no, you don't get free shipping, give us 25 more dollars.There are better options than this nonsense.
The marketing is super shady... there are always promises about celebrities showing up but its hardly the case. T pain was supposed to show up last saturday for the pool party, surprise surprise, we were there from open to close and NO SHOW! The DJ kept lying and getting people pumped up, yelling 'T pain will be here in a few minutes make some noise', or 'T pain is now in the building!!' however, people started to catch up that he wasn't going to show and everyone left disappointed. Customer service, especially the bartender there was super rude. We started a tab, and he just decided to charge us way more drinks than we ordered. They don't know how to count or maybe they did it on purpose!!  DO NOT EVER TRUST THEM TO START A TAB! We had to call our bank for a fraud investigation with this company. SLS in Beverly Hills is so much better than here....  airport shuttles that are supposedly free... is not...
Just ordered the orange chicken to find out the chicken was raw!!! Made zero effort to rectify the situation.  I just hope i don't get food poisoning, will contact clark county health department.
Tried Hederson Millers Ale house tonight.  Got a very nasty bug from the shrimp pasta, not fresh. Avoid this place. Not worth it.  Called the Manager Frank,  who was rude and not interested about the situation.  WILL NEVER RETURN.
used to be the only place I would eat tacos. Just got take out and the tacos are sopping wet and have a previously frozen taste. I would rather pay twice as much for taco bell. I ordered extra bean dip in LIEU of salsa and still got salsa.
If you cannot read not to leave soliciting trash at my door with this sign, why would I want to use your company?
No stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of "I'm sorry!"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it.
I was visiting a friend at Sunrise Hospital on June 2nd.  My friend was admitted on the 3rd floor by the elevators the hospital refers to as "schoolbus" by Subway.  There were students with grey scrubs on that said Everest Nursing.  All the students I saw seems professional and eager to learn except one.  I overheard someone call her Cheyenne.  I had asked her a question and she was completely rude. She acted like she didnt know and wouldnt even point me in the right direction or find someone to help me. She basically said that my friends room was not her side.  I cannot believe you have such rude students at represent your school and are able to take care of sick people with an attitude like that.  I feel bad for any patient in the future who has to be taken care of by her! Please save the public by better screening your students.
It should not take 30 minutes to return a charging cable.... you need an express line. A sale with a customer ahead of me took an hour and a half.
Upon entering the office you notice the chairs are broken & the office is older. The front staff is rude & unfriendly. They don't acknowledge the patients as they sign in. The back staff is kind & dr. Gardner is ok and the examine rooms is a bit outdated. They really need a full revamp of the office & possibly a whole crew of front office staff!!! I'll definitely be looking for another doctors office
So disappointed in the service. They have teenagers running the shop. When I went in to look for a cake for my husband and they had no suggestions.  When I asked to sample the cake I wanted to purchase she told me they could not. How do you expect to have customers spend 40 bucks on a cake but can not sample it. I'll stick with kreative cupcakes from now on!!!
It is a sorry time when a long established restaurant with good food has deteriorated to this point.  I have dined at Chicago Joe's several times over the past 15 years and it has always been a nice place to go for a solid Italian meal.  Decided to go there last minute at 5:30 last Saturday night.  Called to see if there was room for 5 and was told to come on down.  Arrived 15 min later and was seated promptly and greeted by a friendly waiter.  We ordered some garlic bread, 5 entrees w/salad and some drinks.  The garlic bread was hot and delicious, salad was plentiful.  We all normally love the garlic dressing but this time found it to lack garlic. On to the entrees, the chicken parm was an overcooked sautéed, tough chicken breast covered in sweet sauce that tasted like it was from a can with a melted piece of cheese on top.  (no breading, no seasoning, no flavor), The chicken Marsala was topped with a plentiful amount of mushrooms but the sauce was thin, watery and tasted like vinegar.  The linguini with clams was inedible and sent back. Lastly, my 12 yr old daughter wouldn't eat the Spaghetti with meat sauce as it had no flavor.  As you can see from my reviews we don't normally complain but this honestly was the WORST meal we have had.
Went to the gadgets and games to get a kids smart tablet, nubi, the guy told me they were out of them and weren't getting any until June. Why are they on display if they don't have any?? And aren't getting any for 6 months?? Then went to get the kindle fire for kids, they had a blue and pink option, and the blue was out. So he offered for us to get the pink one instead and then buy a blue case, but oh, they had no blue cases and suggested we get it on amazon instead. Word of advice, don't go, or at least call to make sure thru have the exact same thing you are looking for. Nothing against the employee, but his manager needs to start doing his job.
He took my stuff and doesn't want to send it to the place I gave to him. Every time he is Procrastinating me Telling I will send you tomorrow and tomorrow Last time he text me was cursing me and called my I'm not gonna send your stuff go fuck your self. The man his name Tom is fucking big lair and using this business to steal stuff and goods from people NEVER USE Dimura moving and storage LLC They will wrap you.
Waited over two hours for my order. I called and they told me the order had left the shop and should be delivered any minute. After another 25mins I called back to cancel the order. What really upset me was they made no attempt to apologize and seemed bothered by the fact I called to check on my order. Probably wouldn't have been so upset if they wouldn't have charged my credit card. I love Antonios Pizza but I'll never use this location again.
Horrible! Had to leave as soon as we saw the room. Dead roaches on the bench/couch by window. Made a face when we told them we didn't wanna stay and wanted our money back. They were rude. Unorganized. And filthy rooms. I strongly suggest to not even think about staying there. Deserves no stars because it's really a crappy place.
Be careful when consigning with other mothers! My first time consigning was NOT a good experience.  I brought in about 50 very gently used (some never worn)items. They were only used for my grandkids when they spent the night occasionally. I was told they were behind, call in 24 hours. I called back and found out they were only interested in paying me $1.26, two items. When asked they said they weren't interested because of fashion or condition . I later thought about it and realized I was donating summer clothes in October.  Slightly offended, I told them I disagreed but I would definitely be in to get my clothes to sell somewhere else. A few days later I come to retrieve my belongings only to find out that they have donated my clothes and tossed my storage bin. Now, I will admit I failed to read the fine print, but I do believe a simple verbal "reminder" when I reject the amount and let them know I will be in does not seem unreasonable. 24 hours from that conversation, I was told they put the clothes on their porch for a discounted rate to go to charity. I believe that it benefits them more to have clothes in front of their store to draw in customers than it does to have the people come back and pick up their belongings. It benefits them to not give you a friendly reminder. I was upset and surprised. The manager promised that the owner, Nick would be giving me a call to discuss my concerns. It's been a week and I have not heard from him. I will obviously not be consigning or shopping with other mothers again.
Absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then I regret it. Undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. They need to just shut this place down I've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. When you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! I hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.
The owner of this store is very unprofessional. I got referred to this store by a co-worker and said that he would hook me up with everything. So, I made an appointment on Friday for a Saturday 9am appointment. I ride 20 miles to see him and he tells me he doesn't have a mechanic and that there's nothing he can do. He asked me to wait around and see if his mechanic decides to show up. 10 mins later he tells me that his mechanic showed up but it's gonna be a few mins. I ask him how much all of this would cost me and he gave me a total. To which I asked him if he would hook me up like he promised me over the phone. He blew is top and totally disrespected me in front of another customer in the store. I told him that his attitude to someone that came referred to his store was extremely horrible and he should be grateful that he gets referrals and his excuse was that he was having a bad day. Really????? Since when does a customer becomes a victim of a store's owner's bad day???? I don't care what anyone says, but this owner needs to learn the basics of having a business and that is customer service and keeping his promise.
Food: No goodService: Extreme unfriendly especially the guy greeting customer at the door. None of the employee has a smile on their face.Price: Very over pricedDecor: Simple. Chairs were comfortable.
DO NOT EVER TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!I went into this location after being told over the phone that they had a brake special of 50% off services. That was a lie.I take my car in the next day and as I was waiting, I overheard a customer telling the men at the front desk her brand new brakes she just purchased and had installed at this Meineke were grinding and making an awful noise. (I should have left then, considering I too needed brake service). I made the mistake of staying.My car is looked at by one of the "mechanics"who calls my boyfriend and I outside to tell us the quote, I see a quote for $997. How brakes and one rotor costs nearly $1000 is beyond me. But the quote wasn't the worst part. After I clearly disagree with the charges and opt to take my vehicle somewhere else, the man proceeds to tell me, he will not allow me to drive my vehicle away due to the condition of my brakes, and I would have to tow my car off their shop. They claim it's the law. However when I sign a waiver I assume all responsibility of my car and I also make it clear I am aware of the supposed danger of my vehicle. Meienke was not abiding by law they were trying to waste my time, after I disagreed with their bogus charges. Obviously they use this tactic as a way to get fools to just stay and have the services done there. I didn't and as soon as I said I still did not want brake services done there, the nice guy act went out the window. They were very rude and  condescending to me as I waited for the tow truck to arrive.I would never bring my car here again. These are not true mechanics. They are just a bunch of men who take advantage of unsuspecting people by charging them more money than their services will ever be worth. Do yourself a favor and never visit this or any other Meineke store. Terrible service, and a terrible experience is all you will get when coming here, trust me.
Terrible local customer service. Beautiful resort and restaurants but they fail to take good care of locals. They used to cater for local ambition but lately they have been drawn in to becoming a resort i.e. MGm. It's sad to see it transition this way because I've been a fan since 2007 but with all the event bookings and over flow, gvr has now become a senseless strip hotel. Please bring back the station casinos that locals have gathered behind and we ll be there
Signed up for Costco bulk bottle program couple years ago- been a loyal customer.  Dealt with many invoicing and billing errors and their customer service department is terrible to deal with.   Just found out that the Costco program was discontinued and my bill is literally TWICE the discounted costco amount.  They claimed to notify customers but I never received anything.  Cancelled service - not worth the price they are charging now.  Save your money and invest in a water cooler and get your bottles elsewhere!
Only rated it one star because zero was not a choice.  Apparently -- and I say this in total seriousness -- customers who show up in person are the stores lowest priority.  I have watched them fill orders for 15-20 from fax or email while TOTALLY COMPLETELY 100% ignoring the people in line.  This store needs a manager who can handle a rush.  They should also tell people who are 10-15 people back in line that the wait could be as much as an hour. Ridiculous.
We came with a graduation party of 23 tonight. The evening manager came out and said that even though there was adequate seating he could not seat us because it would back up the kitchen. He was not very welcoming either. The waitresses seemed confused by his decision as well. We kindly decided to go to McCormick and Schmick's where they happily took our money. It's a shame, I hear this place is really good.
I'm never coming back to this place !!!!Let me tell you why...Turns out that we really wanted to go and check out this place, and for secret reasons we were running late and needed to have a late dinner, well, their website clearly reads: "Hours: 6 pm - Late", so it was perfect, right ? unless we don't understand what late means...  now hear this, we even call this clowns before going there, just to check if they were going to be open, and we specifically axed ... at what time are you guys closing the kitchen tonight? we are thinking about late dinner and we want to head over there... and so the deception begins, they told us they were not closing the kitchen until 11 PM (take note) 11 PM !!! OK, perfect!We take a taxi to go aaaaaall the waaay there,  and so we show up at about 10:20 PM, all looking like idiots.... guess what???? Kitchen was closed !!!!!  why would you do this to me ???? I'm here on business !!!!!!!!So we were just standing there, feeling like dog feces and talking to the hostess, explaining to her that we were on the phone earlier (like half an hour earlier) with her, and she told us that the kitchen was going to be open... and her response was a simple "well, they changed their minds"  !!!!! ????  : |       excuse me???? they changed their minds ?????  dafuuuuuuuuqqqqq ?????  oh ok.... So, never trust this clowns.... for all we know it may not be open today (even though it is supposed / advertised to be) , or they might could close early, how about closing today at 7 PM??? sure, why not! or maybe it's going to be 10 PM .... you never know.... because  THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS frequently..... What a joke!!!! I declare this place a big pile of feculence !!!   in other words:  this place is NOT ALLOWED !!!
NOT SO HAPPY HOUR. My party of 3 arrived around 6:45 last night and were seated around 10 minutes later. Our waiter came by a few minutes after 7 and informed us that we couldn't order from the Happy Hour menu. A few bucks is not going to change my lifestyle but I resent being penalized because a waiter couldn't get to our table. If we were seated during Happy Hour we should have been allowed to take advantage of it.
0 would be perfect. Bought a box spring today,I asked the customer care guy in how many days I can return it he replied;7 days. Not once he mentioned that the box spring cannot be returned as per their terms and conditions or the sales guy didn't mentioned anything. Now I end up with a box spring i cant use because it made my bed to high.I regret my first purchase there and will never recommend it. Most stores in Arizona accepts returns even goodwill store. I so regret my purchase.
This review is more for management, but they lost all their stars for one very bad decision.  After receiving my doctorate degree yesterday, and having made BRUNCH reservations 7 weeks prior as it is graduation weekend and my family is in town, we showed up for our brunch reservation only to be told that they decided to do "Dinner all day" instead.  Now my wife had called to confirm a BRUNCH reservation 3 days prior and we were not told of this, which might have left us a chance to find another option for 7 people.  Instead, their management decided to change their menu, not call people with a 10:30am brunch reservation to alert them to the decision.  I don't care what field or industry you're in, that is just not acceptable.  The host offered a pity gift certificate, by only after we had been standing on the sidewalk for 10 minutes trying to find another option. If that had been offered immediately, maybe I wouldn't be so sour to V.Picasso, but It was not prompt or offered easily. Be careful if you are planning anything special here, it might fall apart when you arrive.  So very disappointing.
I got a Groupon for 3 laser hair treatments. Casey, who works the front desk and performs the laser hair removal, is really awesome and takes good care of her returning clients. However, I ended up purchasing a total of 9 more treatments in addition to the 3 Groupon treatments (I have completed all 12 sessions) and my hair looks the exact same as it did before I started any treatments. It's no lighter and there isn't less hair. I got treated in several places, including underarms, legs, arms, bikini, and face. All of the hair grew back 100%. Also, a couple of times, the laser burned me so bad that I had burn marks all over my arms, thighs, and bikini. It took several months for the burns to go away. I don't know about the tattoo removal, but I suggest going elsewhere for your hair removal.
I came here at 12:20, ordered a small mcfrappe (chocolate chip=amazeballs) and a sausage mcmuffin with cheese. Seems pretty simple, right? I didn't ask for any crazy special instructions, right?So, after sitting there and waiting for 14 minutes.... yes, FOURTEEN MINUTES, they finally hand me my mcmuffin. I, regrettably, drove off without checking it first.Guess what? There's no cheese. So now I'm sitting in the drive thru line (which is now unreasonably long) instead of driving home. Yay me. I really don't understand it. Is it really that difficult to understand? And now they're trying to argue with me saying it doesn't come with cheese on it.... I know that, but I asked for cheese to be added....so.... am I wrong here? Lol Idk why they look so confused. Please train these employees to have better customer service. No apology or anything, the girl just shoved the bag in my hand and shut the window. What a lovely bunch you have working here :)
Ugg the service and food was just awful.Last time i ate here it was good,but last night was ridiculous.The server was rude and apathetic.She moved at the pace of a turtle,never smiled or showed any interest in how our food tasted.She let us sit with empty drinks for 10 minutes. i have never seen such a poorly run restaraunt in all my life.IT was not busy,and food took forever,along with everything else.When my chicken finally arrived,it was stringy and undercooked.I dont know how they managed to not cook my chicken properly,since i waited a half an hour for it.when we left the clueless manager was sitting on her butt at the bar,smiling and waving goodbye,like she thought everything was a o.k.I will never eat here again.the only good thing was the bread, which they are very stingy with the portion size.
Landed late, on a tight schedule... Got to my car. Filthy, inside and out.  It smelled like a hockey team had lived in here for about a week.    The client that I had to pick up made several comments about the vehicle. It was pretty embarrassing.  Upon my return, I called Hertz to get their address for the drop off location. They gave me the address to their corporate office, directed me several miles out-of-the-way before I caught on.  I rent a lot of cars... This was the worst experience in a long, long time.
So we have been trying this place after my one star review... And nothing has changed, maybe worse. We ordered a shish kebab salad with no feta and scallions. Guess what? It came with both and we sent it back. What did they do? Remove the fata and scallions and bring it back. Now, all the meat is sort of cover with feta (white spots)... Terrible treatment. They have been going down hill for a very long time. They might charge more if it os going to get the quality a little back to normal. I do see us giving this place any more chance. Sorry :(((
So disgusted and disappointed I hate when I feel like I'm being ripped off and I will spread the Word all over so others don't experience my disgust the company I used to book the party bus platinum ride limos apparently just like to rip ppl off and take there money and are the most unprofessional ppl I have  ever dealt with I was late 15 mins from being dropped back off and they charged me an additional $135 which was a full hour fee for services they did not provide once I saw this additional charge on top of all that I spent for there services not to mention leaving the driver a Big Tip outside of all the money spent to basically be dropped off. I called the owner who basically implied that money meant more to him then his customers or future business. I personally will spread this throughout Arizona. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM.If I could give a negative star I would no need and sending a pretend response on the bottom of the review actting surprised or as if your company had no knowledge of this attempting to make fellow yelpers believe differently because I attempted and spent majority of my morning conversing about this with your company who could careless. No regards or even a comparison to the amount of money spent with your company this past weekend not to mention the future business that would have came from business associates, family and friends. Sad to see people could careless about customer service, dignity, and the good of there so called businesses.
Absolutely terrible fish. Nice place , decent service,  but if you want good fish and good sushi this place will make you regret every penny you spent on their fish. You might get better fish at the $2 all you can eat sushi. Waste of money.
No bueno. Sales Associates was helpful and nice but the manager.... Rude, condescending, no interpersonal skills, and probably another 5-6 vulgar descriptions. The new Mazda's have tons of features and drive pretty smooth. My next car will most likely be a Mazda but best believe not from this dealership. The attitude the manager was giving is out of this world. Coming into the dealership, I expressed that I do not NEED to change cars at this time. I can, if I get a lucrative deal, but it's not a must. I am generally happy with my car but since I've had it for two years, I CAN upgrade. I repeatedly expressed this to the manager, as well as the MOST I am willing to pay but it seemed that he thought it was "The Price is Right" while for me it was more of "Deal or No Deal". When he saw that I was pretty serious about what I was willing to spend, he got snappy and said that I'm supposed to meet him half way. I don't know how HE does business, may be starting really high on a price typically get's him the amount he wants consumers to pay, but that does not work with me. Needles to say, I will be going to another dealership, just annoyed that I have wasted my time here.
Just visited this location and noticed they have a C in their health department audit. I personally can't eat at places like this. I've been working in the food Industry for 22 years and to receive a C score in a restaurant is because something is wrong besides the fact of dirtiness. Didn't eat and asked for my money back. A place like this doesn't deserve no star (s) but in order to post this comment I was forced to rated it with at least one star.
Food not too great. Horrible service.  Think the owner needs to train their staff better.  At the very least, tell them to come around to the tables more often and ask your guests if they need anything.  We had a table of of 13 or 14 last night.  About 8 of us were drinking.  In 2 hours the waitress asked me only once what i wanted to drink.  Once!  I had to ask her for my second drink.  Was never asked again after that.  This was pretty much the same for everyone at the table.  They easily could have had 2 more drinks/beers sold a piece from the eight of us who were drinking but they never bothered to ask us if we wanted another.  Cant understand this if your income is based on tips.  Dont know if she was new or just not properly trained.  But the more we spend the more you make!As far as the food goes.  Ordered the turkey wrap club with fries.  Got a chicken wrap instead that was all lettuce, very dry and with very little chicken in it.  Fresh cut fries were good.
Beware! Do NOT come to Augie's with a group larger than 4.  Only one table for 6 and the hostesses have no clue how to think ahead to combine tables. Told us didn't know how long and we waited for over 45 minutes to get seated. The food is good here but definitely not worth the wait.
My wife and I visited East West Pizza because we purchased a restaurant.com gift certificate for $2 and we've been questing to find decent pizza in the area.Our meal here was mediocre. We were pleased by the option to have the crust well done (my wife had hers done this way, while I stuck with the regular crust), but the taste was just bland and uninteresting -- totally lacking in the sort of flavour punch that makes a really good pizza.I wasn't going to bother writing a review of the place as pizza is a pretty subjective area, however several months ago I received a spam email from East West -- I must have filled out some comment card or something so, I emailed them and asked them nicely to remove me from their list. They replied, very apologetic, and promised to do so. For the next several months, despite this guarantee, I continued to receive spam in my email from East West. I emailed them again, this time asking more forcefully to be removed from their list and received no reply - just more spam over the next month or two. Tonight I emailed centurylink, their email host, and reported them for spamming.East West Pizza - two stars for mediocre pizza that I never feel the need to taste again, minus one star for being spammers.
I've had 2 bad experiences with them. My packages were coming from Kohls, when tracking it always says they had a failed delivery attempt and will redeliver next business day. It's odd because in those days UPS, Fed Ex, USPS managed to deliver my packages. They never delivered my package or updated the tracking info. I contacted their customer service which was  very unhelpful, was not able to update me on my package or reason why it wasn't delivered. Finally just contacted kohls who informed me that my package was already on the way back to their warehouse and I'd have to place another order if I actually wanted my stuff.
Before you stay here, read the fine print, and expect the owner to exploit any situation to his advantage.I made a reservation for the weekend of the Toronto film festival on booking.com but by mistake reserved the following weekend. I realized the error when I showed up and they had no room for me. When I attempted to cancel, they still charged me for 60% of the original cost. Considering the nature of the error, and the fact that I actually did show up and want to stay there, it seems that Downtown B&B exploited the situation. They had several rooms available for the weekend that I booked, and so they lost no business from my reservation.
My husband and I decided to check this place out...mainly because of me and my love for the musician....DONT GO.  The greeter was RUDE...because we came in the wrong door.  The table was dirty...as were the seats.  Our server was very sweet.  She did her best to make sure our experience was a good one.  That is where it ended. My husband had the BBQ chicken...dry...bland.  I had the BBQ chicken wrap.  Tasteless.  I ordered a Bloody Mary...horrible...and the $4 frozen margarita...which tasted like well water.  It really is a shame that the food and drinks taste so awful....The concept is a good one...like the music....but the rest....lets just say McDonalds would have been a better choice.
Horrible experience at the storeStuff member occupied family washroom for a long time( she does not look like pregnant at all) The stuff member was holding the wash door and yelling at my wife and baby.  Yes she totally freaked my wife and babyWhen I talked to the front desk. No apology but all protective speech.I regarded that we spend thousands each year there now
This place is ridiculous! Went there with the girlfriend for drinks and some food... when it came to pay the girl somehow "lost" my credit card on the way to her checkout station. After watching the staff fumble around with a flash light for 10 minutes she finally comes and tells me she lost my card... but she's still looking. 5 minutes later she walks back from another table with my card. I ask her of she gave my card to someone else, she did. I ask her if she understands that these strangers could have taken down my CC info. She apologises...I ask for a manager because clearly she doesn't understand how bad it is to give a customers cc to someone else. After asking for a manager 3 times the bartender finally comes over 15 minutes later to apologize for charging someone else's bill on my card... wtf?! This is the first I hear I paid for someone else's bill too??? I am obviously upset about this and she immediately walks away saying "you know what I've got other people to help, I tried being nice " I followed her asking for a managers contact info and she simply went to the back of the bar... appalling... f**K this place. Ownership of one's actions is clearly something these idiots don't understand. Calling back tomorrow to hopefully talk to an adult.
The food is a little higher than Red Lobster. I ordered a Baked Potato but was told it would be an additional 20 minute wait. So I asked for a sweet potato instead. It was a $1 up charge. IMO, the shouldn't have charge me $1 for the sweet potato when they didn't have any regular baked potatoes ready. It still took an extra 10 minutes for the sweet potato and it came out over cooked. Our waitress was attentive, but I felt sorry for the other customers. Their waitress was constantly had her boyfriends table. She must have gone over to his table 15 times while we were there and he had already had his food served before we even sat down. She was very attentive to him, brought him out a baked potato, onion rings, rolls, etc to go with his meal. She must have filled the condiments at his table at least 3x while we were there.  When I went to the bathroom after we ate, the custodian was emptying the trash and cursing up a storm with the hostess. She saw me and they both just laughed. Neither one of them apologized for their language or for me having to wait to use the restroom. Now I am all for a clean bathroom, but I shouldn't have to listen to young adults cuss up a storm while I wait. There was no manger on site. Seems the restaurant is run by teens and young adults.
HORRIBLE!!! I'm not one to write reviews on my experience because in a business I understand there are good and bad experiences But this place tops a bad experience..... Starting with the awful customer service skills of the receptionist who probably got it from her unethical nonchalant boss, and then pours over to the untrained ,pounding, harsh handling therapist, and then to top it off the gooey chocolate and dated fruit they serve with a Bon Appetit......Please stay away....I spent 139.0(Groupon) on the couples massage and was given a low class training class experience more worth maybe $30 And of course the manager explained I better be glad I didn't spend $230.0 for the full price I really should sue this place and get 230.0 + for creating such a AWFUL experience for my husband and I on Valentines Day weekend Don't spend your time or money here They placed needs to be Reported
I do not like this airport. They do not have designated lanes for shuttles to drop off compared to regular traffic. When I came to depart at the nearest security checkpoint was closed and the did not provide any signage for directions on where to go. After paying extra for my baggage and showing my id, Ithen had to carry my bag to a different location so it could go through an xRay. It is such a poor set up. The TSA is worst on average with people without communication skills and no empathy. Even people who should know their job with titles like 'lead officer' seemed lazy and like they hate their jobs as such it has made for a poor travel experience.
I have been looking for a traditional Mexican taqueria, so I search on Yelp and found this store which has a taqueria in the back, so I drove the more than 15 miles to get to this place just to be disappointed.I had to admit that I've arrived one hour before closing but, that shouldn't be a reason for their poor quality food that they sell there.First of all they pre-prepare the meats and the condiments early in the morning so by the time when I got there the food looked really old and nasty, the condiments like cilantro,onions,salsa and limes are all placed on a salad bar for all the customers to pick their favorites,the drawback of that is that by the time when I got to pick mine everything was mixed up salsa on the onions and the cilantro and the limes were old,very unattractive look. So I didn't start looking at the place until after I have placed my order and just by looking at the meats and the salad bar I had to throw my food in the garbage and walked away from that place. I thought about saying something but, what were they going to do?Give my money back? Or replace the tacos for others with the same kind of meat? I didn't even tried so I just walked away and never coming back.
I decided to try Marvellous Edibles because of the rave review the first reviewer gave it, and because it is in my neighborhood of Leaside. I've always driven past it and wondered what it was like, but since she gave it such a great review, I thought I'd give it a go. The restaurant has a sort of Parisian cafe feel to it, with mismatched chairs and some booths and tables, and a mural on the wall. Upon arrival mid-Saturday afternoon, we were also presented with 3 menus, breakfast (which was ending shortly), sandwiches and another menu which appeared to be dinner options, priced $16 - $24 range. My friend and I both selected from the sandwich menu. I ordered the BLT, but having noticed that they served peameal bacon for breakfast, asked if I could have peameal on my BLT, they obliged, no problem. My friend ordered the meat loaf sandwich and we both ordered the sweet potato fries. Service was fast, there were only 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant. I was expecting an average sandwich, didn't really figure you can screw up a BLT, er...thought wrong. The peameal was overcooked, and very dry, and it was served on 'white' bread, no egg or challah bread to be found here!! I was disappointed. The whole sandwich was dry, I asked for mayo, and the waiter said there was already mayo on it, I opened it up and the thing was bare. I showed him, and said, "Umm, actually there's not..." (awkward...) My friend's meatloaf sandwich was a mess!! First she had asked for no onions, was allergic to them, and upon receiving the sandwich, had to proceed to pick off somewhere in the range of 7-8 pieces of red onion off of her sandwich!! The problem with the sandwich was just that it was a complete mess. It was on a regular bun, and gravy was poured over the meatloaf and the other half of the bun was placed on top. On service, the bottom part of the bun, is soaked, drenched in gravy, making it impossible to pick up! It was just a mess, I think it would be a much more successful item choice if perhaps it was served as an open faced meat loaf sandwich, with the gravy in a boat on the side that you pour on yourself at the time you are going to eat it, so that the bottom bun doesn't disintegrate. As if our food quality wasn't bad enough while we were attempting to salvage a meal out of it, our entertainment was listening to our waiter bicker with the other waitress about table assignment and allocation of tips and how unfair she had been. The disagreement got quite heated and their voices were raised, creating quite a bit of tension in the restaurant amongst the customers, or at least, that was my perception. Overall, I was not impressed with the food or the service of this restaurant. I would not recommend it. I will not be returning to try their breakfast or brunch, or even to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, that was my very first and last visit. You know what they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
When my grandmother passed, the hospital recommended this place. They said it would take about a week. After 2 weeks of hearing nothing from them we called and they said that there had been a hold placed by the medical examiner and never called to inform us of this. They then became very rude and said if we have a problem with it we could go pick her up. We called the medical examiner and they said there was no hold and they have no idea why there would be an issue. We are shock by the conduct of this place, especially being that we dealt with another death just moths before and the other funeral home we used (a wise choice funeral home) had everything done in under a week with no issue. Do NOT use this place. The manager (Andrew) is rude, unprofessional, and they have no responsibility. This isn't some retail shop, it's a funeral home, you need to act a certain way when dealing with peoples loved ones and they failed
Worst customer service by the staff and the supervisor. This is the 3rd time we went to the DMV and we have all the proof of the documents between the insurance and the car. Long story short, the supervisor wants another proof to be printed out even though we have these 28 pgs attachment from the insurance. The lady who helped us her name is Dominique.  The supervisor who didn't even waste her breath on us should not be working there. I guess people who worked there for too long are grumpy and hate their life!
So American folks say that due to the merger with US Airways they have discontinued the curbside checkin. So it goes to us - the consumer to waste 40 minutes in line to drop one bag off. Hmmm United has curbside, so does Southwest. Hey American, you are not the cheapest or the best keep adding inconveniences like this and you help us make our choices easier. See ya
They told us we had 20 mins to order because they were closing. We ordered. Food didn't arrive until 30 ish mins later because they were tending to the take out orders. We sat there for a very long time...hungry. It was after we got our food that the waitress gave us the rushing vibe. I know they were aware that they were taking a really long time to give us our food, so why not give us some naan bread to help make the wait a little easier? Customer service really lacks here. If you're here I'd recommend going to another restaurant that's nearby.
I will not be going back to this place. I got a complete car wash service done from here--the actual service was average/okay. I later noticed that the back seat car mat was missing and called them back to complain. I was told that someone would be contacting me back but nobody did. So about a week later I called them again and was promised that someone would be calling me back within a day or so. Again no phone call. I've since stopped calling  but have vowed to never use this location again. I completely understand that someone might have forgotten to put back the mat in the car--mistakes happen. However it's not acceptable to never respond to an inquiry after 2 calls.
I've had to go back now twice in 5 weeks for a terrible cut and a perm that did not work.  After consultation with the stylist I explained my hair doesn't take perms easily.  Instead of listening to me, she proceeded to leave the solution in my hair for 45 minutes, and only after I complained about it burning my scalp did she have her assistant rinse and neutralize my hair.  She was rude and unprofessional.  She has also told me to not come back even though the issue was her fault.  I suggest skipping Etch.  Scottsdale has many more salons to offer.
Red Robin tonight Server: "What temp would you like on your burger"Me: "medium rare"Server: "so a little pink?"Me: "yes"Food delivered...WELL done. Why do you ask if you can't deliver?!?  Anywho, I talk to the manager face to face. She says "oh, it's on a conveyer belt...we can't do pink". To which I say "why would the server offer a choice?" Her response, "if you order the angus burger we can do more pink". Are the servers not trained on what burger I order whether is "regular" or "angus" patties??  Then she continues to say "well if you tell your server, they can do it". Mmmmmmmkay, rewind..."I just told the server I wanted a little pink". The employee next to the manager said "we can't because of food borne illnesses". I'm so confused now.This will be our last attempt at Red Robin.
Not sure this business is even open anymore. I emailed from website no response. I called from website 5 times in 5 days. No answer. And when I called from Yelp and says phones disconnected. Either closed or worst customer service in the world. Maybe if someone calls me back for an appointment I'll change my review.
I don't know what to say, I love the food but as everyone says the service is terrible.Part of the reason is that the owners steal all of the tips from the waitresses. They make minimum wage, and all the tips go to the owners. I am torn. It is without question my favorite food, but the owners steal from the servers. So I don't think I should eat here.... Really disappointing...  What does one do in this case?.... The other Indian restaurants around here are terrible. So I can drive to Tempe to support better practices for servers, or I can eat here and support thieves with delicious food.
If you are a CPR/First Aid instructor, I DO NOT recommend renting CPR mannequins from these guys.  I rented mannequins from them for a large class and when I opened the bag, literally pieces of the mannequins fell out.  Only 2 out of 5 were even usable.  They were completely filthy and they were falling apart.  When I brought them back they said that I had done the damage because I didn't know how to use them.  What an insult.  I've been using these style mannequins for many years.  I highly recommend spending your money somewhere else if you expect good customer service, honesty, and integrity.
Absolutely terrible service.  The waitress ignored us while checking her nails.  Drinks are watered down and overpriced.  It's a 2 drink minimum and the entire place was empty.
This is the worst shuttle service you will ever see in your life. The whole experience was a nightmare. We departed the airport and found their booth outside and waited in line only to find out since we had a voucher we did not need a ticket. It did not state anywhere on there about that.Next we went over to stand in line and wait for the shuttle with the other 50 or so people. Shuttle took 15-20 minutes to arrive. It took another 15 minutes to load and depart and then it was another 15 minutes before another one arrived. Luckily I was able to get on that one, but what a fiasco. They have the worst service and are way too slow. They want you to call in advance to arrange your return pick up and they come and get you 2-3 hours before you need to be at the airport. F*** that. These people will never see me or any of my money again. We are taking a cab back to the airport since we are close I think it would have been cheaper just to take a cab in the first place. Never use these people they are horrible and you will regret it. Big mistake I will never make again EVER!!!!!!!!!!
So I returned. They fixed it for free which was kind. Not 2 days later they all started to peel again. This was a gel manicure which I was told would last 2 to 3 weeks. When I went back I politely asked if they could just remove it (I did not ask for any refund though I should have) and then they wanted to charge me to remove it!Inexperienced staff and overall overpriced for all services.Also, tiny for selection for charging 20 dollars extra. I chose the only neutral colour they had.
Gun Range Closed.All the signs and advertisements we saw said open 7 days a week 9am-7pm.Wasted Lyft ride and an hour.Disappointed, employees just cleaning, no one available to give us a ride.Sad
Bought a car in 2012 and it was a decent experience.  What has been living hell is receiving calls during work and at home every two days trying to refinance my car - a car I sold two years ago.  Despite SEVERAL requests for them to permanently purge my information and phone number from their system, I still get a minimum of 3 calls a week trying to refinance a car that I DON'T OWN.Who knew that the vultures have turned to full on harassment.  I'm fully expecting them to start knocking in my door every  night at some point...
The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.Went for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.Meanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eatEvery so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over."Is everything okay?Everything except I haven't received my order."Minutes later..."Is everything okay?Is there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food."Her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same timeMy plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.We had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.We sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill."What table was yours?The table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner."At that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leaveShe finally came out, and I got the lowdown.- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.
This review is based, solely, on my experience ordering a gift certificate online.Ordered a gift certificate online. Thinking: "Yes, this will be an awesome gift for my sister's birthday!". I chose, and paid extra, to have them ship the certificate to my home. A week and a half passes, no sign of the gift certificate. I call, and it never shipped it was "missed". This was on a Friday and the gal said she would ship it out that day. I live an hour away. It's now Wednesday the following week, I call again and they want me to wait a few more days because they say it was shipped on that prior Friday.  Now you and I both know that if you mail something an hour away, it takes a day (at most two) to arrive. It's now Thursday, and it came in the mail; the postmark was on Tuesday. I'll more than likely have to call again to see if they actually mailed another GC or to use this one. What a disaster and complete waste of time.
DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT HERE.  Law students who really want litigation experience may want to consider it because this place screams "sue me" on a regular basis.1. LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt.  I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here.  We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more.2. FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide.  We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could "redecorate". When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated.  When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations.  You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we.  In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out.  Very questionable behavior.3. CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count.  The Village refused to do anything in response. 4. THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater.  These things do not exist.  There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. If you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here.As a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough.  This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.
My fiance ordered from here recently. After waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. Ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. Any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. Wouldn't recommend
My order was flooded with chocolate ice cream and it gave me a cavity. Do not recommend going here and this is not a good place to have a birthday party.
I hate dealing with this location, they're slow as hell and rude. Every time I place a call for a pickup there's always a 3+ hour wait for pickup and when you go into the actual location for a sit down dinner you'll spend 3 hours waiting to be seated and for your food to arrive. Also note the staff isn't as knowledgeable about the menu as some of the other locations so you may find yourself telling them about things on the menu.I questioned them about this long wait and was told it's because they're the only location on the west side....we'll the 10th St & Camelback location has been catering to the ENTIRE Central Phoenix area for years with no issues and the manager just looked at me.Save yourself the trouble and call the 10th street & Camelback location.
It's 108 so we stopped for a beer..  The allure of the place is the live music.  We came before that.  Wasn't impressed..
Well...it's not that often that a place that serves AYCE grilled meat can disappoint me but I guess there's a first for everything. Where should I begin? We came in around 4PM to a restaurant that was not even half full and waited for a table for 15 minutes. When we got to our table we were left alone again for 10 minutes. We were pretty hungry at this point so we order a bit of food. The waitress gave us a stern look and told us it was too much in a more than your mother's naggy tone kind of voice. I assured her we can handle it. Classic rule of dining is that the customer is always right, even if they are wrong. I shrugged it off. This hasn't been out first time to a Korean AYCE style restaurant but after our interaction earlier, I guess our server took it upon herself to make up our minds on how we want to eat. We tried to keep it pleasant and light hearted but she kept on getting pushier and pushier as the afternoon went on. At the end of dinner we had paid and left her a decent tip (18%) underneath one of the cups. We made sure it was visible so it doesn't get accidentally get swept away during the table being turned over. We were in our car and about to go when the waitress ran out to our passenger door and knocked angrily on my car door. I lowered the window and asked her what was wrong. Our astute waitress, still huffing and puffing angrily, said we didn't even tip her. I calmly said we did and where it was. She then replied with an "Oh..." and then quickly ran back inside. We waited there 5 mins to see if she would come out and apologize as I thought we were entitled one for the way she was acting and for leaving prints on my car window. We will never return here. Never have I been so turned off at dinner by bad service. Had I known that that was the kind of service I would be getting I would have spent my money at an In and Out and got my money's worth and a smile to go with my chocolate shake.
Worst airline ever! Very sad they are merging with US Airways, hence they both are terrible. I wish AA would just go out of business. Not only is their staff rude and not helpful at all they are just terrible. It is worth spending an extra $100 or even more to fly with someone else. Their plane broke down and when I get back to ask for refund they want to give me a voucher to use their crap airline again. Not only did they tell me that I would get reimbursed for renting car to drive since they did not have another plane to fly us for 2 days but that they would reimbursed us for the trip. Once I got back to request for these they do not want to refund me at all but give me a trip voucher. We lost so much time and money since it took us 8 hours to drive and spend money to rent a car and fill up with gas. Such shit airline and customer service no wonder they are going down and have to merge with US Airways. They could care less what your situation is even if their airplane had mechanical issues and had no other planes for 2 days and too cheap to reimburse you for the trip since it made everything difficult. NEVER AGAIN AA. Oh and we had to transfer flights coming home and we were late and almost missed our transfer flight. The stewardess could care less to let us off the plane first to run to make our transfer flight. Since they all had boarded already they gave us crap for coming late when it was not even our fault. Think twice before ever booking with this airline. HATE AA and their staff!
The service was friendly. The hamburger was greasy and tasteless. The thousand island dressing was too salty. The chili was greasy, and I had to throw it away. I wasted my money here.
My friend and I were treated with total disrespect by a blonde bartender. Will never be back due to her lack of customer service.
Came here to find out my results for my tb test and The from desk girl was very disrespectful it was fairly busy here and I asked her nicely how long the wait would be and she just said no with an attitude I rather take the time to go to another clinic than this one.
Only one star necause i had to, otherwise a ZERO star day. So after 12 years of loyalty it's time to move on.  Bought a Groupon and went on line to make an appointment when I forgot some information I decided to call. Tyler told me that the website is wrong and that they don't use it. I told him it said that to call if within a two hour period, he said he doesn't care what it says and they only take appointments until 3 and to call back after 3 to see if he could get me in.I did and he said they were to busy to take any other cars.Today, Thursday, I took off early to drive in to get into the midas, he sad it would be until 5 told him I would wait (2 hours).  I showed him the Groupon and he said they don't take them for synthetic oils, they only for conventional oils. I showed him the fine print.  I don't care what it says we don't take it, I can only give $15 credit. Told him unacceptable and walked out furiously.Went home and called another midas and he said that he could do until he found out it was for the midas that wouldn't take the groupon. Told him what had happened.   He said they had to take it, he took my name and number.  Nick from midas tempe autoplex called back and said that they would take my car right away at this Midas and give me the up charge while using my groupon.Oh by the way groupon was called as well and made aware of the problem as well.
The drive through service SUCKS!!!! Always in line FOREVER. Why I keep going back, no idea. Literally in line at a drive through for at least 10 minutes every single time. Horrible.
Do not go here!  I support Jiffy Lube like you would not believe but I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO NOT GO HERE (NOT THIS JIFFY LUBE)!!!They purposely damaged my tire to spite me!!!Yesterday morning, when I got an oil change, I was encouraged to upgrade to a higher quality oil - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my air filer - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my cabin air filer - I also declined.  It came to a point of forced upgrades where I literally said, "I just want an oil change and I have to go."This morning I noticed my front tire was WAY low of air (they checked it yesterday).  I filled it asap but noticed air seeping uncontrollably through the valve.  I took to to a Goodyear (on Indian School) and they said, "The only way this can happen is if someone loosens it.  There is no way it can come unloose by itself. The pressure is too high."  They even asked if I, "...had any enemies."  When I told them, "No, but I did get an oil change yesterday at the Jiffy Lube on 32nd they replied, "This isn't the first time dude.  About once every few months someone comes in with this issue from that Jiffy Lube."Enough said.I know corporate people at Shell Oil and jiffy Lube.  They are great people and they have supported my business.  I will always support Jiffy Lube but never (again) this franchise or their staff.  They put my family's safety at risk for juvenile redemption because I would not buy an extra air filter.  Do not go here - ever!P.S. When I went I went down and confronted the staff - predictable results.  Ignorance = minimum wage with poor management.
The first two words in their Yelp description is "fresh food", but my order was anything but. My order is simple - a strawberry banana French toast delivery. Cut up, juicy fruits on top of a lightly fried bread - simple right?What blows my mind is how they used canned??? strawberries. I'm not from Vegas, but I'm hoping fresh fruit isn't that hard to find where restaurants forgo it. They have a preservative taste that once biting into, makes you think that these strawberry slices have been sitting in a plastic container somewhere for a couple of weeks. Then... the BANANAS. The bananas are blackish and gummy. Blackish and GUMMY!!! Who uses those words to describe bananas??? These bananas literally look like they mummified before being delivered to me....And the piece de l'resistance is the French toast. Oh boy. You know the texture of stale bread is like? It rips a certain way, it's fluffy, flavorless, and dry all at the same time? That's this French toast. Unfortunately, this entire order reminded me of those questionably "healthy" cafeteria breakfasts from high school, slapped together by pissy lunch ladies, but worse. A lot worse.
Just tried to order two different sandwiches...out of both the types of bread I requested.   What kind of sandwich place runs out of bread?!?!?!
When done properly the food is not bad but unfortunately,  the pig mac was raw in the middle.  Raw beef okay but raw pork not okay.  The reason for the one star was more to the service of this place.  Our server did not apologies about the raw food and feel annoyed that she has to return back to the kitchen.  Her attitude as the server was just not good. I didn't get a new burger until I requested for the second time.
Let me start by saying I've never been treated so bad at a restaurant. My husband and I sat at the bar and it took 5 min for the bartender to ask us if we wanted a drink. Mind you they were not busy at all there were only 3 other people in there. So after I got my water she said she would be back to take our order but walked around for 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing. When I asked for a server her terrible boss had an attitude while she rolled her eyes and kept running her smart ass mouth. Worse service hands down, no wonder they were empty. They get one star for the nice fish tank.
Very disappointed in the service. We waited 30 minutes to recover our food when it was not even busy. When we got it the steak was tough and gristly and one of the dishes has a piece of partially raw chicken. I will not be going back.
I am accustomed to much better.In town for the weekend, I couldn't believe how much cheaper this hotel was when I booked it. Then I arrived, and it all made sense.From the carpet scarred from trying to get out one two many stains, to the paper-thin towels, to the free wi-fi I couldn't access, to the overall grimy feeling of the furniture, I got what I paid for.I checked out the next day and stayed somewhere else.
Came here for the "midnight" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. The previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.Not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). Not happy.
TI  offers two for one special with limited food to eat and bad service a very disappointment buffet not worth the money.
Went through the drive thru and practically had our food thrown at us as the drive thru lady was in such a hurry to rush is off. In fact she was in such a hurry she forgot to give us our drinks, and when she realized we were still sitting there she opened the window and said "what do you need?"  Horrible customer service.
Horrible, this is the most unorganized theatre show ever! I wouldn't waste $10 on an event like this. Put it this way a high school production has a better set up and organization than this.
Me and my husband decided to try this out for the first time he had chicken pho I had rare pho . With that being said it will be the last time I ever go there I've never had it where the cinnamon was so overpowering that I puked when I got home. They were very polite not the cleanliness of places but they were very nice their food I can't say the same about it was gross and believe me I love my Vietnamese soup. So beware unless you like an overpowering cinnamon flavor don't eat it. We also had their spring rolls not the greatest at all. So will not be going again.
Horrible!  Went there because I bought a Living Social coupon.  First of all, the booth was so uncomfortable.  The bench was way too low for the table.  Looking around I could see the same was true of the chairs at the tables.  Then there's the food.  I must say I enjoyed the chips and salsa very much.  The chips were warm and not salty, and the salsa was perfect.  I should have stopped eating at that point.  I ordered the steak fajitas -- one of my favorite dishes.  Not this one.  It was loaded with mushrooms.  Seriously, mushrooms?  Don't know what cut of meat they used, but it was tough and had NO flavor.  I actually had to salt it, which I've never done with fajitas ever!  Got to find another Mexican restaurant that knows how to cook.
Worst panera ever. Really dirty. Staff very unfriendly. Not the panera you see on TV advertisements
I called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy I understand but when they drop it off I didn't take a look at the pizza because I was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as I went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. I waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. It's so mess up. They wouldn't even give my money back.
This girl accused me of buying cigarettes for someone and I had a valid ID and refused me. Never shop at this location. The customer service is subpar. UNBELIEVABLE. The bathroom is never clean and the prices are over average.
USED to love this place...They GOT to be for their heads.SERVICE IS TERRIBLE !!!!Also i got sick from the Ahi Tuna. The sushi chefs don't care about giving you attention...they are so busy ...you don't really important.
This may possibly be my worst dining experience. I've heard terrible things about the service at Smoky's, but I LOVE checking out local restaurants. It'd be nice to have good BBQ you don't have to wait forever for like at Black Dog. A group of 5 of us came and their menu was completely different than what it showed online. Our server was in a sour mood and spoke in a condescending tone when we didn't realize the sauce was on the table as the menu says to ask your server for sauce. My son ordered the kids ribs, they were received cold and dry. When I mentioned it to the server, she was shocked. She couldn't believe it because she said it just came out of the hot box. This was our first and only visit. I will not be back.
We returned from a day out sight seeing and I decided to look for some inexpensive ($$ or $$$) french food.  I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice. As others have stated, there is only one entree.  Your only choice is whether  you want soup or not and we ordered it.  We also ordered some house wine and were served bread and butter with it.  The bread was good and so was the wine - what I'd expect for the price. The carrot soup was ok.  It was a bit bland but not bad;  That was the highlight of the meal!  The 'salad' was iceberg lettuce, walnuts (right out of the bag) and a bland vinaigrette dressing that was very acidic.  They could have at least toasted the walnuts if not glaze them and it wouldn't take much effort to improve the looks and flavor of the salad by adding a bit of arugula or other mix.  The main course, was of coarse, the steak and fries.  The steak was very low grade, tough and not a lot of flavor.  The sauce helped a bit.  The fries were fine for what they were.The price is $26.95 per plate which is way too much for the quality of the food served.Service was ok, not bad but nothing special either.When we go out to eat, the biggest factor about whether we like it or not is the food.  The food here is way below average and the price is way too much for what it is.
We had a work dinner yesterday at Moxie's, we had a reservation for 12 people. The waitress seemed confused but did bring our food and drinks correctly. We had appetizers, main dishes drinks and coffee and right after coffee (I was still drinking my tea) the waitress came back with the bill a message to leave as they had the table taken. We were there around 2 hours beginning to end (which is normal for a dinner but we were still thinking about having at least one drink at least).This is incredibly rude, they have lost our business. I already forgot if the food was good or not, the only thing that I remember now is the terrible service. I have to add that the place wasn't packed... there many free tables. Such a shame...
They installed the WRONG spark plugs in my vehicle, which I later found was the cause of engine knock and a rough idle. The owner is a coward who is unprofessional, belligerent, rude and likes to use bully tactics when he's safe behind a phone. Trust me and the rest of the reviewers here... Save your money, hair and lifespan of your motor by either driving or having it towed to a local dealership or some other reputable auto mechanic who respects and knows your vehicle.
Pass by the China Cafe when driving down Clifton Blvd. ordered a quart of General Tsao's Chicken, was bland, no taste, overwhelmed with peanuts, and the vegetables were cut for soup, not the oriental cut in traditional Asian Cooking, ordered spring rolls, not too good either, the sauces (hot mustard) were packets no kick to them, fortune cookies were stale too, the redeeming item in the order was the white steamed rice. If your on Clifton looking for some good Asian food, get on Madison in Lakewood, and head to the Thai Kitchen, a few bucks more, however, everything is cooked to perfection......
Cocos USED to be my favorite. idk what happened. They switched to a fancier looking plating but the quality of food isnt the same as it once was. Also portions seem much smaller than they once were
Went to this "irish pub" for irish breakfast.  Was informed they they "use to have irish breakfast, but no longer do."  This place an Irish pub as much as a processed cheese is a diary product.
NOT a fan! The service was very poor and when I got my food, the contents of the burro were cold... The place isn't exactly clean or classy either.. Somewhere I'll be avoiding in future.
I defiantly don't recommend this place to eat on a weekend. I have been here many times during weekdays. I noticed the food is ok when the older gentle man is working during the week; it's in decent shape when he's around. I been here a few times during the weekend and all those times the food quality was not that good. I just had a meal here again this weekend; I mean I tried to, but couldn't eat any more. Had to garbage it since they would not refund me. The boneless chicken was very very dry and hard, and the noodles were so dry they looked black almost. I complained they just offered me Pasta, like seriously? I really should have snapped a photo. I can understand why they lack in business. IF, I repeat, IF, I come here again, it won't be on a weekend, but I doubt I'll be back again.
Went to sit and eat ordered the breaded mushrooms they were more breading than mushroom my friend ordered pickled Willy's she said they Were the worst she's ever tried then I ordered the eight chicken wings in the honey garlic sauce and fries with gravy I never got my gravy and the fries tasted like they were out of the bag and just like fried they tasted like they were stale and the chicken wings were good but they were very small the sauce was really good though and my friend ordered the pasta and she said it was so dry and tasteless will never be returning again
I have had this membership for a year. I thought it would be cheaper then LVAC, but after about a year adding everything up using the cheapest one it actually ends up more expensive. They have a hidden yearly maintenance fee they don't tell you about. Another thing they do is if you miss a payment by a day they charge you around $35. This gym is always packed in the mornings. The parking lot is not that big and so people have to park on the street. The equipment is actually decent for the size.
Let me start on saying I didn't appreciate getting kicked out of this place because of how ur security or manager think I was too drunk to handle myself the way I looked that night. I flew all the way from Seattle to Vegas to celebrate my 40th bday. Thinking, this place will be a good place for me, my sisters, brother in laws n husband a place to enjoy n celebrate my bday. Well, let me tell u.. we were so disappointed n wrong. I couldn't believe how poor ur management n security handle situation when u had too much to drink. Yes, I admitted had drunk too much that I did actually vomited inside ladies restroom.  Not to the point, that I made a mess on the floor or did not make it to toilet. I managed to walked n did my business inside ladies room. I managed to clean n flush the toilet to make sure it was spottless. As soon as I went back to r booth.. one of the security guard was talking to my brother in law n want us to leave because according to him.. I was too drunk to be there. At that time, I was just sitting n drinking my water observing n thinking.. what the hell is going on. We left r booth n waited for r parties on the waiting area to take care of r bill. Again, this security guard told us that we can't be there n have to leave the premises. That time, was already getting pissed off n heated up by the way they treated us. We got to this place @9pm n listened to the live band(sounded good by the way) enjoyed listening to them.We took advantage of they'r 2hrs unlimited drink for price of$47 Ithink.  We ordered drinks n enjoyed drinking. That's the reason why we were there for, right. Well, if u guys r offering unlimited drinks in ur lounge expect that u will have drunk people. I had fly me to the moon, mai tai n rum n coke. Hmm, 3drinks within 2hrs was not WORTH IT!! that 3drinks for me was enough that I had too much already n had already gone to restrm. Well, after 2hrs they told us we can't stay in r booth  n we need to moved. But if we want to stay, we have to order drink to keep the booth.  Orderd a bottle of bombay n juice just to keep r booth. They suck u up to order so u can keep ur booth. Again, why did u guys kicked us out coz I had too much to drink n can't handle myself(according to them) but yet, u offered us to ord more drinks to keep r booth. Not only we got kicked out @12:30 at night(still too early didn't even got a chance to dance on the dance floor). I found out next day r bill was $800.00. What  the f***, how much again for party of 8. Come to find out they did 2 separate bill. First, 2hrs bill unlmted drinks so about $400 plus r food chips dips maybe $500 + gratuity of course there were 8 of us 15 or 20% of r total bill. Had another bill they chg after 2hrs+gratuity again of course. Oh, wait there is more another charge for the booth we reserved but did not tell us we have to move after 2hrstotally shocked at this lounge.. billed us twice gratuity that's 40% no wonder r billed was $800. We didn't even finished r drinks that was ordered after that 2hrs unlimited coz u kicked us out. Now, u guys tell me if I was out of control that night.. as far as I know.. didn't say anything nor made a scene to get kicked out. The only time that I started dropping the f** word when I found out that we were getting kicked out coz of me. My only mistake was.. I had too much to drink n I threw up in the ladies room using the toilet bowl n did not made a mess. If I had too much too drink..then why the Hell do I remember all this.!! that's because,  I was not toxicated at all!! I think ur mgmt n security guard did so poorly judging me that I was belligerent n not able to contempt myself just because I threw up in the ladies rm. Thx, blue martini for ruining my 40th bdy n made me think that ur night club will be an epic place to be. I was looking forward to celebrate n enjoyed myspecial day that night with my family but instead worst time of my life. A night that I will never forget..disappointed place to celebrate ur special day. Ur security guard looked at me like I was being belligerent n can't handle myself. Again, u can't judge a person just the way they look n act. Understand, protocol n security of others is ur priority. But also need to realize ur lounge serving alcohol will not expect that customers will not get drunk. I felt humiliated getting escorted by ur security which until now.. still trying to find out WHAT I DID WRONG THAT NIGHT.Ur security need much training when to act or escort people out on how much they've drink. He judge me so poorly that I was not able to handle myself. I did not trash ur place, bother anyone nor I vomited in front of everyone. Not my recommendation to celebrate special day coz they judge u on how u look if u had too much to drink. My 1st time getting kicked out on my 40th bdy n in Vegas.. Way to go Blue Martini... this should be negative zero star but not able to post my reviews if i don't click at least a star.
The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was "That's not possible." Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack.
Greeted with the smell of weed on our floor.  I don't smoke but meh, whatcha gone do? The clientele left a little to be desired.  Being so close to Fremont you could here everything going on down there.  Again, we in Vegas so it is what it is.  There was a constant knocking in the bathroom that would never go away.  To top it off, there was an uninvited guest when I turned on the light around 1am.  I will post it shortly. The cherry on top was what sounded like a piece of paper that got stuck in the AC around 2 that did not stop until we turned it off at 7.  I've stayed at Red Roof's or Mo 6's that were nicer.  The only redeeming quality was the Hash House, more on that later.
We were staying at the Aria hotel (6/6/13). When making the reservation for the Showtime Tours shuttle, they suggested a pickup of 9:25pm since our flight was at 11pm. I agreed. We went to the lobby to wait for our shuttle at 9pmAt 9:40 I called because our shuttle was late picking us up to take us to the airport. They said the shuttle was there on time but didn't see anyone so they left (A huge lie)Thankfully (after many phone calls), they sent someone within 10 min (His name is Brandon and he was super friendly )Next time, I'll do research on more reliable transportation
Hubby and I stopped by to have some late breakfast at this place, the smells in one of the areas were not pleasant at All! , so I asked to be seated some were else,We got our food and It was TERRIBLE the pancakes were under cooked , got new ones and they were Also bad,the food had no flavor , the only good thing was the coffee and the Server was very nice! But wont ever come back to this location!!
Asked for special with meet. Said 12.99 then when I picked up they had a special for 7.99I asked about it and was told "ya I guess we could of offered you that" smart ass.  No tip. As I'm leaving some smart ass loud mouth women yells "you have a nice day anyway"
I wish I could have reviewed this restaurant based  on the food. My girlfriend and I came to Fernando's after passing on this place many times. Upon entering we were greeted by the server and asked to sit anywhere we wanted. The place at the time was pretty much empty save for a small group and two couples. Granted we had taken at least 5 minutes to order but we had ordered in time to beat a rush of hungry customers as the venue filled up another 5 minutes after we ordered. 20 minutes of waiting for our food turned into contempt as we saw customer after customer order and get their food before we did despite us being there before. We wouldn't have left as 'quick' as we did if not for a small family of 3 across the way receiving their food, having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already. The icing on the cake was that as we left the waitress made it a point to come out to us and rudely inform us that our server would have to pay for what we had ordered and that we had to wait because it was busy. Surely for someone who works in customer service one would think that the general principle is first come, first serve, especially in a restaurant. I suppose however that things are done differently in Mexico.
I had high hopes for this garage and had taken my car there once for an inspection with good results.Last week I asked if they could change my oil. The man said to drop the car off on Thursday night and leave the key in the key drop, he would get the job done on Friday. I left the car in the lot, dropped the key in the slot, and came back for it on Friday afternoon even though I had no phone call telling me it was ready for pickup.To my surprise, the shop was closed during Friday business hours when I arrived! Nobody was around, the car had not been touched, my key was still inside the shop, and the phone number was going to voicemail. I left without my car.I called again on Saturday. Voicemail again. No car. Called again on Sunday. Voicemail again. No car. Finally someone answered on Monday. I told him I would be there to pick up my car in the afternoon and was told they would be closing early, and would be closed by the time I got there. Unbelievable.I managed to arrange to get my car back finally after FOUR DAYS. Luckily I was able to make do without it by bothering my friends and borrowing their cars when I needed to go somewhere, and had no emergencies, but imagine if I actually needed to use my own vehicle! Unprofessional and unacceptable. I would not recommend using this garage unless you are comfortable with not getting your car back for days with no communication because they decided not to work that day for some unknown reason.No apology. No discount. When I brought up the fact that they left me stranded for four days the man on the phone said 'that's between you and the other guy'... I will never take my car here again.
Horrible service. Server put in the wrong order because she didn't bother to reconfirm my order at the time of ordering. Food took forever to come and the ramen sucked.
Unbearably slow service. I won't return.  Food was fine, but there's lots of fine food around; waiting 25 minutes to pay your bill, or 15 minutes to get your water refilled is not a model for a successful restaurant. There seemed to be only one waiter in the entire restaurant for lunch. There was another maybe manager, who was more content to sit down with her laptop and walk around than see how the customers were doing.
We had lunch here and ordered the two special rolls and sushi combo. Ehhhhh is what I will say....me and wife both agreed that their rice sucked ass. It was kinda hard and had no flavor (I guess I've always had good sushi rice that I can tell when someone doesn't put any love in the rice).  The nigiri we ordered were small and if this is the portion size....it's a good thing we had lunch only. We will not be returning back here.....oh ya service sucked ass considering there were 2 servers and about 4 tables that were being served
We just sold my dad's house, and moved him into an assisted living.  We had a houseful of belongings to sell.  I had contacted Holly at Lenore and Auntie Glads Estate sale.   Holly agreed to do the sale for a 3 day weekend sale.  I had taken a few items from the home, prior to the sale.  She set up a week prior to the sale and decided to do a one day sale, unannounced. We had our back against the wall, cause the house was closing  the following week.  Holly did the sale, which was a total dissapointment.  Selling the items way below the tagged price and leaving 1/3 of the household item behind.  I continued the "Sale" by directional signs on a church Sunday, and raised 50% of her revenue, with all the leftover, pick over stuff.Holly is quite the sales lady, to get you to sign the contract, but has no sense of  business.  I would advise anyone to do a sale by themselves and put an ad on ESTATESALES.Com for $ 89.00, and post numerous pics on that site.  All the money raised was going to charity, but it put a sour taste in our mouth when we had to pay Holly 40% for a pathetic sale.  She also says, she sends emails to her list, which is the ESTATE Sales.com viewership.  Lenore and Auntie Glads is front for a ripoff company!!
We have been going here for a while.. by far our favorite patio.. However, we just went the other night and were very disappointed by the menu.. everything has changed.. service has suffered also.. we don't know what has happened.. very disappointed.
If you're planning on using the drive-thru, be sure to check your order before you leave. It's almost a guarantee that they'll forget to put something in there. It's annoying. Screw up once out of maybe 10 or 20 times, you're human. Screw up my order five times in a row, you obviously don't give a rodent's derriere about your job. I would think neither does your manager about his. I eventually stopped going to this place and went to the remodeled one on 75th and Encanto. They're "open 24 hours" but may as well be closed. I went there for a burger and baked potato around 2 a.m. and first asked for the baked potato. "We stop serving those and chili after 10."  "Can I get a Baconator - Single?" "We stop serving meat after 1." "Then, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" "We have chicken...um...." "Never mind, then."***Drives off in an late night, unending hunt for food***
So we stopped in for a late lunch 3:30 and the staff is not very friendly did not give a receipt for our meals we ordered separately . The food is fine spicy chicken was good . But when I go to the bathroom and see they haven't cleaned all day that's just wrong! Don't put up a clean schedule if your not going to do it. Went back to the table and this couple rolls up , leaves there lite cigarette right by the door on the window . Very classy move if I say so my self . I'm thinking  it was the owner or the manager because the couple and their child walk around behind the counters and proceed to take money out of the registers . And than pack their stuff and leave . So if your concerned with hygiene and cleanliness I would pass this place up .
Took my truck to get brake fluid flush and rear brakes adjusted. Drove my truck 4 miles and the rear brakes locked up and started smoking. Took the truck back and they said the mechanic over adjusted the rear brakes.
The barbecue was good although I do feel like it is very overpriced to Steffes not usually very friendly when I go to the takeout here but then again maybe it's just me if you want good barbecue there's plenty of other places you can go
I do not recommend going to this location what so ever. Please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. Absolutely nothing hot n ready. While waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. Please do not waste your money and time here. I grew up with little Caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and I have never had such a bad experience food wise I have never left a little Caesars Pizza and thought I was ripped off but this location had me felling like I was ripped off which I was and you will be too. Please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.
We came in to check out smart cars and they had plenty, so they get one star for that.  However, all of the cars were locked.  We walked into the office and requested assistance and waited nearly 30 minutes for the guy who was joking around with coworkers to come help us.  We were never offered water and it was a warm day and we had been there for well over an hour.  We asked for the water fountain and were told it was out of order and still no offer. That annoyed me. Finally we go out to test drive the smart car and the salesman says nothing! Nothing the whole ride. I ask questions about the car and his response is, I'm not sure" and "I don't quite know the answer to that question." I am not asking how many cups of water the car can hold, rather the fuel efficiency, the weight, how often service is required, estimated costs of service and service plans.  Seriously, I will just wait for a preferred local dealership to have a Smart.
I loved this place because I had amazing health insurance at the time so I happily paid $400 for 2 pairs of glasses which would have cost us $1500 out of pocket. I liked their frame selection because they carry Gucci, Dior, & Oliver People's but they are TERRIBLE at doing lenses. If you have bad eyesight and actually need glasses to do their job, do not come here. My husband and I both got the poly-carbonate lenses with anti-glare and I was so disappointed by the quality. I needed my glasses adjusted when I got them (as everybody does) and the crappy lab that these people send their glasses to put on a cheap layer of anti-glare so that when they're adjusted, they literally melt and smear!!! Who does that!? I've been wearing glasses for 10 years now and have never had to deal with something so ridiculous. After my first fitting and my lenses got smeared, they sent them back and received the second pair a week and a half later. Those got smeared during the adjustment process too. Those were sent back and on my 3rd pair, the people realized that they'll have to put a cloth over the lenses to not get them too hot so they won't smear. What a hassel! This place is so far from my house and every time I need adjustments, I have to come back here in hopes that my lenses won't smudge and I'll be screwed out of glasses. I've had those glasses since last February and about 6 months in, the anti-glare began rubbing off at the bottom and continued to do so until my frames snapped two nights ago. My husband's anti-glare actually got smudged because he left his glasses out in the car one day and then tried to clean them. This place offers a one year warranty on their lenses so they replaced them for free, but it was still an incredible inconvenience. I will never recommend anybody nor return here again. My father-in-law also purchased a pair of glasses here and had the same problem of the anti-glare wearing after a couple of months. So cheap. Go across the street to Lenscrafters where you pay a little more but you only have to wait one hour instead of 1 month to get a pair of working glasses.
Not worth the price. Service was OK... "Poop emoji" "Poop emoji"
The service is horrible, atmosphere is horrible, coffee is horrible, and everything is overpriced.   I won't be going back.
I've never had such a bad meal in this area and I've lived here for 2 years. My wife ordered the salad and it came out wet and devoid of any flavor. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and it had so little beef I contemplated sending it back to the kitchen. We both took most our meal to go. We'll have better luck dressing them up ourselves.  Highly doubt I'll be back unless it's for katsu. However, Katsuya is in the area so why even bother?
So I went to Zupas today and ordered the half salad and soup (their special) Hungarian Beef Stew. What I got was more like vegetable soup. I did see some strands of what may have been beef, but definitely did not get what was pictured. Very disappointed!! Good thing it is only seasonal...Of course it would not do me an y good to let them know, because they do not comp you anything. For instance, I ordered one of the creme brulee's a few weeks ago, and halfway into it, there was a cluster of fresh rosemary. I sent an email to their company and they replied they would let the store manager know... did not offer for me to get another or comp my money back..
I can careless for a fast food! But I work by this chi fil A spot and me and co workers go there atleast once a week. I don't remember one time that I got my order right! Once I ordered today, didn't get my cheese and the ketchup and had to wait 5mins just to get a slice of cheese! 2 nights ago we ordered number one we got a spicy one instead! Like it's just a simple sandwich with a simple order! How can you get it wrong every time! And lately the food is coming old and cold! Either warm it up or cook a new one
The service department has had my van numerous times for the same problem. Then I asked about trading the vehicle in and they offered me way less than my vehicle is worth and actually added 800$ to the sticker price of their vehicle. Seemed crazy but that was there offer. I would not recommend this facility.
Don't recommend what so ever. So terrible, we tried to bring one of our friends to try pho for the first time and the service was terrible, we ordered a Thai tea Boba, the Boba was hard and the tea was too strong. It was so gross we didn't pay for it and we're not allowed back but I don't even care, I'm never gonna go back. It was just a waste of time. Don't go here, go up the street to pho Kim long they're pho is way better and cheaper.
This is the worst hotel I've ever been in!! I reserved a non smoking room, checked in at 9 pm and was told there was only smoking rooms left. They brought some air purifier BS and said "that should help"! I am allergic to cigarette smoke, yet I am forced to sleep in a room type I didn't pay for!!! And dont even get me started on booking through Expedia!! Never again! If I owned this place I would be embarrassed! Not to mention the night security guy who was in the process of running off the homeless people (???).  Gross, dirty, smelly, and disgusting!!!  Negative 5 stars!!!!
Stay away from this place. Once the sale has gone through they treat you like a piece of trash.
Really bad experience here. Went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. They start @ 8pm. Ok. We had two drinks and were hungry. Asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. Yes that was fine. Get your hand stamped so u can come back in. We got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. Had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. Ate and then got in line to go back in. No charge since we had our hand stamped. Tried to fit at a table and were told NO we had to stand. The tables were reserved!  Nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. Total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  EXTREMELY disappointed. Sucks
What is wrong with this place? Seems like it creates a uproar in the kitchen just ordering a cheesburger (which I never got). I'll never go there again.
Be cautious about what the service advisor recommends. Before doing the work, definitely get a second opinion or you may pay hundreds to thousands of dollars unnecessarily. Here's our story. My wife and son took our Edge in for a routine oil change and next thing I know they are given a recommendation that ranged in the thousands of dollars. The service advisor made it sound like it was urgent and we would be taking a risk if the work was not done. I took my car to a trusted mechanic and he said none of the recommended work needed to be done right away and some not for a long time. After hearing this, I felt like the service person was just trying to make money through scare tactics. I have bought 3 cars from this facility and have done service through them since then but now I will not bring my cars back again and I will not buy another car from them because I don't trust their ethics any longer! I understand the need to let the customers know what could potentially be wrong but they should also be honest and add when they really need to be fixed to give the full picture. The advisors I worked with early on were honest and did not try to up sale me on things that needed to be done through scare tactics but just let me know the facts and when they could be done. Unfortunately they do not work there anymore. I wonder why?
Ordered from Caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  When we finally got the pizza it was cold.  I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  The toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.  Bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else.
Came here with my cousin who was visiting from Fort Bragg because I had heard solid reviews from others. He got the Mahi Mahi tacos which he said were average. The fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about.I had the chicken tacos which were so watery that the tortilla they came on was soggy, damp and crumbling apart before it even reached my table. That should've been my first sign.There must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.Anyway, I ate a good portion of the tacos and began feeling sick about 45 minutes later. Spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable.I will never go back here.
Service was unbelievably slow. There was one other table in the restaurant and it took over a half hour to get out me food and took the server over ten min to come to the table for drinks. The good is not worth the price either. $40 for a small salmon and chicken skewers that weren't done well enough. Won't be going back.
This used to be my favorite place to get sushi. The new owners have RUINED this place. Priced are jacked up, no more lunch specials and the food quality, my rolls tasted bland and fell apart... Does anyone know if the old owners opened a sushi place up I'll follow them. The customer service here was great for us,  except the short haired blonde lady,  she had an attitude problem. The food not worth it.
In  2 years I've ordered from here 7 times; once for delivery, 3 times to-go, and 3 times dine in. Not only have they never gotten my order right, but the last time my food was spiked with cayenne (which I am allergic too). I had to have an epinephrine shot and still broke out in hives and stopped breathing. If you value your health, please never eat from here
I give this place a one star overall. The service is bad and the food/drinks are just OK. On my last visit they overcharged me $50 and management is always be too busy.Beware and just to be safe keep a copy of your signed receipt.
Renting from here is like the episode of Seinfeld.  You can take the reservation, but don't know how to hold the reservation.reserved a compact, they wanted to give me a two seater truck for three people and luggage... Umm, no thanks.They had one with snow tires which the said was $15 more...  Fine...... Until the price comes up- it's $15 a *day* more...  For the rental period, I can buy a set of four snow tires for that...  Totally ridonkulous.  No thanks...Then they had a Cadillac suv, normally $30/day more, but they're willing to give it to me for $15/day more.  No thanks... You could give it to me for no extra charge...  They had nothing else.  Total bait and switch.So they went over to Avis, which actually had something for $10 less (total)...  I would have booked with Avis in the first place but they said they were closed when my flight arrived...Yup, worst car rental place ever.
This course is in horrible shape. Driving markers are all screwed up and the greens are hard as rock. The fairways are partial dirt and dead Bermuda grass Staff wanted to argue about correct rate and starter couldn't tell us who the twosome was or where they came from when they jumped in front of us on 10. If it wasn't such a beautiful day I would have just left part way through  I know the management company is running the other 2 courses in Henderson.  This company is well known for lining golf courses up for sale or filing BKI am not going back.
This location used to be good - knowledgeable people worked there etc. All the knowledgeable people are gone - not trustworthy - I traded a system - left the CD in by accident - it was a hard to find CD - of course they can't find it. They made no effort to contact me etc. Untrustworthy staff - will never go here again. At the time manager "Jessica" told me should would get the item back to me - of course she made no effort, I contacted numerous times, I hope she's not still there - dishonest employees are the worst. Edit: I'd just like to add that in 3 years I haven't been back to this location and I buy games all the time. I just wanted you to know how much business you've lost in being dishonest people, I hope it was worth it. You still owe me a fire emblem radiant dawn cd = lousy gamestop.
What a total disappointment. There were flies surrounding our table so my family and I couldn't fully enjoy our visit. The waitress was totally clueless. She took our order to another table that was also a family with the same amount of guest (I guess all black people look alike) when they told her that wasn't their order she tried to bring the food to us but it had already been passed out and placed in front of the other family. It took forever for the food to be prepared and even longer for the waitress to bring it. The appetizers came out with the meal which took a total of 32 minutes and no we weren't offered the standard hush puppies while we waited nor did our drink order come out before the meal (and it was incorrect as well). Terrible visit.
I went to Casa Reyna nearly four months ago after a several year hiatus.  I am not sure how to write this poor of a review because I've never done so with as much emphasis on poor as this one. I went with a group of people who all experienced lackluster service and agreed on bland tasting, watered down food. For a restaurant which, in the past, had an amazing reputation for their genuine, traditional Mexican cuisine, most - if not all - of my party left generally uninspired and unwilling to return.  Despite what appeared to be the same authentic, expansive menu (which excited me beyond words) we all felt the actual food (and slow, rude service) was a waste of our time and money.  I could go into positives vs. negatives like I feel most reviews should have but, to be perfectly candid, the only positive I can think of is the cool set up and decor.  Since this could easily turn into a catastrophically negative review on a public forum I will refrain from writing anything more than:  1.  I should have tried the true staple Nopalas (I have concluded that finding this on a Pittsburgh menu is extremely rare) and 2. Don't rely on Casa Reyna's previous reputation because, for whatever reason, things have dramatically changed (possibly explaining our terrible experience?) ... do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Local comparison:  El Paso Mexican GrillNot recommended.
This was one of the worst services we have ever experienced in Vegas. The waitress did not even get our names for the waitlist and even thiugh we could see 4 tables free we were definitely NOT welcomed. For a small restaurant in an area filled with veterans, you would have expected more. Super disappointed!
I have goose bumps after reading the 1st review because I experienced the same exact experience yesterday! This woman "Andrea" who happens to be the owner flat out shocked my mom and I and left us speechless after what she did! Throughout speaking with her for 45 min about what we wanted for the bridal party, chuppa, and table arrangements, we got short answers, no visuals, and complete attitude. Being a bride, and completely overwhelmed, you would think someone who wants your business would show you samples of things and try and help you to create the look you are going for. This woman lacked any expertise. In fact, when we couldn't come to a clear idea of the centerpieces, I said how about I get all of the flowers through her and get the candleabra's through the other place we had conversed about, and she said, " How about you just get nothing from us," and ripped up the order form into tiny pieces! This form had all the things that I had planned to get through her (which mind you was over $1000 worth of business)!!! I still feel like it was a nightmare or that Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out and say, " HA you have been punked!" The only thing I could say was that the BBB would be hearing about this to what she responded, "You can write what ever you want sweetie." Are you kidding me?!!!  Please think twice about getting your arrangements here. Good luck!! - Pissed off bride
Pretty terrible. Reserved a room with king bed. Was given a room with 2 double beds. Tried to call and get the mistake corrected and was just put on holdIndefinitely. Tried to go to the front desk at 11:00pm and the front desk completely ignored the main line and waited on people who i guess were more important because they didn't wait at all?! Definitely would not stay here again!  I've worked in hospitality and this was the worst I've ever seen. Room is ok but when you reserve a king you expect a room with a king. I guess that is a crazy concept at this hotel.
An absolute joke of a branch. The customer service is extremely poor, especially from one specific teller. I wish I caught her name. I have been a preferred customer for years and my family is seriously considering taking our accounts to another bank altogether. Don't expect to be helped if you don't arrive with plenty of time before they close - because they'll take their time to greet you to ensure that they don't acknowledge you until 7pm and spend time telling you that they can't help you because now it's 7:01pm. I was standing there behind another customer for at least 2 minutes before the open teller (who wasn't helping a customer while I was waiting) even looked at me. I'm pretty sure she was just waiting for the clock to turn 7pm so she could tell me she couldn't help me. Oh - but that same teller still answered the phone and does business over the phone well past 7pm.. probably hoping it's a new customer wanting to open another account for her own commission. But when she realized it was the person she turned away at 7:01pm, she hung up on me. Completely unprofessional.
This is a new location from the same owners of the Luna Rossa at Lake Las Vegas.  I have never been to the original location but had a TERRIBLE experience today at the Downtown/Fremont Street location. I went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, filet mignon sandwich and lasagna.  Lasagna and meatball sandwich were both cold and flavorless.  Am assuming that this was previously frozen and microwaved before it was served to us.  Also, the water glasses and silverware were very dirty. We were very shocked when we received our bill... All items that were ordered were supposed to be part of the lunch menu and were supposed to include drinks.  We were charged $3.75 each for our sodas and by that point we all just wanted out of the restaurant. It was really expensive for a previously frozen, microwaved lunch.  The only good part was the Krispy Kreme donuts that we stopped for on our way back to work.
This is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurants. We ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. After over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. He said he was too busy to help us. He said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. If we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. Who treats customers like that? I told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. She just shrugged her shoulders and said "do what you have to". I don't think I gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. The management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. What a disappointment.
Had a 7pm reservation but they made a mistake and made reservation night prior.  They have had us wait over 1 hour for their mistake and still not seated!
Brewery nachos were good. Teri's Cajun pasta was bland and my shrimp & lobster enchiladas were like cardboard!  Bad food. Not a fan!!
The absolute worst, the girl at the counter was unbelievably rude and snotty and quite frankly dumb as a stump... as I'm trying to order a sandwich she's talking over me and rushing me along, I'm trying to ask what veggies and she's telling me the cheeses and the condiments, for god sakes shut up and listen .... I'm only asking about the veggies and she just kept spouting out the entire sandwich. I then told her to just listen to what I wanted and after that she was still asking me if I wanted the other stuff such as  peppers and mayo and cheese. She was the dumbest millennial yet. She is what gives this generation a bad name.
Over charged I got charge $38 for a basic manicure and just a regular pedicure and that supposed to be with the 15% off happy hour discount. Ripped off it should've cost me $29 shame on them. And she didn't even push back my cuticles on my manicure. They are nice people as they rip you off.
I had an amazon return drop off. The first thing I walked in the store its this stare, no greetings... no questions... just a stare with no smile on this guy's face. After I told him I needed a drop off, and the guys wants $2 to tape my box. Seriously? I said I've been to other ups, never charged for extra taping?! And he was like "well, go there then!" Wow! How rude?! I'd love a manager gave me an explanation for this!Worst customer service ever!!!!!!!!!
I decided to swing by to buy a few medium sized mid priced cigars since I live around the corner. I spent $15 on 3 cigars. Sad to say that even though the cigars were kept in a cabinet humidor that they were dry as a bone when I got them home. I smoked one about 10 minutes after buying it and while cutting the cigar it crunched and practically shattered. After lighting up the cigar the wrapper flaked off, it burned incredibly hot and unevenly and was so bitter that I couldn't finish it. Too bad since they are so close to home, but I'll be traveling elsewhere from now on.
Worst mcdonalds ever in the history of mcdonalds.  Food sucks, place is disgusting and dirty, soda is always watered down.  Staff is beyond rude. Including the management.  I work close by so I have no choice but to eat there. They mess up my order every time.  Wish I could give negative stars.
Collision center repair guy gave me all sorts of reason why I got a crappy job, my car was old?! That doesn't cut it. Then to try to some things over the collusion manager said he was sending Ricks Detail service to clean up the vehicle after how it was left after work they did. Rick detail didn't come out it was another company, so I was lied to again. These ppl do nothing but deceive people
Safe to say I will never be going back here again! I'm now 14 weeks pregnant and have been coming to MomDoc since I was 5 weeks. They constantly are calling me to reschedule appointments, I understand that some doctors may not be in the office when they intended to be so at first it didn't really bother me. I had an appointment scheduled for today, one they had already rescheduled, I received a call in the morning and from them saying they need to reschedule AGAIN, and when i call them to reschedule they tell me they cant fit me in that day! Both myself and my partner had scheduled time off work for this appointment and for them to call the same day and tell me they couldn't give me an appointment it unacceptable.The only reason i originally went to MomDoc is because they say they're open till 8pm each day, however those appointments seem to be non existent!DO NOT GO HERE! You'll regret it if you do.
We went here for a bachelorette night and got a private room. I called 5 times asking different questions and then when we got there they didn't follow through with what they told me. For example they said we could do separate checks if we let them know ahead of time and then our waitress said no. I asked about the pole and told them that's what we were excited for when we got there they had remodeled the private rooms and there was no pole (they never told us this) the room was small and stuffy, our karaoke machine didn't work for probably 45 min of our 2 hour stay! Which we were paying $100 an hour for and our waitress was sooo rude the whole time. Never smiled would roll her eyes at us when we asked something!  I will NEVER return to this place.
Well I thought I would give this place another chance It is obvious that if you come in alone you will be treated like crap .. I had just worked a very long shift at the hospital up the street and in wanted to finely get a bite to eat and use my gift card I had ..Well I was taken to my table and saw my waiter 2 times .. they had not gotten busy till I left .. I dont know maybe I should of told my waiter that even though I am alone I do tip well maybe that would of had him to give me a little bit more time ...It is really sad because I would of never treated him like that if he came into my place of employment.. and I did tip well on a 20.00 bill Sad to say I think I am totally done now and I should just give a whole new restaurant a chance to win me over Very sad and disappointed
The cashiers are dreadful. Love the food. Hate the service. Ive been several times and the sandwiches are always awesome, it's too bad the staff is so rude.
The food was ok but I find it very upsetting that you charge extra for each additional item such as my chicken tortilla soup to add tortilla strips cost extra. But when I wanted extra turkey on my sandwich they refuse to do that?? I don't understand....
Carry out order was literally tossed in the to go box, no sides as ordered with increased price for entree. Not happy and never going there again.
15 minutes after I ordered in the drive thru my car hasn't moved...I think that pretty much is all you need to know for this review as I am writing in FROM the drive thru!
Having dealt with sub-standard contractors and spending hours on the phone trying to resolve issues with our Service Agreement (it's not a home WARRANTY, there's a difference!), I've learned the hard way that the entire industry is a rip-off. 2-10's policy is to deny claims right off the bat, even those that are legitimately, undeniably covered. After you've called back repeatedly, they may dispatch a contractor, but not the reputable kind that you would want to make repairs to your home, more like the fly-by-night companies who are only able to continue their existence because of Home "Warranty" companies. Avoid this predatory industry and hire your own contractors, in the end you'll have peace of mind knowing the repairs will be done right and end up saving money over paying the annual fees for a Service Agreement that isn't worth the time you'll spend scouring it to discover all the exclusions and limitations.
Service was poor and they blamed it on the bartender that had just quitNo wonder the food was poor - a bartender cooks itSalad was okThe Keg is betterManagement doesnt care about any complaintsGo elsewhere please.....the arrogance is so inappropriateI think bartenders are the cooks
Slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.  Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!   More expensive to eat in then take out.
The guy who came to "fix" our garbage disposal was a freaking joke. Our garbage disposal is shaking the whole counter and making very loud noises when it is on but not grinding anything. He went on to tell us that the reason it's so loud is because the horse power is a high number and that we'd need to install a lower horse power model for it to not be so loud. After we left we consulted several online sources that said higher horse power will make it more quiet. I hope this company hires technicians who actually know what they're talking about.
UPDATE...So...against my better judgement l decided to give this place another try. Big mistake! They are a complete rip off place, still trying to sell you things you don't need. I wanted to get new break pads and rotors because my steering wheel shakes a bit when I brake from a high rate of speed and my car has 72,000 miles so I figured it was a good idea. They told me $250 and they could do it today. Well, they take my car back and then they come out and tell me that I need new drums because mine are warped and shocks and struts, yada yada...Suddenly it's a $1,400 job. I just had it at the dealer for a recall and they said they did an inspection and didn't mention any of this so I decide to wait and get a second opinion. So, I ask them to write all this down for me...Suddenly, the shocks and struts are mileage recommended, not because they've noticed anything wrong with them and the drums are just ''slightly'' warped. I'll be curious to see what the dealer says. It is so disheartening not to have a reliable place to take my car that doesn't just want to rip me off.
I read the reviews for Agave and had high hopes. I first called on 10/28/14 to arrange for an estimate for yard cleanup at my house. Based on some of the other reviews, I knew it could take a while for a response. I waited 8 days without hearing anything so I called again on 11/5/14. Still no answer so I left a second voicemail. I did get a call  back from Geoff 10 minutes later where I was told to go to the website and to request a quote there since I would fill out a form with all of my information. I did that as soon as I got off the phone. I then received an email from him that night saying he needed my physical address. I had already put that in the form, but maybe there was an issue so I sent it to him via email an hour later. It is now 11/12/14 and I have heard absolutely nothing back AGAIN. I even checked my junk mail to make sure an email wasn't sent there by mistake, but of course, nothing.I contacted another landscaper on Friday 11/7, they came out and did the quote today and they will complete the work next Monday. 10 days total from when I first contacted to when the work will be complete. It has been 15 days since I first contacted Agave and no one has even come out to give me a quote. Agave may do good work, but I wouldn't know since I couldn't even get them out to my house.
on 11/18 looks like the owner wrote a reply....what he said was a lie!!  If what he said was true then we would not have had to go to the Registrar of Contractors; who agreed the granite needed to be replaced due to the size of the grout lines, some were as large as 1/8" inch.  Nor would we still be unsatisfied after a 2nd counter tops was installed. They replaced the kitchen counter top last week2/26/15. The seams were raised, bumpy and rough. We called Mary, the manager who is unable to make a decision without speaking to someone else, and said we wanted the seams smoothed and polished. She brought over a sample of what  we should expect from the seams. The sample was smooth as can be with hardly a  noticeable seam. They came out on the 3rd and smoother the seams, Why didn't they do this in the first place. But now there about  a 6" width running along  each  seam where the granite is duller than the rest of the counter top.  We called Mary again and she was very doubtful of our complaint. Of course she has to confer with someone else. We have not heard back from her today. Why hasn't someone from their organization, who can make decisions, bothered to contact us. They could not even be bothered to show up for the meeting with the ROC.
Yet another restaurant that makes you valet your car.  We parked in the large, mostly empty parking lot ajacent to the restaurant.  As we approached the front door, the valet guy tells us we will be towed if we leave our car there.  Ok, back to the car, to find a restaurant with parking.  As we were leaving, I did see some street parking but by then I was not in the mood for The Clever Koi.  Sorry, lost a customer, won't be back.
This has been one me of my favorite places to eat sushi for a long time now.. the owner Andy is amazing and very friendly! However today I experienced something no one should have to ever go through. One of the server's ( small lady with glasses) was really rude and embarrassed me in front of my friends that I haven't seen in a real long time today. The situation started because I was taking the rice off of the sushi because Lord knows it was just to much rice on the sushi role.. lol Sorry( I had no idea ..I had to eat all the rice on an all you can eat menu lol! ) She came over to our table super aggressively and told us she was getting us our check with her hands in the air looking exacerbated..I became defensive and replied we are not finished eating and can you please prepare another sushi role. She replied back saying no.. and if I do I will grab you a half a role. I said why?.. she went back in the kitchen where our plates were.. brought it to the front of our table around my friends and other customers!   Saying(you didn't eat all of the rice on your plate!!!!) at this point I was just mortified!!!I replied by saying  if i violated your policy.. pull me aside or you explain that I will be charged more and I would have totally understood! I immediately went over to the chef and asked is this how you treat your customers. He quickly apologizes for her action! He came over to the table to defuse the situation and the bad experience from his employee.Please understand my rant.. This is one of my favorite places in the city to eat!! I tell all of my co-workers, friends, and family to go there. So to get treated like this was horrible! As we signed our checks I guess he sent her to tell us sorry.. but I refused to accept the apology because I knew it wasn't coming from a genuine place ( the boss told her to do it) Andy no one should ever be treated like this in any of your restaurants... And if these are the people you are hiring, then it says alot about you! You are the company you keep.
A bit pricey. My early experiences at tanning salons were places that included cold washcloths, decent products to use to freshen up after (wipes, spray deodorant, lotion, hairspray), and also had things like small water bottles or juice, candy, hair ties...**** they made their 'improvements' and the place still sucks. Service has gotten worse and so impersonal. The value of services and amenities is not worth the $$$.
This is not a Philadelphia establishment. The owners seem to be Greek. The default cheesesteak comes with lettuce and tomato!! I can't imagine how wilted that lettuce would be. Average cheesesteak, poor decor inside. The fries were decent. I would not go back.
Let me start by saying this place is a complete joke, whether it starts with the "luxury living" while housing section 8 guest or just having rude employees. The fake wood floors is a nice touch if you are looking for cheap. One Of the things I love the most is the 37 kids from section 8 screaming their heads off. Everything is old and cheap, one of the employees explained to us that the place was old and that's why it is the way it is... Oh okay I didn't know that was an excuse for having not so hot water, dips in the floors, blinds made of tissue paper, AC's that could barely cool a smart car, water that smells like sulfur, and phone jacks that have been painted over... Like really? Did you have sloth from the goonies build these? Honestly I get creeped out at night to take the trash out... You feel like you are going to get jumped by a velociraptor or just plain see someone going number 2 in the grass? I also love the vomit in the rocks from old town guest, that's a nice touch.
Terrible experience overall.Service was so poorly coordinated it ruined our entire dinner, though the staff attempted to be polite. We were seated after being asked to wait for a while (even though half the tables were not taken).I ordered coffee with me dessert, but they didn't serve it until I had finished my dessert (15 minutes after I ordered it). I simply asked them to take the coffee back.Seating for two can be very tight and you hear the entire conversation of the table next to us.Food is not bad, definitely overpriced.
have never had to use my AAA membership but when i needed a tow, WHAT A NIGHTMARE !!They did not want to tow my vehicle because i didn't have a name of employee who would receive the vehicle at the repair shop !! so glad the car was not in an accident, a huge run around,renewal is next month gonna reconsider
Nothing special here. Being from New England I expect a hot dog joint to carry a large variety of dogs and buns. This place was just like any other. Here are my disappointments.1. No New England style buns. They didn't even know what they are and the cook looked at me funny. To me this is insane, the bun is the second most important part next to the type of hot dog. A cheap potato bun doesn't cut it.2. I asked for my bun to be buttered and toasted, again they were unable to do this and looked at me funny again.3. I wanted my dog boiled and charred, again they don't do this. I am okay with boiled dogs and would have gone that route but they didn't even offer them boiled! Head scratcher on that one.4. The only natural casing dog they carried came as a foot long. I did order this and it was good. I wish they carried natural casing dogs in regular size as I was not too happy with the price of having to order a foot long.5. Service was slow, not friendly and they seemed rather irritated I asked question. Also ordering was confusing with all the people behind the counter you would think someone would want to take my order. They must not be that hungry for money.On one positive I did enjoy the onion rings. They kind of reminded me of the ones served at Wahlburgers in Hingham Ma.Any case, if you are from New England be prepared to be disappointed. I had high hopes seeing this was a franchise from New York, but then again New York is not part of New England.Late,
Quality went down. Their curry lentil is TERRIBLE! It's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else, just liquid. I called up and apparently it's supposed to be like that. I'm sorry but that is NOT curry lentil. The chicken feta salad is still decent but it is smaller now. I liked the vinaigrette that had seasonings in it and now its just oil and vinegar. I haven't had their pita sandwiches yet. I usually get the chicken feta pita but at this rate I probably will just save my money. The staff was nice and attentive before. The occasional new girl would suck but overall good service. I'm not sure about now. Haven't ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous!
Being a mix-raced Transgender couple minding our own business shopping we noticed we were being followed. My partner decided to sample one chicken nugget. They stopped us after we purchased some items and then stopped my partner and said he had stolen nuggets and contaminated the rest of the nugget bin because he was gay. They dragged my partner to unknown room and would not tell me what was going on. They told my partner that he had stolen and contaminated the rest of the bin but they did not remove the rest of the chicken nuggets so they are selling contaminated nuggets to everyone. So if you like chicken nuggets beware they will be probably be contaminated by homosexuality.
This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Not sure how they were able to completely remove flavor. Table was dirty. When I wiped it with my napkin, there was black dirt. Service was fair. Server was pleasant. Walk another 100 yards to Mangos.
would give negative stars.towed my car here from another incompetent mechanic. took them 2 months to even touch my car. parts were missing/broken. car still not running in fact is in worse condition than it was before. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. BUNCH OF LIARS.  this situation started at Daves Automotive. check out my review of them for the entire story.
I'm being generous to give this place 1 star. The service was ok. We went in with greater expectations only to be disappointed. We stopped in for cocktails and appetizers and were shocked to find that the specialty cocktails are served in plastic cups-a Margarita in a cup? ( Really?! I thought this was a restaurant, but a pool party!) We ordered Drunken Shrimp and Guacamole and chips. The shrimp looked like something you use as bait for bigger shrimp; it wasn't peeled and was overloaded with heat, not spice or flavor. The Guacamole tasted prepackaged or something from Costco. The venue was typical-TV's playing 80's Rock videos were okay, but not of high quality. If you are looking for a better rock-and-roll venue, go to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.
Came for Sunday game, at first service was great, one it got less busy, the staff disappeared, I had to go to the bar to get a drink and then I had a flag a waitress down to order food. Been here 3 times, 2 out of less were less than good. Boo Al's. Also no paper towels or soap in ladies room.
Reserved a car 4 months ago yet waited in line for 45 minutes because there was only 1 agent although there were 5 rental counters. Finally, 2 other agents came out including supervisor who stated he was " helping outside".Reservations are supposed to enable supervisors to schedule staff to prevent this type of poor service!
Do not rent here ever- I lived here for about 13 months. The front gates do not close. ever--- they will tell you they close at dusk and open at sunrise, but they only actually worked for about 1 month of the time i lived here. When you ask them about this they state that they are having trouble with them, and have had 3 different companies come out to see them.. The walking gates are never closed either, and even if they do, the front fence  by the mail room and fountain is rusted, so you could get thru it if you were a smaller person   There are homeless people that come in and rummage thru the garbages , when chandler, one of the office staff was asked about this she told me to call glendale pd next time..  Speaking of glendale pd they are there on a montly basis, and  when this is brought to the attention of the office staff ,to see if me as a single woman getting home at 1 or 2 am needs to be worried about anything, they never have any explanation,aside from the fact that yes there has been some dificulty with one of the residents..     The mainatance ppl are extremely adept at smoking and driving golf carts, tho they seem to do little else...I have seem more control panels on the buildings open then i can count, the pool gates  dont always open from the inside, you need a key on the outside lock to get out from the inside, there is more light bulbs in the ouside lighting out then that actually works, and that is for the light fixtures that are still standing-- there was on that got knocked down on july 4 weekend and was still lying on the ground when i moved out on the last weekend of august.  oh and some of the other things ive found while walking my dogs on the property is used needles lying by the gym, swarms of bees, a million ferral cats...    Which brings me to the office staff.God help you if you have a problem because the 3 of them couldnt find their way out of a paper bag-- Chandler cant remember anything form one day to the next, you can have packages that get delivered , but the staff cant seem to find them because they label them with the wrong apartment number....They will call and tell you that the people around you complained that you were noisy and they dont know if you were having a party or not,but you need to be more considerate of your neighbors--A direct quote from chandler, and when you contact her to tell her that there must be a mistake because you work until 1 am, and werent even home that night, she has no idea what you are talking about... when i gave my notice I was given a move final price by chandler,  then a day later i was called by another office staff who gave me another number for my final rent. When i questioned this she got huffy with me and stated that she was the book keeper and did i want her to go over the books with her.. When i state no, i just wanted to know how i got 2 different numbers in 2 days,especially after a call to verify that i was moving out and when because apparently chandler got confused at to what i wanted and the dates of these things, even thought they have a form you fill out...that i handed to chandler...when i paid my last rent for 3 days of september i was given a third price,which happened to be the least expensive.  If you havent guessed i cannot say enough negative things about this place-- it was a means to an end for me, but i wouldnt let anyone rent here ever  The maintanence people seem to be very adept at smoking and driving golf carts around, but i rarely see them do any work--I had a upper unit that had a ac that leaked onto my floor between my kitchen and bathroom,.when i asked them about this last year when i moved in i was told that this is normal for arizona,   when it happend again this year i called and spoke with chandler again, who also told me that it is completely normal for arizona.. when i explained to her that i have lived in az for 12 years and never had this occur anywhere but here she told me that it is their units specifically, and normal. When asked if they would cover cost for the mold that occured form the leaking and heat she told me no...
Terrible customer service. Rick is such a jerk. Don't bother making an appointment it doesn't get service any faster. Per rick " you don't get into the doctors office on time". Over 3 hours past appointment to just get it looked at. Just wanted a brake job.
This place had excellent customer service prior to converting to Adam-Nail. Under the new management, Adam -the wax guy, made inappropriate conversation during the session, degrading their professionalism and service etiquette. I unfortunately do not plan to return to this place which I previously frequented.
It was my first time being at the cheesecake factory, and we went for my Sister's birthday, and we had a party of 8. (5/27).  So...it all started with the simplicity of drinks. My husband and I got there to reserve the table for our party. Jennifer came, asked us what we wanted, and she walked back and forth in the opposite direction of where the soda machine was at. Another nice gentlemen came to make sure that we were already taken care of, and thinking back we should've switched waiters while we had the chance. Any who, our drinks our finally brought, and we still havent gotten our bread and butter (as promised by Jennifer). So there goes another 15 minutes to get us the bread. My family gets here, and we are all deciding what to eat. Mind you, ive never been there so im having trouble trying to choose an entree. I ask Jennifer what she recommends and she said "im classy so i like so and so plate"...like what? Am i too ghetto for you, Jennifer?  so, i order this chipotle pasta thing and when i got it, it was alright. I ate it because i was really hungry but it wasnt the best thing. My niece is telling this waitress that it's my sister's birthday, us expecting for them to sing to her you know, because it's tradition. Nope, Jennifer just looked at her like she was crazy and walked away, didnt even say happy birthday at the most. Fast forwarding to the check, obviously we are all split. So, i personally got the check and split it into number groups. Group 1 was me and my husband, 2 was my sister and her family, so on and so forth. She sees me doing this, and says "oh awesome thanks for splitting it for me!" She comes back and says "so i know you tried helping me but i found an easier way". Like ok, whatever works for you, Jennifer. She gives us back our checks and they're all messed up............but she found an easier way right? . She claimed that the system was messing up but the table to our right was clearing up and had new families sitting there to have dinner. Bad bad bad. Don't recommend Jennifer at all.
They close at 8pm not 9pm they place will close earlier sometimes too very sad. I don't know if they don't like kids but we got there at 7:30pm and they said they are closing so Togo orders only. I felt that it was because I had a baby with me sleeping.
Stay away from this place terrible food service and the draft beer is served warm. Portions are small with no flavor. Staff is clueless to customers. I'm disappointed because I live in the neighborhood and hoped for a good pub that was close by.
Aaliyah at the restaurant was super rude . Maybe bc it was myself and my sister - two girls - but she was short , rude, did not smile a bit . We were asking questions about the drinks and menu, and she blank stared us and didn't offer and information. We ordered drinks and water with our food . She never came back . We asked another waitress after 20 minutes . We finally got water and then our drinks . The food was ok- but the service by far made it to where I won't go back
This place deserves 0 stars. DO NOT EAT HERE! What a horrible experience my mom and I had last night. We ordered 3 taco combos for dinner. When we went to pick it up. They had given our order to another lady. They explained what had happened and said fresh tacos were being made right away. Which is 100% alright. Mistakes happen, understandable. UNTIL the women who got our order came back for her correct food. They gave her her order and proceeded to hand us the bag of cold taco combos this women had just returned... You gave a person our order. They went home, opened the food up. Noticed it was wrong. And returned it. What makes you think ANY person would want to pay and eat returned food. We got a refund and found dinner else where. I'm disgusted with the way this establishment handles business. I have a strong urge to report this to the Health Department.
I wish I could give 0 stars. Came back for happy hour again and this time the service was god awful! Someone sent me a "compliment" saying the pull their tips together bunny I'm a server and I know how that works but you'd think 3 servers and 2 hostesses would be able to get me water without having to wait 10 mins bf the another 20 before I ever see the server again. NEVER COMING BACK!
No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn't have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.
How unfortunate. I recently moved into the neighborhood and was pretty stoked that there were several food establishments on Coventry. A few weeks ago I had finished up at the gym that left me with a handsome appetite and ordered carry-out from Hunan Convetry - first and last time.  I ordered crab rangoons, shrimp with honey walnut, Kung Pao beef, and pork chow fun ... (I was a little *hungry* :-P). It was a carry out order, and they were promptly ready for pick-up. I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce. I don't think my palate is salt-biased, but this was the first time (in a long time) that I ADDED salt, among other things, to my shrimp and pork entrees. Chow fun ranks pretty high on my list of comfort foods - the broad doughy noodles full of flavor I expected were nothing more than tasteless oil-laden folds of pasta. I have my food issues, always cleaning my plate, always keeping leftovers, and never wasting (there are too many hungry people out there for me to be cavalier). Well, these two entrees ended up in the trash (did I mention I was STARVING when I ordered?). As for the beef, I tried my best to salvage my $$$ by re-purposing it the next day.I would have done better picking up a frozen entree by Ina Garten or Trader Joe's.
My husband and I came for a Valentines weekend and were rudely awakened by construction at around 6 AM. When we checked in we were not told about the construction otherwise we would've booked another tower at the same hotel, when I complained all they did was return my resort fee for my inconvenience. Beware if your planning to stay here any time soon
What a poorly run establishment. One of our entree's arrvied before the appetizer, I reminded the waitress 3 times that we were still waiting on an entree which still hadnt arrived after an hour and a half. I asked for the check, reviewed it and asked the waitress whether or not they felt they should do anything for us because the poor service. She took it to the owner who sent it back un changed with a different waitress. I let them know I would not be paying since i came to dinner expecting to get an entree and since I didnt get one that I would not be parying for dinner. I let them know that if they would  pay me for my time which was wasted and then I would pay for what I ate. They would not discuss. I walked out, they followed me to the parking lot and called the police. I would advise you to not waste your time with an establishment who clearly does not understand the service industry!
When I tell you somebody needs to come and in a hurry save this Benihana's!!!!!! The bad part about it they know the service sucks, food is mediocre, and the place needs a really good cleaning. I placed a order for sauce and rice and I have to say the sauce was HORRIBLE- COME ON..... That sauce have been around for years other places try but it was a staple at Benihana's you knew you were going to get aleast good sauce but not anymore. I'm sad because the one in Columbus is excellent...... Please get new owners that care, because we do!!!
Haven't been to pizza hut in a few yrs. My daughter and I wanted to try the bacon crust pizza one day a few wks ago so I ordered online  (ok that wasn't successful so I had to call) anyway I placed my order and 5 mins later they called and said they ran out of the bacon crust. This was at noon. Wasn't very happy. Needless to say I don't think I'll be attempting this again any time soon
The best way to describe the food at Nirvana II is that it tastes like disappointment.Located in the bottom of 3 Wells Fargo, there's a line out the door to this carry-out only restaurant most days. I love Indian food, so I've attempted lunch from this location twice. The second time was only after I suitably convinced myself the first meal wasn't as big of a disaster as I remembered. I was wrong.They don't serve authentic naan, you just get flimsy pita bread wedges. Their version of Chicken Tikka Masala is a gritty, brownish curry mixture that doesn't resemble a quality version of the dish in any way. The chicken may have bones, or it may not, it's really a surprise by the day.I've tried another dish -  chana masala from here, and it tasted the same. (Fortunately no bones!) Flavors are just muddy.Both times I've eaten here, I've tossed my lunch out half-eaten before finishing it. I don't understand why this restaurant is popular. How hard can it be to do Indian carryout right?
Bad Contact phone Number! Both on the Receipt and listed online,so no other way to contact this Store.They screwed up my order and we wound up throwing half of it away. I would have called the store to make them aware,but again Bad Phone Number.The number printed on their receipt sounds like an "Old School" Fax machine pinging away!It's 106* outside and I don't want to drive back down there in 5:00 Traffic.I hope the Owner/Manager actually reads this and updates their Contact info!
1 star for the lady in the front desk for being nice but the bar lady is horrible.. fire her if you want better customer service She legit tells you she has 50 types of beers and shes not gona name any of them yet she doesn't even give you a menu to read Worst service ever
I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).  The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.  The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations.The next day, we became violently ill.  With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.  My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  Such a shame!!
I have eaten middle eastern food all over Toronto. Came here for lunch and ordered a simple Swarma. While waiting out of curiously and was surprised at the low scoring reviews. Then my sandwich arrived and I realized my wife and I had different toppings (but I hadn't order any of my toppings). Not the end of the world and my sandwich was okay. My son didn't like the pickles or beets and picked his out. It is just odd that when u publish toppings on the menu you don't ask what people want. Next time I will go to a smaller family owned shop and make sure I decide what is on my sandwich. Service. Poor overall service unless you are an UBER eats driver as they take care of those guys.
Bearded bar staff sucks. Cant smile. New owners I think. Whole staff is about raking your money. The old faithful (large) crowd has left. The food sucks now. THEY USED TO COOK STEAKS ON A GRILL OUTSIDE. Surely losing money and soon to change owners. Go at your own risk.
If I could give a worse rating trust me I would. They have 10$ piercings and tattoos thought I'd go check it out . ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLY RUDE! I want to make sure the area and needles and equipment for a tattoo is clean and new ones used and when I asked questions the owner and all artists and an underage child working the front were incredibly rude and when I asked if I could speak to the artist they said it's a closed shop and you have to want a tattoo to go back and talk to the artist. They were insanely rude and to top it off the artist isn't worth your time. Please research your shops before you come here. Spend the money on a good tattoo, shop, and artist.
BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! I CAME HOME CRYING!  I HAD TO GIVE A STAR TO POST THIS REVIEW. THEY REALLY GOT NO STARS!!!!! I am giving this company a bad review due to the way they made me feel as a customer. I came in with my Mom and Sister for a little girls time to get a pedicure and our toenails painted. But due to my medical condition I opted out of getting the pedicure. Lin the manager told me to get out of the pedicure chair and that could no longer sit next to my family because I only got my toenails done even though there were no other customers and a bunch of empty chair. Then another worker tried to grabbing my stuff to get me to move. After that they told me to stand outside to have the sun dry my toenails even though it is a cloudy day with no sun. This company does not realize how you should treat a customer to get returning business. DO NOT GO TO THIS Margarita Nails & Spa unless you like to being treated like a piece of crap!
I'm assuming it was the owner but he got up in my face and confrontational when I asked about where rice was with my order. The particular dish I ordered I've never received without rice elsewhere. He then started throwing out tourist trap casino prices like $4 for a bottle of water in irrelevant comparrisions bull*hitting me. His resteraunt is an "away from the casino" option in a lower end strip mall. A Walgreen's sells his $4 bottle water claim for a buck and a small shop further down for 2 for $1. I get better food for less and with rice nicer areas and places back home with I'm pretty sure higher overhead. The food was actually decent but with all the add on hits and bad service you can do better. I obviously won't be going back.His Google review diverges greatly from yelp; peculiar and probably loaded.
If I could I would give this place zero stars. I have had the worst experience with this dentist. After making what could've been a one-day procedure last three months they still haven't finished my route canal.so now with a temporary filling I am being forced to find another dentist.PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And I would like to add the office staff was very rude multiple times. And the dentist seemed insincere distant and really not there.               BE CAREFUL!!!!!
My son had a appointment today at 3:30. Arrived at 3:15 had to wait until 4:30 to be seen. What a joke Will never go their again.
I was ok with  this gym until today. My wife had a terrible and dangerous experience that I'm surprised has not happened sooner. She had a tanning bed break and the lid of the bid fall down on the back of her head and it knocked her out. When she approached management after she regained consciousness they were not concerned and brushed her off. She had to make them come and look at the bed. Once they saw the bed they still didn't believe her until she showed them the welt on the back of her head. She could not see or walk straight they didn't even say sorry or offer her assistance. Very disappoint in their lack of concern for my wife. To top it off she has a bleeding disorder so this could have truly killed her. Both the other tanning beds were out of service and in disrepair.  I will being going down there personally to talk with the management  this is not ok. What else has not been maintained in the gym and what will break next and truly hurt someone.by the way I have never wrote a yelp review before but their poor customer service made me Let me add my name. This not an over reaction invade you were wondering anybody that knows me would say I under react to things.Thank you for reading Seth Johnson 4807106675
I rented a car for 3 days ($298.00 midsize vehicleI had to change flight due to mechanical error, airline ask me if I can go on the next flight. I called Advantage and told them that I was keeping the car for an extra day, the representative told it would cost me $194.00, it's in my contact.  They need to change the name "Taking Advantage"  I will never rent from them
Ahhhh the el cortez so much history so old school...what a complete dump. First off you have to walk off of Fremont to get there it was like walking down a hallway in a psych ward replete with urinating hobos,prostitutes having conversations with trees and dogs humping watermelons...I heard they have a 3/2 BJ single deck in here so I went in to check it out....the first thing you notice is that old stale smell..then the clientele which is right out of a homeless shelter field trip. So I walk around the tables to scope them out..not many people playing but a lot of dealers just standing there looking like Oliver waiting for some bread. Eureka I find what I'm looking for. I start to play..initial wager 40 dollars...won some lost some...I guess this is  more then they are accustomed to. Anyways now I'm rolling I'm up about 350 all of a sudden one of the floor supervisors comes over and says after this shuffle we are closing the game....haha hahaha. ..oh really and why is that? The other dealer called in sick..bhahahaha hahahaha how about one of the 10 other dealers picking their asses..they can't jump in? Oh no sir we are sorry..you know we want to keep th game open...i said I don't know anything of the sort..I got up and cashed out...in all the years I have gambled...I have NEVER seen that happen..suffice it to say I will not be returning here...if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen...
3 girls were working behind the counter where i was waiting to have my order taken.  1 was busy fulfilling an order, and the other 2 were having a nice time chit-chatting with each other.  After waiting for almost 5 minutes,  i left.
I work nearby this location and the food is amazing the only issues I have are, when I place a online order to be ready at a certain time it never is ready or they haven't even started it yet. I get "oops I just noticed it" a lot of the time. Anyone that knows this location knows that it's packed all the time and you have to wait in line 15 minutes or more. Another issue I have is that nobody greets you. I'll be standing there waiting to pay and I get employees looking at me but not saying anything for a few minutes, they don't even bother to tell the cashier that someone is ready to pay. Food is great but the service is horrible.
The service here is a crying shame.  The food isn't bad at all but the service is so bad you feel like you are being wilfully ignored. I have walked out before my drink order for the 2nd and final time never to return. No wonder it is always dead in the place.
Extremely disappointed in the service I've gotten my past two visits. Both times I've waited in a long drive thru line (the line moved moderately, but that's not the problem) but, when it was my turn to pull up to the microphone to order, no one said anything such as: "can I take your order?" or their usual catchphrases!  The first time this happened I waited about a minute and then said... "umm helllllooo" I was greeted with a "what do you want." Ummmmm excuse me???? First you're not going to ask what id like to order and then you're gonna get annoyed?The whole time I ordered the girl had a rude/ annoyed tone to her voice. The second time this happened was today and after 30 seconds of no one speaking I just started ordering. I mean come on people???? The crazy thing is both times I could hear them greet the person in front of me and behind me so why ignore me when I pull up? Rediculous! And this time they forgot the extra sauce I asked and paid for. Probably won't be coming back.
This explains my disappointment...If they are busy -service, quality, & everything falls apart...http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Kahunaville-278585471.html
By Far the worst Pharmacy in all of Las Vegas, pharmacist move SLOW think SLOW and work SLOW ! Always out of prescriptions can find prescription, not once or twice but EVERY SINGLE TIMEThis will be the last time i visit this place ever.AVOID THIS AND GO ANYWHERE ELSE
Loved it the first time but today was terrible. I had raved about this place and posted it on two different local FB pages saying how great it was. Today my sandwich was so skimpily made and the "Dutch crunch" bread that I have dreamt about since my first visit was not crunchy at all. The manager was only slightly apologetic and when I showed her the small bit of artichoke leaf and that the rest was lettuce she kept insisting it was all artichoke.She did say their baker has been baking inconsistently lately. I don't know why they would accept inferior product.She did have the kitchen staff remake the sandwich but it felt extremely uncomfortable.The second sandwich was tasty, but the overall experience was disappointing.
Shouldn't even get 1 star! I've never had such awful customer service and to top that it was by a Manager!!????  His name is John? Jonathan?? Hung up on my without saying goodbye after my order took 20 min past my quoted delivery. Pizza is cold, wings cold, salad warm. I asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said "find it online" ! I've been in the service industry for 16 years and understand things happen, but to not even give an apology or help with the issue is unacceptable! You John are of no significance to a company with the attitude you have. This location will not succeed with management like him. I will find the correct person to contact involving this matter with or without your help.
What a disappointment! Food was cold, flavorless and not as in the pictures! Our server was very dis focused we got different things then what we ordered, she wasn't that friendly... You can tell when some one doesn't like their job! Will not come back here. :( The only thing I like somewhat was the green chili.
I really had to make a yelp account just to tell this. This particular branch has a special spot with my sentiments as I went here alot, but tonight's shift served me uncooked chicken with my Bacon club toaster. I called and I really appreciated the manager taking the time to look up my order and have me make a new one. I guess I could understand that they were busy, but I try to figure out how the staff could've missed this. I'm sure whoever messed up was dealt with and I wish him the best.No receipt was given either.
Heard this was a good place for after ball game, or anytime for that matter.  prior to going to Cactus League game checked their website. They advertise daily happy hour  with $4 Margaritas + $3 well drinks, among other offers. My Margarita was $7 & well was $6. When I questioned this was told that during March no happy hour due to ball games as people still come in & that their website means nothing.Great location, poor help, poor service & FALSE advertising. Wont go back!
Drove 40 min to get my nails done every two weeks by Kevin because he is THE BEST! Well, today i went and Kevin is no longer there. Not worth the money anymore. Pedicures suck. If someone finds out where Kevin went, please let me know!
Today myself my Mother and my fiance decided to visit Pho 35 for the first time. We were glad to see a Pho house so close to home. The place was busy. I ordered the number 9. It was OK had a very rich almost Curry flavor. Both my Mother and Fiance ordered Spring rolls. They seemed semi fresh the Rice paper had already begun to harden. My mother had already eaten one order and on the last bite or so on the second order a FLY spilled out from the tightly wrapped roll. I can not believe it. I am flat disgusted. I am a F&B Manager and take pride in my work for this to happen already and this place barley open speaks volumes about there Food Prep. I will never eat there again and will actively encourage my friends never to attempt such a place. Note that once we notified the server he disappeared to the back. Several minutes passed before he emerged. He said nothing to us so we just walked out. Poor service altogether!
Of all the places I had eaten at while visiting Toronto for work, it was probably by far the least enjoyable. Slow service, mediocre westernized fast comfort food. They try to be healthy and service salmon salad and sides, however it took over 20 minutes for the waitress to get back to us saying they don't have any salmon. Meal was disappointing to say the least. If I could give a 1/2 star I'd do it
Very disappointing. All I asked was for my new growth to be crocheted it into my lock, instead he started a million baby dreads of new growth. Didn't take anything I said I wanted done into consideration. I mentioned before starting I've never used interlocking. I have been told my whole life it's not how you loc MY kind of hair. He told me he could do multicultural hair. Long story short very disappointing,  I spent $280 for literally nothing everything that he crocheted or interlocked slipped out the next day and now I have to spend another $300 to go back and crochet my roots where he interlocked because there's a hole in my dread. On top of everything hair aside the first subject he brings up as religion which is a big no-no. I said let's agree to disagree I don't to talk about religion I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong and I got a Bible thrown in my lap.  Very unprofessional if you do hair than you need to do hair and you need to take the customers opinion and their needs in the consideration.
For real, I didn't expect much but when you short me food when I'm hungry don't expect more than a 1 star. Good luck trying to get any employee here to actually care about getting your order out quick or correct.
Do not waste your hard earned money here, there are several other country bars around, go to them!My husband and I's 2nd trip here this past Friday has me determined never to return as well as to spread the word of how horrible the service, food and management was! We waited over 15 minutes to be served, my order was not only wrong but RAW! The management staff was so ignorant to comment that I'll be fine as people consume raw fish all the time. The gal serving asked if we needed a to go box as my husband pointed at both I nodded and she removed my plate and threw it away! This was a FULL plate of food, I had probably 3 bites no joke. She then insisted ONLY my husband asked for a to-go box although he pointed and I nodded. Not only that, but our tab, HA! Nothing done, no offer for dessert either. This was the 2nd trip - both a waste of time and money. So disappointed in the brand altogether. Stay away! I know others who have gotten sick too!
Dinning at the Red Room is an experience I hope to never repeat.Three of us arrived slightly later than our party, and right off the bat we were told that separate bills were not possible. He came back five minutes later to remind us again that we could NOT have separate bills (we hadn't even asked for them). Its a cash only, which is fine, but in this modern day and age, options are always appreciated. The food was awful. A lot of the food is very clearly brought in already-made, and then fried. They have a very large, very mismatched menu. We saw dishes from Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, German and numerous other cultures. I ordered Edamame (over boiled and under salted) and Shrimp Spring Rolls to snack on. One of my shrimp rolls did not have anything in it. It was a hollow, deep friend, roll. My party ordered a variety of different plates, no one was thrilled. The waiter seemed to be the only server in the entire restaurant, so I appreciate that he was busy, and might not have been having the best day of his life, so we'll assume the best there.  And yes....the bathrooms are gross.
Just renovated my butt. New paint and wall paper done by the cheapest bidder. Hair on the bathroom floor. Crappy service. Can't believe these guys charge a resort fee on top of hotel stay. No coffee maker. No mini fridge not even a microwave. Only thing good about this hotel is there location in front of Fremont Street. Place needs to be demolished and built from the ground up.
Had a reservation.  Got dropped off and they had no cars. No attempt to help just we have no cars and we are closing soon. I am serious. No attempt to find me another location or offer me a cab to the airport where they are open 24 hours, just nothing!  Walked 5 miles to the airport in south Phoenix at night.   Just terrible.
We didn't order the sushi because my wife is pregnant. I ordered the Nabe Udon which had all the ingredients and was served boiling hot, but it was too salty to eat. Even the noodles got brown from the amount of soy sause they put in it. The Don Kasu dinner was crispy but the batter didn't stick to the meat. The server said she would tell the manager who never came by, but we did get some dirty looks from the workers and nothing was said or done for us. Don't order udon or donkasu if you know what those dishes are suppose to taste like.
Don't have to come back here. Sushi was terrible. Supposedly tuna??? Nothing but mush! Not sure what they mixed it with?!
Do not go here! I went here with my sister to look for engagement rings for my now fiancé. I walked in and was met by 2 older ladies who seemed bothered by my presence to begin with. I was beaming with excitement because I was going to be making a HUGE decision in my life and also throwing down a huge chunk of my hard earned money. The ladies ( both sporting rings on all fingers) asked what I was looking for and showed me some outrageously priced rings. They asked my budget to which I gave them my reply (I worked my ass off for the money I had and I was convinced that it was a very generous amount) ...THEY BOTH LAUGHED...One said " If that's the kind of diamond you want you'll have to have bring more money than that."I was very embarrassed.  They wanted me to open up a line of credit for the diamond alone. They then realized I wasn't buying a $10,000 ring and lost interest in me so I left. Gentlemen, GO TO THE SHANE COMPANY! They asked my budget and made me feel like a king, everybody is so nice. I left there designing a beautiful ring (which I still brag about) and all just under my budget.Don't waste your time like I did! Off Scottsdale road and acoma, one mile south of bell road!
Some of the worst Asian food I have ever had. Took one bite and sent the food back.  Was offered a replacement meal but it was so bland that I didn't want anything. Chicken didn't taste like chicken. Had a very chewy texture. Ming Fu in waxhaw is much better and half the price. Overpriced food. Service sucks.
I  have been there before and wanted to make a reservation for 11people for a graduation party, the owner calls me back to tell me he will CHARGE 250$ deposit!! What if our bill is 200$? People are paying for their bills so why charge me??? its not a party of 100! it is sooo ridiculous!! Even high end restaurants do not ask for this stupidity!!! DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!
Still yucky.  picked up an order which should have been hot, hard as a rock like cardboard and burnt on the bottom.  There are many other places in town for good pizza avoid this and you will be more than happy.  Hit and Miss place, mostly Miss
The one-star rating is based solely on our recent visit for happy hour.  Previous visits merited satisfied customers, including my friend's fiancee who is notoriously hard to please (he's not so much picky as a perfectionist with high expectations for quality food).When deciding where to go for our February Girls Night, after considering other favorites, we settled on BLT, as it had been a few months since we enjoyed their happy hour.  Apparently, in those few months, their quality has declined.Due to a current medical condition, I ordered Pellegrino sparkling water.  My friend ordered iced tea, out of solidarity.  Boring I know, but it's not like we only got plain old tap.  We ordered, sharing their fantastic popovers (which were still pretty darn good, despite the rest of the evening's shortcomings), the fried calamari and a burger.  We were served the popovers and before we took a second bite, there was a runner hovering, wanting to deliver our calamari and burger.  Really?  Rushing us out the door?  Despite it being tourist season, neither the bar nor restaurant were at all busy.  Someone screwed up by not pacing our order to come out at varied times.In a nod to my current condition, I'd been cautioned to avoid undercooked meat.  Normally I am a big fan of rare to medium rare beef, especially in a place supposedly known for quality products.  I just can't bring myself to order well done, so we compromised, requesting the burger medium.  I figured that would be safe enough.  We continued to enjoy the popovers and the calamari.  The calamari was good, and I enjoyed the green herbal/garlic aioli sauce on the side.  When we finally cut the burger, it was rare plus at best, a far cry from the medium ordered.  Despite the cute little plastic tag sticking out of the bun suggesting the kitchen had heeded our request, they clearly had not.Our waitress stopped by to check on us and we pointed out the error with our burger.  I explained to her that normally we love the cow practically still mooing, but due to my current status, I need to avoid rare beef.  She offered to have the kitchen correct their mistake.  A few moments later, the food runner brought a burger back to us.  The original burger is served uncut.  This one was cut in half.  At first we thought it was a bit suspicious, but maybe the kitchen cut it to make sure they cooked this one correctly, or perhaps they cut it as they knew we were sharing.  We each took a bite and were sorely disappointed to realize we received our original burger, not a freshly made one cooked to our desired doneness.  The kitchen just took our original burger (which sat at room temperature for at least 25 minutes while we ate our other food), slapped it back on the grill until it was charred on the outside, and put it back on the bun.  It was still rare inside.  This is the kind of thing I would expect from Ruby Tuesday, not Laurent Tourondel's namesake.  Upon closer  inspection, the slice of bacon was even sticking out of the bun at the same angle as the original.  We debated ordering something else, and decided to try dessert instead.  After waiting and waiting for our waitress to return, we just wanted to get out of there and satisfy our sweet tooth elsewhere.  The waitress finally appeared and asked if she could clear the plates.  I wasn't really going to make a big deal of the uneaten burger, but when she didn't even ask  why we hadn't eaten it, I had had enough.  I graciously informed her that we were done with the burger as it was quite obvious the kitchen didn't make us a new one, only re-fired our incorrectly cooked first burger.  She stated she would remove the burger from our check, which we appreciated.  We asked for the check, which we received fairly promptly.Waiting another 20 minutes for our waitress to return and collect the folio with a card sticking out of the top, we finally decided to just leave cash and get out of there.It was most definitely a disappointing experience.  When I relayed the events to my husband, he suggested we might give them one more try.  I will have to think about that, considering there are so many other places that have never disappointed me.
A friend went and told me that he enjoyed it. He's been a few times. Finally went in for breakfast with the better half. Atmosphere was great liked the decor, service was good, but we came here to eat. I got corned beef hash with eggs and a side of bacon. She got a omelette. We both got the biscuits and gravy. Only good thing I could say was the bacon was good. Hash was just full of potatoes. Biscuits and gravy were bland. My eggs were undercooked and runny. When I took a bite I had to spit it out I was afraid I was gonna throw up all over my plate. Home fries where just deep fried crispy crap. The better half usually doesn't complain about anything and she found the food to be not good at all and left probably 3/4 of her meal I left about 1/2 of mine. Waitress asked how it was I said just look at our plates we're leaving hungry!
We just went there for lunch, normally they are great. Today it wasn't too busy but we sat and waited for our server.... and waited.... and waited... just gave up and left. Ridiculous. If you don't want business fine we'll gladly start going elsewhere.
Stayed here on 12/29/2015. First off, the parking situation was really bad. We had to park in the far end parking lot which is about a 1/4 mile from the hotel lobby. Second, they put us in the wrong room, so we complained and they reluctantly switched us to a non-smoking room. They acted like they were doing us a favor for the switch. Third, we were woken up twice in the morning, once at 8:00AM and again at 10:50AM by guests who were incorrectly  booked in our room!! Fourth, upon leaving the elevators were not working - we had to haul our luggage down 22 flights of stairs to finally exit onto the 1st floor roof only to be greeted by an unfriendly security guard that told us we needed to have more patience with the elevators. After dealing with the rude employee we preceded  to exit the first floor roof down a flight of stairs. Keep in mind, we had no idea where we were going - us and other guest thought we'd end up stuck on the roof. Wow, this was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We complained to management, and in return they graciously paid our resort fee of $30.00 LOL.
I would never go back to this restaurant. when its about brar one thinks of good food, good ambience, and variety. i have been to all three brar restaurants in the gta. this one in mississauga is way below average. the food was average, very little variety, pathetic lay out, disgusting ambience, and poor poor service. i will never go back to this brar location again. the best brar restaurant is  the one in brampton..
Went to a friends birthday dinner at this restaurant. It's a beautiful place but the service was poor. We arrived 8:30pm on a Wednesday, so it wasn't very busy. After we placed our order, it took 45 mins to get our meals, by that time we were very hungry and he didn't even offer us bread at the table, but everyone else was being served. Our waiter spoke little to no English, and I feel like the language barrier was a part of the issue. All he kept saying we "it's good, it's good."Some of us got our dinner, and when my friend asked what kind of meat was on her plate it, he said it was horse meat. I'd suggest no one eat here, it's not worth the money and the service sucks.
I wouldn't recommend this hotel to a homeless person. The staff is incredibly rude and lazy. Did not feel very welcoming. The check in line was around the corner and actually has a sign that says check out instead of check in. Other ppl like myself stood in a line that next to it that said ace check in which apparently was the wrong line. Please switch the signs if you don't want your customers confused. Was told I'd be charged for a specific resort fee when indeed I was charged an extra $8 every day from the original total. Didn't receive any type of paperwork indicating what time check out was so they refunded me only half of my $61.48 resort fee. Asked the manager working 8-24-16 if he could please refund the difference because I did not receive awake up courtesy call and the staff failed to provide any information besides how much everything was. The manager was very rude!!! Couldn't believe the type of service I was receiving. Just another way to make money. I'll GLADLY give my money elsewhere. The hotel room was terrible as well. No microwave or coffee maker. The bathroom was so small it would be hard for an ant to fully turn around in. All the money they scheme and take from others you would think their pool would be bigger but it's actually the size of a puddle plus it looked unclean. You can't even enjoy the smelly casino that smells that toilet water because you have their time share contract workers harassing you constantly and daily. Don't even bother asking the lazy, non working, incompetent employees for help. They are not friendly or approachable. I'm still very upset and annoyed how they took my money because of checking out "late" When no where in the hotel or the employees bothered to tell me. But of course they pretty much told me it was my fault. Their customer service skills are non existence. I left downstairs to grab a bite to eat and when I came back upstairs my room was "clean" by housekeeping. I strongly believe housekeeping stole several items from me. Had to start using the safe and putting the do not disturb sign on my door. Expressed my concerns to management and of course they seemed uninterested. The staff as a whole are all completely USELESS. Their restrooms are filthy. I will NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. And if anyone ask about this hotel I will refer them somewhere else! You guys will never ever get a penny from me, my friends, family, or other ppl who ask me about this hotel. Extremely rude, uneducated, lazy staff. Get under new management!
BEWARE!!!!!Was lied to regarding the repairs I needed for my Chevy sonic... they also tried to give false information to my father regarding his vehicle... since the location is convenient for me, I just got an oil change there, and overheard them try to swindle a lady who had just moved here....... I warned her about the dishonest business and I also confronted them about their lies... needless to say, they were very defensive and had no way of refuting the facts, when I described what a legitimate dealership had to say about their practice.
It should be noted that this is now called Black Sheep Bar and Grill. As soon as we sat down and got a curt reply when asking about the beer menu (that was posted on the wall on the other side of the restaurant) we knew this was going to be an interesting experience. We placed our order, including appetizers. After our order was taken that was the last time we saw a waitress or anyone checked on us for 40 minutes. We did not see her again until she noticed us being increasingly annoyed with the neglect we were receiving. Empty drinks, no appetizers, forgotten customers. Once she came back we mentioned the appetizer that we have yet to receive and she did apologize that the wings were taking so long. Our fries came out cold and with all the cheese solidified. It was 50 minutes before we received our food. Still with no drink refills. The wings were hot and the sauces were delicious. The sweet and spicy BBQ was excellent. The service was slow and terrible. I would recommended getting take out and avoid spending anytime in there unless you got all night.
Bought the detail package for over $100. My car came back dirty on the interior and a nice little scratch on my window. When I asked to speak to the manager, he said there's no way I can prove they did it. Took my "indecent report" and never called me back...
No communication, no respect for contract deadlines, they don't answer phone calls after 5 o clock. Their team was awful and completely destroyed our home buying process. One of the worst customer service models I have ever seen. A complete lack of respect to the home buying process.
Twenty five minutes passed and I am not even half the way through the line. Only 2 clerks checking people in with a line of more than 12 people waiting! It would have been worth shedding an extra $100 to get a car from Hertz, Alamo, National or enterprise!
Let me just begin with I have never been treated so rudely before and I have used plenty of Groupons. I arrived for my 4pm massage to only be told I don't have an appointment for you. I then told the lady I made it with you " distinct accent" only fir her to ask my my name and then say I don't have a video camera on my phone . I don't have repeated my name or (and then said three other names ) so you can reschedule or cancel your groupon. How rude Avoid this place NOONE VALUES YOUR TIME
While the techs do an amazing job on nails, the customer service drastically declined.  I went from being a long time customer who made appointments and was able to have those honored. To being treated like a walk-in.  When appointment was scheduled, the tech would begin a new person 5 minutes before I arrived and I would then be waiting for 30 mins.
Onions onions onions. Ordered a lengua burrito and it was filled with onions. Also ordered shredded beef nachos and there was no meat only onions . Very disappointed.
requested for fridge for kid's milk as soon as we checked in at 3:30 on a thursday with a not very full registration desk...waited for an hr and when we followed up they said we don't have to be in room for them to bring it....ok so we left for 2 hrs. and upon returning to our room at 7 pm still no fridge... followed up at 8 pm and front desk says " they set it up and delivered it"... i say well it's not here obviously that's why I am calling....and waited another 1.5 hrs no fridge...housekeeping dept asks "were you gone from your room?" I said yes but they told us we could leave and they would still bring it... she says"well sometimes they don't" ok so lady be consistent with your rules and don't tell us we have to be here waiting for someone.... finally it arrives 10:15.... wow I guess you can't enjoy and be stuck in room just for a fridge....hopefully tom will be better service!
If you need an internet connection, find another hotel because this wifi is non existent!
Really rude and non Indian people.....I have never had such a bad experience with any restaurant let alone Indian.....god bless them. I would be interested in seeing how long they can stay in business with this attitude.
Had the chicken and waffles. Price-wise, definitely not worth the high price of $19. You get one piece of chicken, and its a small thigh. On top of that, chicken was undercooked. Basically pink inside and the skin under the batter was still very raw and gooey. Kind of disgusting. There was close to no syrup as well. The eggs benny was another disappointment. You'd expect a nice runny poached egg but these yolks were hard. It seemed like the chef didn't put much effort into the cooking.
First of all, I come here with my family and walk into a crowd of people in line.. There was an older lady, Im guessing the "owner" that came to help us,I got 1 kids scoop and 2 regular scoops of Ice cream.. I was getting ready to pay when the lady handed me my last scoop of ice cream saying "Have a great day".. too me I thought that these scoops of ice cream were on the house being as the bigger group before me was still in front of the cashier paying.. I said "are you sure?" to the lady when she replied, "Have a good day" In my head I was thinking.. wow what a kind lady to give us free ice cream.. then I walked away and sat down with my family.. I told my husband this and he said he would leave some tip just because he wanted to be nice.. As we walk out and my husband places the tip in the tip jar, the lady said to me.. "oh I still need to ring you up, right?" I was in shock... on top of that I felt so humiliated, thinking that these scoops of ice cream were on the house... She asked me if the tip my husband left in the jar was the money we were going to use to pay for the ice cream.. I told her no, he wanted to leave tip.. She was gonna ring me up with two kids scoops and a regular scoop.. I corrected her saying two regular scoops and a kids scoop and paid my $9 bill.. I am not the type of person to run out on my bill and I was more than happy to pay in the beginning.. She confused me soo much on top of making me feel like a complete idiot.. maybe I missed her saying to pay later on top of the loud crowd, but I was humiliated... Horrible customer service... She also gave me "expired" coupons, telling me it would still be valid.. which if I ever go in here and get humiliated again by having expired coupons.. I don't know what I would do... Needless to say.. I am never going to this baskin robbins again after the customer service that left me feeling horrible!!
Pizza came out cold. We ordered the classic pepperoni and there were probably three slices of pepperoni in the entire pizza. It was just all sauce and cheese.
Very bad experience from check-in.We were in rush for cirque show. First they block parking from the Main Street, going all the way around took 15 minutes. Then self-parking is another long story. Then check-in machine says our room is not ready at 8.30pm!!! Kinda walk around and wait email. We were in rush. I went to concierge, fortunately she was still working, so she helped. But what if we'd come 15 minutes later? Then we'll be without the room at 9pm!!! And couldn't change and go for the show.Room itself is a disappointment. No fridge!!! No coffee machine! Not even saying microwave. Not all the light works.Attention: they charge to use WiFi! In 2018.Pool:we came to the pool with 60y.o. mom. They asked our IDs. My mom didn't have any with her.There are no signs anywhere that seniors need to bring ID to get into the pool. Stupid! Not welcoming.Very very very bad experience. I should have read yelp reviews before booking, not only booking.com
I work in a body shop and this was the first time I had ever used them , simply because a client had her car towed in here and wanted to get it out. I really wish I could give them zero stars. Girls in the front desk were extremely rude. Also went ahead and spoke with them through the phone and they did not want to explain anything I asked. Very unprofessional and seems like they never went to school. Also no customer service skills. Not helpful and when I went over I asked what a tow order was because no other tow company had ever asked for one, and all they said was " You should know what it is". I am obviously asking because I don't know! While I was there the lady in front with the most disgusting attitude said " Is that all you need? You only have 5 min to be in here." WHAT? Wish they would be more helpful and had better manners. If you have no manners or aren't friendly at all then go work in the middle of no where, were you don't have to communicate with customers.
This one star is for the car wash attendant. She was nice! A bit salesy but still nice. I just went through this car wash for the first time, and it rubbed  a section of my car's paint/finish off! I honestly am a bit shocked because I've gone through many car washes and never had anything like this occur. Why is the car wash so rough?! It doesn't even make any sense, it rubbed off the paint on one part of my car but left bird poop on the other side. We will be contacting the owners of this business tomorrow since it closes soon. For now, Yelpers, beware! I would not recommend you go anywhere that will damage your car.
Terrible customer service!! I called ahead of time to make sure there was a seat available. I walk in there's two ppl working. The guy working in the front chair asked "what you want done?". I said a full set. Both workers are still working on someone else. I wait patiently in the chair, minutes go by they're done doing nails. I asked "who was going to do mine?." The lady said she was going home. The guy told me he couldn't do mine bc he had another customer. So I asked how long, he said he couldn't do mine bc they're closing after. Mind you it's only 5:30pm they close at 7pm. The customer never shows up, so now it's 5:55 he says I need to get out bc they're closing the store. Worse experienced ever!!!! Never again.
I have been to this location multiple times and although there front staff is friendly the wait times are between 45 to 120 minutes with an appointment.   It is unacceptable to expect patients to wait around this long. I would recommend going anywhere else for your imaging.
I'm puzzled by all the good reviews of this restaurant. Has nobody in Las Vegas ever had well-prepared Korean food? I was appalled by the meal I was served this evening. It was a graceless, ill-seasoned, flavorless mess. It was as if someone had decided to prepare a "Korean meal" at home, threw  "Asian sauces" on a few vegetables, made a salad, put chunks of cheap raw meat on a board, and served it up with a big hopeful smile.  I was able to eat the oysters, and there was some tofu thing that wasn't awful, but the rest of it was either offensively nondescript or downright repulsive. Has this place never heard of doenjang?The surprise hard boiled egg hidden in the salad gave me sufficient energy to get back to my hotel. Otherwise, that was a rather expensive non-meal.To be clear: this isn't Korean food. This is crudités and cheap raw meat. You could do it at home for $5.
Just left had such a horrible experience here, as im trying on some pants i needed for work my son is playing with a soccer ball outside of the fitting room halls, the security a younger guy comes with such a horrible and rude attitude and says you better take that ball away before i take it from him, like wtf how the hell you talk to someones kid in that voice, and with. that attuide, we were gonna purchase those pants and that soccer ball, so whats the problem that my kid wants to play with it while im trying some pants, ok well stay with your ball and pants, i dont see why a security would think its ok to talk to kids like that, theres ways of saying stuff but not the way he did! such a horrible person. So lucky I couldn't punch his face!
No impressed at all with the food taste, but it is not that bad. I had a take out of kabobs with salad and bread.The bad rating is for the Huge Bug that was in my salad... and I mean huge!!!
Terrible service here!!!  Had a coupon for st Pattys day and the employees treated me like they'd rather I not be there.  My bagel was handed to me by one of the food prep workers and he had a very upset expression.  Very unpleasant.  I know he is capable of smiling since he was laughing and joking with the other employees. Bagels are good there are other einstens with better service.  Also ordered a coffee but the employee didn't help me with making a choice just expected me to figure out the menu on the board but it is large and requires you to walk around to see them.  Smear cream cheese choices is on a table flag which is hard to notice.  Very difficult to make a choice here unless you already know what you want.  Don't go to this location in particular!!!
All I got to say that I went there for an estimate Told them not to do any work on the vehicle just the estimate and they did the work anyway with no written or verbal consent from me. I was lied by the Service Manager Noel and even threatened over the phone by the tool of a GM they have. Oh and I have the whole conversation recored to prove what an unprofessional business they run. DO NOT EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS DEALER.
Very disappointed in this company. They called and told me they would be there between 7am and 1pm. When it was 1:30pm I called them to see where they were and they said they told me 1pm-7pm was the window. Which was not true, but fine. They're employee showed up at 4pm and took one look at my water heater and said, "Oh. It's a Kenmore. We don't work on Kenmore's." NOW WOULDN'T THAT BE A QUESTION THEY SHOULD'VE ASKED BEFORE THEY SENT SOMEONE? Of course, one could argue I could've also asked that... but my job isn't to repair water heaters. And my business isn't specializing in plumbing, heating and HVAC and appliances and repairs as they say theirs is. I would not recommend this company, and further more if my home owners insurance requests them again, I will ask for another company.
I'd give this a 1/2 star above the Rusty Dory if it were possible, but it's not, and Jackman Inn has done little to deserve it.  Smoky to the point of suffocation, old men wearing too much cologne, and a DJ who seems to only play the bottom half Hot 100 Billboard hits are a sample of the highlights.  It's far enough out of the way that you're unlikely to see too many new faces from week to week.  For what it is--a neighborhood bar to get local yinzers drunk--I guess it works.  Best beer on tap is Yuengling.
I had an awful experience at RRBC and I will never return again. Unfortunately, this was one of my favorite places to go, they have great food and beer. Yesterday I was there on a Sunday afternoon. The CAVS were about to play and I was excited about Kyrie returning. I asked the bartender if they could switch one of the TV's to show the CAVS games. All the TV's were displaying football games. The bartender went back and asked her manager for permission to change the channel. She got the ok, so I decided to stay and ordered food and a beer. Not to long after, a few gentlemen were upset that the TV's were switched to the CAVS game. They are all wanted to watch the Browns game, which had not even started yet. The owner came out yelling asking who wanted to watch the CAVS and seemed very upset. I felt extremely uncomfortable. My friend and I were not the only people who requested to watch the CAVS game. If it was a problem, I would have just left to another bar with no problem. They made us feel terrible. To top it off, the gentleman next to me was practically screaming in my ear and was in my person space. He then asked if I could move down a seat so a buddy of his could sit with him, and I told him no because the only TV displaying the CAVS games was in front of me and I did not want to move and not be able to see the game. I was there first and should not have to move. As soon as I said no the man got upset and was very rude to me. Starting talking bad about me to his friends and called me names. It was just unacceptable. After all that the owner and the older men at the bar kept talking crap about us wanting to watch the CAVS vs the Browns. Last time I checked the CAVS is a winning team and the Browns are not. I love Cleveland sports and if there was not a CAVS game on, I would have been happy to watch the Browns game. As I sat there trying to enjoy my meal, I felt horrible and uncomfortable. I even lost my appetite. Like I said this is a great place, but unfortunately, I will no longer give them my business. It may not be much money they lose, but I hope other people read this and decide not to go as well. I feel as though the owner should not have treated us that way. You are there to run a business and make your customers happy, not make them feel like crap. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that I am a woman, who knows. Again, I will never ever return to this place again.
Stick with Popeye's. I ordered fried okras and the quality was not that great. I thought I was chewing on gum. The chicken had tons of fatty parts.
Go to another Louboutin store. The sales lady here is very judgemental and I honestly never received such horrible service. I'm used to sales reps from CL to be super helpful, courteous and patient. I mean I'm about to spend a couple thousand dollars. I know I walked in with a jersey and some jeans, but never judge a book by its cover. Wish I got her name that way I can put it here, but she isn't worth my time. I went to Crystals to buy me shoes. Go there! The sales ladies are much much nicer!!
I have to give this business a bad review because of safety. The netting was horribly maintained so therefore there were many holes. I was not playing and I was shot in the shoulder. The paintball missed my 4 year sons face buy a few inches. Also the employees did not enforce the barrel plug rule consistently. There where many children running around in a unsafe environment. I hope they resolve these issues soon.
The worst service I have ever had in my life. You need different servers that actually care about your customers. I will not ever be coming back to this bar.
Terrible doesn't begin to describe it. We were on the VIP list, but were forced to wait in the general admission/regular list line. They refused to even check their list to see if we were on it when we first got there. After waiting an hour to get in while they let countless numbers of locals in without considering the people in line, we finally got in. We were both supposed to have free admission, and I was supposed to have free drinks until 12:30, but when we got to the cashier, she said the men's VIP list was full, even though my date had been put on it in advance, and that they weren't doing free drinks that night, even though I had been told by our promoter on the phone that they were. Needless to say, we were idiots and paid the $40 for him to get in. Once in, the bar was so crowded we couldn't find it, there was no actual dance floor, just people milling around, and the majority of the tables were empty, even though when we asked if we could get one while we were in line, they said they were booked. WTF. I would suggest NEVER bothering to go here. They were rude, and the club sucked.
The manager would not even show him self. Do not eat there the steak is hard and over priced.
Ordered two sandwiches for delivery at 8:30pm. The gentleman on the phone told me one hour.  After 1.5 hrs I called and the person told me it was out for delivery along with 7 other deliveries and it should be there soon.  Two hours later...still waiting.
Be warned! We stopped here today from out of town for a quick restroom break and refresh on sodas. The restroom break included a brief walk on her leash for our 11.2 lb 14 yr old dog, who is well behaved well groomed and current on her vaccinations. I took her to the front of the restaurant under some trees into the grass and mulch. I was quickly called over by a employee and told, "this isn't a dog park I couldn't walk her in front of the restaurant. The park is around the corner." I explained the purpose of our stop and that I was well prepared to cleanup after my dog, biodegradable pooh bags attached to leash ready to go when needed! He didn't care and restated the location of the park. 1) if this location has a zero pet policy on their property- then post it.2) In almost 16 yrs of traveling with a dog across thousands of miles, I've never had such a encounter.
The worst haircut I have ever received. I asked her to layer my hair, the layers are uneven and there is a huge chunk missing on the right side. Very disappointed. Will not be back.
Tried to eat here today, wife's food took 30 mins ( for chicken goujons!!!!!) mine still hasn't arrived after another 15 mins so we called for check , lady with tattoos on right arm should be thought restaurant skills, manager owner? With Irish tattoo on chest should learn how to manageShocking and drove me to a negative review when I would normally just say nothing
The food was ok.The place is meh. Pricy and not maintained well - uneven tables, holes in walls etc. The VIP room has no room to move around - definitely no VIP experience.    Electrical outlet  chipped / dangerous looking.   Hot, fan tower barely helped.The service was horrible - we waited forever, mixed up orders, drinks took forever (I.e. Pitcher of beer on tap took 28 minutes).  Shared our experiences with staff - didn't even get a sorry, more like "oh ok, so you aren't having a good experience". Too bad because if well executed the concept has potential.
Gave this place a second try but no good. Pastas are dry and bland. Chicken Parm didn't have any cheese. Chicken Marsala seemed to be made with cream of mushroom. Food quality is not great.
Ordered the medium sushi platter for take out.  Sashimi was fresh and high quality but the rice was extremely tough, as if it wasn't fully cooked. If the rice was not rock hard I would give 4 stars for this place.
Service department was horrible. The service advisor performed the intake and tries selling me on getting new times from him. Bragged that he could match or beat any other tire shop in town even if it's by a few dollars! He then said except for Costco because they "don't sell real tires". I said what the heck does that mean? He said the tires Costco sells aren't the same even though they look like the tire everyone else sells. Told him he needs to stop telling that story because he's making himself look bad. He then says he will keep in touch with me throughout the day and keep me informed of their progress. At 4:45 I call and leave him a message! He finally calls back and says it's ready. Not even an apology for not keeping me informed or taking 9 hours for what was supposed to be 4-6. I get there and he doesn't go over any of the paperwork and when I ask him where the quote is for the break job he blames the tech forgot to add it to the paperwork. Tells me he will call me the next day with a price... still no call. Won't be going back!
they sent you coupons to lure you in, then they purposely find other thing wrong with your car and charge you big price, if you use your credit card and find out they did ugly work on your car, you should dispute with your credit card company, that's what credit card company are there for, don't just let them have it, and if they ever suggest you do have any work done there, just say no, 99% chances are they are lying to you.  They won't let you stand by your car and watch what they are doing either, so they can tear up your car all they want, please do not come here.
I have been here numerous times and each time it's gotten worse than the last. Yesterday was the final straw. The service has always been perfect, never a complaint however, the entire place smells like a nursing home. Urine soaked diapers to be exact. Never again.
I ordered the half chicken salad sandwhich and noodle soup. The chicken sandwhich was tastless. Bread was dry & the soup taste canned. Over priced for the portions, the service & quality of food. I will not return.
Service was was not good at all, the waitress took forever to have our order placed. the other people who sat around us (who were seated after) all got their orders in before me and my date, the waiter never checked on us and the food was terrible, especially the hash browns... Will not be going again.
We been to this restaurant on Sunday . We ordered gobi Manchuria as appetizer which was so salty that we couldn't eat and for main course we ordered malia kofta which had no salt in it then panner butter masala was very sweet and not authentic at all. There was no one to even come and ask how the food is. Worst customer service. People who have babies be aware there is No CHANGING TABLE IN RESTROOM I had to put my baby down on floor to change diaper. We will not be going to this restaurant and I do not recommend this place to anyone.
The food was actually great, but one star for the horrendous service. I can't speak for all of the servers, but don't come here if you're looking for a good dining experience. Our service was awful.  My boyfriend and I ordered the sirloin with the soup, salad, and dessert ($32 combo). The server never introduced herself, never tried to have a conversation with us, never explained anything on the menu nor the concept, nor once tried to treat us like we were anything other than just another check.When we ordered, we made one single substitution to the combo: we swapped out the profiteroles for creme caramel (a $0.50 difference). That fifty cent substitution came back as a fifteen dollar increase on our bill. The waitress then decided that was the appropriate time to explain they have a no substitution policy, so she "had to" ring up each item in the combo individually. Midway through the conversation with my boyfriend, she tossed the receipt at him, walked 10 feet away, and turned her back to us until we paid. Unbelievable. Once we paid the ridiculously inflated bill and tipped, she proceeded to start an unsolicited argument with us about how the charges were justified.Anyway, they have one single item on the menu: the steak. It's excellent.
Lots of promises from salesman, unfortunately none came to fruition.  Our new wi Dow and door project was scheduled to be finished in 3 days.  We have called over 10 times, only to get an answering machine.  They have our 50% down payment, so they seem happy.  I found the numbers of the new owners (Al 480-495-5513 and Dan 707-655-1000).  Called Dan and finally got some action.  (After threats to call in the BBB, Registar of Contractors and the Arizona Attorney General.)They promised to stop by today to measure (per our contract this was to be done 3 weeks ago), we will see what happens.  To be continued......
We live in Peters and were hoping to find a local spot that we could count on for a late bite to eat. We liked the atmosphere and the fact that we could be casual and watch sports. However after trying the McMurray Sharp Edge we will never go back. The service is so horrible it is beyond description. We were brought flat pop twice even after we sent it back. My fried fish came burnt....can't even believe a waiter would serve something looking like that. My husband ordered a salad that was supposed to have many different types of lettuces in it and it came with only Romaine and a few bits of veggies thrown in. The food took so long to come that on our last trip we left.........such a shame.....we would love to have a local pub to call our own.
This is quite possibly the worst drive-thru. If you have 30 minutes to wait for your fast food to come out, this place is just for you.
Here we are take 2 of coming to the new one with my soulmate. First experience bacon they served at dinner was from lunch. I was been offered Big Bear bucks that never came in the mail. So when my mom came to visit we came again then I told the manager that my big bear bus never came so she gave me  20 dollars in big bucks 2 that expire in 16 2 that expire in 2017. So coming in today very hungry took 5 minutes to even get a drink. And that was from somebody that wasn't even our server took our order without a pen and didn't even get it right. order wasnt taken for 10 minutes and  get my coffee , 30 minutes to find out that my food isn't even being cooked and now that it did it is rushed bread and sammich different temps and some nice grissle from the grill and no one is even come over to say we're really sorry about that your food's coming up right now. 40 mins now after writing this. Finally get my food. Thankfully I'm not allergic to tomato's that are hiding on my plate they left.  Fries are half old half 3rd degree burn in my mouth.
Will not be back. Poor service by the hostess & waitress. Very limited menu. The deviled eggs were much better at the nearby Carson Kitchen. The only silver lining with this place is that the bus boy filled up my drink when it was low. Maybe if he was promoted to waiter the service would be better.
I have visited thus salon at least a half a dozen times and have never left with a smile when I have gotten my nails done. I even asked for different technicians each time. The salon looks beautiful and elegant unfortunately the expertise is lacking! I just wanted a gel color change and the technician didn't realize I had fake nails, she thought they were real. In my opinion that speaks volumes to the level of knowledge present. Also, on that same visit I paid $30 for a french tip and an uneven blue line. This was the icing on the cake for me and I will never return. Oh and don't bother making an appointment, you will still wait for at least 30 minutes until they take you.Go anywhere else, but here!
not very professional. The Chinese broccoli has some weird taste and the beet cake has the flour like texture which is not supposed to have.
The food is terrible! Everything tastes bland, worse than fast food or even canned food.Hope I never have to come here again.
Management refused to let a member of our party in. Absolutely do not go here. Go to another one of the 15 bars on Carson. No reason for the denial of entry.
Horrible food! My boyfriend and I ordered out from here and got terrible food. The sandwich I got was so overly salty and the beer cheese on it didn't taste like cheese whatsoever. The wings were the worst wings I've ever had! They were so hard only little pieces of it were edible. All the food sounded so good but I was very disappointed with the prices and the low quality of the food. Safe to say I won't order from here again..
I normally do not give restaurant 1 Star, and I'm doing so not because they are horrid. Their food is actually decent, but, for now, I HAVE to give them 1-Star for serving raw Shrimp Dumplings. That's just unacceptable after we waited over 15 minutes for it.Hopefully, I'll have no choice but to upgrade the rating next time I visit.
Stay away. Had a fish bone in my spicy yellowtail roll. Microwaved edamame. Sashimi tasted average but there was some brown goo on the salmon that stopped me from eating altogether. Had the runs a few hours after eating there and I never ever have stomach problems from eating food even from the spiciest of all butthole burning food options.
This is supposed to be an albacore tuna sandwich, really what I received when I came home was a bread sandwich with a lot of lettuce, A LOT of onions, the cheese and bacon that I paid extra for but I literally had to scrape away these Toppings to try and find the tuna fish which is supposed to be most of the sandwich.  Very poor especially for an $11 sandwich.  Tasted like bread and onions.  Further, the cashier (as sweet as she seemed to be) didn't really know what she was doing, had a lot of trouble ringing it up, and then gave me a WARNING that next time she was going to have to charge me for bacon and cheese, even though my Total included these extras which I was expecting to pay for.  Overall, you shouldn't be even making a tuna sandwich if you cant actually put tuna on it.
1st time trying DCS, wont go back. 2 slices of ham does not make a sub.
Definitely an old-school greasy-spoon. While our server was very nice, the man we paid at the front counter was rude, practically tossing our change on the counter. I was very surprised to experience such a low level of customer service in Toronto which in my opinion is known for its high standard of customer service. Food-wise, the bacon seemed pre-cooked and re-heated because it was the hardest bacon I've ever had. Toronto has WAY too many restaurants cooking great food that would value your business. Don't waste your time and money here.
Drove 40 miles from the west valley to check out this bakery and wow was I ever disappointed.  I was hoping to see something similar to Karsh's Bakery that closed its doors in 2014.  Not even close.  There was hardly anything even nearly tempting to buy but most of all the prices scared me away and so did the customer service.  Really unfriendly and even rude!  Will never bother going there again!  So disappointed.
Okay so I gave this place another try...not happy!  The food wasn't great enough that I was willing to ignore the horrible service.  Nice clean environment...staff was friendly.  Decided to try the Southwestern Shrimp Wrap (wanted to be daring and bold so I didn't change the order-even ate avocado lol)  not very good.  The shrimp had a weird taste to it and I couldn't even force myself to eat it.  The smell was kind of turning me off.  I looked at the nice selection of desserts and noticed that they had Tiramisu (oooh tiramisu), it was okay.  Washed it down with a Vanilla Milkshake...it was good, not too extra extra sweet, lol I can actually taste milk (lol I hope that made sense).  So I thought the items I ordered was meh...but I will try their breakfast menu soon.
I think they have changed owner or something, I was the first customer in the afternoon, and service was bad. The waitress did not refill the tea for us. Food are ok but there was absolutely zero service. Do yourself a favor, avoid this restaurant, There are many better choices surrounding the area.
Today my wife and I visited this place to try the food as we have an upcoming party. We were looking for a new Indian place to serve yummy food for our guests (expecting about 100-120 people). Our experience today was awful!!!! The food was terrible. The chicken tandoori was raw, the chicken dum biryani( it is not even called a biryani), curries had no flavor, the desserts were not good( the fruits in the mango custard were not fresh, the carrot halwa( I don't want to call it a Halwa. Very bad!!!)). It's good that we have tried the food before ordering for our party. We have ordered at "Kabab palace", "Pastries N chaat" and "Chennai Fusion Grill" for our previous parties and the food was never a fail. We love those places. This time we just thought we will try something new but we absolutely regret going to this place. We will never recommend this place to anyone( friends, family and colleagues). Finally, decided to go back to our old favorite spots.
If only 0 stars was an option: Worst haircut ever. After moving to Toronto for the summer I realized that I would need to get a haircut at some point while I was here. After doing a bit of research I found this place and saw that they had a Groupon. I bought the Groupon and booked a hair appointment which ended up being with Azar. When i got there, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and served tea and biscuits as others described (pretty normal for any higher end hair salon) and was brought to my seat. Azar and I spoke about how I wanted a small trim, keeping my hair long which is the way I liked it. From the start it seemed as though she wasn't really listening to what I was saying and had her own vision for what she wanted to do. However, when she showed me what she wanted to cut off, which was approximately 1 inch, I thought that it would all end up ok because WHO can't do a basic trim!? Apparently Azar can't. I walked out today with approximately 3-4 inches off of my hair, not a trim by anyone's standards. I was holding back tears the whole way home because of how horrible it is. Not only that, but she did not layer my hair as I asked nor did she straighten my hair like I requested. She instead, did some form of weird blowout saying that she thought I might like it "naturally straightened" and then when i reminded her i wanted it actually straight, she did a half-ass job to try and please me.I'm sorry Azar, you are extremely nice but you need to learn to listen. I have always loved my hair and now I can't stop crying at the sight of it.P.S. If that wasn't enough, there was a deep-conditioning treatment included in the Groupon which involved sitting under heat to activate it. I was told she would be back in 10 minutes, however I was left stranded under this boiling heat for 20-25 minutes.
20 minutes in the drive thru with one car at the window.  Ridiculous.  We left and went elsewhere.
This location of Tropical Smoothie  is always rather incompetent. I would drive to a further one just to have better service and quality of product.
Never again.  The apple french toast (~$12) and the sampler (includes a little of the chicken dumpling, sugar crusted ham, and meatloaf - ~$14) and both were huge disappointments.  The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).  Other important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service.
This is, by far, the worst Chick-fil-A that I've ever been to. My family and I love Chick-fil-A and would regularly drive to eat at one when there wasn't one nearby. First visit: Went through the drive-through. The employees were friendly, but the food was lukewarm. One of the best things about Chick-fil-A is that their food is always hot and fresh. Not so on that visit.Second visit: Dined in. Another great thing about Chick-fil-A is that their restaurants are always clean and well-maintained. Again, not so. The tables were dirty and sticky. Also, our sandwiches and fries were lukewarm. The visit was disappointing and definitely not up to the usual Chick-fil-A standard.Third visit: Went through the drive-through for breakfast. There were 3 or 4 cars ahead of us when we pulled up. For some reason, it took nearly 50 minutes to get our food. When we did get it, out of four items, one was wrong and one was burnt. In over a decade of eating at Chick-fil-A, I have never had burnt food from Chick-fil-A. I took the receipt and the two items inside to exchange them, and I asked to speak to the manager. The manager refused to speak with me and told the girl to tell me that he was too busy. This all happened about 10 feet away so I was able to see and hear the whole thing. There were 2-3 employees standing around who could have taken over bagging food, but he wouldn't speak to me. We haven't been back to the Surprise location and won't go back until some major changes are made.
The only good thing about this place is the location. Do not stay here!!! Too much to write about.
This place is totally crap. Used the self-serve wash bays. Spent 30 minutes and $10 between three bays. None of the selectors sprayed anything but plain water. No soap, no tire cleaner, no wax, no nothing. Tried switching to a different bay, twice with no luck. Asked the service attendant for assistance "you turn the switch like this." Brilliant. You had one job to do. Total fail. Clean and nice setup, if only the little spray gun was capable of firing off something other than plain water.
I love this club and have been here before. Although at my most resent visit a coat check attendant was incredibly rude. I had accidentally lost my number tag and the way the situation was handled was completely inappropriate. I will not return. I left feeling insulted and distraught.
We signed up through a deal they have with Costco. If you ever need to customer service expect wait times up to 45 minutes trying to get through. I was stood up twice for service on my cooler wasting valuable time and ended up being without a functional cooler for 4 weeks. I decided to cancel after a receiving an unacceptable canned reply by email with no phone call. Of course I was on hold for 45 minutes just to cancel my service. There was no attempt to make it right as is they didn't care. If you ever think you need service, don't expect to get it here. I hope management gets a clue as I appear not to be the only one giving poor ratings. Costco also needs to rethink their partner if they haven't already.
Super nice inside good music mix of hip-hop and house dj was putting it down ! The downside is the staff ! Security is rude as hell racist if you ask me ! They said no tennis shoes ..... I'm wearing a $200 pair of Jordan's these aren't some beat down raggedy kicks so I went to my MERCEDES ( yeah I'm not broke but they treat you like that unless they know you or you buy bottle service haha ) and changed shoes but when I got inside I seen white guys wearing tennis shoes so I'm thinking really it's like that ????? But I'm not gonna let that ruin my night so we drank and danced it was cool plus they have a super huge nice patio with chairs heat lamps and hookah ! The waitresses were hot and the bartenders but the drinks were weak as hell and overpriced but that's Vegas unless you know where to go for locals. The female bartender sucked just because you're hot doesn't mean you should be a bartender !!!!!  I knew I was in for it when I asked her to put my ciroc in a bucket glass and she said " what's a bucket glass ? " I was like OMG you're a bartender and you don't know what a bucket glass is ..... really ????? So then I kept going back to the guy bartender who actually poured a decent drink and knew what a bucket glass is so he got my business and tips ! Make it sweet and short good time with friends but pricey drinks, rude security and dumb bartender but the guy bartender made up for it so maybe I'll go back but definitely not one of my top five ! It's to bad that the staff can ruin such a nice place with a great set up ! Oh btw do not run an open tab  with the waitresses !!!!! They ran my boys tab up over $400 and when we look at the receipt they had stuff on there that we never ordered obviously tryna increase sales and get a bigger tip !!!!! We were not happy to say the least but yes they'll take advantage of you thinking you're drunk and won't look over your tab !!!!!
On Veterans Day we were dinning at Denny's next door. They came in yelling that if anyone had parked in their parking lot they had tow trucks coming.  Apparently whoever was managing that day was making sure that people were getting towed if they felt the vets were not at Wendy's but Denny's. Not that I don't agree that if it happens on a regular basis it should be addressed.  I mean it's one day a year.  All the times I've gone through there NO ONE was searching for parking in order to go eat at Wendy's. No better way to not get people to frequent your establishment then throwing a fit! GREAT JOB MANAGER! I actually use to work for Wendy's when I was a kid but I find this behavior disgusting. Also to be noted I had ordered from this location previously had they'd gotten it wrong a few times. The unpatriotic behavior just sealed the deal and I will no longer be going to any Wendy's establishment. I'm sure the gaggle of vets that were there will no longer be purchasing anything from their either.
BLEH! Expensive, over-cooked, not great ethnic variety. Yuck. Pick a different Vegas buffet - Try Aria or Rio. You'll be glad you did.
The food is ok but the service is questionnable every time. Tonight sealed the deal and I will not be going back there anymore.  When we walked in, the hostess told us there were three parties ahead of us. When it was our turn to be seated, she passed us up and seated a couple that had just walked in (who appeared to be her friends).The owner should consider hiring someone who has experience running a restaurant because as it stands, this place is unprofessional and the service is horrible.
Disappointed when the sent me away at 6:30 when sign clearly says they close at 8. More technicians in there than clients. They just lost a customer and will spread the word that they will send you away when it's convenient for them.
Never stay here, this place charges $170.00 a night and doesn't give a free continental breakfast for there guests which is inexcusable for a hotel that supposedly prides themselves on being a top notch hotel.  I've never been treated like this by a hotel ever, this is unacceptable.  We will never stay at another Courtyard by Marriott, they have lost a customer.
The WORST storage place!! They are very rude ,they constantly are raising the rent, mine went up by 40% by the end of my 6th month, and when you try to leave they add on a bunch of other things that they say you owe them !!! Would not recommend this place to anyone!
Went in just for a nose ring and I was looked at like I was stupid. I picked one out sat there for 30 minutes and got no help and they never gave me the jewelry, so I just left. Very awkward and unprofessional.
I called this office based on reviews I read here on yelp. When called I was greeted with "can you hold" I did for 25 minutes. A few times they holding call was picked up with a confused hello? They were obviously unorganized. When I finally reached someone they were very unhelpful, not giving any answers but one word. I was asking questions to clarify while they were trying to say goodbye and hang up. needless to say I will not be giving them money!
Since my last review was turned down by yelp lets try again; It's been a while since we ventured to Sewickley for a meal, best way to describe Lola is an over priced version of Ave B but with less than perfect preparation and very few local choices. Server was surprised there was such a  thing as a "red zinfandel" so obviously the pairing question was a bad one. Appetizers were OK, We enjoyed the ambiance, place was dead for  Saturday night.  left most of the food on our plates, left a small tip and went home.
Just awful. I had the money chicken sandwich, the sandwich was soggy and the chicken tasted like rubber. The only thing worse than the food was the service. A total waste of money!
I would not eat here again if the food was free.  I am by no means a picky eater but i ate in with 1 other person and no other customers.  My friend got their food 10 minutes before me and they forgot about the soup until after the food came.  I got the sesame chicken and have never had the sauce gloopy and a burnt red color it was gross.  The other persons pork was nothing but fat chunks and inedible.  One thing going for them is the prices are cheap and the portions are big but with most of the food not being edible it is not really worth it anyways.
My husband & I ate here on s Saturday night. We wanted to bowl but there's 1.5 hr waiting list. No big deal, we decided to put a $20 bill into new arcade card and play some games. Literally more than half the games would NOT read the card no matter how slow/fast we swiped or what directions. Many of the ones that did read ate our card balance & didn't let us play. We reported it to arcade/projectionist Guy  & he made us walk around & relive everything that went wrong. He gave us extra tokens & put $4 on our card. I'd rather have $10 back. We were treated like we were trying to score free crappy token gear instead of like customers with an issue. Whatever. Won't be back. Plenty of places to go on Saturday night in Gilbert besides fat cats. No thanks. I'll happily pass on this place. Bad service=bad time.
Don't go here! Crappy work and the manager doesn't own up to it. My car has a hole in the seat, had soap in the vents and wax dripping from all 4 mud flaps.I had to point out all of this. Manager gave the phone number of shop that fixes their issues which tells you a lot about this place!
My boyfriend and I went here together to pick up lunch... Long story short, this is probably the worst location. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich and didn't get the bread or strawberry. I ordered a salad and soup and they somehow forgot to include dressing in my meal. Save your money and time by going to the location on Lake Mead. They have better service, staff, and they've never made mistakes when serving meals--even when they're overwhelmed and packed with customers! Such a shame that this location couldn't measure up... huge fan of Zupas.
Got my windows tinted. Thought it was a decent job . So I asked about wrapping a small portion of my suv . Quoted me a price. I returned the next day to get it done. Told it would take 30 minutes. 3 hours later. Drove home took pictures of wrap. And the line are off. Called the shop was told to come next day. Came back shop owner not at location. So I drove to 2nd location to show problem. Just missed him. Told tech at shop problem showed him the truck . Was told would take a week to get material in. Took copy of my receipt and all my info. 5 days later I called back to get a time frame. The owner had no idea of my problem. Ask me to send pictures. After he reviewed the photos . He told me he would fix the wrap but because of Easter weekend   It would take longer to get material come back Monday. Came Tuesday was told not available to repair. Had all materials come back in the morning. So I took off work. Came at 830 and now was told material to expensive to order. Will remove and refund. WTF. So now I'm looking a little closer at all the work that was done.  Going to a professional shop to get done what I paid these guys to do. Thanks Desert TINT
We heard a lot of good things about this place, but we were totally disappointed with the brunch and service.  The French Press coffee is great, but we didn't know it was French pressed, so we were frustrated with the 20 minute wait. The waffles showed up at our table cold, without plates or syrup.  Our poached eggs with the Benedict were literally not cooked. It was like a raw egg was cracked on top. The waitress tried to explain what poached eggs are to me. I assured her that I eat poached eggs all of the time and I know how they are cooked. They did comp our breakfast, but we would have rather paid for a good meal.
If I had wanted Denny's service and Denny's food I would have gone to Denny's. What happened to Olive Garden??? You used to be regarded with a higher standard now, you are barely one step above fast food!!!Went in around lunch time and the service was so slow.  I ordered and iced tea with lemon and was brought a raspberry tea which I detest.  I told the server right away and I didn't get a replacement until after I had already finished the soup and bread sticks.  Mind you she brought the drink before any of the food, and I told her before she brought any of the food.  I didn't get a refill until after a box was brought for my order. Pathetic! I love your iced tea and you deprived me of having it. The food came and I asked for a extra Alfredo Sauce on my Chicken Alfredo. I didn't get it, so I asked for it on the side.  10 minutes later she brought it and it was the smallest cup of nothing I have ever seen in my life, not even a full cup of nothing!  My order came with the buy one take one and I got the 3 cheese zitti to go.  When I got home to eat it, it was do disgusting it went straight to the dog.  My daughter ordered the lunch lasagna and the portion size she received was that equivalent to a Fancy Feast dinner you would feed you cat. You all know which dinners I am talking about.  I am done with Olive Garden.  Macaroni Grill here comes our lifetime business.  You have great iced tea, and Alfredo too. I did something I don't normally do, and I didn't leave a tip.  You don't go to a sit down location and not expect a drink.
Did the online order. Arrive at the time that the food was supposed to be ready. 10 minutes after I'm told it will be a little longer, I'm told that the wings are going to be another 12 minutes!!!  WTF?!?  So now I'm sitting here in the store for about 30 additional minutes!  I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it was gonna be this long for one pizza and a few wings. Nobody wants to sit in your shack for 30 minutes when you've already been told that the food will be ready when you arrive. the question I have now is how cold is the pizza gonna be when I get home. I want a nice fresh, hot pizza. Not something that's been sitting for 30 f-ing minutes!!!
Scam to up-sale very expensive service.  If you don't play the game they take your money and spray water everywhere and leave it very wet.
I was attending a play at container park and decided to try cheffinis. It was crowded and my first impression was they did not do well under pressure. The staff were bickering with each other about how to expedite the orders and when to close the coffee shop next door. I placed my order ( 1 naked dog and two kids meals with sliders). After 20 minutes of waiting I was told they didn't have anymore sliders and I could either get my money back or get a hotdog instead. I chose hot dog since I had already waited so long. A few minutes later the cashier came to one of the guys dining and told him he gave him an extra elder by mistake. The guy said, " I haven't touched it" and the cashier took it. Another 10 minutes past and I received 1slider which was supposed to have the special sauce. No sauce. I also received the hot dog that was substituted for the slider kids meal I paid for with no fries and no sauce. And a mediocre hot dog. To this day I am praying I didn't receive the side that was retrieved from the guy dining and regret the time and money wasted. I will never return or recommend. Horrible experience.
I have been to a lot of events in many cities across the United States and this venue is one of the poorer facilities I have been too, almost exclusively because of experience.The entry into the venue left hundreds waiting out in the cold until after the show started due to excessive security scanning, an understaffed crew and slow ticket processing. Once inside the poor stair lighting and aisle marking made it very difficult to find our seats. We missed 50% of the show we came to see despite arriving 30 minutes prior to show time. Will not go back here for anything.
Honestly if I could give them no star... I would. Dr Jeramy Ziosko is absolutely the worst doctor I have ever experienced... He was sooo rude and honestly should retire because he is truly miserable at what he is doing.
I have stayed in this hotel when I come to Vegas for the last several years. I will never stay here again. I will spend my thousands of dollars else where from now on and make sure it's not one of the connected "chains".  Upon my check in the women Ebony was beyond RUDE! I bought two hotel rooms, one was for my mother and father that I was trying to pay an all expense paid vacation for them. Even though both rooms were placed on my card for payment she wanted me to check into my room and then stand back in line behind 30 other people to check into my dads room. Why would I need to stand back in line to check into my other room? Also she ran a payment and asked for no signature but insisted that I had to call my dad back to sign for his room, she said "I did you a favor not asking you for a signature" so then why didn't she continue to do the favor on the second room? After her bad behavior and rudeness the hotel offered me a $40 credit per room which I never used because I had planned my dinners for my family else where. I called in the morning for a late check out which they said was fine, 20 minutes after I called I had a cleaning lady walk into my room and 10 minutes after that I got a phone call asking me why I wasn't out.  So much for a late check out. I don't know if management has changed or what has gone on with this hotel but I would never in my life recommend staying here. there are hotels right next door with the same pricing, please spend your money there and you'll have a much much better stay stay.I also Asked for a pet stay room when you look under the rug there are dog pee stains everywhere. They hold deposits and make you pay double for these rooms to cover the damages that dogs do to the room. Apparently peeing all over rugs isnt damage to the room so you have to live and stay around other dogs pee. My bad for bringing a potty trained animal and expecting the same.
Overall Experience:The wait staff was inattentive and rude.  Our waitress was at the end of her shift and made several attempts to take plates while we had food in our mouths.  After she left, other servers kept coming over.  It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.I am big fan of Tex-Mex and I really enjoyed the food.  I was looking forward to going here as I have a friend who raves about it.  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience for me and I would not come back and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone beyond saying food is good, service is awful.
Possible the worst food I every took a bite of, yes a bite because that was all I could taste. I regrettable had the meatball sandwich which wasn't a sandwich, it was a calzone. I call to tell them the sandwich was wrong, but that's how they make it. Got other items wrong on order also. Wouldn't feed that garbage to my dog.
Not my type of nail salon. It's the day after my nails were done and they're peeling and chipping!! I was also asked for my address which strikes me as strange and now I regret leaving it. I went in with a Groupon voucher and left completely disappointed but happy that I didn't pay the full price which is outlandish for the work I had done. worst money I've ever spent!!!
Terrible....don't use these guys. We needed a cab to and from our hotel for New Year's 2012 and decided to pre order it the night before and even pre-paid with tip online both ways. We also called to confirm the order and they said all was good. NYE comes and so does our pick up time and they never show. We wait 15 minute past pick up before we call and when we did they said oh he is on his way....after being late 45 minutes they finally show. Then the driver was mad I pre-paid because apparently they get stiffed on the tip by the company but he drops us off where we need to be.On the pick up we called 45 minutes before and the guy shows up when he said. When he arrives I told him I pre paid so he isn't caught off guard and he said "I don't take pre pays" and drives off before we can get in!!!I called and they said they'd refund the money 3 times but never did so I filed a dispute with paypal (thats who the pre-pay is through) and it took 60 days to get my money back because they ignored it and paypal ruled in my favor because they never responded to it. They never even bothered to to respond to my BBB complaint.They have another bad review here for a reason.....DO NOT USE THEM!!! You may end up regretting it.
Scam. Event signs everywhere for $20. Still pretty high for a few hours... Went to pay on the app instead of waiting 10 min in line. Was charged $28 instead of the posted $20. Emailed them and for some reason they added the next day's $8 daily rate to the bill. Dishonest and false advertising.
The company decided to do Christmas lunch in milestones second year in a row. I was not impressed by their food last year, so kind of knew what to expect. Well, this year they have went above and beyond my expectations ( I am being facetious). Not sure how to spoil a fire-grilled salmon and boiled rice, but they've managed to do that. The only good thing was the size, it was really small, not enough to get sick right away (wait till the evening when you regret every bite). Rice was probably cooked a few days before as well as salmon and then heated up straight on or with the plate which was smothered with "grilled veggies" (don't try this at home). Grilled veggies consisted of grilled zuccini prepared a few days back that were already falling apart from moisture (not a good thing for a grilled food). Rice was dry and plasticky from being left out of water for a long time. Salmon had the same issue being left out uncovered and then re-heated. And to top it up I have found a hair on my plate and that was the end of my lunch. Since it was company's Christmas lunch I have kept my mouth shut. But as it was not sponsored and I paid $24.5 for the main dish alone I've decided to leave a review. And, to my point, even 1 star is very generous for this particular place (calling it a restaurant would be too much of an honour which they don't live up to). Unfortunately at the time I did not argue and did paid my bill which I regret full-heartidly now. By the way their bill says CASH ONLY, a way to discourage people using credit cards.  I sincerely hope that at some point they will get a customer who is not as placid and agreeable like myself and who will give them what they deserve. Their cooks don't deserve to even touch pans, leave alone cooking. Disgrace to a restaurant business. Absolutely horrific place. Not sure why people choose it over other eateries on the same street, but it definitely not worth a try. There is no third time for me. If you value your health and know at least a little about decent food, avoid milestones on king west!!!
We went out of our way to stop at the new Sweet Republic this afternoon, super excited to try the ice cream we'd heard so many good things about. We ordered, had our ice cream in our hands, and when the cashier gave us our total ($11) I handed her a $100 bill to pay with. She handed it back to me and told me they did not have any change. I didn't have any other form of payment with me- we literally had to put our ice cream down on the counter and leave it there while the cashier told us that there wan't anything she could do, and if we couldn't pay another way we couldn't buy the ice cream. There aren't any signs posted anywhere that say they don't accept large bills. We made a choice to visit Sweet Republic and we were treated like it was our fault/problem that they didn't have change. Bummer.
This storage facility is nice and seems secure. However, I wouldn't come here solely because I was told a price, I took a day off of work to come down and set it up, and when I arrived I was told a price about $50 more. When I asked about it their customer service was apathetic and didn't care to help. Hidden fees are a sure way to lose customers.
I feel like I'm breaking up with someone by doing this but, wow, it's not me its you :( Digestif, I love you... But you can tell your ugly step sister Cowboy Ciao to never call me again.   My tongue is still smoking... in a bad way.
Yeah never going here again. The lady was rude. Barely said 5 words to me. It's been 3 weeks and my nails are all breaking off. Im so angry
I attempted to eat here tonight for the first time. I only ate a couple bites of my dinner. After ordering and looking around deeper, I saw half bottles of alcohol stored on the floor on a moldy tile covered wood shelf that was molding. Then when my Mail came, it tasted like the cheese or something was spoiled. I would not recommend.
I feel bad giving this hotel a low score, but our experience  was terrible and we wasted lots of money just to feel like we were staying in the cheapest room possible.We reserved a GO view room and lost our reservation despite the fact that I called the day before to confirm and I called again while we were en route, explaining that we will be arriving at 1am. He said he made a note that I called and he documented our new ETA. Here's what we ended up with on arrival:A king size, not the 2 queens that was requested No viewFurniture with lots of tears in the leatherHoles and stains in the beddingHard bed and either hard pillows or really worn out pillows that need to be thrown away.Water damage to the ceilings A rollaway, which the attendant said she had requested since we had 2 kids with us (the rollaway took 2 hours to arrive)The rollaway was sunk in the middle. My poor kids looked like they were folding in half.The attendant told us the rooms were not guaranteed and said we could switch rooms the next day, but we were so busy that it would have been an inconvenience. She also said our room was originally on hold but the manager had to give it away (and give us a downgraded room instead). We paid over $500 for the original room we requested for the 2 nights and the only way they could comp us was to take off the $30 resort fee and provide us with that sorry rollaway. Housekeeping even opened our door after the first night even though the do not disturb sign was up. They thought we we due to check out!Unfortunately we did not have a good experience and ended up checking out at 6am bc we were highly disappointed. We were in room 23008 which was not worth the money at all! I really wanted to like this hotel too so I'll end on some good notes...Pros:Nice decorFree parkingGreat location, walking distance to miracle mile24hour food court on site
Hate to keep writing negative comments on this gym but it so poorly managed. All sanitary wipes dispensers empty and when I told the front desk all I got was a "we know"... Last straw with this place. Will look for new gym.
I have invested so much time trying to get satisfaction from the Geek Squad that I am exhausted and won't even give all the many reasons why you should NOT USE THEM.  Suffice it to say, they misrepresent their contract (locked in for at least 6 months -- I was never told that), plus the incidental work they did for me was completely messed up and I wished I done it myself.  BAD BUSINESS.  NEVER USE THEM.
Just left this place. This is my forth time coming here around 9pm-12am since I live around here. There is an African American lady who I think is the manager at this time, and she is rude. I got to the drive thru most times and she always claim that almost every beverage machine is broken, besides the fountain drinks. EVERYTIME!!! Never fails. She only says that because she is too lazy to turn on the other machines, also when I got my burgers, they weren't wrapped. They were poorly thrown in the bag with the wrappers on top of them. WTF?!
When to this place to get a yearly eye exam for contact lenses.My first impressions were not very good. I had to wait to check in while the receptionist at the counter had a private conversation with another employee. Then after I checked in she let me stand in the lobby for 5 min with no seating. After I joked that they need some seating, the receptionist casualty said the waiting are was in an adjacent room as if I was supposed to know. How long was she going to let me pace? Why didn't she tell me where the waiting room was after I checked in? Not rude just unhelpful.The Dr was very knowledgeable, except he dilated my eyes when I specifically told his tech I didn't want it, and even signed something saying i didn't want it. The Dr. shrugged it off and said the tech didn't put it in the chart. That might be true, but the doctor never said what he was putting in my eyes or what he was doing either which i didn't appreciate.My real problem with this place is when how they make you buy contacts. Instead of the standard procedure where they go over you insurance and place your order after your exam, I was told to go home and use their website to order. The website doesn't answer your questions about billing and insurance issues and can be confusing if you are not used to ordering your own contacts. I tried to calling the office 3 separate times one day to ask questions about their website no one answered the phone. I ended up having to go back to the store to get my questions asked. They were helpful on that second visit, and I eventually placed my order. But seriously what kind of office sends you home to order your own contacts and doesn't answer the phone? Not good.Their ordering system is not customer friendly and the staff I met initially was not overly professional, friendly, or helpful. I've had way better experiences at big chain eye exam stores. I will not go back to this place.
Worst dinning experience we have had for a long time. First, the service is awful. We waited for an hour before the food showed up. However, two tables coming after us got their food almost right away. When we got our food, they were ready to leave. The only thing I can think is they are Americans and we are not. The waitress took order from Chinese customers with a long face but smiled ear to ear at all American customers. Why?! And, food! The food they serve is the same as Asian Express Cafe, almost identical but price is triple. Two people $43. Worst of all, servers kept rubbing their noses with their fingers. We, for sure will never go back. How terrible it is when you are discriminated by your own people! Why don't they just put a sign on the door "American Only"!
I wish I could give a -10 on this review. The front staff were so unprofessional which should have been a give away that I should of just walked out. I saw the doctor here who did not address my needs and told me to see an eye doctor. I followed his advice and saw an eye doctor. While I was getting my eyes checked that doctor saw a HUGE mass on my right side and with great concern called the Brain and Spine Center so he could talk with the doctor I had just seen who did nothing for me. After COUNTLESS failed attempts I was sent to the Emergency room by my eye doctor and told I would be be admitted but he still wanted to continue trying to contact the Brain and Spine Center as this is a brain matter. I was admitted immediately and had 3 MRIs and CAT scans and other procedures done to find out what the mass was. It turned out I had a tumor! How could a brain doctor fail to realize that?! The eye doctor kept following up with me while I was in the hospital and even got a new Neurologist involved. He said as his patient he needed a doctor he could consult with and I needed someone for this time in my life. That eye doctor made all kinds of calls for me and I now have 3 amazing specialists. I wish my story ended there, I got a large bill in the mail from the Brain and Spine Center after paying my co-pays from my insurance.
Sushi is really good service sucks. So the first night it was busy they were short staffed we waited over an hour for some one to even check on us after we ordered. We waited 90 minutes to get 1 set of sushi and another 30 for the second set. Both were ordered at the same time. I didn't post a review because I thought it was just that they were short staffed and really busy. So my husband and I gave it a second chance. It was the same and still not as busy. We waited over an hour for food and no one ever came to give us a refill on our drinks. My drink was empty for over 45 minutes and not one of the staff including the owner  ever stopped. I had to track the server down to get a check. We will not be returning which is sad because the food is good but service is horrible.
TRULY AWFUL EXPERIENCE! This place isn't fancy enough to be so snobby. My husband and I went here for his birthday tonight, and we were immediately ushered upstairs. This would have been fine, but once seated they told us they don't do happy hour upstairs. Weird rule, but okay. After the waiter brought our chips and drink... he... never... came.... BACK. He literally served every table around us, and left us sitting in a corner awkwardly and hungrily. Finally, I just got up from the table and asked another server to cash us out. It was the weirdest and rudest experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Never going back.
Workers are not friendly, rude and lazy.  They care more about gossip among themselves than ring up customers.
I have been a loyal customer of Power Toyota since I bought my Scion in 2009. However, after my last visit I will be sure not to return. I went in to purchase four new tires as a routine maintenance and left with my car in awful condition! First, the rep told me it would take 2 hours to complete and after the 3rd hour, I sill didn't have my car. I had to contact them to check in on my car as they were not courteous enough to contact me. After the third hour of waiting, I finally got some information regarding my car and I was informed my SUB ARM was bent. After Googling the issue, this usually happens after a car accident or running into a curb at high speed. OR a mechanic drops your car from the high-rise. How convenient. The dealer took no responsibility for the issue even though I have never been in an accident in my life. They "discounted" my service taking off the cost of the alignment (even though they didn't align my wheels) and said they'd replace the SUB ARM for $500 additional dollars. I asked that they did not complete the service as I felt  they were being incredibly dishonest and they returned my car in worse condition. I will never be back; Power Toyota has lost a loyal customer.
Omg! we drove all the way from Avondale because our pediatrician said it would be a best option. My son has an ear infection but needed an X-ray and urine test. We got there at 3:15...and with a feverish crying baby, like a lot of other partners there.. We waiting for 3.5 hours just to have his vitals taken... Then we waiting another 3 until I am not kidding past 9pm to finally get asked to go in!!!! We gave my son Tylenol 1 while waiting for his fever. He is 9months old. Then.... We waiting another 1 hour for the doctor who seems to be in a hurry and not care about our son... Then another 3 to get him checked and cleared to go home. We got there at 3:15 wedsneday got asked in at 9pm and left at 3 am!!! Now 2 days later we find that they gave us the wrong medicine!! Now my son is has blood in his stool!! I honestly do not recommend them, them saying they care and specialize in kids is all marketing bullshit! They are no better than any other hospital or Doctor. Actually you're probably better off going to those Urgent Care locations. - now just wait for the large sum bill they are going to send me becuase of their expert service! Horrible.
Beware...this venue is not licensed to hold events. They have pissed off their neighbors and they have made their life a living hell. The area is not zoned properly.  They have to do grading to the mountain, install sprinkler system, add an additional bathroom, meet handi- capped accessibility...a lot of work. We are trying to get ahold of the venue to try and get our money back.  Stay tuned... Read filtered reviews.

For qualifying devices, you'll receive a gift card online or credit toward a purchase in the store. We'll either refurbish the device for resale or recycle its materials responsibly". That's what the Apple website states although don't waste your time as they will only give you store credit if you purchase a new Phone or IPAD. Really unfortunate as I even called a head of time to ensure that they would give store credit and I was told Yes....what a waste of time. One would think that all employees would have the same story and procedure to work from...
Though the equipment is clean, $9 a kid is way too much money for what it is.  They charge the full amount for crawling babies, which is just ridiculous.  Our baby was barely old enough to crawl (and only wanted to be held anyway). We came so the older kids could play and the owner tried to charge us for the baby (in our arms). My husband said we weren't going to pay for an infant who wasn't going to use any of the equipment, and the owner replied, "Well, if he sits down on the floor at ALL you are going to have to pay the $9 for him".  Ridiculous.  The baby, of course, never left our arms, as we knew he would.  My kids enjoy this place, but now that the prices have risen to 9 bucks a pop, we won't be going back.  We've been officially priced out.
I went there for lunch, the restaurant was empty. We waited for 10 minutes for a cook to wonder out and see us and ask us what we wanted. Then we were sat in the very back corner of the EMPTY restaurant. Waited 30 minutes, then the waiter came out. The food was not Mexican food. The food tasted like it was made in a drunken stupor by a culinary drop out who visited Tijuana for 1 day and now thinks they can cook Mexican.
I have no idea why I keep booking flights with American...I always think the next trip just might be better. This trip will be my last to ever step foot on another one of their planes. Pushy staff and HORRIBLE service. I've currently been in this plane for 35 mins and I was just told it will be another 40 before we take off. This happens EVERY TIME with this airline. Please do yourself a favor and go Southwest or United.
I absolutely hate coming to this CVS!!! So My husband will get a text saying that 5 medicines are ready and I go by to pick them up and guess what there is only 4 ready. It would be ok if this happened once or twice, but of course I am writing a review because this happens all the time! Every month in fact! Kenny here is a shout out to you, thank you for showing me how much you don't care about any customer service! No worries Kenny your not alone, all your coworkers are pretty much the same, can't remember their names. I don't know what the protocol is for your drive through customers but I am taken back by how many times I have had the same problem happen over and over again and no apology is ever given. I get it it's not your fault it's automated system but once I am there at your drive through window I expect just a bit more concern and help. Instead I was just dismissed with attitude because you didn't understand me? What is so hard to understand that I was supposed to pick up 5 medicines for my husband not 4 after he personally spoke to some one to make sure I would not have to deal with this.  So to sum it up the pharmacy department is so not organized friendly or professional!! I hate it because this is the closet pharmacy to me but I am now certain it's time to go somewhere else where I can really have a great evening like Mr. Kenny so sarcastically wished me.
Hate this place bad customer service the basketball gym is tiny and it is always packed and everyone hogs the machines.
This place sucks. No line cuz they let everyone in. Can't move. The floor is nasty. People tackled by security taken away by cops. I showed ID and was told to throw away my water. No problem. Threw it away and walked in, other guard grabs me strongly by the arm and pulls me to the other side of the rope telling me he didn't let me in. He was standing right next to the guy who did. So confused I go around a pole and the other guys acts like I'm stupid flashing me in like "hurry up". Wtf? I go in the floor is nasty. My shoes SUCK to the floor. The place is overcrowded. People acting stupid. Girl RUNS out to vomit. An employee not taking our order grabs the card, he's not helping is at all or even knows what we want and my friend says hey, what's up? And the guy helping us finally says HE WORKS HERE. Ok... but why is he taking our card? It's just shady and nasty and they herd you like cattle. It's ridiculous. We had one round and went across the street. Way better. Better music, better drinks. I can still fee his grip on my arm. It's excessive. I'm not one of the other drunkasses barfing outside. DO NOT RECOMMEND. Literally anywhere else would be better. They should really just  erbally tell people what to do instead of grabbing them. What the hell. NEVER happened before and I go to way better clubs in the San Diego gaslamp. Like do not touch me. Unacceptable.
I have been using rinse and ride since it opened and have always been satisfied. March 6th my opinion changed. I took my 2008 Infiniti through like I have a million times. When I was through and started drying off my car, I noticed that the trunk molding had been knocked off. I know they aren't responsible for things like that happening, but when I asked the guy running the car wash to get it for me, it was like I was putting him out! Not a sign of human kindness at all!
-1 $14 drinks.-1 Weak as hell.-1 Service extremely slow.Finally went to the bar. Bartender proceeded to walk away to "do something" and then came back to fill up the glass with my drink.Luckily, I ordered the best drink, the New Cable Car. Well, other than the guys that had beer. The other two cocktails were pronounced, "disgusting."We stayed maybe 20 minutes including waiting for the cocktail server, waiting at the bar and then sucking down a drink each.The crowd was older and a bit weird. I watch some cougars challenge guys to a push up contest. Women in short skirts doing push ups? Is this a reason to go?No, not really. There's not enough alcohol in those drinks!
The dude who did my mani/pedi seriously acted like  he was doing me a favor. Not to mention his SLOPPY work. This spot had been my "go-to" but I'll be on the prowl for somewhere new. The new ownership was painfully obvious. Avoid.
Advice: find a new profession, or learn how to do this business the right way. You won't be able to sustain your business for very much longer unless you change. There are a lot of wonderful places to get a massage out there, so you need to step up to the competition. Without happy customers, what happens to the state of your business?
After waiting an hour and a half after my appointment.  He tells me that he has 2 others that he did not know I was coming. Dude, I'm here waiting.  I will not be coming back to this place.  The worst customer service ever!!!
It's a decent playground if you enjoy attractions like heatstroke, broken play sets, and hanging out with the Children of the Corn.
This car rental company out of Mccarran Airport in Las Vegas NV is a RIP OFF!!!  They purposely leave out pertinent information when you book online!  I called the day of pick up to let them know to push back my pick up time & this is when I learned that I had to have an out of state license to utilize the reservation I had already made!  Apparently the reservation was for in town use!  Who does that? Who rents a care for in town use if you own a perfectly functioning vehicle?  Why would I make a reservation as such?  Now I am fighting for a refund as they charged me right on the spot for the reservation weeks back from my actual pick up date! The website is a sham as non of this was indicated on my confirmation page!!!  Dont rent your cars from this place people not unless you enjoy being scammed & RIPPED OFF!!! :-/
So if my experience wasn't bad before I went back with my receipt and the lady that helped us out at the fine jewelry was very nice, but when the manager came out she was the biggest bitch. She didn't show any concern for my horrible experience or the time wasted. Just said its policy shrugged her shoulders and walked away. Didn't say have a nice day or asked if there was anything else she could be assistance of. This managers name is Lynn. The gm of this location whose name is Chris will be getting a call as well. She needs to be aware of the poor customer service her employees are giving. Almost like I'm wasting their time after I have spent nearly 500$ there. I returned everything and went to Dillard's to buy the same exact items for the same price.
One of the worst HOB I have been to.  My wife and I went here on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. Decent looking place. My waitress was nice, but she reminded me of the gal that was on Seinfeld, a low talker.  I could barely hear anything she was saying.  I hoped I didn't misunderstand anything she said and ended up with a meal I didn't order.I ordered a shrimp po' boy.  The shrimp was just okay, no spiceyness to it, but the bread it travelled in was bad.  It literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up. For the price, not even remotely worth it.My wife ordered a salad.  It was lettuce with a small chunk of blue cheese on the top and dressing on the side.  For nine bucks. And though this is no fault of HOB, my wife didn't like the lettuce offered and she asked for another kind.  They did not offer anything else.Very disappointing meal.  Lots of waitresses and waiters standing around.  It seems like this place is going on it's rock and roll reputation. We will not be back, at least not this location.
This a reply to Renee, owner of Studio 480, rebuttal to my negative comment regarding a very bad haircut  that Irene gave me on 11/23.   Please regard my review to get the whole story.Renee states that 3 people worked on my hair after her mother Irene cut it and could not rectifythe chop job.  (I did bring a picture of what I wanted.and Irene said she could do the style.)There was only one hairstylist who came to try and fix the problem.  Casey tried but try as she did she couldn"t fix the damage.Another correction to Renee stating that she called me after she found out I was not happy is not correct.  I CALLED HER and told her how unhappy I was with the cut . I did verbally say how this is not the what I asked for,and showed the picture of cut I wanted several times to Irene.In conclusion.Renee tried to fix the the problem. but  I still walked out upset that I would havelive with this haircut till it would grow out.Marianne
We went here on Father's Day. Ordered the queso dip. It came in a container a little bigger than a ramekin. The price was 7.50. It was thin and very bland. For dinner we ordered the "cadillac" beef fajitas. I think they gave us yesterday's beef. They were very tough. The tortillas were good. I would not recommend the guacamole. 3.75 for a very small side. No flavor and runny. Our server was nice and kept our drinks filled. We will not be back. If we want fajitas Chili's or Applebees has better.
This was the worst manicure/pedicure I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this place nor would I ever go to her again. The reasons for my low rating:1.K Von said that she guarantees her work and that it will last at least 2 weeks. 4 days after my gel manicure, it started to lift & peel. This has NEVER happened when I got gel I asked her to redo it and she would only do it on the days she was free. She refused to do it a week after it happened. That doesn't seem like " I always guarantee my work" to me. 2. She was very unprofessional in my opinion. She kept on talking about how little she makes in this business, how expensive it costs. I think she says that so I will tip her more. She also cussed several times in my presence and talked too much about her personal life.3. The "salon" is a small room in a salon and she has a limited selection of nail colors. Overall, number 2 and 3 wouldnt really bother me that much. The main concern is that my nails only lasted 4 days. Very disappointing
I came in here with my grandmother, and my mother the other day for three pedicures and one manicure. We were there two and half hours and there was only one other customer at the time. Three different women rotated doing my pedicure(which chipped the same day). The "manicure" that we paid for consisted only of the manicurist applying over 10 coats of gel polish that pooled at the end of my moms nails, only to peel off the next day. When doing the callus scrub on all three of us they used a CHEESE GRATER and scrubbed my grandmothers feet raw. She could barely touch her skin without being in pain. Overpriced and overall awful experience. Will not be going back.
Let me begin by saying I have never eaten their food, and unfortunately never will due to my encounter with this truck today in Phoenix. During an emergency situation in which a firetruck was trying to make it through traffic on the i17, I found myself gazing at the lovely looking food truck next to me (Bang-Bang Dumplings - displaying cherry blossoms and a large Buddha statue...) Ironically, as traffic was forced to move this seemingly peaceful food company decided to push their truck and food trailor into my lane, which was bumper to bumper. I had no choice but to hit the gas and go forward or this truck would have caused me to crash into the side railing to the right of me - where an emergency responder was coming up on a motorcycle. As I looked out my window to try and figure out what to do, the woman and young man in the front of this truck immediately began screaming "F*ck you!" and honking their horn repeatedly until I finally lost my temper. I admit that, but I was also unnecessarily endangered by this company's reckless driving. As a localist, I know I will not be supporting a company that treats members of our community this way. What a horrible experience. Even if their food is good, this ruined it for me. Glad to see from the reviews I'm not the only one who has crossed paths with Bang-Bang Dumplings reckless driving.
Terrible,terrible,terrible. This place has horrible service we ordered something and the lady just left we hooked over and over and no one cared . She comes back with an attitude and has to double check that we payed for what we ordered she leaves again and takes forever just to get a drink .
Do Not Eat Here!! It smells like rotten eggs as you walk up and inside. They are not very friendly and do not cater to food allergies. The bathrooms are extremely dirty as well. They don't really understand English either. I ordered a quesadilla and my cheese wasn't even melted. Wow! Not a happy customer and they didn't even care!! Stay away from here everyone!
Ever since South Point opened, I have desperately wanted to like it. Truly. I just can't. It's the "motel hotel" of LV casinos, ranking slightly higher than Terrible's. From the car park to the layout of this "locals" joint, I don't care for it at all. There's always a funky stench. I've had food poisoning in the Cafe. The restaurants here aren't good & barely decent. And yeah, that goes for Steak & Shake, an over rated, get what you pay for, dump. There is nothing about South Point that would inspire me to return, or want to return. The decor alone is plain & unappealing. It's very boring. If you like understated, and find GVR, M Resort, or Strip corridor resorts over the top or extravayou might enjoy South Point. They definitely cater to a different group of guest.
This shop is not recommended by me because they are shady and will intentionally lie in order to get more labor done. They upsold me to $1400 of repair work for a $140 job and still did not diagnose my issue properly. These are the mechanics that your dad told you to avoid. My experience: This shop was near my house and figured it was convenient to drop my car off and get work done. I previously had my power steering pump replaced. That job was a few months before this incident, and I was marginally satisfied with the outcome. (They should have discovered the PS Cooler was broken and causing my coolant and PS fluid to mix - poor attention to detail.) That cost me about two hours of my time doing a PS flush and bypassing the PS cooler myself. This incident was when my AC Compressor Clutch seized up earlier this year (February, I recall). It made an awful screeching sound while driving. Not being strong in the field of AC on cars, I decided to bring it in and get it properly diagnosed. It was somewhat of an emergency due to the severity of the noise and they were only a couple minutes up the road from me. My father is an ASE Certified Master Mechanic and counseled me between the discussions I had with the shop owner and mechanic on duty, and he lives a hundred miles away. The shop owner informed me that my entire AC Compressor was busted and needed a complete replacement including a flush of the AC system and the Accumulator. After he said this, he quoted me at $1400 to complete it. Assuming this was a "recommended" upsell, I asked, "What is the minimum work to get done so it doesn't screech?" He backpedaled and said that if you don't do it, bad things will happen. Great, now I'm dealing with dishonest mechanics. My dad explained to me how an AC Compressor works and how the clutch on it operates independently of the compressor. Explaining this to shop owner back and forth, he agreed and explained he doesn't replace AC clutches. In theory, if they were honest and would be willing to do it, they could pick up at least a couple hours of labor. I refused their services and requested they take the AC belt off. When I left, I expressed my disgust in their lack of ethics and how they give great mechanics a poor reputation. I drove my car to my father's house. In a matter of minutes he confirmed that the issue was the AC Clutch assembly and not the AC Compressor. A little searching online, I was able to find a brand new AC Compressor cheaper than a clutch kit and ordered it. The following week, we installed it over about an hour. No recharge or flushing necessary as the AC Compressor was functioning perfectly. We were still shocked at all the work the shop suggested for such a simple job like this.If this shop advises you on work, ALWAYS get a second opinion. It is in their best interest to upsell you on services and parts to make higher margins. It is this behavior that will get this shop in trouble with the Attorney General for unfair and misleading business practices. I rarely give "1" stars on Yelp, but this place earns it. I will never do business at this shop again and I recommend you don't, either. Alternatively, I have had favorable experiences with Tire Pros in Chandler.

The best thing about our visit was our waitress. She was attentive and apologetic that the pizza was terrible. It was undercooked, the crust was soggy and the toppings were sparse. Too bad. It was the first time we have been out in the evening in 4 months.What a disappointment!  We won't be returning.
their manager shouting and swearing "F" word when someone asking to him a replacement for a broken foodbag here's the link..ig and youtubehttps://youtu.be/P7jfzKlyKOshttps://instagram.com/p/Bnsq-ozFvaF/
Horrible! Took three hours on my full set - then let me go for free because she knew how horrible it was. Her husband agreed that they were all crooked and tried to fix them. I never complain but what the heck! Be careful they are going off the other people's reviews but the good people moved! They have another Yelp account now. Check it out don't go here.After she did my nails they were talking about how she doesn't usually do full set - just design. Well thanks lady. Can't wait for two weeks to go by for these things to peel off. Everyone at work thought they were "press ons." This is the location on Sahara going by the same name as the company that just moved out of there.
This place is a joke. The posted hours of operation as well as the voice mail recording says they are open on Saturdays at 7am.  I called on April 23rd at 7:05am to place an order. The recording came on. I decided to go ahead and head up there. I tried calling twice while on the way. Now the phone line was steady busy. Upon arrival 4 other people were standing outside the establishment. The lights were off and the place wasn't open. It was 7:21am. Not professional at all. I immediately left and drove over to ALFONSO'S Taco Shop. It was open and ready to serve. Also ALFONSO'S prices are lower and no extra charge for potatoes or cheese. I will not support Tacos and More again and I suggest you don't as well.
Uber drivers beware the main technician told me he does not like Uber drivers.. if your looking to get a uber inspection go somewhere else
Waited on hold for 38 mins while I listened to a woman bartender complain about everything in her life! She answered, and told me to hold. She never came back to the phone?? What a joke!!!
Giving one star only but that is because you can't do negative stars. Stopped by this morning for a bagel and coffee. Ordered an Asiago bagel toasted with Salmon cream cheese. The staff was overworked and rushing through the orders. When I got to my office and was ready to eat my bagel, I open it up to find that there was literally just a shmear of cream cheese on my bagel that was spread so thin, there was at least half the surface area with no cream cheese and another quarter of the area barely had a slight smudge of cream cheese. I know this isn't the end of the world but if I have to pay $5.19 for a bagel and small coffee, then I would at least like to get enough cream cheese to cover both sides of a sliced bagel. Not cool!
This hole in the wall should have its license suspended. What kind of people let their customers drink themselves to oblivion? They obviously do not care about anything but their bottom line. Is it going to take a mugging or murder to convince them to not serve people who come in drunk or cut them off when they get plastered in this place? Demolition is my recommendation
We waited over an hour for an omelette and bacon.  The cook came out and said she hadn't forgotten our order, but that they were out of eggs.  Not sure why the waitress didn't tell us that so we could have the option of changing our order.  Then, first bite into the omelette had a huge piece of egg shell.  We won't be coming back.
I've been to this restaurant multiple times and even though the drinks are quite pricey I still liked the restaurant's vibe and food. As a result, I decided to have my birthday on November 13th, 2015 here. I called beforehand to let them know that I'll be bringing 10 guests with me. They informed me that even though they don't take any reservations, they'll still keep in mind that a group of people will be coming at 10 pm on Friday night and try their best to accommodate us as fast as possible. When I asked how long the wait time will approximately be, the guy told me around 20 minutes which doesn't sound too bad. My friends and I arrived at 10 pm sharp. There were around 7-8 people ahead of us and it was a very cold night but we decided to wait anyhow. An hour and a half passed by and we were still not seated. Throughout the time we were standing in line, we took a couple pictures because it was my birthday but the bouncer or the guy at the door kept telling us to stop taking pictures and that we were blocking the way which we were not doing at all. And last time I checked, I was allowed to take pictures on the streets whenever I wanted. Not the best impression to get from someone who works there but finally, when we got to the front of the line after approximately an hour and a half of waiting, a group of 5-6 people appeared from nowhere and were let in. Everyone was shocked and no one could believe their eyes especially knowing that this restaurant, in particular, doesn't take any kind of reservations at all. Therefore, I went inside to find out what's happening and both of the guys standing in front of the doors told me that they the group who just went inside were with the owners and ignored my questions about how they were let in, in the most unprofessional manner and kept saying they were with the owners and ultimately left the conversation when I was talking and went away to serve other customers. Even though we were all agitated, we still waited another 15 minutes. Finally, the bouncer came outside and asked to check everyone's ID which he didn't do for anyone standing in line in front of us. Also, he didn't mention anything about checking ID's for more than an hour and half that we were standing in line. If we had known in advance, we wouldn't have spent our time standing in line for a restaurant with very poor customer service. Two of my friends were not legal at the time so he refused to let us in. No apologies whatsoever. This is the last thing he said to us, "I cannot let you in, go eat somewhere else". Never have I ever encountered such a rude and unprofessional customer service from someone working at a restaurant in my life. I called the restaurant to express my complaint to the manager at least 8 times but no one picked up the phone. The voice messaging system is also always full so you can't leave your name or phone number for them to call you back. Unless contacted by this restaurant and given an explanation about this whole issue, I will not be going back to Warehouse and would not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant either.
Food was decent, but the wine service and specifically the know it all bait and switching snob of a somm will ensure I never return.Went in anticipating a great dinner and a great bottle of wine, poured over the wine list with my partner and found several great bottles...that were all mysteriously out of stock.You have a 200 page wine list that the server laughingly refers to as a 'novel' and somehow everything I picked is out of stock?The somm came over and recommended a bottle I'd never heard of, but insisted it was similar to the things I'd picked.It wasn't, I knew from the second the server popped the cheap composite cork.When I got home I looked it up - a $12 bottle that they'd charged me $44 for. I hope the profit was worth it, I'll never be back.
Poor service. I ordered something to go. When I received my order it was wrong. The young lady proceeded to tell me I ordered wrong. They attempted to correct my order by not making a new one and adding regrilling what was messed up. After paying $20, I then had to pay $1 more dollar for salsa. WOW. Food tasted less than average.
Awful place. Average facilities and very pushy annoying staff. I was called after 10pm on two different nights by someone trying to schedule and push personal training passes on me. So many people I know are fans of good life and I wish I could be as it is so convenient, but I have had nothing but terrible experiences here. They refused to cancel my membership when I asked. Do not recommend.
False advertisement!!! In new year, the stated it is the best place to see the fireworks and the ball drop. Nothing close to this. I complained w/ the manager and he said u can watch it in the TV, hahaha. We were just able to see the Monte Carlo building. We got a table and pay extra ticket to see OT Genesis that night. He did not sing or play any song.. this place sucks and had false propaganda. I drove to Las Vegas to have fun in New Year's Eve and we waisted our money in this place. Don't trust on this place at all.
Never again.  Not only will I not set foot back in Bricco, but I'll never stay at the Doubletree because of the rude manager at Bricco.  I tried to complain to the desk at the hotel and was told that the individual that had spoke to us the way he did was the Manager so not to put in a complaint until the next morning.  We were locked on the Patio and knocked to be let back in...no one came...shook the door and the Manager came and opened the door.  I assumed he was letting us back in.  Instead he told us the door was locked (as he's standing in it) and that me and my fiancee can jump the fence to get back in....Seriously?!  He then shut the door and walked back in.  Yes, we're still standing on the patio locked out.  This was at about 11:30.  I jumped the fence, went the entire way around the building, back into Bricco and to the door that he just shut to let her in.  Very rude and cost them my repeat business.  This man does not need to be in a business that deals with the public...get him in an office behind a wall where he doesn't have to be bothered by paying customers.
Oh jamba... first of all some background. I have been coming to this locations for 10 years. As a 23 year old that is a big deal for me. I have never had a company that provided a product consistently at a reasonable price other than jamba juice, so i thought. My sister worked here for 2 years and i am friends with a handful of now previous employees. The customer service is horrific, when i walk in and ask for the order that i called in, if you dont hear me you could simply ask "Excuse me sir i missed what you had said" instead i got "WHAT?!" Now i get it with the blenders running it can get pretty noisy, and had i been an elderly person whom may have a hard time hearing i could understand you yelling at me. However i am very obviously a young man with great listening abilities and would've heard yoh no problem had you just repeated yourself in the same tone. Not that you knew this but i work in a professional kitchen and am very skilled in tuning out background noise to communicate. As for the next part this is what really set me off and decide to never come back. I called in my order because i was on my way to work and assumed that if i called my order in i would be in and out. Instead after moving past the fact that im paying to be treated like on of your home girls, i stand at the juice pick up waiting for nearly ten minutes watching 3 girls continue workiing around me.  I was the only customer in the building and you could easily finish the dishes after i leave a satisfied customer. However i stood there waiting for a drink that i knew was already made sitting in the cooler as the person making the drinks wiped down her station. I had to go back to the register to find the girl that checked me out on her phone and when she was done she looked up at me and i had to ask if my drink was ready or if they needed to make it. Ever since Haley Hinds left the management has been on an exponential decline. At least when Stephanie Hasse worked there the other employees worked their butts off because fore mentioned employees created an enviroment of almost retail proportion. As an employee you should be in my face helping me or communicating with me to ensure that i come and go a satisfied customer. Instead you will probably read this and say.... "WHAT?!"
Had an appointment at 3:00 and waited 45 minutes with 2 animals. Not good at all! Terrible experience, and they never acknowledge the ridiculous wait time. To make things worse I feel like I was overcharged for service that were provided. Time to find a new veterinarian. Enough is enough. Been with hight way too long (10 years) each year is getting worse no need to be treated this way.
omg! sooo stingy with vegtables!im never going again my vegtable chop suey was a couple snow peas and 4 baby corns with bean curd!
No bueno.  La comida muy mala y me cobraron 8.98 por una margarita sin alcohol.  No medijieron que no vendian liquor cuando la ordene.  Pero vender cervezas.
Customer service here was horrible. You would think you'd help the customers that are in line to give you money before stocking the shelves. Nothing was priced. I asked for a pin the tail of the donkey game for kids and they couldn't fine it and then the employee just walked away. The girl that filled my balloons was so rude. She didn't even tie them right and made it seem like I'm inconvenienceing her by purchasing balloons at a party store. Bad vibe at this place. Stay away.
Standing here watching them get everybody order wrong. Waited 6 minutes for 2 sausage muffin no cheese. Yikes
I have been waiting a while to write this review because I was torn. I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. I think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. Anyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. Anyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.Next, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.My salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. Then,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  I also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? The bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.We didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.Its sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. We have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. Will we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower.
I went in there today because my normal spot was jammed. Never again. I even told the girl I was in for the first time, but just to get a fill. She didn't even speak to me. She filed my nails down to nothing. Couldn't even file them evenly so I had to file them myself. She filed them so hard and so fast, never even asked me if I liked the first one she did. She was awful. I learned my lesson for sure. Stick with the people that take care of you, even if you are in a rush. I shouldn't have tipped her a dime, but I've been in the service industry for so long that's not my style. She did a crappy job, and I paid for a fill and could have gotten a beautiful full set down the road for that amount. 0 stars. Go to LV nails. They take the time and treat you very well.
Gone down hill since new owners took over cheese burger Quesada was barely edible wife had chicken tenders with mashed potatoes and chicken gravey which I'll call odd colored water mashed potatoes weren't edible either
One of the most budget rooms I've ever been to in Toronto. Everything from the intro to the overall experience was completely thoughtless and done with minimal effort. Save your money!
Girl was kind enough to tell me that I always don't tip when I purchase my Pizza to go.  I've been a server/host for 5 years so I guess I don't know a thing about tipping? I guess it takes real skill to put my Pizza on a plate and ring me out at the register? I mean if she was my waitress of course I would tip her. I don't think I'm going to feel comfortable purchasing a Pizza here again...
We "used" to order the family special every week or two on a regular basis. Food was decent & value for the $ (at that time) was fairly good too. One night we ordered, the food was delivered. We paid cash & tipped well (always do, as I used to deliver fast food myself). We get a telephone call the next day saying that we shorted the driver $10. WTF? Seriously? Like the driver would NOT know this right at the door (if it were true)? We do NOT get a call that night (we ordered for dinnertime) but the next day! Clearly they got ripped off by their driver. We have NOT ever ordered from there again. Brampton's best pizza(s)..Mackay & Gusto's.
I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box.  The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM? We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  Good meat and tangy sauce.Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back.
These guys are assholes and the place is filthy.  I'd rather eat frozen Ellio's out of the box
Made us wait 30 mins before even taken Our drink orders. We were there for 2 hours in total and not because we were casually enjoying coffee. Service is absolutely terrible. Not to mention we left a pair of sunglasses on the table and immediately went back to grab them and they were gone. With the staff acting like they never saw them. Will never go back. Food is very mediocre. Was very excited to take my sister there and I'm embarrassed that's where I chose.
After visiting the real Richmond Hill Corporate run Nando's, I was surprised at how bad the service is at Markham Road. I have visited  this location a few times and have always left with a bad experience and never went back! The staff never smile or try to engage in conversation with you and in comparison to the real Nando's at Richmond Hill- this seems like a fake version. The chicken is not as flavourful and the portions are very small. Save your experience and try Richmond Hill for a real Nando's  experience!
The past two time I've come, their ice cream / shake machine is down. Super unfortunate since it's summer and 93 degrees outside.....
Not recommended. I booked and was told I would be picked up at my hotel and taken to a ticketing office and there would receive tickets for the USBR 1 hr tour of Hoover Dam for $132. Instead after  paying they gave me a different tour, NO offer of a full refund. I did not receive the Hoover dam tickets. When I called I was told I booked with their agency so they were not responsible for not providing what I paid for. The booking agency said they weren't responsible either. After over a month of back and forth including talking to managers for Airbridge and Best Tours I was given $33 back as "FULL" compensation. I paid $132. The face value of the tickets I did not receive alone was $90 so definitely not a happy customer. I was even less satisfied when I complained and $33 not even being the cost of the tickets I did not receive and still being out $99 and having never received the tour learning that the Airbridge Manager and Best Tour manager had talked and it was decided "You have been compensated" "You got exactly what you wanted."If I were to go again, which I will be to actually see the dam, I am renting a car and avoiding the bus tour. The bus "tour" was about an hour and a half driving behind motels and hotels, did not include fund Hoover Dam facts on route, and did not include Hoover Dam tour tickets which in the advertisement were included. Instead it was a $132 bus ride to walk outside the dam and see the visitor center. Definitely not worth it.
I commented on how slow the service was last August. We went last night on Taco Tuesday to meet up with friends. We were seated at 6:25pm. We left at 6:40pm after no one stopped by our table to take our drink order. Servers visited all 3 tables around us and no one seemed to notice or care. There's no excuse for servers not knowing their sections.
I tried this place last week based in the positive reviews on Yelp. Probably the worst takeout sushi I've ever had. Ordered the Kokoro combo 4 which is a combo of spicy salmon rolls and dynamite roll. It didn't taste fresh at all. The salmon was ok, nothing great but the dynamite was horrible. The tempura shrimp and sweet potato in the roll tasted like it was made days prior and was cold with a rancid oily taste. The avocado in the roll was already super brown when I opened the 'made to order' box of rolls. The rice was ice cold and unappetizing. Plus they didn't provide the good Japanese soya sauce, just the Chinese kind that's super salty and not for rolls. Won't come back.
Ok 1st off I don't expect much late night since Ive been disappointed by most places in vegas but if you're a bar that can't even get wings or a burger right - then just pls DONT EVEN SERVE FOOD!!! Why bother?You get a 1 time customer that will NVR come back cuz it's 1 thing to get bad food but it's another to get OVERCHARGED FOR BAD FOOD!!! & FYI scream when you order because apparently the waitress is deaf! She said whatWhatWHAT? after every word ugh I asked for a burger med-rare but it was so well done, I took 2 bites -seriously gross. Also ordered wings & fries -extra crispy Well wouldn't ya know EVERYTHING WAS SOGGY!!! Terrible food experience= $55Thanx a bunch Jacksons! NVR AGAIN                      *******UPDATE*******both my fiancé & I are sick from the little bit we ate/ thank God we have 2 bathrooms
I came here at 9pm and the sign on the door said they were closing at 10pm. The door was locked and the people in the restaurant were cleaning up. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the sign on the door was wrong so I knocked several times and pointed to it. For ten minutes. They aggressively avoided eye contact with me and looked at each other, laughing and chuckling. As if I'm the crazy one for knocking on the door when they should be open according to the sign they put out on their door.If you want bad service from all around incompetent and rude people, Bacus Bros is the place for you.
First night here and so far I have been unimpressed with absolutely everything. We tried to upgrade our room a week ago by phone, and was told that we could not upgrade our room until we got here. When we arrived we were told that we could not upgrade our room. Nothing else was available. Not a great first impression.Our room has a great view but it also has mascara and blue eyeshadow all over the bathroom floor. Obviously the floor was NOT CLEANED.The cocktail waitresses in the casino were rude and so was the woman who gave us our Togo food at Johnny Rockets. We have three nights left and I think at this point with the lack of service, hospitality and dirty hotel I'd rather stay my next 3 nights in a cardboard box under an overpass. I DO NOT recommend this place.
Didn't honour lunchtime summerlicious reservation made through website. Manager blamed the city's website and said we weren't the first to have this issue. I have no idea why we weren't told this when they called in the morning to confirm the reservation. Horrible customer service
My a/c went out on 6/22/11, so we made a service call for the next morning.  The technician came while I was at work, spoke with my wife.  Technician said that there was a leak and the unit needed replaced, but he could go ahead and fill it with 3lbs of freon.  My wife told him to go ahead if it would get us through the summer, and we could start looking for someone to maybe replace the unit.  So, $367 later, the technician leaves and 6 hours later the a/c unit completely dies.  I called them back that evening when I got home from work and their response? "What do you want us to do about it?"  Why would he fill the freon and charge us if he knew it would die?  Screwed again by an a/c company in Phoenix.
Went there a few times.     Their customer service is horrible.    They order the wrong sizes and fail to correct it.   Go to another scrub store.
They are just a bunch of typical  "used car salesmen". Masters of the bait and switch tactic.  the Jeep Grand Cherokee loved the dealership not so much. Do yourself a favor buy a Jeep but stay far away from this place. I'm sure there are plenty more Jeep Chrysler dealerships in the Pittsburgh area or surrounding area.
!!WARNING!! One of the worst hotels to stay in! We came here for my aunts wedding and experienced mold and chipping paint in the bathroom, dirty drain water coming from the sink, no amenities in the room what so ever! Staff is slow and unfriendly, room had food from previous guests. The casino and some rooms flooded from the rain and not to mention the resort fees they charge when there is no pool and half of the casino was blocked off due to flooding.
HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!! ., they charge a resort fee you when you check in and when you checkout.. Room service was horrible. Blood stains on the sheets, floor and bathroom!! They never cleaned our rooms!!! Mangers were not professional!!!
RESCIND prior stmnt: From biz standpnt, this is very respectable thing 2 do. Was happy w/my trnr, his enrgy/motivation & even noted in my rvw the facility seemed decent. Sure u picked up on this by my happy-go-lucky, bubbly demeanor. Positive u didnt pick up on this thru our "multiple convos," as we never had any. The depth of our encounters consisted of "Hi how r u?" Disturbed u would post "u gave many unsolicited compliments so shocked 2 read such neg things". When u called Mndy 8/17 @6pm, I had just walked in2 work & told u I would call back in AM. Our convo was less than 3 min, most of which was u explaining how my trnr quit. While I told u I was disappointed 2 hear he left & happy w/ reslts I achieved from him, I had 2 cut the convo short w/u b/c I was @ work. At no time in that 3 min did I give u "many unsolicited compliments." Also, my rvw was not overtly neg, & shift in attitude came from u not doing what u said u were going 2. Sorry 2 hear u parted ways w/ trnr 4 "very serious matters that [u] will not discuss." Being in biz is never an easy endeavor; disagreements ensue, feelings get hurt, & sometimes lawsuits arise. I can assure u that ur doing right by "not discussing" any details of the employer-employee dissolution (or is it employer-indep contrctr?), as that could lead 2 rumors. Sorry 2 hear u say he's gone out of way 2 try & "tarnish" ur co "out of retaliation & anger". I choose 2 ignore that comment b/c its hearsay & angry. Think u should take ur own advice & "not discuss" any disgruntles of ur biz relations. At no time did I have a convo w/u re contnuatn of my training w/ T (ur insinuating I currently train w/ him). I find it disturbing that once again ur having "conversations" w/me that never took place. My neg perspctv that I highlighted stemmed from actions of a reimb that never took place. 1. Refund-U did agree 2 void out the contract as evidenced by ur VCE MSG 8/18 @3pm. Full mnth was 600, I trained half (300), minus cx fee (150); there4 should have seen 150 credit. Believe u have me confused w/ another client who left AZP b/c we NEVER "discussed this in detail on the phone," as our cx convo were BOTH over vce msg (my msg 2 u 8/18 in AM when I got off work & ur rspnse 8/18 PM). Based off what u promsd in my vce msg, I rvwd u by stating "From a biz standpoint, this is a respectable thing 2 do". I was refrng 2 u agreeing 2 cx contract & reimb the remainder of Aug. However, this didnt happen & thus led 2 my neg perspctv. 2. Im aware ur website had issues, as that is something I highlighted in my rvw. Not sure how my current trnr (Shaun T) can explain why ur website had issues? Ur correct in ur stmt "our staff may not have been entirely accurate". Since site has been down 4 awhile, cant remember all the peeps who were pictured but not actually there. Believe a few of them might have been Felicia, Erik, Kristen, Michelle & Alicia (Note: May b off w/ names b/c been so long, but I dont recall seeing trnrs). 3. In re 2 my stmt "He helped me achieve my goals w/out drugs/injections". In no way was I insinuating anything AZP does aligns w/ that. I was simply making a stmt (1st Amd Rght) that I did whole diet/exercise w/out HCG or B12 injections! I read up on bikini pro prior 2 contacting u & was upfront w/my trnr that I wanted 2 do this all natural. I never in any way made comment in rvw that AZP employees use/endorse any drugs. In re 2 the trnr telling her client 2 spry Windex on cake so she wouldnt pull it out of the garbage & eat it, this was NOT taken out of context, nor was I misunderstd. I have no hearing prob. And yes ur correct, this is a bold stmt...ON BEHALF OF UR EMPLOYEE! I was disgusted & appalled; shaped my overall perception of facility. My rvw was based on facts, not hearsay, as I actually heard it w/my own ears. Hearsay is when u hear stuff thru 3rd party. Agree in that u should not take comments like this lightly. This 1 time I caught my old dog eating garbage from my neighbors toppled over can & then she got sick, so this is no matter 2 take lightly. (In no way making an accusation or insinuating my dog had eaten cake sprayed w/ Windex). 4. Clean-Glad 2 hear u clean equipment "midday, @ the end of day [&] throughout the day." I must have missed every single 1 of those cleanings in the 10 wks I was there. Now thats an anomaly! 5. Equip-The piece of equipment was out of service 4 the 10 wks I was training. Theres really not much else 2 discuss on this...ur correct in ur confrmtion that it was down 4 several wks. Have 2 say Im SHOCKED @ reading ur response. U completely overlooked pstvs & honed in on negs. 2 boot, u tried 2 twist my negs as "assumptns, insinuatns, or misundrstandngs". If Im disappointed in smthng then I should b able 2 share! Sad 2 hear u think Ive had a "change of heart" from some prior postn I never discussed w/u; unsettled that u "can definitely assume" as 2 why u believe my postn chngd on AZP from a prior postn, since Ive never expressed any postn of AZP w/u
I live in the neighborhood next door, so I unfortunetly frequent this place. I can vouch that about 98% of the time they WILL get your order wrong. I don't know how they do it. Maybe they have some kind of contest on who can get the most (or least?) amount of people to return their order. Just today, I order 2 coffees and 4 wraps (2 with chicken and 2 with ham) from the drive thru. They hand me my drinks and ask me to park and wait for my food. The guy assures me it will only be two minutes. I wait about 6 minutes. For wraps. When the guy comes out, he hands me my bag, gives a quick "Have a nice day" and walks off. I'm barely opening my bag of food before he's gone. Guess what they get wrong? The ham! They left out the ham that they charged me for. It's on the receipt but it's not in my wrap. I just said forget it. They clearly don't care about their customers enough. I won't be going back. There's a Dunkin near my job that is always efficient. I'll just go there.
This is the second time coming to this establishment. The first experience was great but the wait was way too long. this time they were busy and did not have enough staff. We got the large beef combo for $90. It wasn't even enough to feed two let alone the 3-4 that was advertised. Overall value for price paid was not worth it at all. Also the service was terrible, how many times do you have to ask for items from the waiters. Is it worth the hype? Probably not.
Terrible service.  Soup I ordered was cold.  My friend had to return her potato pancakes 3 times for being burnt.  Strudel was soggy.  others in our group never got their orders until we were ready to leave (2 hours) later.  they had to have their dinners boxed up.  Would rather go to Sterle's.
So originally my review was going to have a few more stars but took some away and you can read to see why.So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied. A manager lying and saying he will pull a receipt and refund you and not doing so, leaves a bad taste , on top of getting a simple order wrong .
I came here for one reason, the free Sunday paper. I love free stuff. Even if it appears to be absurd, like a Sunday paper. The deal is, you spend five dollars and they give you a two dollar Wisconsin Sunday paper. Okay, so know you know how I ended up here, let me tell you all about the magnificent Metcalfe's.It is just a supermarket. Not of a Safeway variety, but a Gelson's or Bristol Farms variety. Despite the many Yelpers who proclaimed that this is expensive, its not expensive. If you are buying toilet paper or paper towel here, it is expensive, but it is no more expensive on food than anyone else. I don't care about some Brat Fest, I don't even care about brats. Cheese is just cheese, in fact, if you have been to cheese stores in New York and Paris, you realize everything else pales in comparison. In fact, everything pales to New York and Paris anyway.Back to the review. The store is well laid out, clean, the produce appeared fresh. It was early on a Sunday morning, but a lot of the prepared foods were already out. They looked good, but I don't buy prepared foods in a supermarket, unless its Wegmans, but that isn't a supermarket, its nirvana. Thus I can not assess the prepared section. I do buy baked goods, and it is on this basis that the store failed. As I was walking down the bakery aisle, I noticed a slice of white cake. I love white cake. The soft, dewy white cake, enrobed in creamy butter cream frosting *cue the angels and ethereal music* Anyway, as part of my five dollars, I bought a 2.49 piece of white cake. *gag* How much sugar do you people eat? The cake was okay, but the frosting was just a sugary, you could taste the granules, nightmare. This is not white cake!!There was nothing wrong with the store, but if your bakery sucks, it is a good indication that the other prepared foods are not going to be very good and there are also some other flaws. I didn't see anything that was unique or that would make me want to come here. There wasn't any Bell and Evans Chicken. I did see they sold Boar's Head cold meats, which is always a plus, but is it worthy of five stars? No.Sorry Mr. and Mrs. Metcalfe (or whomever you are), work on the bakery, let me know and I will come back and re-evaluate you again.
Terrible, terrible, terrible. Let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, I didn't realize that is what they were famous for. Also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. My daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably Tyson). There was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. When we told our waiter he said OK then took the plate, no apology. They did bring her out new ones but like I said before they were to fatty to enjoy. They did not even offer to take them off our bill. Our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. I can't even remember the last time I have had thin pizza this BAD!! The ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and I believe it was covered in the store bought Hershey's syrup. I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. Nothing has ever been that disappointing that I felt the need to write one until now.
The vaunted Apple service is a hoax of marketing at least at the Apple store in South Park Mall in Charlotte, NC. I purchased a MacBook Pro laptop 3 months and 12 days ago to replace a 2010 MacBook Pro.  The new MacBook Pro had a defective battery and would not boot. I met with the manager and asked about the time required to have it repaired. He said the earliest he could promise the repaired MacBook Pro was 3-5 days. Since this is the one computer that I use for my business, I asked if Apple would return my money or provide me with a replacement laptop. He said under no circumstances would Apple do so. A high end laptop should not have a battery fail after 3 months. Also, because of the way components are installed on the new MacBooks, it will be necessary to replace the memory chip as well. I will lose all of my data. The manager was polite but had no suggestions. A business cannot afford to be without a computer for a week. I have been a Mac user since 1984. I suggest that Apple offer an expedited repair service for this type of situation. In summary I will be looking elsewhere for my next laptop.
Rarely do I come sonic but only when i have coupons. The little kids they had working on the night of 9/23 were loud and disrespectful. I had to repeat my order 3 times stating i had a coupon. Only to have the child raise their voice at me like she was a man. Chick needs to learn some respect and listen to the order the first time instead of giggling and acting like a complete uneducated idiot. Never coming here again and nor will anyone i hang around with.
Just left the concert, it was a wonderful concert. However, I was completely shocked at the staff. First, when I entered I was told to leave my water bottle at the front because it's metal. That being said I brought the water bottle to REFILL. Instead they'd rather you pay 5 dollars for a plastic water bottle. So I left it, as I was asking how they keep track of them I was brushed along in the line.  The security guards seem to have no issue screaming at a man for smoking but if a female was its a invitation to flirt. I wish the venue could have matched the great concert, but I was left with a stolen water bottle and no explanation. I will not be coming back any time soon.
Yelp is also a place to access honest reviews of shady businesses; and should not be used by business owners to give themselves a 5-star rating to mislead the public.  Good one, Twinkle Tan, you almost fooled me.Attempt to schedule a spray tan appointment on 3/5/2012 via text message-Me:     Hi!  My friend and I bought Enamor vouchers and noticed they are expiring soon- do you have any openings for tomorrow (Tuesday) or this weekend?  Pretty please thank you Twinkle Tan:     We have openings Wednesday Thursday Friday Other than that we are booked. Me:     Ok- when is the next Saturday appointment that you have available? Sent from my iPhone***not holding my breath, but still waiting.....
Bad.. Came here Tuesday night and initially I was very impressed. The decor was beautiful and me and my friend were seated immediately. It was kinda slow, so we expected our food to come out quickly. Food almost took around 20 minutes to arrive, and when it did we were unimpressed. I ordered the 2 piece mackerel nigiri, and my friend ordered a $15.00 roll, (forgot the name). We ended up getting 6 pieces of mackerel sashimi, with a bowl of rice (no complaints.. here.. more food for less money right? and the roll was really really small... like thinly rolled small and not worth the $$$ price tg. Ok whatever, so I'm eating the mackerel sashimi.. and I literally started choking on what I thought was ONE fish bone.. turns out there were 3 fish bones stuck in my throat and I had to HACK them out. My pretty plate setting after this looked pretty disgusting with hacked up fish pieces and bone. I told the server and showed her the bones she seemed pretty shocked, but didn't really offer any real solutions other than that she would tell the chef. 10 whole minutes later she returns with MORE mackerel.. and she said that the chef checked it super carefully this time around.I told her I didn't want any more but she insisted it was safe... I took one careful bite, and what do you know? MORE FISH BONES. When she came back I told her AGAIN, and at that point she offered to get me something else (but did not tell me it would be on the house). I did not want to PAY more money to risk more fish bones in my mouth but I might have taken some cali rolls for free at this point cause I was STARVING, but I was honestly just irritated and wanted to get out of there. She ended up offering free mochi because there would be no fish bones in there.. and took the mackerel off the bill. We ended up paying $15.00 for a bad roll, and me almost ending up at the emergency room because of the TWO times I had to pull fish bones out of my mouth. Not worth it at all, but I guess it makes for a terribly cool, but still terrible story.
My wife ate here a few hours ago. She now has the WORST case of food poisoning. We will never eat here again!
The school lacks integrity and the staff is not knowledgeable. They are only regionally accredited and cannot confer doctorate degrees that can be used in any field for specialty. If you get a doctorate degree there it is worthless. I don't even know why they keep giving them out. Many of the students cannot even transfer their credits to other schools. Most of the staff signing out doctorate degrees are signed by faculty with MBAs. The teachers are hired overseas with foreign transcripts that are not even approved by the US Department of Education.
My husband was walking to work one day and spotted this boutique. I had been looking for a good sports bra in addition to some pretty bras because I have had a bit of trouble finding my size. I happened to show up at the store at around 5:40pm and they close at 6pm. Keep in mind, I didn't know what time they closed and I didn't even know the name of the store because my husband forgot to write it down. I knew where to go because of it's location. As soon as I walked in I saw the "what the heck?" face from the sales person, yeah- I'm calling you a sales person not a bra fitter consultant, because your job is to sell. Anyhow- she was pretty rude off the bat and let me know that they were closing at 6pm and that she would "try" her best in finding me what I needed. She put me in the room, measured me and went to grab 3 bras and none of them fit. As soon at the clock was close to six she was literally trying to get me out of there. She said she couldn't find anything my size and that she would call me. I pointed to her a bra color I would also like for her to look into for me and she was very quick to respond that the bra I was looking at was for women that underwent mastectomy's. I wasn't asking for that bra! I was telling her I wanted that color. Anyway- guess what? It's been 2 weeks and I'm still waiting on that call. It's sad for the business owners because they leave their business in the hands of people that don't really care about customer service or to actually sell. I'm never going back there again.
Judging at the previous reviews. This is the worst branch that I just so happen to go to. Everything was overpriced, portions were tiny, big plate, brownie sized sandwiches this place needs a overhaul. I fear for a similar experience. I will never come to this franchise ever again goodbye.
Awful! Where is the flavor?! I ordered delivery tonight and got the egg rolls, Tom Kah soup and Authentic Pad Thai. Every single item lacked any flavor. I even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot. The Pad Thai has got to be one of the worst I have ever eaten. There is no egg, no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu. It literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime. Terrible, I won't be ordering from this place again. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else.
Overpriced Chinese food.  Not really the quality I expected from a place inside the Caesar Palace.   The food is pretty much tasteless.  Great ambiance unfortunately, that is what you are paying for. My advice, try something else. Great if you never had good Chinese before.  I have had Chine fast food that tastes better then this.
These people are below average intelligence Try to rip you off Argue with you about specials posted on the menu board in the store!Had enough of them I do not have the time to teach basic common sense !The special reads add any pizza for 9.95(Equal or lesser value )I order a pepperoni and sausage and a specialty pizza.Simple right well they say they can't honor the "2nd" pizza because it's a "specialty"What does it matter what order I say my pizza's in?Is it the darn important that you have to say the specialty pizza 1st? Common sense would be to just charge for the specialty pizza the charge me for the pepperoni and sausage at 9.95 right?Well if I have to teach them basic common sense and argue over it I will just find me a new shop!
We have gone to the buffer for years back when they had crab nightly and for us it was the best buffet ever. We always ate here one while visiting from SoCal The crab buffet  ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on Friday night so we wentWe waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm. They had several VIP lines and sat everyone in those lines before general public - very unfair. The crab legs were tiny baby crab no meat like before and poor tastingThis buffet went from the top of our choice to where we will never go back They are out of town in Henderson and used to worth the drive but  not anymore most other casinos have a better buffet and better service
I bought a groupon for laser. And im very disappointed because i didnt see any results. The technician was always very nice and kind, getting a hold of them by phone or anything was annoying. I went to all my sessions, before the last one I was offered to extend it, of course I refused because of the lack of results and I am not saying that I saw an improvement of at least 20%, maybe a 5% at the most. By the last session, the technician, always nice and kind, finished the procedure and disappeared, i went to the front desk and nobody was to be seen, i waited a bit but they seemed to be very entertained talking somewhere else so I just left feeling even more disappointed about their services and  respect for customers. I will never go back there, even if is with a groupon, is a total waste of money and time.
If I could give negative stars, I would.  Just went in for a pedi and she cut me so bad I was bleeding everywhere and it wouldn't stop.  I walked out and will never go to one of theses places again.
I'm writing this review to prevent others from wasting their money at this restaurant. I have been to Copper several times and finally accepted that the food is WAY overpriced and the service is horrible. I will not be returning. The only thing I like at Copper is the naan and with the outrageous entrée prices, being charged for a second basket of naan is tacky.Recently I went to Copper with friends for a celebratory dinner. We waited an hour for a table even though we had reservations and there were empty tables all around. We finally complained and were seated in the center of a crowded room in the back of the restaurant . My $15 vegetarian entrée consisted of a few pieces of broccoli and a thick cream sauce--this was not included in the menu description.  Our appetizers were comped only because we complained.I have never written a negative restaurant review before, but my recent experience was so disappointing and the manager didn't make much of an effort to rectify the situation. Apparently Copper doesn't value paying customers. I'm sure there are many other restaurants that will be happy to take my money.
This is a decent gym often over packed but for the price I would never complain. Until some donkey ass guys want to sit around the basketball court (not even playing basket ball), and be a sideline referee. He starts a whole big scene and then runs to the front desk to complain! How can he complain when he is only in there to start drama! The manager Claude Schutte I believe his name is (older white guy with black hair) gets so rattled at the situation he doesn't know what the hell to do. I never heard someone stutter so much who doesn't have a stuttering problem. He then proceeds to tell me he will cancel my membership if I don't calm down. He was able to muster that sentence. In the mean time the other guy is yelling at the background after he ran toThe from to tell. Lol so he makes us both leave for the day and nothing was done about the situation. Classic case of being rattled in a tough position. Get someManagement with experience to handle situations vs someone who can't handleAny situation with some aggression! I mean it's a gym what do you expect!
I would never come back here again. I know all art is open to interpretation and everyone has their thoughts, but everything I saw was completely spooky and made my skin crawl.
I can only give this company 1 star based on their disappointing costumer service. Our daughter took the Saturday class and enjoyed it. However, when it comes to scheduling the driving sessions, a total disappointment!! Let me start by saying when I initially signed up I was clear that I wanted to get all 4 driving sessions in before May 9.  I even confirmed this in an email and was of course told it would not be a Problem. But as you might assume, it was a huge problem!! The woman who schedules offers all sorts of half truths to cover for the fact that it is a joke to schedule anything. She says 3-4 weeks out to schedule. And yet she could only offer dates 6- 7 weeks out. When I asked about why it was so difficult to get in the schedule, she said it was because I live so far away.  Well when I offered to drive in to their office and have her picked up from there - Guess what?? Still no drivers available.  Additionally, because they don't have driver's schedules beyond the 7 weeks or so, I wasn't even able to get on the schedule ahead of time. Instead she told me to keep calling back on the off chance that a driver turns in his schedule. When she finally got frustrated enough with me she offered two dates. I took them, scheduled the times and everything. 1 week before the first drive I checked the website and the dates were not listed. When I called to enquirer suddenly those dates were tentative. What??? Now there was no way to get 4 drives in before May 9th.  She was pleased and quick in giving me a refund, as I could tell from her cranky attitude that she was done with me. Thank goodness. I called another driving school, and was able to get all 4 dates scheduled. About 30 dollars more and those dates weren't perfect but at least I had options and a kind person to help me. Btw, their calendar is available at least 6+ months in advance. (Not done by one lady and a pencil).  Thank you Stop and Go Driving School!
This place is horrible. I was towed from a U of I parking garage, which is fine. I get the fact that I wasn't parked in the right spot, but there is absolutely NO information on anywhere in the garage that tells you where your car would be when towed. I don't go to U of I so I had no clue and there is very limited information on the university website telling you where your car is taken. I finally figured out where I was supposed to go this morning after an entire weekend of being stranded in this place with no car. I arrived at the towing place fairly distraught and the man working there was the most unpleasant person I've ever encountered. This man gets his kicks from a predatory and mutually extortive/beneficial relationship with the city of Sham-paign by commissioning tow trucks to drive around and impound cars while giving inadequate information on how to get your car back. The other kicker is the fact that the offices for both U of I parking and Tatman's are not open over the weekend so I had to wait until the entire weekend to be over to find out where my car was and even if I had figured it out earlier, I would have had to pay an extra fee to pick up my car "after hours". Once I had gotten there, the aforementioned man working at the desk quite literally berated me in the office for trying to figure out how to pay my tickets online to get my car released. I was clearly upset at my situation and this man snapped at me and upbraided me for being stressed out with what was going on. On top of all that, the amount I had to pay total for both the ticket and the towing fee was $400 dollars which is way more than it honestly should be. Horrible place, horrible service.
Mediocre and uninspired dishes made only worse by the size of the portions and high price tag, should rank Woods as your top 10 to skip while in Toronto. My first Yellowfin Tuna was served so well-done that it no longer resembled fish; how this even left the kitchen is beyond me, as they seemed to think I was crazy for not liking it this way. The second attempt, while cooked properly, had zero flavour and the sides (poignantly touted on the menu) were no where to be found. I paid $30 for two meagre slices of tuna that could have been a sashimi appetizer at your local sushi joint. My girlfriend got served cod despite ordering duck, and aside from the over cooked duck breast she eventually received, her plate was bare aside from a few butter drenched croutons. Highly disappointing and ridiculously overpriced for pub fare.
They have messed up two of my online orders now. This time I didn't ask for it to be re-delivered, but I called to speak to a manager to at least let them know. I mean I would want to know that my employees can't read. He didn't give two s***ts about it and didn't even apologize. Sorry goes a long way, but by the look at these other reviews, these guys just do not care. Lost my business.
I have had numerous problems with Bennett. I have been trying to get my CPAP equiptment resupplied for over a month. They do not return my calls. In the rare occasion I get to talk to someone, they flat out lie to get me off the phone. Very frustrating. I am a disabled vet with few options here!
Checking out the Container Park and then decided to have a brunch at this place. First, it was a small restaurant but nice decor and setup. There was no host at all so the waiter said we could sit wherever we want. Okay, got it. Next, he poured us some water and then took the extra napkin and utensils from our table. For the next 10 minutes...tik tok tik tok... no one ever came to our table and asked for our order? I kept looking around and found so many employees on a small establishment but yet no one can ever keep up the guests? I could even serve guest by myself only with that small establishment. Soon, an employee passed by and I grabbed him and told him our order and he said.. Sorry, I am not your waiter but what do you want? Well, nobody paid attention to us??? So if he is not the waiter but can he just HALLER???? to anyone? So he took our order and then tik tok tik tok for another 15 mins. our order still not coming and yet the people right after us got already their order before us?? Umm time to stand up and walked away!!! To the management of The Perch... Please... look around your establishment...It is not hard to keep up with your customer. I can do it with my one eye closed serving guests. Let alone you have at least 6-7 employee that wasn't paying attention. Time To Gather Your People and Re-Trained Them.
The employees were nice girls, but the gel manicure and spa pedicure I received were below average. My cuticles weren't trimmed well, my feet weren't scrubbed well, and the manicure left my fingers BURNING INTENSELY for a couple hours afterwards. My hand was under the UV light and I felt some burning so I pulled my hand out and looked at it. The technician said, "Oh, is it burning?" I told her yes, and she replied with "That's weird" and kinda shrugged it off... I'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened since she obviously knew what the issue was when I pulled my hand out. The sensation would come and go with intensity. I'm not sure if it was because she got the gel on my skin and it cured, or if the chemicals in the gel polishes were low grade or had been manipulated in some way, but I've NEVER had that pain happen to me during any of my numerous manicures. I redeemed my Groupon and left... as I was driving home, the pain got worse. It was so bad, I was nearly in tears and was considering stopping at Quick Care. I am afraid to get another gel manicure from ANYWHERE after this experience and will NEVER go back. It's a shame because the girl was sweet and I'm sure didn't mean to cause me pain, she just didn't know what she was doing and will end up costing this business money.
We were told by a few friends to try this place and we went with another couple and no one really enjoyed the food at all, the service was ok and the drinks were good, but net net I would try several other places DT before this place.
Rude US Airways Gate Agent in a Friendly CityI fly nearly every week. Maybe I'm getting to be a jaded frequent flyer.  Today was one of those days that I really wanted to pitch a fit. I am booked for a flight that is scheduled to leave at 7:05. I had a shot to leave Pittsburgh airport on the 5:15 flight to Charlotte that departed from Gate B34.When I arrived, they were boarding. I approached the first gate agent and asked if I could get on the flight. She looked at me and rather shortly said "Are you Platinum or Gold?" I said "No, I'm Silver". That was it. No more words beyond that were said. I was not happy. So, I waited a bit and asked the second agent, who said, "I believe the first gate agent already answered your question". Wow.Every time I can choose to fly Southwest instead of US Airways, you can better believe I will.On the other hand, I love Pittsburgh. With 2 exceptions, home to some of the friendliest people in the country.
Valley ENT  did not send a claim to my insurance on time, currently working with them to get this fixed.
What a disaster. We waited 50 minutes for a deep fried spring roll. 1 hour + for two entrees. We were the only diners in there. No plans to return.
What the hell happened to this place, the new menu sucks, the size of servings shrunk, and the quality of the food is uber mediocre. Will not come anymore
This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. the customer service at this location is horrible. i have a contractor account and came to purchase some 4X6X12 treated posts. When we arrived in the lumber section a guy came and asked us what we were looking for, I told him and he opened the gate. With four employees standing around doing nothing, we found what we needed. When we realized how big these were we tried to ask for some help. Every one disappeared. After standing in the contractor line up for 20 minutes to get assistance we decided to try some where else. We went to Timber Town and we were in and out within 15 minutes.
Went to the Southeast Crab Feast setup at the Raleigh Seafood Festival this past weekend.  They advertise "All you can eat blue crab sessions" at 2 hours each.  My son and My wife decided they wanted to indulge.  After paying the 33 dollars each for a 2 hour "All you can eat" session, they were extremely excited.  After you pay for the session, you get a plate with 3 crabs on it.  Once you have completed those 3 crabs, you can get in line for another plate of 3 crabs when it is available (cooked crabs were not plentiful) and the average wait time in line was 20 minutes.  After 1 hour of this, they left extremely disappointed and only finished 9 crabs each for their 66 dollars.  What a rip off this is, the "all you can eat" is determined by how many servings they can provide and the time frame between each serving.  I would have rather paid 100 dollars and just steamed my own.Needless to say, We will not be attending any event where Southeast Crab Feast is serving, nor will we ever attend the Raleigh Seafood Festival again for promoting this SHAM.
Listen I have lived in southside for a couple years, and I go to primantis about once a week. They recently hired a woman with half a pony tail, half a buzz cut. (Will add a photo). My friend and I walked in, and asked for sandwhiches. She said "you know you can go to the back of the building for food" we replied "can't we get food here?". She says "I guess". After this encounter she completely ignored us for the rest of the night. I had to get my own ketchup and buffalo sauce from the BACK of the building (apparently the only place I'm allowed).
Good lord. Do people not want to work anymore. 6 girls standing around hostess stand while customers what 46 min for a seat because the kitchen is backed up. Get rolls. Get drinks. Bus tables. Do something. I'm afraid this place won't be open much longer.
Great place for a laid back drinks night. It's relatively cheap for the area and 3njpyable if you want to watch the game or chat the night away! The good- drinks specials- central location to financjal district- dead so you'll get a seatThe bad-washrooms are not the nicest- crowd is so so- Food looked only ok- drinks cheap but wine but pricy-overall place uppity for what it wasWon't be back 100$ for a few drinks? No thanks!
We will not stay here again. Parking was insane and we we couldn't get valet because we weren't casino members. Other casinos in Vegas we have not had this issue. We had to park way out behind the wheel and cart our items in the heat. The parking garage was conveniently full. We got in and staff was not overly friendly. In the room the hardwood floor was nice but our shower leaked all night and the walls were dingy. We won't stay here again, you get what you pay for in Vegas.
I only go here because they bought out Gold's Gym and my membership transferred to EOS. Don't go here between 5PM and 9PM. You will be standing around waiting forever for a machine. They don't keep up with maintenance like Gold's did, I feel like machines are broken more often and the padding is left split/worn longer than before.
So, we came here a few years ago and had a bad experience with the service and the food. Fast forward to 2012 - we decided to give the Grill another try - it was good. We continued to patronize the Grill and even told friends that we enjoyed it!  Huh, what a HUGE mistake! We went with our neighbors who were VERY reluctant but were willing to try again. To say it was a disaster is being kind. The manager Mike (yes YOU MIKE) was a total jerk. We waited a good hour for our food and my husband who ordered a sirloin burger, got his order WITHOUT the burger!  What a total joke this place is! The manager MIKE (yes YOU MIKE) is a first class worthless idiot!  There are plenty if other good places that would be delighted to have our business!  I felt sorry for the waitress who had to put up with pathetic MIKE (yes YOU MIKE)!Do yourself a favor and patronize somewhere other than the Grill.
What a waster of time and money!  My regular ophthalmologist recommended I see the same doctor who performed my previous cataract surgery (which was here) for a followup procedure.  Step 1:  Repeat the same exam I had just received from my ophthalmologist at a cost of about $200.  Step 2: Go in for an evaluation with the Surgeon ... wait in 3 different waiting rooms for over 2 hours, then leave, since I myself had appointments. Leave having accomplished nothing as I never saw the doctor!  At no point did they indicate to me it would be over an hour delay and offer to reschedule or give me any indication of actually how long the wait would be. Feels more like a surgery factory than health CARE.  I have no intention of coming back to this facility.
Very mediocre pizza. If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza.
I'll start by saying that my boyfriend and I have been to many PT's in the city and they have all been pretty awesome. We were enjoying this location until we were slapped with a bill without even asking for it and the bartender saying "here's what you guys owe, just so you know." We were no where close to finished and came here to enjoy an evening together to get some snacks and to play some Keno. We collectively put about $500+ through the machines and we were charged for mostly all of our drinks.We're not ones to ask for free items ever as we are both in the service industry and understand they have to make money as well (in which we always make sure to take care of our bartenders very well because we go off the original amount of the bill) but as a local you know it's typically customary for drinks to be comped, especially when playing the machines. (Which we played for roughly 5-6 hours for the entire duration of the time we were here.)He left and incredibly bad taste in our mouth after this action of his and we found this to be INCREDIBLY rude. After years of loyalty to the company, many long nights, many football games and thousands of dollars played through the machines we're just disappointed. I hope that things will be improved in the future. Sadly, we probably will not be visiting this location again.
Worst Wendy's I been to. Its a very slow hr few cars in the drive tru & a couple in dinning room...The dinning room was a mess while the whole staff in kitchen talking & laughing the restaurant looks messy never coming back to this Wendy's
Waited 30 minutes no help - finally got help, waited 20 more minutes for them to say they couldn't find the charger for the drill I wanted  - than $5 off a drill that was 2 times more expensive - they basically told me to get out - go somewhere else this place is a joke - asked what was taking so long and I was told "man we just transferred here everyone complains about this location".....
As I was looking for a doctor that specializes in tonsils for children I came across Valley ENT. The reviews are great and everything seemed OK I make a call in at 4:45 I'm on hold for a while. The lady who help me on the other line sounded like she was more into what she was chewing what she had in her mouth then talking to me. I was asking certain questions like do they take my insurance? When's the soonest the doctor has an opening? Are they good with children? She seemed to blow off every question I was asking her. I asked if they took my insurance and she says that we would have to call them ourselves to make sure that they are in network they take other Blue Cross Blue Shield but was unsure if they took the Michigan one. I didn't have a problem calling my insurance company but when I asked to please schedule since it was almost 4 weeks out until I can get my daughter in she hangs up on me! I try I try to call back at that time it was 5 PM and I got the answering service, it is so frustrating I wish I got her name so I could call the office manager in the morning. I will definitely be looking for another place to take my daughter to because obviously they don't care about customer service or building the patient relationship what kind of office is this? If I were you I would look at other resources than this office.
Just was not a fan. My wife and I were excited to try the place and left leaving our bowls more than half full.  Just thought flavors were off (bland), atmosphere was less than pleasant, and staff were very blah. Shocked by all the good reviews............maybe I will try it again and see if I was just delirious that day.
Horrible I went there tonight! Waited in drive thru for about 10-15 minutes .Ordered 2 orders of mash potatoes and gravy and 6 biscuits....I asked if everything was in the bag and honey and butter she said oh I got you.Needless to say I spend 12 bucks on 6 biscuits one thing of potatoes and gravy. Called to tell me he fumbled with the phone then questioned someone because I wanted to talk to a manager. Then said oh I'll put them on hold, told me they would be with me in a minute . I waited 5 because they never put me on hold just put phone down.The line has been busy for 26 minutes to call back
Be advised they only have one high chair and one booster seat. If you have multiple babies or toddlers you may want to go somewhere else.
I went to Pete's because my roommates love this place, but, I come from the Pacific Northwest.  The fish was okay, but, the fries were soggy and the shrimp tasted like breaded cardboard.  The only saving grace was the sauce they give you, but, it was weirdly spicy and I wasn't a fan of that either.  Take into account that everyone has their own tastes, but, I won't eat there again.
these bullshitters don't even try and tell you that there's an event and it's not even open to the public. An hour after they opened I got there and saw it myself then we had to go find some place else. And then somewhat many hours later they finally reply my message n tell something I found out myself hours ago. BULLSHIT! NEVER EVER AGAIN！！
Pros: -Great food (excellent steak, excellent seafood. The Iceberg Wedge salad has a smoked bacon that is really great. The tuna tar tar is also terrific and beautifully presented. And the Macaroni and Cheese side dish: fantastically flavorful, rich, creamy, delicious pot of cholesterol. Worth it!!) -Good drinks poured generously-Very good service Cons:-absolutely earsplitting music- so LOUD it's impossible to hold a conversation. In an attempt to create a high energy environment, they have eliminated any opportunity for enjoyable conversation, and drive out a lot of sophisticated people. Bad, bad, bad decision!! PLEASE just play some classy jazz at a reasonable volume or anything except that loud rock and roll. Really a detraction from the establishment's fine qualities, and honestly it ruined our meal. If the music doesn't get turned down, we'll never be back.
This place is a scammers paradise.I called AAA to have my car towed and they were supposed to take me to a car repair shop.  When the tow truck arrived (ABC Towing), the guy talked me into going a different car repair shop then the one AAA suggested.  I kept asking did he have their information and he kept saying he would give it to me  in a second.  After he had my car up on the tow truck he gave me the business card and it was for ABC auto repair....the same company as the towing company.  The tow truck driver said that they would be affordable and most likely able to repair my radiator.  And not have to be replaced.Of course, when I call to tell them what happened to my car (stupid boulders in the middle of las vegas boulevard), and that my radiator was leaking....I told them I wanted to know if they could repair it).  She said they would look at it then let me know.So she tells me that it would be $400+ for them to replace my radiator, I cant afford that. So I decide to hire a mobile mechanic (very good by the way)So I go to pick up my vehicle, and have it towed away (and of course AAA assigns them again).  They hand me this $100 diagnostic fee bill.  I told the lady i never approved a diagnostic and im not paying a diagnostic fee bill.  I told THEM what was wrong with my car - why would I turn around and pay you for telling me the same thing I told you?  I had the Nevada Bureau of Automotive Repair ready to be dialed in my phone, but she just "$0'd" out the bill, and let me go.But someone please tell me why it took over an hour for them to tow my car to a spot I probably could have pushed my car to?  You have my car, you are the tow company, why am I waiting 1+ hours to have my car towed?Save your money and avoid this place!
A great example of #poor #service . This must be the worst experience I ever had. I just want everyone in #toronto to know that #windmobile is the worst company. I should be at full speed up to 5 Giga bites a month. And look at this speed test. Their cusomter rep is telling me everything is good on his end. All BS I tell you. Scam scam scam #CTRC should get on this . While I'm here 10 months ago I signed up on plan with tab because I couldn't buy the S5 Samsung valued at 650 + tax = 735$. I had the phone for about 10 months now and made exactly 9 payments of 25$/month towards the tab which technically means 225$. So if you subtract 735 from 225 that would give you 510$ . Right ? Well wrong I called today to buy the phone and get rid of the tab payment and #wind rep told me that I own 670$ on the phone. Does this make any sense !!!!I also had complained and asked to speak to a manager but I was told that I manager will call me back. No one called me back. I don't recommend this company to anyone.
Can I rate this place a minus 10? I have never in my life dealt with people like this, this is a foul mouthed bunch of unprofessional ignorant men. They are rude and cocky and I would never go back!!
Although our server was very cordial and apologetic, service as a whole was still pretty atrocious during our experience. My friend had ordered the shrimp from the appetizer menu as her entree and ordered a side of rice to go along with it, and I ordered the braised pork which already comes with the rice. 20 minutes or so pass by and our waiter brings my friend's shrimp to the table, no rice, at this time my waiter finally remembers to bring me my beer order. We inquire about my friend's missing rice, he brings it over, then shortly after I too get my entree... no rice. I get our waiter's attention once again to inquire about my rice, about 10 minutes later my rice finally makes it to the table, but at this time my entree is no longer hot. Our food was tasty, it was a nice intimate atmosphere, they had a tiny but decent beer selection, but If you're planning on dining here better take a lot of patience with you, (probably not worth a second trip in my opinion) unless they perhaps, get a clue from other yelpers and improve on what seems to be some major communication issues within their staff?
We booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegas.com... When arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap. The technology exist today that this should never happen.  South Point doesn't care and neither does Vegas.com... All they want is your money.  This is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegas.com again.
An update to my prior review... I finally after two hours heard back from the salesman only to find out that my linoleum was at the warehouse not at the store is it was supposed to be, and it had a hole three foot in which made it impossible for me to be able two use it. I requested a refund of my money set that I was not going to do business with them. they did refund my money and I will look elsewhere for flooring. the sales people are courteous and nice but the service from the business is terrible I would not recommend this place
BUGS!! Do not eat here. Check photo posted. Dirty dishes everywhere. Bugs in the eating area. Can you imagine the rotting food in the back? Bugs in a sushi  (raw)place is dangerous!
Absolutely the worst drive in. I have never gotten my order correct and you wait a long time for service. I food is definitely overrated.
The food here I will admit is great SOMETIMES. Last time I order Chicken Fried Rice it was basically rotten BUT what is worse is their customer service, it is disgusting. If you order on the phone they change the price as they so choose. They have insulted me on the phone multitude of times and if you actually go into the store itself it is DIRTY. The owner himself is very rude and the lady is even worse and she has insulted so many people even in store. Their company should be closed down because they don't know how to treat people at all.If I could rate it in negatives I would..repulsive customer service and haphazard food. After 2 years of ordering from them I will NEVER order from there ever again
When the owner, Joey, tells me that they should be putting 8oz of steak on their steak sandwich and I only see 5 pieces and its well done when I ordered it med rare...he does the right thing.  He gives me a $20 gift card.  He gives me a promise that he'd go back into the kitchen, get the staff to make sure the amount is 8 oz, and make it right the next time I come in.  He gives me a card, with his cell to let him know if they get it right.  This was last Saturday.  Well, tonight I gave his Bell establishment that 2nd chance.  I ordered the same meal.  I ordered a steak sandwich this time medium.  I was hoping his word was gold and I was going to taste redemption.  Well, as you can see by the stars, "Eek, Me thinks not".  The steak count is 7 pieces and the weight...3.5 oz.  (we took it to go).  And again, the steak was well done.  I call in.  I talk to the manager Austin. I let him know the situation.  He wants to make it right (again).  I pass... I'm over it.  He says the next time I come in......... but I stop him and tell him there's not going to be a next time.  I just want him to relay to Joey that it wasn't right.We live in the neighborhood.  I was hoping this place would stick and we could dine here on a regular basis.  Well, unfortunately, we won't.  I see a lot of positive reviews.  So, I hope they do well.  This spot has turned over a handful of times.  And we need s solid restaurant in that location.  For me, it doesn't fulfill that need.  Only time will tell.
I've tried this place out once or twice more. Service was terrible, hardly friendly at all. The sushi is just not that good. I wish I loved this place but I can't stomach it. Extensive menu with crappy service and very mediocre food.
I don't even know where to begin...We had been here before and the first time around the food was amazing! Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how we had requested so we were excited to be back. We live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. We walked into this restaurant around 9pm for dinner with my parents and grandparents. We ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani, Chicken tikka masala, Tandoori chicken, a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It's really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so we always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived it was bland, and I mean like completely bland to the point where we were drowning it in mint chutney. We asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. It was bland! We asked the server whether he had changed the spice level in the kitchen and we didn't quite get a clear answer. My grandmother tasted the Dal and she almost spit it back out on her plate and stated that it tasted old like it had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and it was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and my dad told him that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the dal and make it spicier. We quietly finished our "dinner" and made it very clear to the server that we wouldn't be back he didn't seem to care. My grandfather hated it so much that he actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would've been a better dinner. Needless to say I wouldn't return to this place ever again. If you're looking for good, fresh Indian food I suggest Taj Palace on Eastern and Richmar.
NEVER EVER STAY HERE!!!  You will regret it.    It took me over 7 hours to get a room.  The front desk staff or awful!!  No customer service.   I will never stay at this Westin or any because of my experience.I had 9 employees with me.  We spent 11K at this hotel for the week.   All of us had to wait over 7 hours for a room.  The reason we  were told even after we complain to the corporate Westin was the following:  " As stated this was our peak check in time" WTF People!!!!    Every hotel has a peak time.   I travel every week for work.  I have Never had to waited 7 hours for a room.Then after waiting this long.  I go to my room and it had NOT been cleaned from the previous guest.  I go back down to the not so friendly front desk.  And I was told.  "yes it is"   I said no it is not.  Room service from the previous night is still in the room.  the sheets or on the floor and trash is everywhere.  I was told  "Well the computer says it is"   Do you still want this room?   WTF!!  really!!!   I had to wait another 45 minutes to get a room.   Then I get to this room  NO WATER!!!!     I did not have any Hot water for the four days I was at the Westin.    POOR  POOR  POOR SERVICE and they do not care..   No gift shop.  No place to get bottle water, coke etc.    DO NOT STAY AT THIS PLACE!!!   It is ran by and bunch of idiots!!
My wife and I have been customers forever and the lack of customer service received at this store was appalling. We went to this store, received nothing but attitude from the associate, Bianca when we were trading our phones in for the $200 credit we were promised by the GM himself. This credit was part of a promo given when we renewed our contract two weeks before, which we completed with the GM. We came back two weeks later to get our iPhones that were out of stock the first time we went in. Instead, she wanted to give us $38 (where that number was from, couldn't be answered from her either) for our trade. After telling her, her own boss promised us the full $200, she said that we were wrong. We asked to speak to someone else, she refused. We confronted another assoiate and told him that she said $38 and he even disagreed with her. We asked to speak to her manager, then magically she came back stated that her manager on duty would override and give us the $200 credit. She was completely unprofessional and rude and it made our experience at this store annoying and horrible.
This is a scam organization. Overcharged without notification. No statements sent. Basically rent-a-center for healthcare. Do yourself a favor and price out your unit and then talk directly to your insurance provider to see if they will cover purchase. The monthly charges are completely absurd.
Yikes! I just pulled up and they are closed. It's only 6:10 pm. I was so eager to try a portion of everything too. F me!
I understand it was New when I went. So they were still getting their stuff organized. But the manager/owner  was yelling at employees in front of customers. Our food ended up being cold. It was also not fast. And I didn't think the price was worth the product. The udon at all you can eat sushi places taste better. The broth was bland... They told us to come back. I'll wait a while maybe it'll be better. We ended up spending almost 50$ on 3 people. That's a decent meal somewhere else.
Went back a second time, I found the burrito to be decent again, but I'm finding their cash/prep staff to be seriously lacking customer service skills, standing at the cash waiting to be served, I smile I say hello and I just get a vacant stare, fine... i'm not sure if she is ready for my order or what but I went ahead and ordered my burrito...the girl who is reluctantly "serving" me seems too pre-occupied with the music playing and joking with the cook..., she rushes through prepping my burrito, and I ask for a bit more sour cream, which seemed to throw off her rhythm, she looks up at me obviously annoyed. I'm getting a "I'm really too cool for this place" vibe from the cash people, they just seem to be a fairly unfriendly lot in general. It's not horrible service, but you definitely get the feeling that they want you to hurry up and order so they can get back to dancing, goofing off and acting cool.  Its sad because I was very polite to her and found the lack of customer service quite annoying and unfair, now I'm not looking to be best friends with these people, but it would be nice to not get attitude, especially when you are being polite and friendly to them. My advice to them is, if you are too prideful, and think you're too cool for your job, give it up, quit and let someone that actually needs one and cares about being employed take your place. It's hard to want to return to a place where the people that make your food are annoyed because, they are making you food...*** And to add, I even messaged the owner who previously complimented me on my first review, and told him about my disappointing experience, and of course, I got zero response, apparently they are only interested in positive reviews, they don't want to learn about or address their weaknesses. *** Too bad so sad.... I'm done, customer lost... for what it;s worth, Fat Bastard Burrito's are 1000x better anyway... they are more authentic and don't take 20 minutes to make... And they have fantastic customer service, they always seem to be happy and thankful to get your business.. unlike this place...
I'm extremely sad to give this one star review but I feel like this is one of the only ways to get my voice heard. I love capriotti's and have been a weekly customer for the year I have lived in Las Vegas. Tonight I ordered my usual Chicken Cheese Steak from Capriottis, it's one of the only things I order there, other than the Bobbie. My wife picked it up on her way home, after a long day (we wanted easy dinner). When she got home she savagely ripped into her sandwich excited for the cheesey chicken goodness. She took a bite without looking only to be surprised it was beef. She spit out the bite and put it back on the plate she was eating it on. I volunteered to call and go back to the store for us and replace the sandwich. When I called and explained what happened (this has happened before, no big deal), I was asked to BRING BACK THE WRONG SANDWICH. I have had my order wrong before and this is the first i've heard of this. The town square location literally will deliver the sandwich if they get it wrong. Anyway, I drove back to the store with the sandwich bag and gave the guy working (really nice guy) my sandwich. He opened the bag and looked and said "There is only half a sandwich here..." I remembered that I only brought 1/2 the sandwich back because the other half was still sitting on the table. I said "Ok.. well I thought the purpose was to make sure you in fact made the wrong sandwich- which you obviously did". He then calls Carl Zwick, the "district manager". Carl informs him that I am only to receive half a replacement sandwich because I only brought half my sandwich back. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I go to this capriotti's a couple times a month, bring all my friends there when they are in town, etc. This is how you treat your customers? Carl Zwick, if you read this- you really need a lesson in customer service. First of all, mistakes should be expected when you are making food- it happens. However, the mistake should be rectified with as little to no hassle for the customer. I already had to drive back to replace it, wasting more of my night. Is half a sandwich worth losing a repeat customer from your location?
Well, it used to be so great! but as of recently many things have changed! (1-14-14) The prices are still the same, yet the quality of it has decreased a bit. I use to LOVE their salads, and i kid you not i could not find sufficient lettuce in a salad. They also used to supply a little bag of chips No extra charge, but now the policy has changed and you must purchased the chips. Which is Fine, but then when i got to my smoothie...oh boy it was watered down sufficiently. It's not even a smoothie anymore more like JUICE! So UPSET! i doubt i will be visiting again.
Long story short, I ordered 2 dinners from Uber Eats and got a confirmation saying that the orders were accepted and should be delivered. When I received my food, a whole order was missing.. I called 5 times before the manager "Jackie" got on the phone. She said there was no order for 2 dinner plates only 1. I let her know that I was charged for 2 and was expecting 2 as my confirmation receipt shows, she said for the inconvenience I can pick up a new order. I let her know that I was unable to pick up, hence why I utilized Uber Eats, she was totally unapologetic, didn't even offer to reimburse me for their mistake, just said "We can't deliver the food you can pick it up" Will never order from here again, should have took the bad reviews as a hint! I will be contacting Uber eats to get my money back; if not I will be paying Jackie a visit!
I would give this place zero stars after the experience my friends and I had last night. We waited 1 hour to get in which was not a problem because it was expected being that it's Memorial Day weekend. Once we get to the front we stand there for another 5-7 mins and then the doorman told us that our guy friend could not get in because he was wearing camouflage print. He began to state that women can wear whatever they want but men can not. We asked if there was anything anywhere stated about the dress code because we tend to recommend this place to a lot of our guest that stay at our resort. He said it's corporate that has these dress codes in place. So still confused and embarrassed we begin to get out of line he whispered to us that if we slide him something he will talk to management and let us in. At that point we are all offended because is that the dress code or not because I can give you money on the low to get in and then on top of that still pay $40 just to get in. So how is that ok to tip the doorman so he can speak to the manager to allow my friend in. Had we had "slid him something" would we have been kicked out once security or a manager spotted my friend in his camouflage and have to leave?! That was the worst experience and the fact that we had other friends who were planning on coming that night was a huge mistake and I can no longer recommend this place to anyone else because of the bad service from the doorman.
Really bad service at this location very bad attitude from Bernice and the manager Lettica.We went through the the drive thru and order 5 meals when we got home we were missing one of the order, we called the store to tell them we were missing a order, the manager Christine told us that they would replace the missing order, just come back next time and mention her name and that she would leave our name on a board for us.When we went to order our replacement order we talked with Bernice at the counter and asked to speak with Christine and that she had promised to replace the one order that we paid for on our last visit.Bernice told us that there was no information that she could not find for us and that she could not replace the missing burger, I did ask to speak to the manager, which Bernice told us that the manager was busy, I did then ask her for a district manager name and number. Which she refused and walked away from us.The manager Lettica did finally came out to explain to us that they have homeless people trying to get free food from them, I was not looking for a free meal, I was looking to pay for 4 meals and see if I could get the meal I paid for on the last visit.After being compared to a homeless I then took my business elsewhere.I still would like to hear from a district manager to let them know how disappointed I am with this store.I know going through the drive thru this does happen, but going inside to recieve this kind of service is not acceptable.

Definitely not a store to purchase Men's Suits!You are only allowed to buy what Macy's wants you to buy.  Not what YOU want to buy. The customer is definitely wrong when wanting to spend money in this establishment.
Wow.....where do I begin...The one rating was for the lady wearing The Vegas Knight Jersey other than that...service? boy oh boy....a negative all the way..she did not look happy at all....very slow and this ONLY server had a RBF look from beginning to end. Food for the price??? Sonic will give you better service n better quality food. Unhappy
Satisfied with food. Problem is you have to wait at least two hours to be seated. Then when you do, you get a servant who forgets to bring the bread and butter unless you remind him of it. Then there is at least another half hour waiting to get your food. Remember not to go here with you are crazy hungay?!?!?? Like I was.
The food looked like it was prepared in old grease and had a taste to match. Wings and fries were over cooked and dry. It's cheap but you definitely get what you pay for. I won't ever be back. I would rather not eat at all.
The most disgusting pizza I have ever eaten.  Nothing but salt and no cheese.  Ugh...will never order from them again!
Originally I had given this HT 5 stars, but after 2 awful incidences they are going down to 1. 1. I (mom) had ordered a cake for my son's birthday. My husband had gone to pick up the cake (dad). He had no idea what I ordered but just picked it up for me. When he brought home the cake I had noticed they did not write Happy Birthday with my sons name on it. when I called they immediately started to blame me for not telling the lady what to write, or to write anything at all. I calmly explained that I did, and I distinctly remembered as she asked me how to spell his name. He offered a refund, but I was just irritated that I would be to blame and why didn't my husband say something. 2. Today I was standing in line with just a few items. A cashier came up to me and said she could help me on another aisle. I started to walk over when another customer who didn't realize I was coming walked ahead of me to have his cart rung up. I thought she would tell this customer that I was actually next since she asked me to come over. But NOPE! She started ringing him up, even looked me in the eye and ignored me. I even said "seriously?", she looked up at me and shrugged her shoulders and continued on with the other customer. Would have been pretty easy to explain to the other customer that I was actually next, especially cause I only had a few items. Guess that will be the last time I shop there!
Asked 6 bartenders prices on draft beers. None knew pricing on any of the draft beers. Wholly unacceptable when you are a brew pub.
They will rip you off your hard earned money. $450 for a key replacement is INSANE!!! Its unfortunate that i was left with no option but to go with them as i don't have a spare key to drive to the dealer and they knew it. The dealer quoted $180 for the same job. Do yourself a favour and take your car somewhere else. You will thank me later.
This was honestly one of the most disappointing stays I have had in a very long time.  I was keeping my loyalty with the Marriott Brand and chose to stay at the local Westin even though my event was at a competitor's conference center.  I started my stay in a room with a beautiful view but the vibration from a fan was so powerful It began to hurt my ears (which I found out after the fact was a complaint in the past).  I was then moved to a different room.  I was so tired at this point that I just wanted to get rest, but upon entering the light was out and the bathroom had the previous guest's hair all over it.  I had also "made the green choice" and came back to find my room had been cleaned.  This is typically not a problem, but I found a cleaning rag under my clothes!  My stomach was in knots just thinking about why my stuff would be moved and a rag underneath.  I didn't feel that management took my concerns seriously and just brushed it off as an error in the system as to why someone was in my room.  Furthermore, being there on business, I needed to use the business center to print and scan some documents.  Their printer was not working and there wasn't any concern to fix it in any hurry.  To end it, our conference was to end at 12:30 and my flight to leave in the evening.  Because of a concert, the hotel would not honor late checkout (even for 1 hour for me to return, freshen up and head to the airport).  This was certainly not your typical Westin Experience so please consider your options.
I stopped by here at Jackson's a couple months ago and I havn't been able to write a review but what happened needs to be seen on here. I went in short on time so I thought I would drop by just to see if I could get a quote about cleaning my car seats (some stains on them). I talked to a guy and showed him my car seats, I simply asked him "Is this something you guys could clean?" He responded with "Oh, I'm not sure, probably not all of it." If they can't, I totally get that but I'll have to go somewhere else. So I just thought ok I don't want to do business here especially if they are confident that they can get done what I need done. I told him that I'll think about it but he proceeded to tell me that if I want to buy the cleaning it would be $50. I said that I'd think about it and maybe come back tomorrow. Then he said that he'd throw in some free waxes, washes, and stuff that's worth like $200 and he said he would only charge me for $119. I told him the same thing "I'll think about it maybe come back tomorrow" it was so clear that he was working on commission. At this point I was pissed. This guy would not stop and he said he'd give it all to me for $100. I told him no and he just said "whatever and walked away in disgust". I tried to tell him I'd come by tomorrow Because I don't have time and he was like "But you can pay right now and than come by tomorrow." He was awful. He was Tall, skinny, and had a beard. This was such an awful experience. I had never been to Jackson's before and actually went here because someone I know told me that y'all did some good work.
Their quality of work has diminished in the last few months. I use their dry cleaning services for my work clothes, and recently, my items have been coming back shrunken or damaged. Now, I know I still have a little post-baby weight to lose around the middle, but in pretty sure my legs didn't get longer during my pregnancy. At least I have no shortage of highwater pants thanks to Won Cleaners!
Horrible experience. It was first and last time I will go there. Had to wait while the host was on the phone, then seated at a table where there was a couple with a small child needing a high chair that made the seating situation incredibly tight. Once we were seated, we had to wait another 10 minutes before our server took our drink order. Then we waited another 10 minutes before he took our order. Two other couples at the table had been sitting there for close to a half hour. Meanwhile tables that were seated after us were getting served. I was really looking forward to eating there. Guess I will find another tapinyaki restaurant to go to.
If you love your self and the person(s) you are with, I urge you not to take them here. My friends and I have made a few mistakes in our lives and this is certainly one of them. We ate there Wednesday night (it's now Friday as I am writing this) and some of the people in our party still had stomach aches until this morning. The food looked good, but it wasn't. EVERYTHING had a sweet taste to it and nothing was a few degrees above room temp, so there's no telling how long it had been there. The sushi selection looked rough, but I noticed a few brave souls trying it out. Hopefully, they didn't get sick like all of us did. Service was ok, nothing really stood out. I don't think any of us will be returning.
Twice i have ordered the Asian Chicken Salad with Mango and twice they have given me a salad without Mango. It's the main ingredient!I emailed to let them know thinking it might be a mistake but they never bothered to respond.Terrible service & food not as advertised.Dont bother
I hate having to write this review, but alas our visit at this hotel was gross to say the least.  The Flamingo is generally a go to for our Vegas vacations, we usually stay in the newly remodeled "Go Rooms" which are fantastic! Clean, cute and a great location. However, this visit we booked a "Fab Luxury" room. I didn't realize what a difference there was in the rooms! First of all it took over an hour to check in because it was overcrowded and under staffed. That's all fine and dandy, stuff happens right? Now, we finally got to our room, after an exhausting and hot drive to Vegas, only to be repulsed upon entry. The bead spread (which is furry for reasons I can't figure out), had some funky, brown, sticky goop on it that caused the fuzz to all clump together in some disgusting pink clustergunk.  Ok, gross so I pulled it off the bed and tossed it aside. We continue to settle in and realize that the lamp table and floor beneath are COVERED in sticky nasty mystery sludge, to the point that I can make out footprints in the gunk.  This is followed by the discovery of clumps of hair on the bathroom floor and a filthy tub. This was all enough for me to be seriously grossed out. We tried calling the front desk to no avail. So, I marched down to speak to someone in person.  The girl at the desk was very pleasant and informed me that normally they would move us to another room, but because it was booked solid she would have someone come up right away to clean. We waited, and waited, and then we waited. Nothing, the entire night. We went to eat, walk around and still no one had come. The next morning, we went out and about for the day and saw that someone was coming to clean our room, excellent! So we thought. We came back to the room after a few hours to find that everything was exactly the same, save for the made beds and a few new towels. So, again I go downstairs to speak with someone. I am told once again that someone will come clean right away. We go to our room, and wait. What do you know...someone came. A grumpy, disgruntled, irritated woman came and aggressively scrubbed the goop off of the floor and table and then handed me some towels and left.  Overall, I was extremely disappointed by The Flamingo. The food court was closed the whole time we were there, our room was absolutely filthy and the pool closes at 6pm (how lame). Next time around I think we may just spend a little more and stay somewhere with some standards. Massive fail Flamingo.
Zero stars...A  group of friends and I reserved a table for $1000 and 40 minutes later it was sold to a bunch of hooligans willing to pay $5000.  Loud obnoxious and horrible customer service.  Go here if you are a masochist and really hate yourself.
This place by far has the rudest employees I have seen in a long time! So unhelpful, made it seem like I was such an inconvenience when asking a simple question.. I first called multiple times and the phone just rang continuously, so I made the drive down there from glendale and asked to speak to a manager and she was busy! Yes that's what the gentleman told me! I will never be back there!! I will also spread the word of how terrible their customer service is! If you do not like working in that industry find a new job!
I have had a manicure and pedicure twice at Kelly's. They are close by and always available to take a new customer. My pedicure was well done. The manicure was not. She cut my cuticles and left hang nails but the big issue was that I  got a fungal infection from the manicure tools. She put the tools in alcohol for only about 10 seconds. I've had to go to my Dr in order to be treated. I would not recommend this salon.
We ordered this Monday night after a busy work day. Generally a fail safe, as you know what you're going to get. Not this time. I got my own pan pizza, which saved my boyfriend who got his own pizza, from being violently ill for 3 days. Im still feeling the stomach pain, although not the terrible twisting of death i was the days before. I phoned to inform them of what happened and of course, just as i thought, the person i spoke too did not care or say anything worth anything. I explained how I didn't want anything, just that they should probably know. They proceeded to tell me that i would need to see a doctor to prove what happened. I honestly do not care nearly enough to pay $10 for a doctors note to prove this. I am just warning other people that this was by far the most painful sick i have ever been in my life. Violently awful and lasted for days now. Please beware...
Worst branch of any bank I have ever visited , went every month for last so many months and every time they tell me issue is fixed you won't have any problem now . Fed up and finally closed my account today.
I would give negative stars if I could. They are 100% helpful if you are going to buy something there, but not when you have problems with your apple products. I had battery problem with my iPhone 6s and went there for help. One staff came and check some information with me, and told me a TECHNICIAN would come to help me 1.5 hrs later.  Actually there was no technician there and the guy who finally came to help me was already there during that 1.5 hrs!! He had a basic diagnosis and told me they would change the battery for free (the phone is still under warranty ). Sure. When I arrived there the next day, another lady picked up my phone and told me I had to pay ~80$ for the repair because the warranty had expired. Excuse me?? I know when I bought the phone and it should be under warranty. Good that she went back and figured it out.This was not the professional customer service I was expecting. Totally disappointment.
I had stayed at this place during Memorial Day weekend. When I reached at hotel there was no self parking available so have to do valet parking. Hotel room was very substandard wasn't clean, wash basin were getting clogged. Furthermore while driving back to home I found many stuffs like drug bottle (Medical Canabbis), cigratte making papers etc. I was shocked and annoyed to find these articles from my car. I complained about it to Hotel Valet manager but he said none of his employees can do it and ask me to send evidence so that he can investigate on it. Till now I haven't heard back from him.
Zombie Brunch: False Advertising We went with our kid and nieces expecting a Zombie Brunch, but the only Zombie-like thing was a couple of servers behind the bar wearing make up. There was no special decoration and no special items on the menu.  I checked on an old post about the Zombie Brunch from 2012, when there was a special menu and it certainly look more fun http://www.thedrake.ca/blog/2012/10/zombie-brunch-drake/  We live uptown and the only reason we went to The Drake was to have a Halloween experience we DID NOT have. We could have gone to any other restaurant since there was nothing special about this.
Dumbest cashier. Slowest service. Highest prices. Mediocre-est food. Just hoping I don't get food poisoning at this point.
Change management and has gone down hill. It's slow, portions are smaller and the staff is terrible. They also raises the prices. I would have been happy to pay the new prices to the previous management but not fit what you get now.Missed opportunity.
This is hands down the worst coffee unless you like coffee flavored water. I should've went to tim Horton but this place was closer so I gave it a try. Over priced, nice people, terrible coffee.
This place is horrible! Its so  close to the street that it feels like I'm sleeping on the sidewalk because of how loud it is! The apartment my boy friend got smells like a rodent cage! What a shitty place to move someone into a place that smells like crap! It's not far enough west so it's still in the ghetto I even seen some kids cussing each other out and fighting by the play area! I hate it here!
I hate to write negative reviews, but I had no choice for this restaurant....Let me start by saying that the staff was extremely friendly and nice.  But that's where it ends.The food is very, very, very poor in quality.  I tried a small portion of about 15 dishes, and was not impressed by a single one.  I didn't expect gourmet food for $13, but the quality was very bad.  The shrimp looked and tasted old.  The rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, etc were really bad.  The ice cream had frost on it as if it's been sitting there for 6 months.It might be fun to take small children who want to eat new foods; but I definitely don't recommend it for adults.
I was so excited for my sons 2nd bday party. It was aweful!! The host was everything but a host. A guest passed out cake and my husband stood at the door to hand out goodie bags. My party was from 4-6 and at 5:30 she started cleaning around people making it very awkward and guests left early. She was wearing a lower cut dress and I now have her cleavage in the pictures of my son blowing out his candles. When I booked the party I was told that each child gets 2 pieces of pizza, they actually get 1 slice cut in half. I had 15 children and 2 babies, I was charged extra for the babies even though they never left their mothers arms. She wasnt a kid friendly person and would just hollar out that it was time for cake or pizza, getting nobodys attention I was forced to round up the kids and get them seated. She started a "soda tab" and they charge $1 for a can of soda. At the end of the party I had spent $100 more than planned on sodas, extra pizza and the ridiculous 18% gratuity that was added on to my bill. A $45 tip was not what I had in mind for her. When calling the owner to discuss my issue she did NOTHING to resolve it and might have well just called me a liar because she defended the host to the very end. I will not recommend TOY TOWN to anyone!! BAD BUSINESS!!!!
I usually like BWW but this place was bad. Pretty empty when we got there at 8pm, a couple of 8-10 people groups came in and there was still plenty of room. First sign of trouble, "I'll have a ... IPA, draft", comes back in a bit "we are out of that", "I'll have the Dogfish 60 IPA" (a pretty standard IPA), comes back in a bit "we are out of that, how about a Stone IPA", "Sure" I say, comes back in a bit "we are out of that", WTF? My wife orders coffee, "we are out of creamer, we do have milk", OK, whatever. Put in a order for wings, pretty simple, it's in their name, it took 1/2 an hour for them to show up. They would stop by every 5-10 minutes to see if we wanted a beer refill, no thanks, I'll finish my food and get out of here.
This place is a joke. They don't honor their own coupon. On the phone they said $80. I go, coupon is no good for the iPhone. I ask to talk to the owner. Twice. He then comes out and now says the price is normally $99. That's funny, I never told them I had a coupon when they first told me $80. What a joke. Never ever ever will I go back.
Ordered 5 pizzas at 11 for 11:45 pickup confirmed waiting for 25 minutes and pizza still not ready. Got an "oh sorry".  I watched 5 customers leave.  One said, " let's go for office max we stand a better chance of getting food."
This is the first one star I have ever given on yelp, mainly because there are usually redeeming qualities to any establishment or business. NOT this one, avoid it like the plague. The Older Indian lady there is by far one of the most defensive and rude individuals I have ever encountered. Walk inCharged 3 dollars for using email to download a file Black and white machine broke down so forced to print in color with no discounts.Stays on the phone out of site for 3 minutes while I wait to pay the outrageous charge of 3 color pages for 5 dollars Proceeds to ignore me in sight while still on the phone not coming to work the cashierWhen I called her out for poor customer service became unintelligibly defensive and rudeAgain avoid like the plague I plead to you all U of T students!!! I would give negative stars if I could I hope the business goes bankrupt to be honest.
The food was ok...once we got past the rude host at the front (maybe the maitre d'  - a tall guy with a mustache & little beard). We arrived at 3:52 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game. He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant.
I would give zero stars. I came here with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night only to be told that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table to be cleared. By this time we had already been waiting 15 minutes. I'm sorry but it does not take 15 minutes to clear a table. I should have offered to help clear it! There were no other people waiting for tables, but the server's excuse was that they had to clear other tables. This isn't the first time I have experienced bad customer service at this location. We left and will never come back here again.
What an unpleasant experience...Birdsong not open yet so I came across this place...totally uninterested and surly barmaids, obviously not interested in serving a new customer....one tells me the beers, I ask for a sample, she walks off...another serves the sample, I order a pint for me and my friend from Texas, she tells me she can't serve me two beers at once per state law...I take my beer outside to the table and then return for his beer...what BS...start a tab? Nope, we finished those subpar beers and left...needless to say no tip and won't be back...apparently you have enough patrons who aren't treated this way or put up with it...on to Divine Barrel for a   5 star experience...Heist is aptly named; glad to see others have also had a bad experience here so it's not just me...hey Heist: without customers you don't exist. Plenty of great breweries in CLT, you ain't one of them.
Flowers ordered through 1800flowers and this was the local florist contracted to fill the order. The flowers arrived a day late and looked no where near what was ordered. There is a difference between substitution and down grading the order.
Never having heard of it, I was looking for any type of tea to help with my husbands sinus infection so I tried this place. The guy was honest about not having what I needed but quickly swept me over to check out skin care. After thoroughly insulting me and telling me how badly I need colagan (I'm a baby faced 30 yr old) I allowed him to apply their "remedy". He insisted there was a difference, saying one side of my face looks "happy and awake" and the other is "soggy. I told him I couldn't see a difference and then made it clear that I wasn't buying anything and he immediately got nasty, telling me how badly my soggy face needs it and then he decided to just ignore me and treat me like a bum. Thanks for nothing guy. I came in bc my husband is sick. I didn't need to you to tell me I'm old, gross and my face is falling apart. I just wanted yea.
UNDERWHELMING with a capital U. Starts with the decor and layout.  Person at next table was back to back with person at our table.  It's one thing for a place to be intimate but another to be flat out cramped.  Then they have these red metal chairs that are completely uncomfortable.  They look cool but are much more form than function.  Next, we sat right by a giant flatscreen that seems out of place where it is hung on the wall and it was even weirder that they had cartoons playing on it the whole time although I only saw one child in the place, who was not even facing said TV.  The service was really really awful.  Fumbled the drink order and then took forever to finally bring drinks, so much so that most of us decided not to order a second round even though we were there for quite a while.  Server went MIA for long stretches at a time but it was not that busy on this particular night so it was just odd.  He may have driven to BevMo because the bar was also out of stock on some things.  Appetizers and salads were just nothing special.  Had a wedge salad that was uninspired.  I get less being more but there is also less being truly less.  The main entrees I will say were good but would need to be outstanding to make up for the rest of the flaws here.  Server admitted they were not on their A game that night.  Understatement of the year.  Gave us a ten percent off card which seems more like a Denny's tactic.  I threw it away.  You'll shrug and live with sucktacular service at some places but not when you're dropping $100 for two people.  This city has way too many good restaurants for us to go back.  So we won't. I hear their catering is awesome but maybe they are working out the kinks for a restaurant.
My hubby just went to pick up our order of Mu Shu Pork, shrimp toast, pork egg rolls, and pork fried rice.My husband was concerned at the dirty front of house, but we dug in none the less.The shrimp toast was almost black from dirty oil and fell apart.  It really didn't taste good either.  The egg rolls we just so so.  The Mu Shu was ok too ( greasy) but it was supposed to come with 4 wraps and we only got 3 (not great when you were expecting to split it).  The pork fried rice was greasy and the rice was undercooked.  All in all we were disappointed and after reading other reviews I think we will not be back.
HORRIBLE SERVICE AT THE COFFEE BAR! The woman behind the counter had zero patience during a busy day and was very rude while we were ordering! It was our first time here and our last! Such horrible service !
Despite me having given them all of the information requested from me, North Scottsdale Women's Health did not (and still has not) submit all the correct forms to my insurance agency, which is the provider's responsibility. Michele then put my account in collections without notifying me. I only found out because months later I tried to book an appointment to get a prescription refill and was told I couldn't due to my account status. Because of that, my credit score has gone from "very dependable" to "very risky" in a matter of months. The billing manager did not apologize or express any regard for me as a customer. She was impolite on the phone and stated haughtily there was nothing she could do. As a previously loyal customer, I'm highly disappointed in my experience, particularly due to the billing manager's service and NSWH's supposed inability to pay the $200 it owes to the insurance company.
Horrible experience, booked a limo received multiple confirmation emails charged our account. When the event came no call no show leaving us to scramble. 5 days later and still have not received one call or email from anyone at limo lux. If you want a good experience and a smooth night DO NOT USE this company.
Horrible no decor it feels like a big warehouse the bartenders were drunk and more interested in throwing ice at the nice tvs and down girls tops then waiting on the only 2 people gambling. Second time there and last time there.
I will never rented from them.My friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car.I called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company.That company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.Finally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.Also, we made reservation a middle car for $120, but last day, they required $210 which include insurance.Even when I called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.Be careful about total fee and I do not recommend ask them to rent a car.
and this is why you have to yelp things before you decide to drop-in a random restaurant just because you happened to be hungry but in an area you're not familiar with.this place is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.service = disgustingfood = DISGUSTING (how could you serve slimy sushi like that? our salmon was streaky with brown spots on it!!!)can't believe i ate here.. my poor tongue and stomach.
These people are thieves.  I don't go to the casino expecting to win.  But I asked an attendant to hold my machine while I went to the restroom.  They said they could.  I came back from the restroom to find no attendant and my $200 gone.  They said they'd help, then left me sitting at the machine for 2 hours.  I got the impression they were just waiting me out.  Absolutely awful experience.  I'd recommend taking a road trip before gambling here.  Unethical.  As an update, they left the information for me to contact them.  I did and never received a reply.  They do not care about their customers at all.
Not sure what's up with this place?  I have driven by 3-4 times in last two weeks to get some wings to take home and it's been closed every time and phone is disconnected.   Not sure if they haven't got everything up to speed yet or what their issue is.  Perhaps the owner can respond here to let everyone know what's going on.
We were in the market for a new car seat for our toddler, and my husband had been doing a lot of research online to figure out what would suit our needs best. Sears ended up carrying the lowest price of the model we decided to purchase, so we headed to The Boulevard Mall location this weekend. Once we were downstairs at the baby section, we found the selection of car seats. We noted the price was not what they had advertised online. We located a friendly employee that stated she was not on the clock yet, but was still helpful to us, indicating that we could speak with someone upstairs about the price difference and that they'd bring the car seat up to us upon purchasing.My husband got in the short line for customer service. The guest before him was rudely interrupted by another customer waving a purse and cutting in line to make a purchase. The clerk took care of the rude customer first, only apologizing for the wait to the guest in front of us after the rude customer was out of earshot (we can only assume that the rude customer was either a friend of the clerk or a fellow employee, but who knows). And once it was my husband's turn, he explained the price difference between what he had seen online with the same model they had on the shelf downstairs. She stated that the sale price was online only, even though we could find no evidence of this, and that if we wanted that sale price we'd have to buy it online.So my husband said he'd use his phone right then and there to buy it online, expecting to be able to pick up the same car seat at this location, but the employee told us that it doesn't work that way. If we wanted the item right then and there, we'd have to pay full price. If we wanted the online sale price, we'd have to pay for it now, but we couldn't pick up the item until a code was emailed to us, which would take two hours or so.We found it ridiculous that they couldn't price match their own website, especially when the website had no indication that it was an "online only" price. We also found it ridiculous that we'd have to wait hours after paying to receive a notification to be allowed to pick up the item that was already waiting right there on the shelf. Sears really needs to get with the times. Rather than dealing with that mess in order to save a measly $15, we left for Walmart to buy our new car seat.
People here don't know how to do their jobs. All I simply had to do was to change the name on my claim title and had to come back FOUR times because each person told me different things on what had to be done. Thanks for wasting my time because y'all can't do your ONE damn job.
I have been here several times. One time, they got me mixed up with another patient (don't know how because my name is so unique) so they treated me according to the other patient's condition and did not discharge me for an extra 3 hours because they had to get everything straightened out. I was told that my description of symptoms was "wrong and not possible" by a woman who never introduced herself, so I am not sure if she was a doctor or if she even worked there. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! They also gave me a handout for high blood pressure because according to them, 110/70 is too high. Completely incompetent people working here and I will not return even if I am dying because I will never put my life in their hands again.
Very long lines and slow tellers.  Should've gone to my branch a t Safeway at Horizon Branch. Really like the manager there. It cost me 1/2 hour of my life that could've been done in 10 minutes - Ugh!
"Was" excited to try this place.  Walked in....no hostess insight.....waited....waited....and waited to be seated.  Finally we just sat ourselves.  Place wasn't busy...maybe 4 tables.   Waitress came over and gave us menus.....a few minutes later...Hostess with purple hair shows up....glaring at us for 15 minutes.  Guess she was pissed we sat ourselves?  Anyway...we ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes & corned beef sandwich with fries.  The chicken fried steak had so much gristle in it....you couldn't even chew it!!!  Gravy was cold....and CLEARLY potatoes...that weren't mashed after all....were old and cold from breakfast.  Mind you....we were their at around 3:30pm.  Then they had 5 burnt green beans on the plate as well.  Corned beef sandwich was ok....but the bread was an inch and a half thick!  So 3 inches of bread with a 1/4 inch of meat was like eating a rye bread sandwich.  Instead of slicing the corned beef....they pulled it going WITH the grain....witch gives you stringy meat.  The fries were coated with flour and were not hot.  I seriously don't see how this place makes it...without some BIG TIME CHANGES!  $45 later for this disappointment....is definitely NOT WORTH IT!  I won't be going back!
I really don't even want to give it one star, but it looks like I have no choice. First of all, there service was okay when we walked in. The kid was nice to me, but just decided to stare down my shirt as I leaned over the counter, so freaking rude. So after that we waited about 10 minutes to get our food, and even though it's fast food I really don't mind waiting for good food, but when we asked for ranch for my wings they said it was 42 cents... I said nevermind. And when I got my wings I opened the box and they where small, and no sauce on them. I started to eat them and they where really soggy. Like they had been sitting out at least for 3-6 hours and then they put them in a microwave. GROSS!! And then I looked on the receipt and it said you only get one ounce of sauce! Cheap!! So my boyfriend decided to get 2 for $6 burger and a chicken sandwich. And he just says they where nasty. He did tell me that the little cheese bites that where in the burger and chicken sandwich... he says they tasted like fake cheese and they where a bit rubbery! Cooking 101... a microwave it's used for cooking!! This place needs to be shut down! There fries where okay, but I would have rather gone somewhere else. Now I have a stomachache and I am not happy at all. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I am never going back.
This place provided lackluster service. I'm surprised they're open. The staff was rude. The bouncer was even worse. I wouldn't come back here, ever again. I agree with all the other reviewers. This is a horrible place.
I wouldnt recommend. I work in the area figured I would try them. I will do myself a favor and not return.
All I can say is bad food, there is no such a Indian flavor taste waste of moneyDon't spend ur money
1 star but it should be a - star option this place was the worst I have ever visited ..... We decided to go there because at other locations never had an issue but this one in particular the manager I forgot her name but she has red short hair she yells at you even if you are next to her saying your name with a bad attitude plus the service is not the best the coffe is COLD , no choice of creamers the table dirty when I got my cup of coffee it was dirty it had pink lipstick all over I had to ask for another cup even, the food ok  they never replace the coffee when I had to take my kid to the restroom the restroom was DIRTY  disgusting .... Smelly  when I payed they didn't ask how was our service or anything definitely NOT COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION ......
When you go to tell the manager on duty that your storage got broken into and he can't even make eye contact with you not to mention he didn't even know I was talking a picture of him... I think someone is guilty of breaking into my unit and stealing my stuff  Don't store your PERSONAL items here, the employees here are crooks and there are NO good cameras to watch your unit. Surprised this place is not closed down by the BBB.
Do not stay at the Flamingo! I repeat, Do not stay at the Flamingo. Reasons why:1. Unclean rooms. We booked 2 rooms. 1st room had one bed, when we had requested two. The bed was messed up, there was trash on the floor. 2nd room was a handicapped room which was fine except I hope that someone who actually was handicapped did not miss out. 3rd room had two beds but both had been rolled around in and dirty towels in the bathroom. 4th room reeked of weed, but otherwise "clean" and thereby deemed acceptable at 4am until they could get us a room on the same floor as the other one the next day. We got in at 11:30pm and went through 4 rooms that were not clean or able to be slept in in 4 hours. Meaning although we paid for a room on Friday, there was not a clean one available.2. Unaccommodating service. 1 out of 3 front desk agents were friendly. We did not hear an apology for any of the dirty rooms and when my friend asked for compensation they acted like they didn't know why. They reluctantly gave us a $30 voucher for a hotel restaurant. Whoopee.3. Slow service at the Mexican restaurant in the casino. Also, guest services said they were open until 2am on Sunday after the marathon. Nope. They turned on all the lights before midnight.4. When cashing in our $30 voucher, my friend had to sign her name and put our room number. The server at the restaurant misunderstood (or not) and charged my friend $30 EXTRA to the room.There are so many more reasons I could name to skip over this hotel when planning a trip for Vegas, but the cheap price is not worth it. Other guests that we knew also had problems with their rooms (leaky toilet and shower) and with rude staff.Why people stay at the Flamingo:- it's central on the Strip (really its only saving grace)- it's cheaper- it has a convenient small food courtThe flamingos in the courtyard were cool, but walk through as you pass to your better even if a tad more expensive hotel. Do not stay at the Flamingo unless it's for free. And even then, I'd think twice.
So, mother always said if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. When I finally reached someone at Ladlow's after two unanswered voice messages and an email about a bench ordered in September they were quick to refund my deposit after we determined the bench wasn't on order. They blamed it on the manufacturer and slow demand for the piece but the manufacturer said in an email to me they were surprised at that response and couldn't find an order from Ladlow's for the item. I was glad they sent the refund check so quickly. That's as nice as I can be.
I've been to this location a few times. I think my latest visit will be my last. I hadn't had a hero burger in about a year and placed an order for a 6oz. The lady cashier asked "is cheddar cheese ok?" and I said "sure" thinking ok, you get free cheese now, great. Of course when I get the bill I see the extra $0.99 charge for cheese and thought that was some seriously sleazy up selling. I was also reminded how incredibly overpriced this burger combo is coming in at close to $15. People, this is a basic burger and definitely not worth that price. Anyway, while I waited nearly 15 minutes for my order, I also realized how slow this place was. When my order was ready, I realized that the lady pre-packages everything and doesn't let you get extra ketchup, napkins or anything. You get what they give and she made it seem like she did me a solid by giving me an extra ketchup packet when I asked her for one. There was a customer who asked for extra napkins and she gave them one. ONE. They don't even leave napkins out for customer to use as needed. Anyway. I won't be back as this place is clearly getting worse and worse. But now they're even being sneaky with their up selling. I'm staying away from this communist crap heap.
j.s.everyone that has complained is telling the truth.  the people that work for the arizona republic are liars.  i took out the newspaper on the wednesday, saturday, and sunday.  i was lied to by the representaive that i would only pay $29.99 like they had advised on the internet, but now they are adding up my bill.  it does not matter who you talk to down at the paper.  they all lie that they will take care of things.  i told them to cancel the paper for good.  this is sad that they are the only big newspaper in arizona.  they need another paper to take care of them.  thank god we have some local newspaper that print the truth.
This used to be one of our favorite places for Lenten fish fry.  I don't know what changed from last year but, tonight we had the greasiest three pieces of breaded cod.  I ate one piece, removed the breading on the second piece and left most of my french fries uneaten because they were soaked with oil from the fish. My wife left two pieces of fish and most of her chips uneaten for the same reason!  To top it all off, there were half a dozen guys playing a "chipping game for beer", who were way too loud, occasionally profane and just plan rude!  I don't know if the restaurant is under new management but they had better get their act together.I hope the course hasn't undergone any changes like the restaurant atmosphere and food has!
Went because I had a groupon.  I'd say skip it.  Really didn't learn anything useful.  Went over basic chair dance.  Then pole dance.  Would have been better to concentrate on one or the other and practice so u could actually put it in use.  Preferably the chair dance because everyone has a chair but not a pole.  Drink upgrade was not a drink really, little alcohol if any....so if you go, skip that too.  Take a bottle of water.  First class was cancelled so I waited 1.5 hr for next class... Comped me one of the non-drink-drinks....useless.   Left my Maui Jim glasses in cubby, called for them to check and get them for me.  Said they would call me back, never did.  So that's $200 glasses MIA....Spent more time watching the stripper pole dance than learning anything.  How could you not watch and wish you could do that stuff??  Then she had a tip jar... Seriously...???? Basically a glorified workout class if you really put the effort into it--nothing more.  Expensive lesson for me and 3+ hours of my life I'll never get back...
I have been going to this cleaners for years. I will never step foot in there again. I dropped off a pair of "dry clean only" pants at a dry cleaners. Seems simple enough. I went to pick them up a day after they were due & I was told they weren't ready. I said I needed them for that night. Next thing I know, the female owner hands me a cell phone & tells me to speak to her husband.He tells me that the pants were defective. I need to seek reimbursement from the store where I purchased. He would not offer me any reimbursement for the pants, which are quite expensive. I ask for the pants back. They were two tones, black & white. The white is now black. It appears that they were laundered, rather than dry cleaned.Had the owner offered to pay for the pants, I could move on. Shifting the blame to the manufacturer & expecting the 3rd party department store to refund me is ridiculous.I will never return to new select cleaners & advise you to stay away.
Showed up for happy hour at 630pm....820p the waitress comes to our table and puts a reserved sign on our table and tells us that at 945pm that someone has reserved and we have to move....uh?!? Yeah, that's not normal or good customer service?!?! If you want to go somewhere, give them your money, then get kicked out.....Have fun!!!  For a normal person....dont go! That's why we go to Miller's Ale House!!!
Every once in a while I love to remind myself as to why I don't order delivery from chain pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and tonight I was not. Over an hour and a half delivery time and I received a soggy medium pan pizza. But what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. After delivery fees and tips for $16 I recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. Me, didn't have access to an oven. Otherwise I know what I would've done. Baked a pizza.
Actually pretty expensive for what you get. The chicken was crispy and juicy however had no flavor complete lack of seasoning. Biscuits were literally hard like a hockey puck. The mashed potatoes had such a small amount of gravy it was almost a joke. Not worth it. Go find yourself a KFC.
This place is disgusting!  I walked in shortly after it opened to get a drink.  No customers there.  The floors, tables and counters are all dirty ( yet no one there).  So obviously it hasn't been cleaned from day before.  No one greeted me.  Waited 5 min.  Still no one.  Went to restroom, and it was beyond gross!!   Stalls all dirty, one even when blood on floor under toilet.  Went back out without using restroom.  I finally had to call out for someone. A young girl came up.  Got me the drink.  I asked to speak to manager, and Indian guy I believe.  I could here her ask to come out from behind wall. He obviously said no cause she came out and said, "can you come back later, he's on computer right now. ".  Don't go here!  Can't believe it passes health inspections.
The chain of a necklace we bought from here breaks every 2-3 months, so we bring it in on a regular basis. Even though the item and warranty are under both my boyfriend's name as well as my own, whoever drops it off has to pick it up. Which is extremely difficult with our busy schedules. It's also very hard to get any service here when you are standing at the pickup counter and not looking into the display cases, looking like a new $ALE. They also NEVER answer their phone. I hate this location.
Horrible customer service.Over changed me on my rental. Rented me a scratched, dinged, cracked car and then charge me 50% over the negotiated rate.In store customer service was just as bad as the "800" service I forced the in store employee to call.
Dropped my clothes off to get it dry cleaned on Friday. The lady said it's a 2 days turn around time, I said that's fine. So I should get it by Tuesday or Wednesday, she said they'll call me. Still nothing today
This medical group is a mess! Telephone system is horrible to reach actual human. Frequently get stuck in phone tree, voice mailboxes full or calls not returned. You can complain to supervisor or receptionist but no one cares about fixing your problem short of offering an "I'm sorry "Go somewhere else - avoid this group and both Thunderbird locations!
They changed the name, because somany bed reviews. Late night i like to try one last time. Service slow, food is terrible. I don't give one star but this place always bad management, poor food quality. Sorry but for this hotel this cafe joking.
Do not stay at this hotel. Management is stealing money. Mexican manager Juan inflates prices per week. The staff is incompetent. You can never get a straight answer regarding billing. I questioned why weekly payment did not go down once all "fees" and "deposits" were paid. Mexican manager Juan told me to pack my things and leave. I was fully prepared to pay fee that was quoted to me by staff member Brenda. Mexican manager Juan informed me she did not quote me the correct amount. He stated she failed to add in a pet fee and charge from previous week. When Mexican manager Juan gave me a total it was the total I paid the week before. When I pointed this out to him he became angry and enrage and yelled that he would not do business with me. They owe me a deposit. This company will say you will get a refund on your $100 deposit but you have to stay 30 days or more. I was due my refund this week. I tried to call corporate but only get a voicemail when I call the number. Person on message sounds just like Mexican manager Juan. I contacted the Better Business Bureau since I cannot get a return call from Siegal Suites Corporate office. I have kept all documents regarding my stay at this hell hole. Please beware of this facility. There are roaches, open drug trades, prostitution and children unattended running everywhere. Complained about the marijuana smells coming thru apartment and was laughed at by Brenda. I only gave this review a one star b/c you have to give a star in order to leave a review. This establishment needs to be shut down. All criminal activity needs to be investigated. This establishment preys on the desperate. Thank GOD I have other means.
The only thing this place has going for it are the portion sizes. But if the food is gross, than you don't really want a lot of it. Had the mixed burrito with chicken. Very little flavor. Got it "wet" and the enchilada sauce tasted like tomato sauce. No flavor. Doesn't come with chips or anything. 10 minutes after eating about half I have a terrible stomach ache and have already run to the bathroom twice. I do not recommend.
Bad service. We were super patient as we waited almost 20 mins for our waitress to bring water.....water! She then proceeds to bring water for only half the table and it took another 10 mins to bring water for the rest of the table. Two tables that came after us got their food before we even received water....water. Sad to say our first experience here is beyond disappointing.
I've ordered from here several times, and EVERY single time they've gotten the order wrong and tonight they also forgot to deliver the liter of Pepsi. We called and asked for the Pepsi we paid for, and they said they can't deliver one tonight but next time we'd receive a free Pepsi. I said it's not free because we paid for one and didn't receive it and they didn't understand. Don't ever order from here!
Wow. Came here based on Yelp & friend reviews and what a mistake. There were five in our party for breakfast. We were the only customers for the first half hour or so and the service was horrible. Waited for quite a while before having our order taken, only received drinks and coffee once with no refills at all. I ordered eggs over hard... not that difficult. They came out runny and gooey. I asked to have them cooked again and when the returned they still weren't done! No apologizes and no quick fix. Dirty dishes, floors & walls. The rest rooms were worse than a a college bar during spring break. Horrible experience. We will never return.
I just got back from an appointment there which never actually happened because they wanted $600 from me for an ultrasound, all of which have been covered 100% by my insurance and this place is listed as IN-NETWORK.  I called the insurance company and they informed me that it is not normal OR APPROPRIATE for the doctor's office to ask for a payment like this based on an ESTIMATE only.  The insurance company then called the billing department to check with them, and the billing department said that this is an estimate only and they do not ask for the payment up front.  I called back to let them know that I no longer would like to go to their office for services and the billing department argued with me and said that it is their policy to collect payment up front.  Sound fishy to you?? If you have gotten referred to Valley Perinatal, ask for a different referral.  They have shady and borderline FRAUDULENT business practices.
Consider seriously before joining.  I canceled my membership but they still charged me for an "annual fee" several months later -- and then I caught a charge another year later!  (My credit card company refunded me.)  I had experienced issues like this before with LA Fitness, so I went out of my way to avoid this very problem.  When I canceled the girl at the front desk (who wore WAY too much makeup looked at me like I was an idiot) assured me it was no problem.  WRONG.  Gyms are known for these unethical practices but with so many negative reviews, until they go out of their way to change these practices, you'd be SMART not to join Smart gym.
This store was absolutely disgusting! The soda area was so sticky and covered in soda, and the hot dog and condiment stations were revolting. I like a cheap hot dog occasionally, but seeing their nastiness made me turn away and walk out immediately!
I flew from Portland to get a medical check that required an x-Ray. This place assured me over the phone that there is rarely a wait. Wen I arrived they cautioned that it would be approximately 1/2 hour wait. I waited over an hour and a half to see anyone. If you are in a hurry or expect good service, this is not the place for you.
I would Never coming back here ever!!!! Make a appointment with my regular tech. They said she is not here today but the truth is she no longer work there. The girl Jantra that did my nails did a horrible job. My nails were very ugly , crooked, and misshaped.  Come on it is a fill!!!  She told me that the owner and the employees there is treating her very poorly. I was so shocked to hear her  talked about one of her coworker (the lady that sit in the front). After that she ask for my phone number saying that she is gonna to rent a station soon and would call me to make a nail appointment with her.THIS place is very expensive and they are treated the clients very rudely. I miss all the people that work there before the new ownership.
"You get what you paid for" Let me start off by saying my family visits Las Vegas frequently and The Plaza has been a family favorite due to its location in Downtown, with most rooms having a nice view of Fremont the experience. I went up to Las Vegas this past weekend, as I usually do for APA Nationals at the Westgate Hotel and Casino. We stayed there Thursday and Friday, but they were booked for Saturday, so my finance and I decided to stay at the Plaza. Plus my sister and her bf were visiting from London and staying at the Plaza with my mom, aunt and uncle. Gambling wise we did good at this casino as well as on Fremont. Unfortunately, this does not outweigh the bad we experienced. First of all, on Saturday night when we decided to take a cruise down the strip, we found human SHIT near the elevators that you use to retrieve your car from the parking lot inside the casino. I am not exaggerating when I say it was a real emoji SHIT without the smiley face. There was even some on the walls too. Just GROSS!! At first, I didn't think it came from a human, but my sister and her bf are in vet school and said that it was definitely from a human. It stank up the whole area. It might as well have been inside one of the elevators, so everyone didn't have to suffer and smell it while waiting for their elevator. You would think it wouldn't get worse but it did. Checkout the next day was at 11am. My fiance checked out while I was finishing getting ready. Around 11:15am there was a knock on the door. We told the male hotel staff member that we were on our way out. We literally had our suitcases in tow when we answered the door. He said he was calling it in downstairs and made his way to the elevators. We also made our way to the elevators and asked the staff member if we were going to be charged. He said that is not his job. We asked again also stating that if we were going to be charged we would just stay in the room a bit longer and not rush. At this point the hotel staff member began to get loud and told us check out was at 11. We told him we knew that we were just running a bit late (15min late). As we made our way back to our room to think about our options, the staff member followed us into our room and began to wait (it seemed like he was talking on the radio and was waiting for a response). Again we asked if we were going to be charged. He gave no answer and at this point I told him if we are going to be charged for the room, then it was our room and for him to get out. He said for me to lower my voice and that I couldn't speak to him that way. I wasn't yelling and I was speaking to him in the same tone he was speaking to me. Again I told him to get out of our room. He then said he didn't give a fu@k about his job and that he would throw his clip board down and wait for us outside. At this point we just decided to go talk to the front desk about this whole mess and figure out if we are going to be charged the extra night. Even as we made our way to the elevator (which was full of people) the staff member continued to follow us and taunt us. My fiance did an excellent job keeping his composure, especially after this male staff member made a threat to me, not to my fiance, but to me! In the end my fiance complained about the threat, everyone at the desk was in complete shock. We were only there one night, no comps were given and we totally forgot to mention the SHIT near the elevator due to the bizarre check out experience. I will NEVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN!! Next time my fiance says suit, I'm jumping on it. Frugal me decided to save money and stay near family. Well, here at the Plaza, you definitely get what you paid for.
Worst service and managers. Make other plans trust me! Took 3 times to get a drink right and over 30 minutes
DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE! MY father brought our dog here after searching the Internet for symptoms we came to the conclusion he was having heart failure. After telling the vet what we think is wrong the vet at this clinic (sounding extremely unexperienced) took a needle to Buddy to see if there was blood in his abdomin he came back and told my father that we would have to put Buddy down. He then said he made a mistake and might have hit his spleen with the needle. He took x rays/ultra sound stating he doesnt know how to use the machine and told my father Buddy isn't showing anything wrong with his heart and he just needs rest. We paid the incompetent man 500$ and today Buddy passed away.
Extremely disappointed. Ambience and service were fine. Ordered hot green tea. It came in a cute kettle but the tea didn't taste good. Opened up the kettle and pulled out the tea bag - it was Bigelow green tea, one of the cheapest tea available at a grocery store. No Japanese restaurant should serve Bigelow green tea! Makes one wonder if their fish is also of lowest quality. Did not order any fish and walked out.
I'm not 100% sure but I think they have 6 types of nigiri and 6 different rolls. Compare that to the dozens that most ayce places have and the conveyor belt just becomes a gimmick that doesn't work. It's boring. Service was fine, food was ok. Nothing special. They need to work desperately on the variety of what's on the conveyor belt. Otherwise, it's just not worth the money when so many other place have so much more variety.
Our room was in poor taste, and hadn't been renovated in quite some time. This place is a good deal because the Trump brand has been so tarnished by its namesake that they can't get a fair price for the accommodations.
I have been shopping at Smiths since I moved to Las Vegas. Recently, I've noticed the quality of fruits and vegetables were not top quality. I can't tell you how many onions and potatoes I've had to throw out after only a few days. I know not to store them together. The last time I bought onions I purchased them separately,( because I noticed the bagged onions and potatoes ALWAYS had one rotten piece in them, which makes the rest go rotten). Not two days later, the onions were completely black with some type of mold. It's not just root vegetables either. I bought cucumbers that I put into the crisper in my fridge. Couple days later I went to grab it and it was mush. So now this brings me to this. A couple of weeks ago, ( I just had no time to post this until today), I bought a family pack bone in pork chops. I brought them home to divide into portions. When I opened the cellophane, the smell was so bad. The chops were green underneath the first layer. My husband took them back and they gave him another pack. I opened them and again pork chops were smelly and green. I'm honestly going to try Albertsons or even Walmart. I probably won't go back.
Bad customer service, blaming the customer for the terrible upload they did to Sierra which have a feature that slows down everything. My laptop is useless for 48 hours on top of the 3days from the upload. A whole morning wasted in trying to fix the problem with a very rude Genius who didn't even bothered to say goodbye. Time is money for some people, not for the one that assists you.
Cashier was super rude. Ordered 2 breakfast burritos and they gave us 2 Carne Asada burritos drowned in guacamole. We didn't realize it was the wrong order until we got back to work. Went back and explained what happened and she said that it's our fault and that we shouldn't of picked up the wrong order. Customer service was horrible, instead of apologizing and giving us what we paid for she decided to be nasty about it. To be honest I should of got a full refund after that type of service because after running back and forth food was cold and appetite was ruined. Will not be returning, food isn't that good anyways.. it's just convenient.
One of the workers came in and made her son & husband a drink first before customers then they didn't know which drink was in which blender. This place keeps going downhill. They are no longer friendly.
The one star is only because our waitress Alyssa was great, but the food was some of the worst Irish food I've ever had in my life.We started off with their potato soup. One cup came to the table looking like soup and the other two looked like congealed porridge, not to mention they where all extremely salty. The cheese curds where about the best thing they had, but the onion rings were soggy and anemic looking.My wife had the pork shank that was so over smoked, she couldn't even taste the flavor of the pork. To this day she can't eat anything smoked because of it.My son had the shapers pie and said it was bland and tasteless, not worth $13.I had the bangers and mash by the recommendation of the waitress and they where in-eatable. The gravy on the massed potatoes was a gloppy gelatinous mass that would stick to the fork like The Blob.Needless to say I will not be going back there for anything ever again. Money down the drain.
Poor services. I had reservation for dinner with my mom traveling from another country. As we were heading to there from Toronto downtown, we took Go Train and the Train was a little late. They did not contact us at all and cancelled our reservation. And when we arrived they did not show any apology and even a little arrogant. Well if the cancel-without-contacting-customer is your style, at least write down when people make reservation and I will call you if the train delay happend. But they did offer us another table. They had plenty vacant tables in normally busy Saturday evening (yes I totally understand if that is the service). And for food, I am a big fan of Italian food. But honestly, compared to tons of Italian restaurant in Toronto, the taste is not recommended. And if anyone is travelling Port Credit, there are many other better options to dine.-------------------------------------------------------------------------And after I post the review above, I received their reaction about the complaint as below:make me laugh.
It's unfortunate that the stellar initial experience I had when purchasing my car was torn to shreds just days later, all courtesy of Berge Ford Manager, Craig Ginsberg. Four days ago I had the pleasure of dealing with Mel and got into a 2017 Ford Fusion. The experience was great, customer service was amazing and I was so happy with my car and Berge......until today. Today my tire pressure sensor came on, so I came into Berge, after calling for an appointment, to have it resolved. To my dismay, I was advised that the tire is irreparable and has to be replaced. To add insult to injury, Berge was not willing to replace the tire for free, even though there was no proof that the tire wasn't damaged when I purchased. Nonetheless, when the service department was working on it I made my way to sales to discuss what Berge could do to ensure their customer was taken care of. Unfortunately I had to speak with Craig Ginsberg, who is a chauvinistic, rude and unprofessional individual. Craig advised me that if they had sold me the car with the nail in my tire it would've been flat in hours. LIE, even the service department confirmed that was a lie. Secondly, I advised Craig that I didn't spent 25K on a car a few days ago to pay another $250 for a new tire today. Craig said that wasn't his fault and he doesn't give things away for free and he conveniently dodged my quality of customer service he was providing questions. Once I asked for Craig's Manager's contact information, I was advised the General Manager of Sales, Steve Countryman, doesn't have a cell phone. LIE. I told Craig I wasn't going to listen to any more deceit and then he offered to call Steve to see if they could do anything since I wasn't accepting his rude demeanor and lack of ethics. Imagine that novel approach.....and within 30 seconds he came back and advised me they'd replace the tire for free. MAGIC! When Craig told me that I asked him why it took me going to the extent of asking for Steve's information for them to do the right thing, and he literally looked at me and said, 'What, you don't say thank you? I went out of my way to call Steve and I get you a free tire and all you do is tell me that I'm rude and condescending?' Are you kidding me?!?! Craig is a poor excuse for a Manager, even poorer excuse for a 'leader' and if I were Mr. Berge, I'd be embarrassed to have him work for my company. He was unprofessional, condescending and has no regard for ethics or customer service. I am extremely disappointed with this experience and it's so sad to me that the great individuals I dealt with to buy my car (Mel and Dave) were totally forgotten, all because Craig lies and is on a power trip to feed his ego. Note to Berge......Craig should do some on the job training with Mel and Dave as well as attend some workshops and truly learn how to deal with customers, how to tell the truth and how to do the right thing. My apologies to the quality human beings I dealt with at Berge but after my interaction with Managers like Craig, I'm shocked that anyone returns to Berge. Craig needs help, and if you're not careful he's going to be disrespectful to more and more customers and one of these days he'll mess with the wrong customer. Icing on the cake? I was advised that they'd wash and clean up my car once the new tire was put on......not only did they NOT do that BUT I walked to my brand new car to see the passenger window covered in bird poop. I don't know what else to say, Berge.....so disappointed today that people are allowed to operate on deceit and false promises. You've lost a customer.
2.5 hours, multiple phone calls, 30 plus minutes on hold. No food. Promise of a managers call tomorrow and as of now a supposed refund. Absolutely unbelievable, also let the record show that the business number goes to "call center". I'm a very understanding customer but this went to a very unacceptable level.
DONT EVER GO TO THE SPA GUYS! As I was leaving I was approached by 2 security guards accusing me from two other guests that I was acting aggressively. I was upset and also uncomfortable. In the end I then proceeded to tell the security guards this is the last time I will come here. I told them that I felt very uncomfortable over accusations that were not true. DON'T EVER GO TO THE SPA AT LEXWORD MEN YOU MAY GET STOPPED BY SECURITY AND BE ACCUSED!
This place is a Dirty Germ magnettoday was our first appointment for OT and Speech.  First thing the building looks like a house, Walking into the front entrance the waiting room is small, the bath room Is A Porta-potty which is DISGUSTING. I asked how the state can allow this to be considered a handi accessible bathroom my son is in a wheel chair but he is able to use the bathroom m. We had to physically lift my son to urinate which resulted in urin on the floor, along with all the Other Urin on the floor, apparently the bathroom is hooked up to a septic tank and would not accommodate the amount of ppl who would be using it, the OT told me that usually the abled bodied kids use the poro potty no problem and the kids in wheelchairs are usually in  diapers... as if theres no in between, they suggested we use a toddlers training toilet in which he would be to big.  The  pool pump was broken and the water was Green. I have waited a year for physical therapy so i gritting my teeth and pushed through, the Speech therapist, was working with a mask bc she had an upper respiratory illness and despite me telling her my children are low immune, she found away to get back into the room.  After voicing my concerns to the manager about the bathroom facilities, I received a text posted below. August 28, 2017Dear parent of A*I have been told that you expressed concerns about our facility. We are very sorry that it does not meet your family's needs.  Our program does offer therapeutic riding and hippotherapy and, with these available specialties, IS different than a traditional clinical medical office.As such, effective immediately, we want your child to receive therapy services at a traditional clinical therapy facility.  Based on your expressed concerns we are reserving the right to refuse service.Please consult your pediatrician for recommendations as to where to receive outpatient therapy other than at our facility.So because my son cant physically use a porter potty they are refusing to see him rather and correct the problem. Good to know.
Damn, this place is a cold, zombie like, empty shell of what was once a business! From the cyclone fencing surrounding the weed choked parking lot to the abandoned echoing staircase, there wasn't a single redeeming quality!
This was an absolutely terrible experience for a meal. Let's start...the place was sweltering hot inside the restaurant. I ordered a Caesar Salad w extra salad dressing. Had to ask 3 times. My friend ordered a salad but the server missed the dressing. My other friend ordered a sandwich & the fries were "forgotten"?! The steak was undercooked for another meal! For my meal I had wilted fries & they were out of a key part of the meal of waffle & chicken!! They featured a meal & were missing a key part?!?! The place was old & broken down as well. There are tons of restaurants in the area...do yourself a favour...eat somewhere else!
5 stars for the doctor he is a good doctor. Zero stars for Kenia the front lady who has no idea what customer service is. Its a shame that for staff like her they have to lose patients. Of course they don't care because its not their business they just want to get their check. Horrendous service. I just wonder why people that hate customer service work in that environment smh. Don't even bother calling for an appointment because they will hang up on you or just leave you on hold for 25 min. And if you're lucky they pick up the phone with an attitude. Great!
Very expensive and very rude.. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone! All multi level marketing stuff market up 188% Go find a honest do terra rep or a natures sunshine member before you ever go here! I can understand a profit but charging someone over 188% profit is crazy.. Buyers beware
A few days ago I saw their ad on Television. They were selling the 2014 Pilot for $12,8 something. I was very interest in this price, but wanted some more information. So I called them and spoke to Samantha. The first thing I did was ask her to please find out if the car was an automatic or a manual engine. I can drive a stick shift but I didn't want to. I asked her if she could find out for me what was inside this vehicle. She put me on hold and soon came back. She said yes it was an automatic, it had cloth seats, a CD player, Blue Tooth and Sirius Radio. The only thing I was really adamant about was the automatic engine. She asked me for my phone number and I told her I would rather just come out there and see it for myself. She told me to ask for Chad or Josh. So today I went out there. Chad was not available and Josh was busy, but I waited for him. Eventually, he came over to talk to me. I told him what Samantha had told me and I would be interested in seeing the car. He then assigned me to Dennis and told me that after I took the car for a ride he would crunch the numbers for me. I told him I wasn't interested in crunching numbers---that I wanted to pay cash and I wasn't going to play numbers games.  He suggested that I could finance the car, and then pay it all off.  When Dennis pulled the car up, it had a manual transmission--NOT AN AUTOMATIC.  It didn't have Blue Tooth, but I didn't care about that.  I asked to see Josh again. He then preceded to tell me that an automatic would be a little bit more. And he didn't know who told me that the sale was for automatic---I had already told him that, but I told him again. When I asked how much more the automatic would be he said he would crunch the numbers for me and let me know. When he came back he showed me a paper that said $23,000, Are you kidding 11 thousand more. Now he tells me that to get the sale price you have to qualify. Qualify for what  YOU HAVE TO FINANCE your car.  Now why do you have to do that===because the bank gives the dealership a bonus (or as I like to call it, a KICK BACK) for every car that is financed. You also have to be a veteran and there is a list of other qualifying factors. I wouldn't be surprised if you have to have a calico cat.  So if you have the cash and want to pay cash you can but you can't get the sale price.  Now Josh tells me that they have a disclaimer in small print under the ad.  This is so small that you can't even read it with a magnifying glass. What a joke, it is no wonder that car dealers have such a bad reputation they are anything but honest. My advice to anyone that wants to get this deal, be prepared and make sure you qualify for an array of things. My other tip before you go to Monroeville Jeep is DON'T!!!!@
I really wanted to love the new location, and was willing to put previous poor food and service at the original location aside. While the concept is lovely, the omelette was awful. The applewood smoked bacon was so over cooked, I was unable to stick my fork in it. Overall, the omelette was slightly burnt. I hope they can fix this issue!
This review is a bit overdue but I realized I should leave a review on how frustrating verizon makes every process. I made the huge mistake of taking my phone to the river. I had a Galaxy S3 with a Bluetooth speaker I bought online, and which was waterproof unlike my phone. I put my phone in a couple Ziploc bags, which ended up being fruitless as the bags got water in them and my phone died. I put it in a bag of rice overnight but that didn't fix it. I pay for the damage protection plan so I called this store since they are closest and told them my situation. They instructed me to come in so they could take a look.I arrived and per usual they were moderately busy. I put in my spot in line and waited about 15 minutes which wasn't a huge deal. After waiting one of the "specialist" came over and asked me for my name. Once he confirmed that I was who was waiting, he gave me a card and told me to call or go online with that. I asked him if I could do this in the store. He said no. I then asked why I was told to come in, he didn't know either. Waste of my time and the situation didn't feel like they didn't even care because I wasnt buying anything from them.I wish there was a 5 star verizon store.
I am taking a trip to California tomorrow and was in need of a thorough car wash. I just left this location and I honestly should have just done it myself, or drove a little further to another car wash. Tried to use $3 off on Yelp but the cashier forgot to honor it even tho I showed her the coupon prior to paying. She did give me extra air freshner but do I really need 3 of them? Paid $34 for handwash + $10 tip. After I left I realized that the rugs were barely vacuumed, the exterior had water stains. This is the worst car wash I have ever been to. Been trying to call but nobody is picking up the phone. This is the last time I will be visiting this god awful place.
Can't make up for sub par sushi with superb service 1 Star.....  had the 100$ chefs choice well as a single person deciding two of each item is less than acceptable. Never sat at a sushi bar and ordered chefs choice without them asking what I like or at least dislike....
Won't let you sit there with your fiancé while playing bingo.  I'm not bothering anybody, not being loud.  Just watching my fiancé play bingo.  Most dumbest rule they have.  I'll go to another casino and spend my money there.   Whack ass bingo hall anyways.
Needed something cheap and quick to eat.. decided on this and it was a bad decision. It looks like Panda Express but tastes nothing compared to it. Had a funky sour taste. Not a fan.
I had the worst experience here. I was at self checkout and realized a lipstick I wanted didn't have a bar code. The rude older Mexican lady working took it from me instead of having a runner get a new one. (That's what they do in the south.) Anyways she started off rude and told me to hurry up because she had other customers. I told her that I had just got there to go tell everyone else at self checkout to be faster. She was so rude the security guy came and asked me if she was harrassing me.  I have not been back there. People like that shouldn't get away with that shit. I spoke with a manager but doubt anything was done.
We reserved a luxury strip-view room, and a couple days later i called to make sure we can get a smoking room becuz we r smokers. They said they reserved us a smoking room. Then after waiting in a 45-minute line (on a sunday, no less) to finally check in, they said we didn't reserve a smoking room and no smoking rooms are available. I said "so u guys can't guarantee smoking or non smoking rooms?" And she said no, we cant. Sooooo now we r stuck with a room we don't want. I suggest u don't stay here when in vegas cuz they can't guarantee if u have have a smoking or nonsmoking room!! How horrible is that? What if u have kids and r stuck in a room that smells like smoke? Just bad bad bad. Very disappointed.
Don't know what happened but customer service is absolutely horrible. Not to mention the fact they charge a ridiculous 18% automatic gratuity for a party of 5 or more. The cashier was very rude and wouldn't even give us credit for our full stamp card, sooooo unfair. I will never step foot in this place again.
UGGG!!!!Cant get the order straight when I called they were not listening to the complaint proceeded to ask me what I wanted to order Then I asked him to stop talking and listen well what do you think happened next,,,you got it the ole' hold button aaahahaa then the gal whom took my order got on the phone and told me she would make another..NO THANKS It wouldn't have been so bad but they were not busy and I did repeat the order several times
The wait at this Location is ridiculous.  I came in and waited 30 minutes in the first waiting room.  I was taken back by a medical assistant to another waiting room to wait for an hour and a half.  She then came to take me to a room and told me there were still 2 more patients ahead of me.  I waited another 30 minutes.  They staff 1 dr which resulted in 2 1/2 hours of waiting.  I don't consider waiting 150 minutes as receiving Urgent care.
Good food at Mesa but bad experience, totally unexpected from a restaurant owned by one of my favorite tv chefs - Bobby Flay. When our food arrived, the plate had a big hair on it, I immediately brought it to the attention of the server and the manager who got my food to the table, they took it back and immediately got one back, just by removing the hair, when I asked them why did they get the same plate, they lied and said they made a different one, it was impossible, first of all I had to wait for a good 20 mins before they got my entree out so there was no way they would do another one in seconds, secondly I was sitting very close to the kitchen and saw it with my own eyes that it was the same plate. I decided not to contradict as I had my 3 yr old around, we barely ate, paid the check and walked out, they did not compensate the dish, neither did they apologize. So not done....not going back.
Constant rate increases, poor customer service, and now new data caps with overage charges you can't opt out of (e.g. No service cutoff limits).  I sincerely hope their monopoly in my area doesn't last.
Johnny Vegas Grill has some of the best food that I have found locally since relocating to the Vegas area a little over a year ago. Unfortunately, I will no longer be doing any business with the establishment. Today I placed an order for delivery at which point the representative taking my order advised the food would arrive in around 25 minutes. The food arrived just short of an hour and a half, and to my disappointment, the food was soggy and cold. I have always received great service from Johnny's, so I decided to reach out to the General Manager to inquire about a possible refund. After explaining the situation and politely requesting a refund, the General Manager quite unprofessionally told me that an hour and a half wait time isn't anything uncommon, and that I was being " ungrateful for how accommodating she is". As I expressed, Johnny Vegas Grill has delicious food.. it is very unfortunate that they have a General Manager representing the business at a lesser quality than the quality of food they provide.
Never gotten a worse car wash in my life. I asked for my convertible to be hand washed. Paid the $25 VIP cost. Still had spots on the body of my car. Looks like the tires were barely touched. And on top of that waited almost an hour.
Not very happy with the pharmacy. Dropped off my sick son's medicine at 3pm. Went through the the drive thru after 7pm and nobody could find the prescription anywhere. After 10 minutes it was "found lost in the system" I was a told to come back after they filled it. I guess my sick child is of no importance to them. I'll try CVS next time.
Rude. Tried them a few times. They act like they are doing me a favor whenever I order there.
My friend from Toronto that now lives in Victoria recommended this place to me in an email about a month ago. I was driving down Hurontario and saw it and thought about his email and figured I would stop in. I walked in and did not know that it was a buffet style restaurant. The woman that took my order let me know that I could still order something from the menu since lunch buffet was over and dinner buffet didn't start for a few hours so I did.I ordered the vegetarian combo meal which came with 2 spring rolls, vegetable fried rice, and Chow mein noodles with mixed vegetables. All I have to say was that this was the worst Chinese food I have ever had.The rice had no flavor and was extremely dry with dried up cauliflower and carrots, the noodles were seriously just ramen swimming in chicken broth. I don't eat meat and chicken broth was not something that I was looking forward to tasting. I got the food to go and didn't realize this bad food till I got back to the hotel. I was not about to drive all the way back to the restaurant. So I tried to eat the rice and the spring rolls and threw the rest of it in the trash. Yes, I felt bad about wasting food, however I couldn't bring myself to sit there and actually eat it either.
Bad. The tacos are not good. Cold. Hard. Tortillas were probably out for awhile. I don't know what else to say other than save your money and go have tacos elsewhere.
The Women's Restroom is very filthy! I am here to see someone at Urgent Care and used the ladies room outside across the Urgent Care Unit.Very unhealthy- trash bins overflowing and all over the floor. There's also a cleat plastic bag with a bloody rag inside on the floor. The smell of the room is very bad! Just plain unhealthy for patients that are already sick. YUCK!!!
I wish we had read the reviews before coming here. It was the worst breakfast we've ever had in a restaurant (we go out almost every day for breakfast), and 1 star is really more than they deserve. I understand they are in a tourist area, but prices are close to what you'd pay at a fancy downtown hotel: 2 eggs, toast and coffee came to $16.49 per person plus tax and tip. It's hard to screw up a fried egg, but they did. Over easy came out with crunchy brown edges and hard yolks. The bacon was tough, and the coffee, passable at best. Service was pretty much non-existent. Don't waste your time and money here, there are much better alternatives in the area.
La Comida was not our first choice for dinner, but after attempting to eat at three other places, it was the only joint that was open and didn't have an hour wait. It was late on a Monday night, so it wasn't even close to crowded. However, the service was some of the worst that I have ever experienced. Getting water refills and the check was painfully slow.The food was overpriced and uninspired. You expect fajitas to come out sizzling on a hot cast iron, but there was just a small hunk of meat and a lot of veggies on a plate. The carnitas tacos were dry and underwhelming, and did not come in the pulled pork form that I am accustomed to eating. My margarita was not much better. I feel like this place spends more energy trying to look impressive with the decor and fancy names for menu items than it does on its food and service.
Been here a couple of times.  The ice cream is ordinary.. whipped cream from a can.  Wouldn't give it a second thought if it wasn't located in the heart of Old Town.  But you know, when you your hours say your open to 10:00 PM you should be open until 10:00 PM.
I Live Right on Parc Avenue, just beside parc metro. I called in for their service after I was pleased with their food and delivery the first time. But this time, they were just rude. Told me that they do not and will not deliver that far. I even told them that I will try and tip the driver a hefty amount, but they just hanged up on me. This is how they start treating their customers when they have the amount they need. Great business mentality you have going on there. I wish you well, but I will not be calling for their service anytime soon.
Absolutely worst customer service I have ever seen it any fast food location. Apparently has never heard of the word please or thank you. When told so order was abruptly stopped with "just a minute". Once I finished ordering was told to "pull forward" very rudely. Maybe she was having a bad day but that's still no way to talk to customers. Will not be visiting this establishment again!Part 2: after getting home and opening up the box of chicken, was once again disappointed. The chicken was soggy and dripping oil. If no stars was an option, they would have zero!
I have been to many nail salons and this one was by far was the worse. Their prices are too high for the quality. I got a full set with gel polish and I asked for a glittered finger and they charged 8$ for that. The design didn't come out correctly it's uneven and has spots where there is no glitter. The technicians are unfriendly and not courteous to their customers. I will be going back to my original place.
Been here for a few years before. My mom still goes here to get a perm & cut, my sister comes to get her hair straightened. Really liked the way how my sisters hair is done so I thought maybe I should give it a try. Called to book an appointment and explained the condition of my hair to the male staff. Knowing that I'm calling a week ahead for that specific day to get my hair done. He says you need to come in for us to see how your hair is on a weekday. I said I need to work on weekdays and the best day is on the weekend. So I've asked for that day and he said "well, I don't want to book you in and then you not doing it. I don't want to ask a stylist to come in and then calling it off because it takes a third of a time". VERY UPSET with this kind of service. Pretty much asking my family and friends not to go there anymore.
This would have been a 5 star review but since there was a fraudulent charge on my credit card this place receives a 1 star rating.  The $27 fraudulent tip added to my bill by the bartender is not only unacceptable but illegal.  If you decide to visit bring cash and save the headache of calling your bank to reverse the charge.  I have since emailed the GM to advise him of what is occurring in his establishment.
So I'm providing an update for my poor review on Trump International Hotel. They still suck in my opinion however there is FINALLY closure to all the drama. My boyfriend was sweet enough to find another number to call besides the one the Hotel told us to call and finally got someone else to talk to. We explained to the guy on the phone how we were ignored for TWO MONTHS and not one person has contacted us nor returned our messages and e-mails. He sent us a check for the exact amount of my new flat iron (which I originally had paid way more for the first one). We got it a week later than when he said we would get it. We also contacted the BBB and complained to them about the situation. Apparently the guy who never returned our calls or e-mails before told the BBB that he could never reach us. WHAT A LIE! We never got any missed calls nor responses to the e-mails we sent to him! I'm sad that they are just as much liars as they are thieves. Incredible. I'm glad they finally did something and stopped wasting our time. I'm disappointed that they never tried to go above and beyond expectations to live up to their so called "5 Star Hotel" rating. I would think they would try to make a good reputation for themselves...especially in this economy. Even if they offered us free nights at their hotel, I'd refuse it in a heartbeat. Thank God it's over....I now feel like I can breathe.
I see another person on here had the same experience as me.....the wrong coffee in the wrong pot...lol...that cracks me up.....how hard can it be to put the coffee in the right pot....today I'm sitting here waiting to get my order...we will see if they get it right....well we got our food and of course they got it wrong again...lol...this place is something else I've never seen a resturant with a track record like this....I asked to see a manager and there isn't even one here. .lol...What a waste..
First and last time in this place. Employees sitting down, finally one gets up to assist. Another customer came in and they assisted them, so I left. They obviously don't need the business.
Started our Sonic experience this evening at 7:30pm, attempted to order a heath concrete mixer, was told they were out of heath. Ordered two mixers and a small vanilla ice cream. We waited, waited and waited until 25 minutes later my husband went to ask about our order and was told they are short staffed. They handed him our ice cream and he asked for spoons...THEY WERE OUT OF SPOONS! My husband expressed, "you have to be flippin' kidding me, half of what you do has a spoon in it!"  Seriously, Mr. Sonic himself would of been disappointed with lack of menu items, the WAIT and NO SPOONS. It's simple really, put someone in charge, wait should never be more than 5 minutes, check your inventory and make sure you have SPOONS :)
Horable service and bad dealings they seem to not have anything right going for them and really don't care about what they are doing bad place never again
I probably should have done my due diligence in July of 2016 before signing up for the Petsmart-Banfield "Wellness" Plan as they have thousands of online complaints.  https://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/banfield.html, just on this one website.  Banfiled pushes this wellness plan hard as if you sign up for this plan, they automatically deduct from your bank account $35.95 monthly for among other things, UNLIMITED office visits.   Well as you may know, it can be expensive to have a pet seen at a veterinarian's office, so I agreed as to have peace of mind in case my pet needed to be seen.  Flash forward one year to Friday July 14th. Jasmine, my dog that I found through a rescue organization 3 years ago, I could tell she was not feeling well for a couple of days and then started throwing up and experiencing diarrhea.  She had not been drinking water as usual so I feared she may also be dehydrated.  I took Jasmine over to our neighborhood Petsmart at Christown, where they host a Banfield Hospital at the rear of the store.  It was 4pm on Friday and they had no medical staff available.  I spoke with the store manager and he advised there was a staffing issue that day which left the hospital closed.  I asked him to find out if another Banfield close by could take a look at Jasmine as she needed to be seen urgently.  He called both the Deer Valley location and the Desert Ridge locations and both locations declined to see Jasmine as they were fully booked for the rest of the day.  Clearly, Banfield Hospital have oversold their Wellness plan as they cannot even see an animal with an urgent need.  The Unlimited office visits is a wonderful benefit of the plan but worthless if you have a sick pet and they refuse service.  I complained directly to Banfield via email and they returned a standard form letter letting me know they will not withdraw further payments from my account. Meanwhile, I have paid for this service and when my pet needed them the most, we were turned away.
Pookie was our server, she was awesome, full of personality and bubbly, offering miso soup on the house which was amazing. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, spicy yellowtail handroll, and a spicy tuna roll, all of which are my go-to items at a sushi restaurant. Not only did the food not taste that fresh, three hours later I am now vomiting clear liquid nonstop after all the rolls have came up. Food poisoning is no laughing matter, I will never go here again.
My sister and I decided to try a new salon. I am very familiar with gel manicures and how long it takes to get them off. The longest it has taken for a different facility to get the gel off was approximately 10 minutes and they at least checked up on me every 2 or 3 minutes to make sure I was doing okay. Not here. The lady that did mine, soaked my fingers in acetone, wrapped them in tin foil, and then directed me to sit at a different table  while she took another walk-in and started a manicure.  A different woman (that was doing my sisters nails at the time,)Tiffany, was really sweet and checked up on me about 20 minutes later to remove the tin foil. I sat there for 30 more minutes after while more clients came in and other techs quickly rushed them to a table or pedicure chair.  After a total of 50 minutes, my sister was finished with manicure and I was acknowledged. By that point I was so livid that I didn't stay for the manicure. If you like being ignored this is the place to go.
I'm handicap with great difficulty walking  and visited the restaurant on Sunday 06 Nov 2016 around 1pm.  We entered through the concourse level since we parked in the underground.  We stood at the back entrance and the waitresses said they had no table available on the upper level.  So I hand to hold onto my partner since we had to descend 3 steps.  I was handed my rollator/walker once on the lower level.  The waitresses directed us to an empty table near the front.  We proceeded to the table and sat down.  We asked the waitress for menus, but were ignored.  A female supervisor came over after 5 minutes and told us to get up and join the line at the front of the restaurant.  I told her that the waitresses at the rear directed to the empty table.  Another 5 minutes went by now the manager Joe Bagorro came over and told us to get up now since there were 5 parties waiting ahead of us in line.  He told us we had LIED about the waitresses in the rear directing us to this table. Why on earth would we lie?  Since we had been seated, over 5 parties had been seated, so we are to get up and now go to the end of the line with who knows how many had come after us.We just left.  Totally inconsiderate management and made me feel ashamed to be at a disadvantage.  Poorly handled situation with total disrespect for my disability. As a result of this, we will NEVER again visit any Fran's locations.I had been a patron of Fran's since the early days on St Clair Ave West.We also had to pay $7 for the underground parking for almost being thrown out.
While the service is great the items (different products and supplies) are overpriced and trash. Shame.Update: Funny how I get a response to my review from Ben H about my review (the only review this person has ever done) Telling me I'm wrong in my review. ROFLMBO I am not fooled one bit. Ben H is one giving a review on a business he works for or owns. Which is a no no big time. Then lashing out when someone who's been in the dump gives an honest review.  IMHO if you're looking for a good deal check out Goodwill, Salvation Army, Savers or a garage sale. The items will be cheaper and cleaner.Copy of response load into photos.
Where to begin?  They said a hand wash and hand wax would take 30-45 min.  So it took over an hour.    And it was still dirty.   Water spots all over.  Under tailgate never cleaned.  Cup holders dirty. Mays not cleaned.  And then fresh new dirty fingertips on leather seats    And when I told the owner I don't have time for them to fix it and not paying because they didn't give the service promised.  The owner said don't pay and never come back.  That was the response    Go hear if u want 60-70% clean for cheap prices.  Or go somewhere else that has integrity and people skills
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!  UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS POST TO POST TO THIS PAGE I HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STAR WHEN IF I HAD THE OPTION TO CHOSE NEGATIVE 5  STARS I WOULD !!!! I called in October to schedule an appointment and was told no opening until Saturday 12/3/2016 which I went ahead and scheduled.  Come Saturday 12/3/2016  I find out that The Studio was NEVER  going to call me to let me know that my "Stylist" oh I'm sorry student had graduated and I no longer had an appointment.  The REFUSED to accommodate my schedule after I had accommodated theirs to wait for a month and a half for my appointment.  Both Adam (instructor) and Amy (Associate Director) were very sarcastic and condescending and uncaring about my appointment not being able to be held.  They both kept telling me that it's a school not a salon but yet The Studio accepts money for salon services.    I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE FOR ANY SERVICES.  THEY ARE HEARTLESS AND UNSYMPATHETIC TO ANYONE'S NEEDS BUT THEIR OWN!!!!  RUN FROM THIS PLACE AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!!
Any one else having problems booking an appointment after purchasing the Groupon? I left two messages over a week ago and haven't heard back...hopefully this wasn't a giant scam!
Worst AYCE place I've been to.Went once with a group of 4 but was seated at a table meant for 2.Food quality was below average and the service was horribly slow.  What ticked me off is that they kicked us out for reaching the time limit (I think it was 1 hour) even though we spent about as much time eating as trying to flag a server down and waiting for food.Will not be going back.
Being the only place that serves Thai in the area I was hoping I had found a nearby place for my Thai fix. Well this place won't be it for me. I went with several friends and we all got something different to share. To the food. The Panang Curry was watered down and lacked flavor, it was a shadow of the true Panang Curry I've had everywhere else. Next the Pad See Oew... Or what they called Pad See Oew. The noddles were floating in liquid. The noodles were rubberish and it was all very bland. The Pad Thai... Hard to mess this one up right...wrong. First it came out looking neon orange which is no big deal as long as it taste good which it didn't. We got it at spice level 7/10 which I do everywhere. The heat level was good but it wasn't heat with flavor but just all over your mouth heat with the bland noodles. On to the fourth bad dish, the Lo Mein noodles. The noodles tasted stale and lacked any flavor what so ever. The one good item we ordered was the garlic chicken. Nothing special about it but it was good.
Cheap but NOT worth it. My bus was delayed by 4 hours. We were left stranded in the dirty bus station without any customer service updating us on our situation. When people started to ask questions staff became aggressive towards the paying customers. Horrendous customer service along with overall transport service. Never again.
Ordered chips and salsa, took 3 years to get it. They can't handle basic service items.
Pretty lousy service, and drinks are small and overpriced. We sat for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged, we ordered a cocktail for my wife, chips and guacamole, and a Diet Coke for me. When the waiter brought the coco-rita my wife, he spilled part of the drink on the table, he left immediately with the drink tray for other tables, as the flow of my wife's spilled drink spilled off the edge of the table. We were left to scramble for napkins from empty tables to soak up the spill. Her drink started out mostly ice anyway, and she had just a few sips left before it was gone. Just a margarita glass 3/4 full of ice. The guac was ok, the salsa was a dark tomato pasty looking thing, not much flavor. Almost $40 for 1 drink, chips and guac, and a Diet Coke. What a lousy time.
The bouncers and especially are rude with a power trip and can suck a DICK. They wouldn't allow my friend and i in the bar because we were wearing shorts on while other customers were wearing shorts. Such Liars! That place is overrated. Big douche bar! BITCH IT AINT VEGAS! !
Came here after spending a Friday night at Savoy. We talked a lot about shawarmas so we decided to check this place out after seeing their sign.That $9.99 for 2 shawarma deal is lunch only. Normal price is $6 each. Chicken was meh. And the guy was very stingy with the meat. Not worth it at all. I ordered samousas afterwards (2 for $3.50) and those were meh too.Cheap? More like a rip off. I have had cheaper and tastier shawarmas before.
Amazing. Apparently there's zero communication between employees at Fitness One because after somewhat successfully cancelling my membership on Tuesday night I got a phone call tonight from "Jennifer" inviting me to come to a free fitness assessment because I was a "preferred member".So either I was wrong to think that my account was actually closed or Jennifer doesn't know how to read a client file?
This was my first Vegas buffet. My boyfriend got food poisoning from this buffet. The selection was small and it was often difficult to get at the food because it was not set up in the tradition buffet style. It was more like a cafeteria. The pasta section had a chef that would make you whatever you ordered. I ordered some pasta which ended up tasting like the pan he cooked it in. I didn't eat more than a couple of bites before I was completely disgusted. Everything else didn't taste good either. This was a terrible buffet. The dessert selection was good, but I don't go to buffets for the dessert. One star for crappy food!!!
Very social (aka LOUD) .  Food was not very good.  Waiter forgot to bring some things we ordered and the gluten free dish that was ordered was delivered with bread crumbs on it!!  Would not recommend
This restaurant has terrible service.  The waitresses are extremely unhappy and rude. When we got our table, we had to wait to get our menu. Food is not very tastey either. Then, when the bill came, I didn't finish my food and had asked for a takeout box. The waitress said very rudely that I had to pay 25cents for a takeout box. I have never once had to pay for a takeout box in my entire life of eating in restaurants. This restaurant is extremely cheap. I will not be coming to this restaurant ever again.
Awful awful. Spent 150.00SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. Took 27 minutes to even be acknowledged. Really. The only saving grace was the kids had fun and the hostess took AMAZING care of us......
We have been to a lot of improv comedy shows and this one just did really live up to what I expect to be good improv. The location was good. The price was a little high for the product. seemed more like a place for kids. Could not stand the seats. Could not stand the MC. had some funny parts but the show in general felt dull and dragged on. Would suggest other places over this one like improvMANIA, The Torch, or even The Jesterz if you are looking for "clean comedy". I would not go back.
Oh. My. God. The is a hygiene issue here. They dropped(!!) my plate of stir-fried veggies and then picked it up and tried to serve it to me. Gross.
It used to be that Safeway was VERY customer service friendly and would go out of their way help you. Now they seem to have flipped it and gone out of their way to being rude, offensive and downright UNhelpful. And don't get me started about the long lines at the cash register! Ridiculously clueless and lazy employees. I wish someone from corporate would visit this store for the week and DRAIN THE SWAMP of all the bad employees, and turn it around. This store is a sinking ship and I blame the management. Your customers deserve better than this.
This was our first and last time here. We made reservations. We had to wait fifteen min to be seated. Another 20 for drinks. We were there for tapoyaki. There was children running and screaming between the table.  My favorite part of dinner was the soup. The salad dressing was gross. Almost looked half frozen So I didn't touch it. The sauces were not good and very watery.  The fried rice was not flavorful. The shrimp was good. The calamari was over cooked and chewy. The chicken was so over done even the sauce didn't help it.  Also didn't eat it.  The onions were undercooked.
Snooty staff. Was deeply offended by the horrible service we received. Hostess was arrogant and made statements like, "we are usually a reservations only restaurant, you are lucky we can for you in at all."Not sure how she even had a job with an attitude like that. When I asked to speak to a manager she said no-one was available. Then some guy came up and claimed to be the manager's without even taking the time to respond to my complaints of bad service all he had to say was that a table was available. He was not truthful, however. No table  was available.We left before we were seated. Won't be back. There's a better greek restaurant down the road with significantly better service.
Absolutely terrible experience. We had a big group so I understand that large groups are tough for servers to manage but our server served half the table water and disappeared for half an hour. When the server came back she was incredibly arrogant and impatient with taking orders. The bar staff was no better and made us wait for another half hour because they apparently ran out of glasses. Given the fact that the restaurant was barely at half capacity for a Saturday night, I think the overall operations of this restaurant need a huge overhaul. I'm never going back here again and will try to make sure no one else makes the mistake of going here again.
I needed a last minute notary for a car title I was selling and I called the branch and spoke to a teller apx 10 minutes before they closed. The teller on the phone was kind and told me to have her hurry and I assured her she'd be there no more than a couple minutes past at the most. She said that was fine. I called them back to let them know she was on her way. My wife walked up at 7 and no one made eye contact with her until 7:01 and they turned her away. They refused to help her, even though the process would've been quick. The notary was apparently with another customer, even though the teller told us that my wife should come in. They were closed.Another customer walked up while they were turning away my wife and they helped that customer. My wife called them on the way home, at 13 minutes after 7pm.. and they were still answering the phones and doing business. But yet, they had my wife rush in to make it before 7 and refused to see her 30 seconds after 7pm. And when my wife complained about it at 7:13pm to the teller still working on the phone, she got hung up on. Take your business to another branch that has the decency to not treat their valued customers so poorly. Customer service at this location was a joke. But had she gotten there 30 seconds prior maybe they would've been kind and professional?
Worst experience ever.  my new car was dented after shopping!! food quality is unacceptable.  hot foods are greasy and I threw it in the garbage after a bite.  They display milk and yogurt in room temperature which I worry about its safety.  The price is very attractive but I don't want to eat sth in my stomach that may hazard to my health.
Travelocity is definitely not worth your time. Incompetent representatives, false advertising, sneaky flight details, bad customer service.  You'll be given the run-around if you need to address an error that they have made. When you ask to speak with a manager, they tell you to contact their "Consumer Relations" department. Then all you get is an auto-reply email stating that they will get back to you within 7 days.  Of course they take the full 7 days to get back to you, only to tell you that they need more information. I will NEVER use travelocity again.I bought what was detailed as a ONE STOP ticket and after I purchased the ticket, I got an email confirmation that states that I purchased a TWO STOPS ticket! I would not have purchased a two-stop ticket with a 3-year-old. The whole company is a SHAM. DO NOT USE TRAVELOCITY. Better yet, use them for the list of rates for all of the airlines, then when you find out which airline has the best rate, go the that airline's website and purchase directly from the airline!
We have 2 rooms here with a room key for senior prom! The AZZhole security guard, WE WITH A ROOM KEY which is policy, would not let us in.WHAT KIND OF FKRY is this⁉ AND ITS STORMING‼My beautiful daughter in her prom dress. Never ever do I get so feisty that I want to use my vaporising powers to disintegrate a stupid fk face from the face of the earth, this was the case. The security guard apologized for his actions and was let go for his unkind ways. It's simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated especially when you have a room key to get to your room! Life is simple.
PLEASE READ! IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ANIMAL THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO STAY HERE! They refused us with an emotion support animal. She is a small sweet chihuahua and they claimed she would ruin the room. According to Jason the front desk manager you must be able to prove what the dog does for you. For so many people that depend on their service animal for so many physical and emotional things, this could be incredibly embarrassing to be asked to demonstrate what their animal does for them. DO NOT book your next stay at South Point.
I went here on Saturday for the breakfast special but turns out it's only available on the weekdays, fair enough. So I went again on a Wednesday around 7:20am and it was not even open yet. I saw 2 other cars waiting outside but I just left right after I saw there no lights on and no staff inside. That's ridiculous.. they must have some irresponsible staff working there.
DON'T plan a wedding at the Palais Royale or any other event for that matter.  The coat check staff are thieves and Katarina is horrible.
I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for transportation. The fares are nice but that's about it. The workers are highly incompetent when it comes to basically everything. Rudeness seems to be top priority for these people. I was grabbed by a worker and physically moved by them because I didn't know where the line began for the shuttle; I have never had an incident like this one with a company before. I've been waiting for a shuttle for twenty plus minutes now giving me time to write this review and watch the workers to continue to perform poorly therefore irritating more customers. BIG THUMBS DOWN!
DO NOT GO HERE!Avoid this place. When I went here to be seen there was only one person ahead of me and it still took about an hour for me just to be seen. Once in the back I waited about another half hour before a doctor entered. He spent approximately five minutes with me, but only because I kept asking questions. If I hadn't, he would have left the room within a minute of entering it, literally; no hyperbole here, folks.After being seen I waited I waited another 30-45 minutes for my prescriptions and paperwork for my employer. The one good nurse there gave me my paperwork and even though she said the paperwork for my employer was within the reams of paper it was not, so, of course, I had to go back and get it which meant more waiting.This place operates at a snails pace and the staff, from the receptionist to the physicians, were rude and  generally unhelpful.  DO NOT GO HERE!
If you want a company that no-shows, doesn't call, 2 days in a row, then calls you when they already know you're at work, this is your place.  Throw in the fact that when I called them the first day they were supposed to show up, I left a message and the girl that called me back said they had to reschedule for the next day and she left a message on my wifes phone.  My wife did get a message- AFTER I CALLED TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE FIRST NO-SHOW- She was just covering her back!  Not a company to do business with, shady tactics and they have no problem wasting your time.   This was all through a home warranty, I'd rather pay full price for service than get jerked around just because of what MIGHT be covered under a home warranty.
Extremely poor attitude-problem from the seamstress, short and straight black hair, at this Lululemon.  I do not understand what her issue was or if she was just mad she was working during the after-holiday-rush, but she gave me a huge attitude during my time there to get my boyfriend's pants hemmed.  If I acted like that at my job I would be fired.  You're in the service industry so don't be a b-tch.  I did let the manager know how I was treated but she seemed to not take my complaint very seriously.  I don't feel like she listened or apologized for what happened even though she said she would speak with her.  I'm a small shareholder of this company so I am especially mad.
In Regards to 5 star review which he posted in response to my bad review of him:1) obviously, I am not a valued customer of his. I wouldn't want to be!!! I never hired him because of his incompetent, reckless way of dealing with potential clients. The purpose of these reviews is to warn others of how I was treated so, as I stared in my review: they, the BUYER BEWARE!!! And2) what exactly did I falsify or what was inaccurate? 5 star fails to state one thing in my review of him that is inaccurate or false. He just says: I posted false info & I'm not a valued customer ( which I am glad I'm not) & to remove it. & 3) I have saved ALL MY e-mail correspondence between him & me concerning our dealings & how he failed to honor his terms & agreements.  I CAN PROVE EVERYTHING I POSTED IN MY REVIEW. HE SHOULD BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL OF ACCUSING OTHERS OF FALSEHOODS WHEN EVERYTHING HE SAID IS IN WRITING. Also, I will make those e-mails available to anyone from YELP that would like to see them & also, I will make those e-mails available to any potential client of his that can't make up their mind as to whether  or not to hire him & would like to see them first to ensure my veracity.To me, 5 Star is only digging its hole deeper as I only posted this review on Yelp. Now, I intend to go to FACEBOOK , & other review sites I know of , & keep posting these same reviews as I am more confident than ever that the public needs to be warned about this 5 Star Movers.  Your move, 5 STAR MOVERS.
Me and my wife jest got done here and the food was awful and over priced $40 per person what the hell for bland tasteless food one star for service that's the only thing that was good we sat at the bar and ordered hibachi off the menu teriyaki shrimp is was smothered in oyster sauce not in a good way and the bartender kept pushing to order more drinks Hibachi Japan is soo much better
Should change their motto to...."we speak patient.....in 8 weeks".  We prepaid for braces for my wife.  The initial appointments were fine.  Now, they won't see us for her adjustments unless we make an appointment 8weeks ahead of time.  We had an unexpected emergency that took us out of town so we called to reschedule an upcoming appointment. They said the soonest they would see us was 8 weeks from the date of our call.  We offered to go to a different location to get in sooner but she said this was against policy.   If we hadnt prepaid we would be going elsewhere, but now we are held ransome by their 8week policy.  Go elsewhere.  The advertised cheap prices apparently come at the price of doctor availability.
Hot as an inferno inside because the giant smokers inside. Dirty nasty bathrooms. Wont be back food was so so.
I took my car in for just an oil change they asked if i wanted my tires rotated so I said sure. With the oil change they are supposed to top off all my other fluids nothing else was topped off my alignment is now in awful condition. They tired to take advantage of me because i am a female. I was not please with my experience there at all.
I'm sad that I have to write a poor review about this place. My sister had gone in looking for a wedding dress before and the service was great. This post is meant for the manager of the store. I was really disappointed with how she handled our particular problem. We had purchased some shoe accessories (sole mates) these items are meant to be put on your heel so that they don't dig into the grass. We followed the instructions and put them on correctly, they fit well. However they didn't work, we sank into the grass continually and by the end of the wedding photo shoot (30 minutes) the sole mates had worked their way up our heels and had to be yanked off scraping the finishes off our shoes.When I spoke to an associate about this she told me she would speak to a manager about it. No one ever got back to me. I followed up a few days later and spoke to a manager, I explained my situation. Instead of offering helpful solutions she instantly became defensive and told me I didn't buy the right size, I put them on wrong, and I am the one liable for my ruined shoes because I assumed the risk when I bought the sole mates. She told me to bring in my shoes in so she could look at them. When I asked if we would be reimbursed she snarled and said refunds were against store policy. I've been in the service industry for over 2 decades. I've never seen a manager deal with a situation in such a rude and unhelpful way. I will definitely be sending my brides-to-be elsewhere.
My husband purchased two dozen roses from this place for our anniversary. The SECOND day the roses were already browning and drooping. Absolutely not fresh flowers, and my poor husband paid full pop. He was better off buying flowers from Costco! Not impressed.
C'est ridicule parfois le bus passe en avance et tu le manques ou il passe en retard ou pas du tout (un de mes autobus j'ai du l'attendre 1h). Le nombre de fois que l'autobus passe pas est inacceptable et les retards aussi. En plus il y a toujours des pannes de métro. Vraiment pas fiable. Aussi il passe vraiment pas souvent (mon autobus passe au 30min et les autres proches de chez moi sont au 20min). La nuit il n'y a pas vraiment d'option, le métro ferme tôt et les autobus passent presque jamais
I do not want talk about the management . The gate was broken and somebody already lost stuff ,they do nothing , after that the second person also was lost many stuff . Anyone can come inside . The gate open for everyone . Please consider it and buy insurance equals value when you chose here
Too busy to focus on excellent customer service? Or is it because I'm a single sitting at the sushi bar that I'm not as important or profitable of the table of four? Tonight was the final straw for Ru Sans. My server was so neglectful and rude, the whole experience was ruined. I literally had to get up and go to the bar to get my bill because I only had seen my server once the whole time and I literally couldn't find him.  Did I want another soda? Did I want another sushi roll? Did I want dessert? Shame on you Ru Sans. After many years of coming here, I'm done.
Was once the best...Now that the previous owner sold it, the new owners have managed to trash the food. They said the same cook but I can't believe that's true. Went last night and found the vibe totally different, the food bordering on flavorless (the wings now just taste like salt, fake crab and tasteless fishballs in the pho), the waitress bordering on nasty and the whole deal made it so I'll never return. Farewell Sidestreet....Anyone have any idea where Ken landed?
Horrible service. Food was so so. Sat down waited 10m for menus,  another 15m to order,  and 15m just to get the check.  Never coming here again.
Who ever the guy is that picks up the phone sucks at his job and he works at a phone store so idk I give 0 stars
AC didn't work in our room and room smelled like sewage. Pool was good, steak restaurant was good. Won't stay there again.
Definitely do not recommended. Bought a Groupon and figured I would try it out with a friend. Our gel manicures and pedicures took around 2.5 hours which I was fine with since it was a school and it seemed like they were just really taking their time to do a good job. However, a couple of my gel nails ended up like wrinkly looking, but whatever, it wasn't super easy to notice. Then my friend tells me the next day that she went in the pool and all of her gel nails fell off. So I tried calling the place 3 times, left 2 messages and waited to see if I would get a call back. Nothing for over a week. So I tried calling again and still couldn't get a hold of anyone. FINALLY talked to someone almost a month later and all they said was "it's a school so that's the risk you take" and that it was so far out from the date now that they can't do anything -even though I called the Tuesday after the appointment (since they aren't open Sunday or Monday) but got nothing back. I looked into their policies more on the website and even if my friend had gone back the next day, they apparently would have charged her another $5-$10 for "supply" charges to redo her nails. I will definitely NOT be going back. It's not worth $20 + tip to have gel nails for a day
British Air is a joke! Our flight from Phx to LHR onto AMS was cancelled due to birds damaging the jet engine. Took us HOURS in ticketing line to try and rebook. That entire process was very frustrating and chaotic. I finally called and after holding for 40 mins I was able to book 2 seats for the following night. They did provide hotel and meal vouchers.The seats on the plane were increibly tight. I am average size and could not lean down to reach my carry on nor could I rest my head on the tray because the seat in front prevented it. It was an incredibly uncomfortable 10 hour flight.Due to the cancellation of this flight, we were charged $120 by the AMS hotel as a NO SHOW even through no fault of our own. We have been trying to reach BA since early January '14 by phone to discuss a refund for that $120 charge.  NO ONE answers the phones.  In desperation and frustration we left a voicemail.  STILL WAITING for a callback.On our return to Phx, we were unable to do the online check-in 24 hrs prior to departure.  We called ticketing in AMS and they were not only unable to tell us why we could not access the online check-in but they were unable to provide seat assignments.  We were told to go to the ticketing agent at the AMS airport.With the seating arrangements on the initial flight still fresh in our minds, getting back onto a BA plane was not something we looked forward to.In the past. We have flown KLM and we will definitely give our business to them.Thoroughly disgusted.
I don't know why people eat here and think it's good?we had a 2 for one coupon and ate here.we sat down and after 5 minutes had to flag girl down to get something to drink.terrible service.we ordered their benny's.we knew from last time not to order their diablo potatoes they taste like eating cardboard so got hashbrowns.our breakfast comes the hashbrowns are frozen cakes like ya get from mcdonalds or arbys!!!! this is suppossed to be a restaurant not fast food. the "eggs benedict" canadian bacon was thick and from a can!!!! worst eggs benedict I have ever eaten!!!! we knew not to order any mexican eggs cause we both remember how bad they were.even with the 2 for one coupon wasn't worth it.we will never go back.there is nothing on the menu that we think is any good.ingredients they use is same as fast food and that's better and cheaper. lousy restaurant
Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!
I'm pretty much regular in this joint. I come here at least 3 times a week, and normally    it's always around between 6am-10am. I wasn't much a fan of the service but the stir fried low mein is hands down the best I've had so far. So I keep going back to this place regardless of how mediocre the service were. I've figured I can overlooked that service part, since it's not that bad.    Tonight at 8:25pm I decided to go in. They were slow. 3 tables were occupied. A guy who seated me was already annoyed that I was there. He was on the phone while seating me.    I went and ordered my usual. I just told him what I wanted since I already know what I wanted.    He kept asking me to look for the number on the menu. He then was irritated when I asked him for a Pepsi. The entire evening of service was like, I was being treated like shit. Around an hr and half of me being there, never once I was approached to ask if I'm still alive or choking with something. I still went ahead and just kept eating.    By the time I decided I am done and I still have half of my low mein left on my plate, I was waving at anybody that would pass by my table to get my ticket and a to go box. Two men were working that night. I seem to be invisible. Then finally, one guy approached me, I asked for a to go plate, and he pointed out the direction of the door and said something " there" and walked away.    Again, patiently enough, I waited for someone to come to my table again. Nobody came. So I stood up and asked one of the other guy who was taking orders, and he then again told me " there the to go plate". I guess, I was supposed to get my own to go box, located right next to the entrance door. By this time, I've had enough. So I said " ok can I get a check..". The first guy I asked for a to go box, went to the cash register and rang me up, I gave him my card and asked for his name. He said his name is " Johnny". I doubt if that's even his real name,    I said " you guys are rude, I said what kind of service is this.. I waved at you multiple times you were ignoring me" - as I signed the receipt marking " no tip". He said " one person works inside the kitchen so we're short". So I asked him " who's that owner what is his/her name?".    He goes " You dont' need to know her name". I said I come here almost 3 times a week in the morning and I'm a regular you should be nicer to the customers". And He said yelling " go in the morning!".    That was that and I left. That would be the last time I go to this place. Being short handed was not an excuse for being rude to the customer. He could have been apologetic and that would have been fine with me.
After explaining our disappointment with dishonest agents and online companies, they assured us they had been to the resort we were booking and that it was truly a 5 star. HAHA. What a joke. We arrived to find cockroaches in our room, along with ever present spiders (halls never cleaned), stained carpets, rusted out bathroom fixtures, falling apart furniture and terrible food. We sent a photographic record to them as well as Conquest Vacations. They both ignored our concerns and did NOTHING to make us feel any better after spending $3,000 with them. Of course, I shouldn't have been surprised. They were involved in some highly unethical dealing with the OutGames wherein they were trying to extort money from Toronto's gay community by forcing them to purchase membership in Team Toronto with the punishment being that you would not be allowed to march in the opening ceremonies of the OutGames. A TOTAL LIE !!!. RAINBOW HIGH should change their name to Rainbow Ripoff the Gay Community. They should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of their position in Toronto's gay community. STAY AWAY from these thieves.
Because of plans that needed to be maid last minute my family and I were stuck with this hotel for the night. We paid $120+ for a $50 room.- Hotel doors face the outside so there is less security.- breakfast was the "cold bread" kind - prepackaged cereal and pastries. Nothing warm.- blankets had gaping holes in them - http://flic.kr/p/c7GdiS- best part was the signed form letter in the hotel room. Note the "Insert your info - http://flic.kr/p/c7Gdr3- nothing updated or renovated in 15 yearsIf still interested in staying there, look for the parking lot with weeds growing through the cracks.
By far the worst service I've ever encountered in my life. Not only did we ask for rice 3 times... it never came. Water wasn't filled once. Two ladies working and four tables seated. This place can sucks. I don't understand how you forget when someone's asks 3 times for a spacific item. Water? Cmon that's automatic. I don't care what excuse you have, that should never be forgotten. Last time I eat here. I don't recommend anyone eating here. We had to ask for our check 2 times and only when the next shift came we got our check. Go to honey pig. That place is better. Better food and service at honey pig.
We ordered the white queso, forgot to tell them without hair.... It was left on the bill... We will not return to this location.
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO APPALLED BY THE MEDICAL CARE RECEIVED! Or should I say lack there of! Appointments?! Clearly mean nothing, after waiting 3 hours before being seen! Then to have Dr. Royal-Pain-In-The-Ass only look for 2 minutes and proceed to rush me out. Not to mention the MOST INCOMPETENT, ABSOLUTE RUDEST UNPROFESSIONAL FRONT DESK STAFF I have EVER met!!. I'm sure I would've been better off using webMD or Google to diagnose myself! Unbelievably awful!! Just an over all Atrocious experience!! RUN!! DONT WASTE YOUR DAY in this fast food, sorry excuse for a medical office!!
worst food ever. Even my boyfriend who will eat just about anything- did not finish his food. I paid $11 for a taco and enchilada, I ate perhaps two bites of taco and a third of my enchilada. NEVER again. Why does this place continue to get business?
We had a terrible experience at Biarritz this evening. I was there with one other person initially. Once we had decided to stay, we called a few other people to see who would join us. We then ordered the $50 poutine... had to see what this was all about.A little while later, around 11 PM, our friends arrived - 6 in total. They were told that the kitchen was closed. They asked if they could get a drink. They were told they could not. So, we had invited them over, it is -17 degrees outside, and they are being told to leave. Do you see a problem here?And so they left. We should also have left. Instead, I tried to discuss what had just happened with the server. She was not interested. I then talked to the manager to see if I could get a tiny bit of understanding out of her. No. She insisted that I was wrong because we had sat at a table for 2... There was no way for them to know that we had friends coming. But this is Montreal, on a Saturday night, in a restaurant on St. Laurent with music blasting. Who would expect it to close at 11:00 PM? Anyway, they decided to argue with me instead of trying to figure  out a way to settle the issue.  Then the $50 poutine arrived. Terrible. The meat was inedible. It may have been 25 oz of steak... but 24 ounces were inedible. It was beyond fat.We ate the mediocre french fries, paid the $50 plus tax for the worst poutine I have ever had, and left there very unhappy.
I had the worse service at this location yesterday. After my car got hit in a parking lot while it was parked while I was working. I had to take my car in for collision repair. The collision place called this location for me and they came and picked me up. Ok so then after going through the whole entire transaction and being told that it was a 50.00 deposit and a hold would be placed on my debit card. I had to transfer money from one account to another. I was then told that my card didn't go through as it was not the 50.00 hold it would be 52.00 and due to the fact that I had already transferred what was supposed to be enough it was 2 dollars more. They could not use my card again until 24 hours went by to redo the transaction. This is one stupid procedure that kept me from getting a rental that I needed. She showed no interest in helping me or even bending the rules a bit to get me a vehicle. The person that was doing the transaction was stupid and the so called manager was dumb as hell and wouldn't not come from the back of the room. She just sent some little lame stupid guy to stop me from doing what they think all blacks do is get "Violent" which I do not do. Horrible service, a great deal of racial profiling in this location. Stay away from this location at all cost. I proceeded to walk over to Enterprise Rental and got a car and was out of their in 30 minutes at the Autoplex center.
If i could give 0 stars I would. Awful awful awful! What a waste of my time and money. Ordered the 4 piece shrimp and chips & 2 piece fish 7 shrimp, ended up with 3 pieces of fish and 9 shrimps that were so completely covered in their breaded stuff you couldn't even enjoy the shrimp. I will never go to this location again.
Slow, surly, shoddy & expensive. I can work around the first, sort of appreciate the second, and can even justify the fourth. But it's shoddy that runs through. I just came back with five shirts. The press-job for the top half was great, but the bottoms all had some oblong shaped, like a giant tongue depressor, neatly stamped into the pressing. Below that, the runner around the bottom of the shirt looked like a twisting DNA strand. Probably OK if these shirts were meant to be tucked in, but they aren't!So I'm done.
Completely and utterly awful.  The service sucked, the food choice completely lame, and the shot glasses were a 1/2 shot.  The seating is cramped. Don't bother with this hole in the wall.
I purchased a brand new Hyundai Sonata at this dealership and the smooth talking salesman was trying to get me at $436 per month payments. I told him I couldn't afford that amount, he then said how about $380. I still said no. I needed to be closer to $300 per month. after bringing out the heavy guns and the closers to basically strong-arm me, we reached $320 per month payments and I had to put $1000 more down. I went to sign the papers and I noticed that the crafty finance guy added 6 payments to the 72 months that I had agreed to. I got up and walked out. My wife and I went to another Hyundai dealership in Las Vegas, and I don't want to name them because people will think that I am biased and probably work for the other dealership, but I don't. I am a retired vet. I think that most of all these 5 stars given on this report are a scam and are from people who are affiliated with this terrible dealership.This practice of switching paperwork should stop. Henderson Hyundai Superstore are a HUGE SCAM!!!!
This the worst flower place that I've ever encountered. The flowers they sent were not at all as pictured. When I called to get a replacement bouquet they were so rude it was astonishing. Got yelled at on the phone for not being happy with the bouquet. Expensive. Rude. Go anywhere but here. They need to be put out of business.
The Pizza Gods have blessed us today.   Thank you for closing down!  One and done.  Tried it once and never went back.    If I could give zero stars, I would have definitely given what was deserved.
Terrible car wash tried to get my windshield replaced there and they said they had to order the molding. They contacted me next day setting up an appointment at my home a month later I'm having to have my windshield replaced again because they didn't really order new molding they flipped over the old molding leaving a gap for water to get into my car
This is the worse service I had on my life, I did asked to bring me water 3 times half of my order was missing when I asked the waitress she said sometimes they lost the order and you have to order it again. They bring each sushi plate to the table every 10 minutes, but when you asked for the bill they bring it away. Right the food was good but they have very very poor customer service. And one star is too much for this restaurant
Went here with my family tonight.  We have been going here every time but tonight we went here it was so horrible.  The food was so horrible, no taste, no flavor it was just plain and bland... It was so disappoonting my family and i left their still hungry and had to end up goint some place else to eat dinner...
Never had a pedicure and it's been years since I had a manicure. Thought I'd do both before my sons wedding. The pedi was great! The manicure left a lot to be desired. I left with dry cuticle untrimmed around each nail and had uneven edges on each nail that needed re shaping. Came home and trimmed cuticle and filed my nails to get rid of the rough edges! Place was clean, staff friendly, but don't see myself returning any time soon!
Tried to have breakfast at Over Easy but after a 40 minute wait and cold food we left. Much better at the Breakfast Joynt. Fast service and great food. My tummy is happy
My 6 friends and I had reservations yesterday morning when they opened at 11.  We are all older and were sat at the tall table right next to the counter, the chairs were HORRIBLY uncomfortable, made of medal with a really tiny little seat, like for a 5 year old, we all kept sliding off of them because they had such a high gloss on them.  I brought it to several peoples attention and asked to be moved and was told that the other 6+ tables were all reserved, mind you we had reservations too.  The food looked like it would be really good and I guess if it had been hot it would've been but my over easy eggs were hard, the enchiladas underneath were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted.  The icing on the cake was the noise, we had a hard time hearing each other at the long, high table and then they brought in loud, live music, Oh Boy, won't be my next choice of places to go.  The flowers on our table were completely dead in cloudy water, obviously needed to be replaced yesterday.  When the waitress brought our bills, gratuity was already included, she asked me if I needed change on my $20 bill, I was like a yeah I do, I didn't get $7 service here.  Just saying, if I ever went back, it definitely wouldn't be on a Sunday morning and I would refuse to sit at that tall table.  The only good thing I can say about this place is had my eggs been cooked properly, they would've been amazing, I don't know where they get their eggs from but the yoke was amazing, what part of it that was still soft.
Are you kidding me? This was THE worst service I've ever had in my life! If you don't mind waiting over an hour and having your order be incorrect then this is the place for you. Servers with attitude should be sent home, not left on the floor to ruin people's evenings.
The food was terrible. Lobster was made out of rubber and that's was the first time I didn't finish my filet mignon, because it was unchewable.
We went for dinner on a Monday night. We waited over an hour for the sushi. We only received half of our order. Never received our drinks.  When we complained to the manager he said that server would not be there much longer and he would take off the food we never received and a glass of wine.  Terrible service and customer service. Will never go back.
Brian was the rudest person I've ever delt with especially because I'm a woman. I want an oil change that's all I need. Not new tires I have a new car. He kept trying to up sale me. My car was towed here and they had the keys he kept trying to take the keys to my other car and didn't understand what keys were for what car. He wouldn't listen rolled his eyes and was beyond rude. Then lost my keys for my car. Then acted like using my boyfriends rewards card was illegal. Worst service ever. I was highly recommended here to talk to some one else and won't be returning due to his attitude. Treated me like a pos because he lost my keys that were already there.
I think this place is built on a burial ground, gives me bad vibes. Small and depressing, usually only come here if...well...I stopped torturing myself and will only make an appearance if it's a friends Bday or somethin'.
Just about as bad of an experience as you can get.  Horrible female barber (if you can call any of them barbers) who pretty much place a bowl over your head and cut around it in layers.  No idea how to fade (blend) your hair from shorter to longer.  Then after your horrible haircut they want to wash and dry your hair like a female hair salon.  When I said no thanks she informed it was part of the fee.  I asked what the fee and my mouth dropped.  With a decent tip you'll be paying $40 for a haircut your wife would do a better job with.The woman I got pretty much tells me how she hates men, union county, and pretty much life in general.  To sum it up this is pretty much a typical chop shop (no pun intended) corporate run barber shop.  Gentlemen, run from this place!
Ordered a chicken  teriyaki bowl. The chicken was hard , at least I think it was chicken. It was uneatable . Either it was way overcooked or way over breaded. It had sort of woody texture. Had to throw it away. I will be hesitant to return.
Simply put service was horrible food was ok nothing special and finally price was high for quality of service, atmosphere and food...I will not be back and you should stay cleare of this place.
Nasty. Gross. The griddle must not have been clean because my eggs, hash browns and bacon all tasted like old grease.
I got the 12.99 basic wash. Pulled up & there was no sign to wait or what to do. Finally ten minutes later someone comes up. I ask how long it'll be for the "basic" and he tells me ten minutes max. It's been over an hour and I am still waiting for my car. Not worth the time or money.
Food is great thats why I go there . A friend had mentioned to me how at yuphas the owner came up to their table when they were still finishing up and wanted them to leave so the next people could get a seat . Today the same thing happened , I still had the soup and salad I was finishing up , my friends were still eating ,their was food on their plates and the owner comes and says to me looks like you have finished and your check is also here . I did not appreciate this at all .Looks like you cannot enjoy a meal here without being rushed .
I'm writing this review to stress my disappointment with how much worse this place was (July 2016) compared with the last couple times I've been there. I don't know what has happened, but it's just sad. They serve Moscow Mule's in plastic cups, really clueless!?!. On the bright side the Pimento cheese dip with pretzels was pretty good, yay! 1 star. Won't go back, bye bye...
I think it i so overrated and I love Bobby Flays in Atlantic city.   Both the chicken and the pork tenderloin were dry.  Ashame, because staff was great.  I never expected to have a thigh with my chicken for the price.   Never ate the thigh but breast was dry as well.  They tried to make right for my partner and did not charge her. I though maybe it was just her because I can eat anything so I tried her pork tenderloin it was so dry I could not eat it.  Too many great food places for us to ever go back there.  Hope they listen and get a chef who knows how to do southwestern food and make it moist.
Ive gone to this nail shop 4 times in the past 2 years. Service gets worst everytime I go. The 1st time I went there an older man did my nails. The very next day my nails began to lift! I was in complete shock to see acrylic lift after 1 day. So I immediately went back to the shop and Tony fixed my nails free of charge. While doing so he told me that he was sick of the man that messed up my nails and that he had been trying to get the owner/his ex to fire him.  Tony is funny and ok doing nails yet very unprofessional. He said so many inappropriate things about his ex and women period.My 3rd visit there was because the nail shop I normally go to was crowded... Tonys ex/The owner did my nails and she seemed like she was in the worst mood ever, her son kept crying and was running around the place. But she did a better job than the older man and Tony. My issue was her poor attitude and her child running around. I normally go to the nail shop to be pampered, relax, get away from my kids. My 4th and final visit I got a pedi and a fill. Tonys ex (sorry I dont know her name) did my pedi and a younger Asian girl did my nails. Once again they both had horrible attitudes. The younger one was sooo rough and she ruined my pedi experience by doing my nails while I was getting a pedi. Instead of her moving to do each hand she had me cross my arm over the other so my right arm was numb by the end of the fill. She also damaged my cuticles and made me bleed. She gave me the most painful fill I've ever gotten.  Also the little boy was there again and he was running around and whining because he was hungry.  Also they charge an extra $5 to apply matte top coat even if you bring your own matte polish. She said they charge extra due to the extra labor! What extra labor? There is no difference between applying a shiny top coat and a matte top coat. Needless to say I will never go back to this nail shop.
PLEASE READ FOR YOUR SAFETY:Stayed for one night. Checked in and had to change rooms at midnight after discovering a used drug needle in the bathroom.Spoke to the front desk manager who rudely said, nothing he could do about it.No discount, apology, nothing.If you don't mind taking your life in their hands!Just want to warn others of the unsafe conditions!!!!!!
Very cold/bad customer service. You'd ask a question about an item on the menu and he'd reply with a semi brag and then tell you that it's sold out. No list for available coffee. and when you ask about the options he'd reply with "choose whatever". Seems very disinterested in customers, and when we tipped him almost 25% (yeah, i know) he didn't even utter a simple thank you. Just a poker face a la "why are you still here". It seems like the positive reviews are from family and friends, cuz this was not a nice place. The coffee we did get was good though. If kind service isn't that much of an important factor to you, hit it up. Otherwise, there are plenty of decent and better places to go to.
This place is a 4 star if you're maybe in your 20s, but if you want a nice meal and being able to have a conversation, this is not it. The music was just way too loud. It feels like it's trying to be a night club more than a restaurant. The food is decently okay; definitely not the best and nothing to go gaga over. The waiter we had was incredibly rude and went off on us for ordering something they didn't have. I mean, seriously? We spent 800+ dollars with a mandatory 22% tip and this is the service? Never coming back again...
Super slow! Took two hours for dinner and we arrived at 4:30. Took 30 minutes to bring me water and only after I asked her twice. Messed up my drink order 3 times and never got it right. Sticky floors. Several of the servers acted snotty with our requests. The hostess was rude when we asked to sit at a booth and she told us the booth was for parties bigger than ours (we had six). When we left, a party of four was in the booth! Took nearly 30 minutes to run our check! What happened to service with a smile? Go to Sandbar next door for better service, better drinks and a better atmosphere.
Really disappointed by the service. Called in and said we have 10 people coming in and asked for a reservation. They took our name. We drove from another angry crab to come here to find out that they don't have our name nor do they take reservations over the phone. Why then even ask our name? The hostesses didn't try to help. Not sure how they do business here but this isn't the right way.
Worst experience ever! Do not order a tuna sandwich. If you do the staff will be vocal in shaming you of your food choice.
First time coming here and my last time. The service sucked big time, very little instructions on where anything is. The food area looks like a health code violation, the plates and sliverware still had left over food. .. overall this place seems like its been open for years and everything is grimy and gross, the broth has no flavor, taste like boiling water. Was it worth the 22.00, nope... Will I come back? Nope I am afraid I might get food poisoning
Went there to get my nose pierced last month and the piercer did not sterilize the stud. I watched him bend the stud with a plier and his bare hands and did not sterile after. After the piercing he recommended 3 items in which I bought all 3. 2 of the items were pointless (wasting money) and the other one was a sea salt spray in which did not do the job it should have done. I was left a month later with a huge bump. Hypertrophic scarring (which is normal) but mine got so big and nothing would make it go away. I was so desperate I went back into the shop and asked what to do. The piercer called it a "keloid" in which was totally incorrect. A keloid and hypertrophic scarring is completely different. Then he told me to continue to put tea tree oil on it. After 2 weeks of doing that I was so fed up. I decided to go to a RELIABLE piercer in north Olmsted in which he was great. He said my piercing was not pierced at the right angle and that I won't be able to wear a hoop and if I did it will stick out. The piercer at all tattoos pierced it straight where as your suppose to pierce it at an angle. He changed my stud to a higher quality stud (which I wasn't offered at all tattoo). I am SO disappointed with my piercing and will most certainly not return. I would not suggest going there to get your nose pierced. Unless you want a dreaded experience.
I would give this place zero stars if I could I came with my friends to tint our windows on our cars and 2 out of 3 cars had bubbles the next day so I returned to try and get them redone and they refused ... unbelievable don't go to these crooks
I can say this safely now and get this off my chest. I used to be an employee here, and I will share with you my experience. Most of the employees that work there are desperate seasonal employees who never stay long. Of the three months working there, the longest employee was a sad, withered undocumented old man who had meager career options. Habib the owner seems to be bipolar with a dr jekyll /hyde personality. He would yell, verbally abuse, and humiliate both the customers and employees on a daily basis. When I was first hired on, he payed far below minimum wage and under the table. He liked to call it a 'salary'. The food I saw the owner and the chef cook was horrific. The meat kabobs greasy, and soups were frozen, never fresh. The yogurt drink was expired as well as many of the market items he had next to the restaurant. He simply took the items and added a further expiration date. He took my tips and said I had to earn them by working there longer. He has lost passion for the restaurant business(if he ever had it), and treats people like animals who can't discern quality food.
Quantity over quality. The staff proved this to us over and over during our three-night stay in April. It started when we checked in. We booked 2 rooms for 6 people, but the Flamingo says these 2-queen rooms are for "double occupancy" so when we gave the three names of the people staying, we were charged extra. The pool is great, but everything else sucks.
This place is a joke I walk in to make an appointment the lady stated I am the only person working and one person ahead of me so I made an appointment less than an hour. When I come back to the appointment I was told there are 3 people in front of me and the same women was in the chair and the wait was going to be 45 minutes more after waiting 15mintues past my appointment. I would never come here again. Can believe this is how they treat customers.
These guy's were at the Chandler Ostrich Festival 2010.My daughter wanted a smoked turkey leg, big belly's bbq were the only vendor that was selling smoked turkey legs. So I decided to go ahead and get one for her. I waited in line, paid for my order ($10 for one leg) and started waiting in another line...Little did I know that these people were accepting money for product that wasn't even cooked yet. 40 minutes later with about 30 people behind me, I finally got the leg. We walked to the stage at this event, took our seats and I noticed that my 11 year old daughter was barely even picking at it. I asked her why she wasn't eating and she gave me a lame excuse...Now my daughter is a healthy eater, but she also doesn't like to complain. (She also realized that we had waited almost an hour for the turkey to finish cooking and didn't want to be a pain)I decided to try some of it.It was moist, but it tasted awful. Sort of like a combination of raw egg and raw poultry. By this time I was pretty pissed, not only had I wasted 10 dollars on sub-standard meat, but also 45 minutes of my time!I really wanted to see the band that was playing since that was the main reason we went. (http://www.wartheband.com/home.html)After they were finished playing I took the leg back and they just blew me off as though I was trying to rip them off.The bottom line is that  these people cannot seem to handle large events or even maintain a consistent product. Keep that in mind the next time you have any remote urge to hire these people. Horrible food, horrible customer service, but they will gladly take your money.
We ordered 3 drinks. One large caramel macchiato, one small chestnut praline latte with no whipped cream, and one medium hot green tea with 2 ice cubes. We received a medium caramel macchiato, a medium gingerbread latte with whipped cream and a large matcha iced latte. When I asked to change the gingerbread latte for a chestnut praline, I specified no whipped cream in both English or French in case of a language barrier. Nope. Still got whipped cream on my medium latte.
Gosh, I guess you really get what you pay for. I have tried this place twice (my fault for thinking the first bad experience was a fluke). The first time - the car's warning lights started going off - of course, after I was about 100 miles out of the area on my way down to CA. The cars are OLD and NOT WELL MAINTAINED. The second time - there was no one at the counter. Just a phone number to call if you happen to show up. I call them and wait ... and wait... and wait... I actually waited for about a full 15 minutes, feeling extremely stupid - how can they advertise 24 hour service, if no one's at the counter and no one shows up? I ended up just heading over to another car counter and booking a car there. After the end of my booking (another 15 minutes), I looked over, and STILL, NOBODY HAD SHOWN UP! Don't waste your time - just spend another 5 bucks per day and go to a different car rental there.
Servers can't tell a real driver's licence from a fake one. Refused service for my daughter who is of legal age to drink and bluntly embrassed her by telling her the ID was fake. She tried to show that the birthdate on her government Health Card was the same (She knows a health card's can't be used as ID).  Eventually, the server spoke to a manager and offered to serve, but without compensation for the embarrasment. A free dessert, discount.  They need to be smart serve certified to understand how to determine real ID from fake. Maybe, asking for another piece of ID as well to confirm the legitimacy of the birthdate. Food is overpriced.
I ordered that Pomodoro and honestly I cant tell you it was pretty horrible the meatballs were very overcooked and dry, the sauce was incredibly bland and the portion size was like 2 bites. The only half way decent thing was the actual past itself which was average. For just under $11 definitely not worth it I wouldn't have paid $5 for this.
The ONLY reason this place gets one star(aside from the fact that I can't give it NO stars)is that the security staff is cool when I bring  my dog for early am training.Actually I think they might be relieved as he is a working dog,and probably looks like added security.One morning I was going in with him and all the crackheads who hang by the Bank of America ATM were already amassed.One of them asked me"Hey.is that a po-leese dog?"My reply was "Sort of.He's a drug dog trained to find meth." I never saw so many disability claiming neer do wells scatter so fast.They were still gone when I went to leave.The place is sketchy,nasty,and the parking lot is NOT safe.More often than not,skells are perusing it looking in vehicle windows and trying doors.The malwart there is one of the nastier ones I've been in,so much so,that even with gas prices being what they are,I will drive further away for a less frightening shopping experience.The shops in the actual mall part are gehttofab,so if you really need a chola version of Marilyn Monroe on a t shirt,there are a few places that sell really nice ones.There's one shop that sells really cheap costumne jewelry,but for some unknown reason,the place REEKS of formaline.I don't know how anyone can actually work there and not incur liver damage from whatever the toxic waste they're storing there is.The excure for a food court is terrifying.Yes,I'd like the deep fried ptomaine on a stick with a side order of Shigella please.Ick ick ick and ick.
Hate this location personally.We only drop by here for a quick coffee but the drive thru and inside always has a massive lineup and the staff are retarded. Better to find another Tims.
just ate here for lunch.  uuugh, $12 bucks for chicken fried rice. so not worth it. tasted like it should have cost $4. don't eat here. the cook was rude too.
Horrible service and overpriced. Waited forever for our food and they always forget orders when they are busy. Food tastes decent but not amazing.
Ghetto. Inside of the place is ramshackle offices with a garage. Lot is tiny. Car selection minimal. Never going back. How has this place been here so long?!
I have been to this location several times In the past year since several friends and myself are getting married.Pros: decent selection and okay prices, decent hoursCons: Staff are frustrating to work with, it's apparent commissions and the bottom dollar is the first priority.  Appointments are rushed, crowded with lots of people, and they wont document your information so remember what you like if you go back. Customer service is very poor.I had to call three different times to request my dress to be shipped to me, which I told them when I ordered it and they said they put it in my order, since I am now living out of state (I still dont have it a month later after it arrived in the store).  They give the run around to honor bridesmaid discounts.Be specific when you order and before you pay, sales are final which they won't always say that it can take 8 or even 12 weeks for some dresses because they are "made-to-order" dresses, dont be pushed to buy 6-9months out, for their sales goals to be reached.  Go there for a decent selection but it is not a good experience for your happy occassion.Be on your toes, ask specific questions, and be aware that they may not have your best interest as a customer in mind as much as they have the profits in mind.
My dinner cost me over $800.00 Had dinner there food was good but I bit down on a rock in my salad from the salad not being washed properly and broke a tooth.  I brought it to the manager and he gave me his card, I called and called.  They ignored me.  So I paid out of pocket to get my dental work.I will NEVER RETURNif you want dirty salad then you have dinner thereManager not honest said owner will helpOwner will not accept responsibility Produce not being properly prepared
This place sucks. I was trapped in the drive threw. The screen where you orders makes cracking noises. The girl mumbles and forgets she is taking my order. I can't get the hell out cause someone is in front of me. She says wait and I waited over 10 minutes. I didn't want to eat food made by such idiots
Waited a few minutes at the counter until an employee slowly walked up and asked for our order. We get the half chicken salad and smoothie to go. When we got home the sandwich was missing tomato, and had the tiniest amount of chicken salad! Guess that's what happens when there's no management and the store is run by teenagers... Will post photos
Terrible Customer Service Lawnmower DeptI will never go backService in the past okToday not the case
Ordered delivery.It took 50 minutes for the food to arrive, and when we received the delivery, there were no forks, spoons, and napkins.The flavour and the serving size compared to the price was extremely poor.There are definitely plenty of other places in Toronto where you can receive twice as much food (that taste better) for half the price.    .
The pizza was burn over cooked. We eat three slices and make up no taste to it. Would not recommend this place for their pizza. At the end we asked for a box, the staff make us a small container for more than a half of a pizza. Not even a pizza box .
Checked in here last week to get a brew and bite while kids next door at Force center. I am at the Force a lot as I coach and play there. Would love for the brew co to work out but the service again was awful. I sat at the bar and had to yell after sitting there for 5 minutes without being greeted.  At least say hi be with you in a minute as you walk by 7 times. Literally I sat at the beer taps so I patiently waited before I said something. Then after finally getting a beer. Atasty IPA which was NOT theirs as they had no IPAs. What decent brewmaster has NO IPAs??My wife came in anxious for a beer and some food. After sitting there another 7 minutes she said nice service and walked out. Done done DONE with this place.
A year later still the worst place ever. I went back cuz it's close to my place and I was in a hurry. Jason greeted me and said he'd be doing my gel mani. Since I was going on a 2week vacation I simply said, I need a good job done since I had never had him before. So after polish removal, he starts cutting the heck out of my cuticles and I pulled my hand back and said, please very little cuticle cutting.  He pulled my hand back toward him and said loudly moving his face in my face, "you want a good job?"  WTHell Dude!!! I was so shocked. I'm sorry for Jason that he hasn't met his career goals and is doing nails but since when in North America do I have to have my cuticles cut when I don't want to????    He was rough and rude and angry. It was an even worse experience than I had a year before. Never again, no matter what.
This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have "the biggest and best sandwiches", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place.
Nasty food! Way over priced for the quality. The best tasting thing there was the soda.
If there was a negative star rating, Yellow Cab Pittsburgh would get it. Try negative 5. After calling about 1 hour before the bars closed, we were given a 30-45 minute timetable to wait for the cab. That was fine. But 1 hour later, still no cab. Call back. They 'honestly' told my husband that their timetable was total B.S. & we essentially weren't important enough to receive their 'services.' We were told that they may or may not show up & that we should just wait another 30 minutes & see what happens. Really? By this time it was almost 3:00 am & we were only 9 miles from the city. Thank goodness for family, who just so happened to wake up at 3 am & give us a ride. I will never depend on a company that so blatantly tells untruths to potential customers just to keep them waiting for the possibility of their business. Our business is forever lost & I hope that this never happens to any of my fellow Yelpers. What a horrible feeling, to be stranded.
Definitely old school feeling once you walk in.  The casino is dim and the hotel just feels ancient.   Long cab ride from the airport.  My friends and I booked this hotel for one night.  Thank god.  The rooms are big but the newest thing in the room is probably 30 years old.  Avoid at all cost.
One of the sales associates lured my boyfriend in to the kiosk and offered to clean his shoe, while cleaning my boyfriends shoe the associate noticed a spot on my right shoe and said it would work on mine as well...so he proceeded to clean the spot. My boyfriends shoe came out looking really good but my boyfriend said he wanted to see how the product dried up and if it did so nicely we would come back to purchase the kit. We walked around the mall some and I noticed the spot he cleaned on my shoe was showing come kind of yellowish/brownish discoloration and I thought it just wasn't dry yet, after giving it more time  the spot wasn't going away. We go back to the kiosk and show the associate and he said it was probably the towel he used cause it was new and possibly still bleeding, and he will just clean the whole shoe will a different brush and towel and it would be fine. To make a long story short the shoe didn't dry up nicely now my whole shoe (nike free run 5.0) are damaged. Although my boyfriends red vans came out looking good I wouldn't recommend this product on white mesh shoes possibly no white shoes at all. Its disappointing that the associates don't know what the product is safe to use on. And from reading other reviews I can see I am not the first victim. Now I have to go through the troubles to finding a way to restore my shoe but I doubt it will ever be the same.
This one star is not for the Massage therapist.   The massage therapist I go to monthly Josie is amazing.  That is why I travel almost an hour to go to this location.   The one star is for the clerical staff.    If you sign up monthly for massages and have specific terms of when funds should be debuted from your account then why does the company just debit from your account when they choose too?   Each month between my massage and fees from my bank my massages is really expensive . This is a chain business.  The owner of this location definitely needs to look to the corporate office for some training tools for his or her staffing or get more involved.  I have seen others with the same issue as I when I'mAt this location
On Friday I made a very big mistake by pharmacist that are usually go to at Walmart they didn't have the pills I needed so he suggested to go to this pharmacy to get what I needed when I got there I went to see the pharmacist because the pills I needed were behind the counter the only thing that pharmacist was telling me that the painkillers I needed wouldn't work and I was insistent not to give them to me so I'llLeft the pharmacy without the pills went back to my pharmacist at Walmart and we found what I needed if you want to good service don't go to this pharmacy Jean Coutu .Walmart in LaSalle The staff is there to help you and I'm top of it everything is at least 30% cheaper plus very good service . Jean Coutu gives you very bad service specially the one on Champlain
I like this place but they closed without notice today. I brought bunch of friends...
They greet you when you enter the store but then they are done with you. We were looking for shoes for an adult woman, an adult man and an 8 year old girl so basically we were all over the store.  The entire time my granddaughter was trying on 8 different pairs of shoes two employees stood nearby having a conversation but never offering assistance. In fact a customer walked up to them and waited for them to stop talking and turn to him which they never did and he left in disgust.  I gave up looking for shoes for myself because I was too annoyed with the store  .  When I paid for my Granddaughters shoes the cashier asked if I wanted some kind of loyalty card and I said no I would not because I did not plan on ever returning and told him about the lack of assistance.  He didn't care.   They had shoes I was interested in but never found.  For the price of their shoes you would expect a little assistance.
In store order not ready when promised. When I placed my order they almost lost the sale as the employee told me what he couldn't do rather than tell me what he could do. Placed order Tuesday morning, employee said we are not to busy we will have this ready by store close tonight. Came in on Thursday to pick up order and order has not even been started. Employee made me feel like I inconvenienced him for having to stop what he was doing to move my order along. Brick and mortar stores need to be over the top with customer service online ordering is just a click away. Staples just 2 miles down the road also.
I reaaally wanted to give Liberty Burger & Wings a better rating, as I try to support businesses involved in Yelp Burger Week, but this place just made it too difficult to do so. I tried to come in with an open-mind, even after reading a lot of the concerns voiced in other reviews - unfortunately, most of the complaints about restaurant policies, service, and price-gouging seem to be totally on point.SERVICE/POLICIES1) To start the night, our large group of 10+ were required to each purchase a drink, or be automatically charged a 20% gratuity. This is much higher than the 16-18% typically charged for large groups at more upscale places then this, and more importantly, this policy was not communicated to us earlier when the reservation was initially made.2) As already mentioned in several prior reviews, this place refuses to serve you water in a cup - if you want water, you're required to buy a bottle, even if you ordered beer/other drinks as well. I read about this unusual policy before coming, so I was not surprised like other customers have been - still a turnoff when this place refuses to offer what literally 99.9% of other restaurants do.3) The server offered me the option of fries, sweet potato fries, or poutine to accompany my burger - it was stated exactly like that, as though they were all standard side options. I literally asked her "oh, I can have poutine instead of regular fries??" and was excited when she confirmed yes. Never did the server mention that I would be charged a $5 "upgrade fee" for the poutine - I only found this out when I received the bill. 4) Although I didn't order the Yelp burger special, I saw that the burgers served to other customers didn't come quite as advertised (no mozzarella). Part of the reason I didn't order the special is because it sounded more plain when the waitress listed ingredients than I remembered it described on Yelp - after another in our group checked the Binge Week page, it confirmed that Liberty Burgers just kind of decided to omit the mozzarella after the fact (probably the most expensive topping on an already relatively plain burger compared to other Burger Week offerings). 5) The server dropped two of those bottles of water on me. It was an accident, but still had to mention it though haha. FOOD:The food itself was decent, and I liked how they gave us frosted glasses to share our pitchers. Although the fries in the poutine were a bit cold, and tasted somewhat stale for some reason, the cheese was pretty good (oh THERE'S the mozzarella!). All together though, the "Canuck burger" I ordered (bacon, cheese, mushrooms) was not worth the $18 before tax, especially since the poutine had less fries then the standard side. Had I known there would be an extra charge stealthily slipped in, I would have just ordered a full order of poutine plus a single burger for a few dollars LESS then what I paid. ATMOSPHERE:I had actually previously passed by this place, and peeked in quickly before walking away - the exterior looks slightly more dingy and dive-ish than the dark/cramped interior, which is why I'm so surprised at some of this place's high prices. This is no upscale place...VERDICT:The mediocre food aside, my gripes with this place have nothing to do with being "cheap" or "Asian," as another reviewer (possibly affiliated with Liberty Burgers) somewhat racistly implied. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of integrity in this place's business practices, where many policies and staff miscommunications appear to exist just to deceive and/or price-gouge customers. Nobody wants to feel cheated - I will most definitely NOT be back.
Have been waiting 29 minutes past when my online order was supposed be ready. There's 3 others in the entire place so I don't think they could be backed up. Have encountered this many times before, very frustrating!!
1st Visit: Took order home - Donuts stale2nd Visit: Entered store with intention to make sure donuts were fresh, but no counter person in sight; rather friendly, loud conversation from back of store - Waited for a bit and then left. Kidding around in the back apparently more important than selling product.3rd Visit: Counter person busy with coffee machine, didn't acknowledge customer. Continued with a more important activity going from one side of store to the other complaining that the steamer didn't work. Another case of ignore the customer.Summary: 3rd visit was last visit; doubtful that I'll bother with Dunkin' again.
Terrible. Just terrible.  No flavor. The only thing good was deep fried dough balls in sugar. The snow shrimp was good. Overall if I could give it 0 stars I would. Barf.
We found this place several years ago and had some family with us. We ordered pizza, salad and garlic knots. Everything was so delicious. We visted a few more times over the next few years and everything was so very good. Last night proved it will be the last time. A 16' pizza is now $20 or more. All the prices went up and we were told it is because of the minimum wage hike. They only have one size pizza. We ordered garlic knots they were not hot at all and sent them back. We asked for our pizza to be a little crispy and half of it ended up being burnt. We have always asked to be a little crispy and it always came out so good, not this time.  Ordered 6 wings $6.50 for 6 wings They were very good. We asked for 1 ranch dressing to dip our pizza crust in. We got charged .60c for a souffle cup. Nope that was it. So very dissatisfied overall. Service was mediocre. Guess all customers will have to pay for the minimum wage hike, tipping no longer needed.
Horrible hotel, power went out, no running water for hours, a/c didn't work well AT ALL, ice machines on top 10 floors(at least) not working, had to goto downstairs bar to get ice. "they don't deliver ice". Pool service was great tho. I won't stay here ever again and have stayed her a dozen times over the years.
I was very disappointed in the overall appearance and cleanliness of this location. I've never seen a "dirty" Chipotle. The store was not overly busy and the food bar was dirty with excess food spread everywhere. The guacamole had a brown film over it to make you think it was not prepared fresh that day. When I went to sit down the booths had food all over them and I had to wipe it off prior to sitting. The food was good, no complaints there until 4 hours later when my husband and I both are wondering if we have food poisoning. With the cleanliness issues I witnessed, I would definitely not be surprised because things are just not "kosher" with the digestive system right now. I'll give the Chipotle chain a chance again, once I break the association from getting sick, but I'll never visit this location again!
So this place just earned themselves a 1-star update, and it's a complete shame too. Service was always good to adequate, and I looked past that because of the food, but tonight was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. First, the gal who seated us puts us right next to the kitchen entrance in the dining area, the noisiest booth in the entire restaurant, even though the place was 1/2 empty at the time. Nothing like having to repeat yourself to your dinner date every-other-sentence because people in back are continually dropping off piles of plates and smashing things together and, generally, making enough racket to wake the dead. Someone finally brings chips and salsa, but we've still got no drinks and no server. I guess I'm supposed to take it down dry, right? Eventually someone shows up and we get our drink order in. No apology for the wait, naturally. After waiting slightly more than usual, our entrees come out. We went to town, all the while consciously saving room for some dessert (sopapillas for the win, right?). To her credit, the server did check on us to ensure the food was ok, albeit not until we had about half way finished the meal. Had there been a problem, it would have been a long wait. I know what you're thinking at this point. You're asking yourself what the big deal was and how this was some service disaster. In fairness, I didn't see it coming either, but stick with me for a bit longer!So with our entrees done, as in pushed away, covered with a napkin, cutlery crossed on the plate, we began our anxious wait for the sopapillas. The first step was ordering them, which when the server finally came to collect the plates (also after too long) we did. And so begins the waiting game without end. At 10 minutes in, still to sopapillas, but I counted up to 6 different staffers, including at least one manager, futzing with the tables next to us. Talking while standing right next to us, as if the plate dropping, chair moving, table dragging was not enough. There's nothing like trying to sit in silence at the table while having some chic's rear end inches from your face while she and some other mental midget try to figure out if they have enough chairs. Between all these people, they still managed to put more plates on the table than they had chairs. While this is going on, a woman walked up to one of them and said she needed a server. She described him physically, with enough detail to pick him up out of a police lineup (age, height, hair color, glasses.. seriously!) and someone went looking for him while she returned grumpily to her table. We're now 15 minutes in. Still no sopapillas. Futzing with the table is continuing, but then suddenly the manager and staffers helping with this decide on a new plan. Each table and all the chairs are slowly, noisily moved to the other side of the dining area. That's right, all the racket and hassle was for naught. Still no sign of our server or our dessert. A chip guy comes by and asks us if we want more chips, mistaking us for someone that just got seated. I explain we would like the dessert we ordered and asked if he could help figure out what happened. He leaves, never to be seen again. At the 20 minute mark, a completely different chip guy wanders up and asks if we'd like more chips. I tell him about the ordeal and previous chip guy and tell him to get a manager so we can get our bill and leave, because we don't want the dessert anymore. He obliges. While we're waiting, we get another red flag. Remember the woman who was trying to track down her server? Yeah so she wanders up to the area behind the fountain, where the kitchen entrance is, just beneath the "Employees Only" sign. This lady literally yells, while waving her arms, "We need a server out here!" Wow. O.oAt the 25 minute mark, chip guy #2 came through and a manager arrived at our table. Clearly no clue what the problem was, he opens with the standard, "Is there a problem?" line. I explain our ordeal and he asks me who the server was, and of course I don't recall her name (he's the manager, shouldn't he know who is serving this table?). I told him I don't want the dessert, just bring the bill. A few moments later he returns will the bill, sans sopapillas, and apologizes. Nothing else was comped, naturally. About 5 minutes later, our server shows up with sopapillas and a backhanded apology. See, she goes on about how she asked someone else to help out and take care of us. It's your table, you own the service. If you entrust our care to some brain donor who drops the ball, it's still on you. She cashed us out and we walked out, leaving less than 10% for the tip and all the sopapillas behind. We didn't touch them for two reasons. 1) On principle, as we said we no longer wanted them and 2) They looked disgusting, long and skinny, darker than usual color and just.. wrong.I'm sorry but how do you manage to screw it up this bad? What a complete and utter farce.
They never have any taro balls. Please change your name and stop giving false hope to your customers.
Last Sunday I ordered the Hawaiian Burger, I cut it in half and noticed it was pretty pink on the inside of the patty. Unfortunately I ate it anyway without knowing I could get sick from uncooked beef I figured it was cooked just not thoroughly, well long story short I've had food poisoning since Sunday night & had to get my stomach pumped.I'll never eat here again nor will I refer this restaurant to anyone. I shouldn't have to think twice about if my beef is cooked all the way. I would think that ordering a burger from a 50's styled restaurant would be a safe choice, but I guess not.
Update- She said she would rebuild my band at no cost and without getting the insurance. We agreed to that only if she would write up paperwork saying if any stones fell out of either ring she would give us a refund. She agreed and said she would get the paperwork to my husband that same day- 9 days later, after hearing nothing, I emailed asking about it. She emailed my husband & said we could use the email as her paperwork bc it has her name on it. Really??? Not to mention her exact words for the guarantee were "we will warranty the wedding about against any stones falling out for 6 months after you pick up the new band"- no, you're not reading that incorrectly, those were her words. Confused? Yep. Us too. My husband asked her to include the engagement ring in the guarantee so he could then he could let our council review it. She copied & pasted that exact line I quoted & resent just that statement-That's what she wanted us to show our lawyers. Talk about a joke. This has gone on far too long. I haven't worn my rings since August-after the 8th diamond fell out. All I want is my ring. A ring I don't have to worry about a diamond falling out if I wash my hands while wearing it. This is absolutely the worst customer service ever. You would think, with HER name being the name of the business, and the fact she's on the county council, she would be a much more professional business woman. This is a nightmare that just won't stop. We filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on 10-2-17. I haven't heard a thing from her business, she has yet to reply to the BBB either. This is not a surprise though. I will update once we have hopefully settled this unnecessary situation.
Every single time I go to the course the staff are extremely rude and condescending. The staff have a snotty air about them and act like this course is cypress point in pebble beach.  By all means it is a nice course but it is not cypress point.  The food at the club house is not very good either.  I just wish my experience was not ruined by the staff's attitude.
One star is a major exaggeration--the service and quality of the food was much worse than this. The food is wretched--I mean, when you take an 11-year old, and he says the food is disgusting, you know you've hit the culinary bottom. We asked for nutrition information, and the answer we received was, "no, we don't have that, and we cannot guarantee what's in the food." Is that even legal in this day and age? The server seemed overwhelmed with the many (3) tables he had, and sighed and shambled about any time we asked for anything (like, lemons and plates). Save yourself the trip and the tip--eat a Lean Cuisine. Those are terrible as well, but at least your expectation is low going in. And for the cost, the food should've been at least edible.
My friends and I booked this hotel knowing it wasn't going to be the Bellagio or the Venetian, but we were left very disappointed. Check in takes forever and the customer service staff were not welcoming at all. Day one my friend's phone, credit card, and ID were stolen at The Flamingo Pool. We were able to cancel the card, buy a new phone, but not having an ID for her to get into places ruined the trip. Pool security is only there for show. They do a thorough search of you going in the pool but not going out. Hotel security was even less helpful....saying they would not be looking at camera surveillance. Police do nothing in that city besides turn a blind eye. The phone had not been turned off and we could track the location with "Find my iPhone" and still the police were unbothered and unwilling to help with a stolen identity. The Flamingo only use surveillance for their own benefit. Wifi costs extra and is still so slow. The carpets are filthy and everyone who stays there looks very low class. Housekeeping would not give us fresh towels or bag liners since we did not want them in our room after the theft at the pool. By the way no one followed up with us after the theft and we went out of our way to make sure they had our contact information in case at least the ID showed up. Our dirty towels laid in the hallway for days since housekeeping wouldn't take them from us. Walls are paper thin and you can hear everything next door which of course was disgusting. An alarm was blaring for hours next door and the front desk did nothing after we called them and physically walked down to complain. No vents in the bathroom....it was clogged and moldy. When we went to complain about how horrible our stay was we got a business card with the wrong information on it to contact someone. The e-mail was invalid. It was so awful we checked out a day early and still did not get our money back for the night we didn't stay there. A very scummy place that does not seem safe. I loved Las Vegas on prior visits and am now afraid to go back. Please do not stay here. There are so many other options and the city themselves have some soul searching to do about their inaction.
When I got home to eat my pizza it barely had any cheese, banana peppers and pepperoni. Next time I'll pay the extra fee for more toppings, if I ever from here again.
This place is usually dirty (floors, tables, soda area, counters, glass doors) and fly-infested.We drop by every so often hoping they'll get new management and enforce some necessary changes. So far, no good.
We had done a reservation and no one ever told us that the main street to get to the restaurant was closed for a parade. Drove 45 minutes just to be told by a police officer at a barricade that the road was inaccessible and we needed to park our vehicle 2 kilometers away if we wanted to get to our destination. Tried calling the restaurant but no one ever picked up the call. Some 30 minutes later, on our way back home, some lady called to ask if we were still planing on showing up. I explained what had happened and she didn't bother doing or proposing anything because of their mistake. Bad customer service. Shame on you people. No sense of business relationships. NEVER AGAIN!!!
The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, "we got busy, we can't help it". I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won't be ordering from them again. Don't waste your time.
Very disappointed with Argenta Apartments staff. My husband and I went in on May 26th to sign a lease on a large 2 bedroom apartment. We were told we could move in the following week but were required to provide a holding deposit that would not be applied to rent even though we would be moving in to the apartment the day it was available. May 27th we received a phone call stating that the apartment we were holding would not be available for a longer time. We were offered the same apartment on the ground level at the same price if we would wait until June 8th to move in. We made arrangements to move on June 8th, set up SRP and cox, rented a truck, secured a babysitter, gave our notice at our current location, and packed up all our belongings. On June 8th Argenta called in the morning while I was driving to the apartments to get the keys and I missed the call stating that we could not move in till after 5pm!! We sat around with all our moving help and waited for 5pm. We went back to the complex at 5 and got the keys. We walked back to the apartment excited to move in finally. As we began walking the unit we were stunned to see that they had not kept their word and had reserved a SMALL apartment for us. Of course at this time the management and the lady who had been helping us were gone for the day! We were told maybe they would have a unit for us Saturday! We already spent money and time for moving Wednesday and Thursday! When we spoke to management on Friday (!) they pretty much called us liars and told us we should have known there were no bigger two bedroom apartments on the ground level. Not sure how we were supposed to know that when all we know is what they told us. We asked for our holding deposit back since they did not hold the agreed upon apartment. Again they pretty much called us liars and said no. So we are out $250ish and got lied to. Pay a little more and get the apartment you agree to somewhere else.   Update: Argenta is again calling us liars with their response to my review. We never agreed to a smaller apartment. This was switched on us without our knowledge or approval. Very disappointed.
*Encountered an extremely RUDE manager today at Yang's.- My partner and I decided to have AYCE lunch at Yang's Kitchen. Main service was mediocre/average; however, it was not a big deal as the food here is usually fairly good (been here a few times before, service is typically mediocre or subpar).Pros: Food arrived quickly after ordering. Cons: Ordered 10 pcs. of shrimp tempura; received only 4. When asked for a side of spicy mayo, server completely forgot. Had to ask another server 15 minutes later. Mandatory 10% tip no matter how large your party is.HIGHLIGHT of our meal: My partner ordered 5 salmon roses (pieces of raw salmon wrapped around a bit of rice). As she started eating them, she felt as though there was too much rice in the salmon rose for her liking. She therefore decided to remove about almost half of the rice from each rose and scooped it to the side. A woman (who I assumed was the manager because she was dictating orders to the staff) came by the table and told us in an RUDE and scolding tone, "Hey, you eat the rice. Yeah?" (spoken in broken english and pointing at the rice). We looked slightly confused, so she repeated, "You EAT the rice!". We were taken aback at this point, she assumed we didn't understand her so she proceeded to speak to me in Chinese (I am not Chinese, nor do I speak it). I responded confusedly, "Sorry, I don't understand. What??". She repeats in English again, "You EAT the rice", this time motioning with her hand scooping into her mouth. How condescending and uncalled for. My partner responded with, "Oh, well there's a bit too much rice ..." , the woman cuts her off and exclaims, "Nooononono, you eat the rice". We now realized that this was not a request, it was a demand. As she walked away, I explicitly told my partner NOT to eat the rice (accumulation of 2-3 tbsp), especially if she did not want it. The woman overheard and turned around as if she were going to come back and continue scolding us. She then proceeded to talk crap about us to the employees for the next 20 minutes (complaining to them, while looking back at us). UNPROFESSIONAL. We did not even feel like finishing our meal at this point. She even walked around a few times to look over at our table (to see if we finished the rice). We obviously did not finish it or felt a need to. We left soon after.This experience alone would earn Yang's a 0 star rating. But seeing as the food itself was decent, I'm giving it a 1. My partner and I will NOT be returning. The manager here has HORRIBLE customer service skills and that request was just ridiculous. I have never heard of any restaurant employee/manager telling a guest HOW and WHAT to eat. Appalling. The staff here are definitely not afraid of arguing/lashing out at customers. "The customer is always right" does not apply here at Yang's.
I have been to Great Clips a number of different times and have always been satisfied but my visit there on Thursday, 01/16/2014, was the last time I will ever go there again!!!!! It was at the Great Clips in the Deer Valley Marketplace located at the corner of W. Deer Valley Road & N. 83rd Ave. in Peoria.  When I first got there one of the women looked my name up under my phone number and put me on the waiting list. Then another woman called me up to the counter and asked for my name. I told her my name and she said it wasn't there. Then she asked for my phone number. I told her but I had to repeat it several times. She was very rude and was extremely hard to understand due to her accent. She said her name was Nina (later when I looked at the receipt it showed her name to be Niculina). She directed me to a chair and asked me how I wanted my hair cut. I asked her if she could check the notes in the computer to see how it had been cut the last few times I had been in because I wanted it cut the same way. She walked over to the computer and looked at it for a few seconds and said "something happened to computer, there's nothing" and walked back to the chair. I told her how I wanted it cut but she wanted to do it differently. I told her no to do it like I said. Well after she cut my hair (If you can call it that) I asked her if she could rinse my hair off in the sink, not shampoo just rinse with water so I could get all the extra cut hair off and she said no she would have to charge me for a shampoo. So I asked if I could do it myself and she said no. Then she immediately put gel in my hair without even asking if I wanted any in my hair. It was ok because I use gel in my hair anyway but I thought it was odd. Well after I got home from having dinner I took a shower and my wife looked at me and said OMG!!! Your hair!!! Go look at it!" It is REALLY REALLY BAD! I have bald spots in a number of places where my hair is cut all the way to the scalp! How does someone do that?! Then there are other places that have long hairs that she did not even cut! To top it all off when I looked at my receipt she didn't even spell my name correctly, it reads Brayen not Brian??? I have e-mailed them and also called their corporate office and I am still waiting for them to call me back. The sad thing is I am job hunting and now I have hair that looks like a monkey cut it for bananas. I'm not saying ALL the stylists there are bad but if you do go there just make sure you DO NOT have Niculina (Nina) cut your hair.
Food was terrible for the price. $16 for a burger and the patty tasted frozen, the bun is harder than a rock. Overall for the price the food is terrible
Definitely not.  Unskilled, unprofessional, not craftsman like skills, did not tidy up.  Ripped us off - took our money and then filed bankruptcy.  Check out public records.   Shabby.
Awful awful experienceWalked in expecting a fantastic dinner.  Started off with the jelly fish and it was decent so looking forward to the rest of the meal.  That's when it went downhill.  Hot and sour soup is watered down.  Bitter soup with maw fish tasted like pickle juice and broth.  Egg plant was ok.  Meat on the ribs was tender but had no flavor.  Like I opened up a bottle of la Choy Hunan sauce and poured it on the meat. Worst part was the rude server.  I tried this restaurant using a groupon and she kept telling everybody at the table how I only paid 50$ for $80 of food.  She said this three times extremely loudly.  Purpose of the promotion is to get people to come back.  I called manger afterwards and he told me this waitress has a history of doing this.  She should be fired.  I will not be back plus I spent half my time trying to swat the bugs alway from the food Rude and bad food
Been here twice, and haven't gotten to eat anything.First time was on an already hot summer day, for brunch, and where we were seated had hot air blowing on us (likely from the open kitchen). Add to that, the lackluster menu, we decided to leave.Tried again yesterday for lunch, and after waiting at our table for 10-15 minutes, we were never approached by a server (although they were at the table next to us at one point). There were only 2 other tables, so they weren't busy. Obliviously we left. Ironically, as we left, the guy behind a counter thanked us for our business.Only restaurant I have ever walked out of. And TWICE!Disappointed, because I love most of the restaurants in my neighbourhood (Ronces), and had heard great things about this place.
The staff are hit or miss. One or two of the guys are nice, the rest seem to absolutely hate it there. I (used to) grab slices from here because I live close and it's cheap, but I found every second time I did, I got really Ill afterwords.  I can only speak for the veggie or cheese slices, but if THATS giving me food poisoning, I'd be really afraid of touching any meat product here. Something is wrong with the food in this place.  You're also surrounded by mirrors inside, and I often find myself looking into them asking myself what fuck I'm doing eating there again.
Dot dot dot has gone from decent to worse. I've been here several times and each one has been progressively worse. I recently showed up with a group of 5 and was told that I could use the NoWait App to register my party to enter later after eating at Sir Edmund Halley's. The app did not let you register 5 people for the wait list and we instead registered for 4. When we showed up, we were told we were in the wrong for showing up with one more person and were forced to go back on the wait list which was another 40 minutes (there was no line outside and people were pouring out of the bar). You guys need to do some work with your seating methods. How does one person cause you to have to wait another 40 minutes to be seated? I would like to understand before I come back. I will also be urging others to avoid until this is figured out.
Sad how new ownership doesn't value the customers satisfaction. My review went from a 5 star to a 1 star. I would have liked to have given them a no star. Rude and argumentative. The new location is not at all relaxing  and inviting. Feels like your waiting for the dentist. Sad but I guess I will have to find another spa for my massages.
I ordered cheese enchiladas, they brought me chicken, I told her I wanted cheese, they brought me chicken AGAIN, and I never have and never will come back. Don't think I need to say more.....
The staff was super nice and delivery was quick. However for three large pizzas it was over $72. The pizzas were plain with no flavor. Looked beautiful but zero spice
If you want to see a good drag show find your closest gay bar. Anything is better then this show. The dancers had zero coordination and it looked made up as the went half the time. One of the queens event stopped lip syncing. Besides that it was an ad for Franks TV show and things to buy after. Oh, Frank doesn't even perform just advertises.
They're working on fixing the problem of the check engine light on the car, hopefully it will get figured.out soon and the issue will be resolved and the check engine light will stay off and the car will run goodFly by night mobile mechanic didn't show when he said he would. Several messages left at the car company with no return call as well as a text to an employee with no response. This place sucks and couldn't careless about customers
About a year ago they destroyed my hair the "hairdresser" spent the whole time watching tv and no time paying attention to my hair it ended up completely uneven and it's taken me a year to grow out evenly! Going back they have now destroyed my moms hair! THEY should know what type of hair style fits a persons face shape, they're "pros" right? I do not recommend.
After reading reviews, we decided to finally try Avenue B as it had been on our list for quite some time. I have to say, I found everything about this place to be lackluster. We had The Raw Deal appetizer, and I can't think of a more apt name for a $16 plate of mushy fish that had gone one too many pulses through the food processor. It was almost inedible. After that, we had the duck and meat loaf entrees, which were not terrible in flavor, but were both prepared poorly. The temperatures were off (warm potatoes, hot onion rings, room temperature meatloaf), the duck was medium well (despite ordering mid-rare), and the sides were just off, for lack of a better word. It's possible we caught the kitchen on a bad night, but this was entirely overpriced even if it had been good. We spent nearly $100 for an awful appetizer and two entrees that we barely ate half of, and I'm already regretting the fact that I have leftovers in the fridge. There are much better options in the city, both cheaper and better, and I will not be returning to Avenue B.
We sat at the bar and met the Arrogent BartenderI asked for horseradish. It took 10 minutes and never came. I had to go around to the other side of the bar and pick it up myself. I think if I was 20 to 30 they would've brought it to me but I'm way older, so they ignored me.
This company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me.  I had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though).  He told the gal that he was not going to open the door, that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me, his mom.  The driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative.  My son kept saying, call my mom, she's on the phone now.  And she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature.  I told my son to close the door.  I then called the company and spoke with a Manager, Sara.  She understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations.  Three days pass and I still don't have my flowers or a phone call.  I called and spoke with Sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously.  She was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses. I asked that the Owners call me.  Five days later, I've never received a call back from the Owner or my flowers.  I called to find out when one of the Owners would call back, and Linda told me it would be by Friday, which meant six days later than my initial request.  I told Linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the Owners are busy and have several other businesses.  In my opinion, that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this Company.  They are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service.
This should be a short review because we did not actually eat here. When we arrived, there were no clean tables to sit at. When we asked the waiter to clean a table, he brushed food debris on to us as he was cleaning it. We overlooked that, and were looking at the menu, when the waiter returned with our water glasses. We quickly noticed that there was not a clean water glass of the five that were brought to us. You could see lip marks on the rim and other food debris stuck to them, that indicated they were not clean. We decided that we were not going to risk our health and left at that point.
We used them at my parents house last week and I have to say it was the worst food I ever had prepared by someone else..I think I'm even sick still from it. Let's just say I've been in the bathroom quite a bit the last few days... The two entrees were horrible. Tasteless green chili macaroni and some lasagna concoction that tasted like it was cooked 7 hours before it was served to us. Thanks but I literally have to run to the toilet...
I thought this was going to be my favorite location after issue with the other one off Fort Apache.  We came here about 5-6 times the last few months.  I'm starting to think all the Chipotles in Las Vegas just sucks.  We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food.  The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy. We still came here after the e. coli breakout.  That must say something, but after seeing how dirty it is here.  I don't know anymore.  I don't want to get sick.  The condiment bar is dirty and empty napkin holders and lids.  Trash cans are overflowing.  Customer service at Chipotle in Las Vegas is non existence.
My co-worker and I went for lunch and the service was horrible. Gave us plate with hair on it, then had to get up and go to bar to get another plate because waitress disappeared. Then bartender was rude, didn't say sorry about that, took plate and handed us another one no words exchanged at all. Won't go back!!
So in March (30th) of this year we had Maricopa AC come service 3 AC units (2 personal and a rental property).  The owner Steve did the service.  My personal unit was shot but I had a home warranty (which was a whole different nightmare).  The other 2 Steve said were in great shape.  Fast forward to 9/26 when our renter texted her air wasn't working.  We called Maricopa again as they would be most familiar since they had looked at it exactly 6 months prior.  This time another guy came out, Brian.  He looked at it, charged us $500 for a capacitor and relay (those parts are about $50 on Amazon.com and take less than 15 mins to install), $500 for a can of stop leak (again $50 online) as he said the coils were corroded and had holes in them, and $300 for 5 lbs of R22 (this is actually in range seeing as how the EPA requires a license to put freon in).  We said why does this AC unit have a leaking coil it was installed new in 6/2012?  He said it wasn't serviced well and cleaned.  We said we just had that done in March.  He said most guys don't do a good job of inspecting that is why, you should purchase our service package for $1700 for 5 yrs.  We said YOUR company did service it in March, Steve the owner did it.  His excuse then was Steve is too busy to do a thorough job.  I am not disputing this could have gone bad anyway but Steve could have warned us in March had he actually looked at it apparently.  Well after this $1300 repair to fix it....I should more say band aid it as it stopped working again on 9/30 less than 5 days later.  We called them again.  Brian came out and put another stop leak in it and more freon saying it probably will not work the coil is shot... it didn't, 10/6 it was done again.  We called asked what a replacement coil would cost (seeing them online for $300-500) and hoping they would give us a break since their $1300 repair did squat for us.  They said they would get us a price on it but acted as though a coil would be more than a new unit.  10/7 no call back with pricing.  10/10 we decided just to get a new unit as our renter was in 90+ degree place complaining as she should, so we called for price on that hoping again to get a break....no break, no call back even.   Thanks Maricopa Air Conditioning & Heating for charging us $1300 for 10 days of cool air, phenomenal prices lol.  I'm sure they would respond that the 2nd time they didn't charge us, but when you charge 10x what the parts cost (and considering they were up there no more than 1.5-2 hrs total, no labor is not $400 an hr) you shouldn't charge to come back; and you should have offered us $800-1000 off a new unit.  Worst part was when we called Steve for a price on a coil noticeably upset...he acted as though we shouldn't be mad we just wasted $1300?!?!
I've been coming here for years. But after today I won't be coming back. They sat us down, gave us our menus and never can back.we waited for 20min until we finally gave in a flagged a random waiter. He took our order, brought us water and never came back. Another 30min went by and the people who came after us got their food first. We finally decided to leave and go somewhere else. I went as talked to the manager who offered us the meals on the house but we were done by that point. One of the waiters decided he'd join the conversation and he  explained that and I quote " we are busy and the large party ahead of you took extra care, everyone has to wait". So don't go during peak hours because they can't handle it and stopping by your table to let you know the situation is above the customer service they can offer. I was glad he said that because then it became clear they don't care. FOOD: The food is  average and decently priced. The combination pho is probably the best and they have various sizes depending on how much you want. They have a good and varied drink selection. I'd give a try to one of their house specialty drink that are always changing.
Service was horrible I returned my order after waiting  for about 10 minutes for a torta while the place only had about 5 people inside.  It seemed every person returned their order because they forgot something.  The taste is bland and average and super greasy.  I couldn't finish my meal
Funny my burger didn't look like the add pics it was bright red inside. Scary for a hamburger. Will not be going back,and the line to order is slower than Disneyland.
I was there for a birthday celebration, which celebrated three people, last Sunday,  March 13, 2016. After waiting for an hour and never receiving any service, I decided to leave. I was later told by my friend that there was only one Server on duty for over 50 people. I understand watching your bottom line, but this was ridiculous. My first and last time at this establishment!
Make no mistake, this restaurant does not serve dim sum in the evenings.. We went there and ordered three dishes the lemon chicken, beef with green pepper in black bean sauce, and a house fried rice after waiting approximately 25 minutes we asked the waiter what was taking so long and it was obvious that somebody had screwed up in the kitchen and we didn't get our order. So we just got up and left. For such a fancy looking place they really can't step up when it comes to serving dishes on time. Also this place is very expensive. For a simple house rice it would have cost almost 20 bucks. In a way, their screw up was technically a blessing in disguise for us as we went elsewhere.
Please please please do not rent here! Before I even moved in they gave me an apartment that had broken tiling in the front, as well as, stained carpet. They consider themselves a gated community but half the time the gate is broken and open to anyone. Also beware they will try and jipp you out of your money! They took no security deposit from and then tried to charge me$450 two weeks after I moved out for cleaning purposes, when I left the apartment in better condition than what they gave me. They have complete morons working in the front office, so if you like dealing with incompetent people than this is the place for you. Enter at your own risk. Recommendations are the only thing most businesses have these days and I will make sure they get none!
Took 40 min to get our food wich included a salad ,pancakes &hamburger.the inexperience service was awful.the bun&meat was hard&could not be eaten.salad was missing half of ingredients &no refills.manager came over after calling her to tell her about the food & she did not apologize for anything.she brought a new hamburger with an attitude on the side.the check was never picked up.worst experience&disappointed because the cafe was long over due.no organization,no guest service, not coming back.
Horrible experience with them! My first visit they LOST my urine, second time they made me belive i had an ectopic pregnancy(which was not). The nurses are not orginized AT ALL ! WOULD NOT RECOMEND MOM DOC TO NONE OF MY FRIENDS OR FAMILY!
The previous reviews that mention the service problems are absolutely correct, it is horrible.  We have visited this restaurant several times over the last few years and it has really gone downhill.  You very rarely see a waiter even when the dining room is practically empty.  Yesterday we went for a late lunch and were seated right away in a booth.  There were three tables in the entire place that were occupied by a total of 7 people.  We sat, looked at the menus, and waited...and waited....and waited...and got up and left.  10 mins is my max time in an empty restaurant without seeing a server.  That will be out last visit, too bad, I thought the food was ok for a chain restaurant.
Had a tech come out to check my unit under my home warranty. Looked at unit and said fan was installed wrong. My claim was denied. I tried to talk to tech though my wife And he wouldn't get on the phone. Trying to get unit fixed cause I have a 1 year old in the house. She had to put on speaker phone for him to tell me I needed a whole new unit cause it would be to much to repair. I called and spoke to John who told me that he didn't fully diagnose unit cause warranty denied claim. Also told me it was denied cause my plan came active Sunday and they where called on the Monday after. After talking to warranty company and we both called join with no response I called from home number and answered first time. Seems if it ain't cash customer service sucks. $95 later a new fan unit works fine.
Food was disappointing.  Waited for a long time while they said the wait was 10 minutes.  The falafel itself was alright but cold.  Wouldn't recommend it.
Stay away from this company. They are rude and unprofessional. I saw their ad on Craigslist. Mandy responded and set up the appointment. The worker she sent was nice but did not do a good thorough job. We paid for a deep cleaning of our home but we were left disappointed. When we expressed our displeasure to Mandy, she wrote a series of nasty text messages. They are so appalling I can't even repeat them here. She threatened us and we had to call the police to have her worker remove her car from our property. This is a lesson to always check Yelp reviews before hiring anyone to clean your home, especially off of craigslist. If I had read the reviews and tips off this page I would have hired somebody else.
Terrible experience. Cheap feel, room smelled like cigarette smoke. When we approached the staff about this, they were rude and didn't offer to remedy the situation. Overpriced. I enjoyed my stay at the Golden Nugget much more than this "luxury" hotel.
This place was decent until I saw them on Dirty Dining. Yes, they got demerits from the health department for not being very clean. I won't be back. I don't believe in giving these places a second chance because after the health department goes away they'll be back to their unclean ways in time. It's too bad, though, because I really liked their mixed won ton soup. Now, no telling where they chopped the vegetables...on top of the garage can?? My health is more important!
Nothing but reckless far-right rhetoric, lies, & spin! Constant Democrat & Obama-bashing. Instead, listen to 1480 AM KPHX! "Progressive" Talk Radio in Phoenix!  Stephanie Miller in the Mornings, then Thom Hartmann, Randi Rhodes in the afternoon.
Use to go here a lot, but recently I've stopped due to the asada tasting bad. They use to cook the meat fresh on the grill when you ordered it. Now they keep it cold in a pot. Disappointed to know one of my childhood food spots are going down the drain.
Horrible store! Horrible customer service! Was planning to open 2 new lines through Sprint with my husband but after being in this joke of a store we decided not to. We were helped by a woman who clearly didn't know what was going on in her own store. She tried to show us the new iPhone 6 but didn't even know it wasn't on display anymore. All she cared about was making her sale. We were going to preorder 2 iPhones and she said she just had to see our credit. My husband SPECIFICALLY asked her if it would be a hard credit pull or a soft. And she said don't worry it's soft. Come to find out this morning it was a hard credit pull. Besides that she had no other information or answers for our questions. It was all "I'm not sure." "I'll have to check."  Do you know your job or not?! Don't go here. You can find better help at another store with more educated employees.
Never have experienced with lawyers before until have my first accident here at Vegas. The first meeting with Mr. Corral was fine after that I never hear from them at all. Never communicate about how my case was going and when I called to ask for information their staff was very unprofessional and rude. Remember calling Mr. Corral and leaving messages to hear about my case but he never answered or got back to me. The day when I have my second accident called him and as soon as I mentioned that I have another accident he pick up the phone but thanks God I have already founded another lawyer and told him that I was only calling to advice that have another accident because stayed at the paper work that I received on first meeting with him. Haven't finalized my case still because they holding my daughter's check and still don't know when I going to get it it's over 2 months since my case settled...
The receptionist at my PCP's office recommended Dr. Gimel but I never got to see him. Instead they made an appointment with his PA, David Rueb. My PCP suggested I had an issue with my SI joint.The younger lady with dark hair at the front desk is quite rude. So I was already kinda bummed out. A assistant with arm tattoos called me back and took my vitals. He was really friendly, I wish I could remember his name. Finally David Rueb makes his way into the exam room. He immediately starts in on my x-ray, which BTW you "MUST" have before they'll even book you an appointment. He states there's nothing wrong with my back. I tell him my symptoms. And he immediately says it's sciatica. So first there's nothing wrong and now I have sciatica? Okay. I mention how my PCP suggested an MRI to possibly rule out SI joint and he says no. He assures me it's sciatica. And prescribed Naproxen and 3 weeks of physical therapy. I again ask if we could just have an MRI done just in case as I'm in serious pain and I don't really have sciatica symptoms. No again, and schedules another visit with him in 30 days. Well, come to find out he misdiagnosed me, just as my PCP suggested. I saw another ortho doctor who w/o  question knew it was my SI joint and not sciatica. If Rueb had only set aside his ego and condescending attitude and ordered additional imaging I could've been on my way to recovery. When I called to cancel my second appointment the rude girl even asked why I was canceling. Don't worry about it! I don't know how Dr. Gimbal is but I do not recommend David Rueb. What a knucklehead!
Managers are pathetic. They don't like to take feedback from customers. I had the worst experience dealing with the folks in the counter....I used to like this place before but never going there again.
Frank Marino is the only performer with two stars on the Las Vegas walk of fame; which is one more star than this show is worth... Lip syncing..... Every song is lip synced.... No talent on display here.... Just men in dresses lip syncing to records, I can do that at home.  Skip this dud of a show...
Hostess was extremely rude; she just walked off without saying anything after we told her the number in our party. Most people would be like "please follow me."Ordered drinks - pear martini (fairly good) & strawberry limeade (limeade was terrible, had an awful aftertaste & it had an identity crisis, didn't know if it was going to be sweet or sour...)Ordered 2 fried rice dishes, which ended up being extremely salty. Would not recommend...Only good thing about the whole experience was that our waiter, Doug was really nice.
Went to Walmart to get a battery replaced. What was I thinking. I waited over an hour to have my car looked at. I waited in the waiting room which was disgusting. The tv had no reception and the couches they have for their customers were filthy and full of who knows what kind of stains. I expected more from a neighborhood store yet I was disappointed. Never again bad customer service.
Matsuda has the worst service I have ever experienced! The hostess was inattentive and kept wandering off as the foyer filled up with people so when she returned, she was bombarded with people trying to get a seating number. The hostess gave us a number and didn't tell us how long the wait would be. Whenever someone approached her she looked as if they were burdening her with our presence. We waited for 30 minutes before we had to ask to be seated since we were next and there had been an empty table for 4 for over 10 minutes. A table for two was empty beside us for 20 minutes before a pair were seated.The food was good but a lot of our order did not come. When we tried to get the attention of a server, they would look at us and walk away. Portions were extremely small. One roll was only 4 small pieces. My overall experience was poor and I will never be going back.
Horrible service, what a bunch of con artist. I highly recommend staying away from this shop at all cost! If not expect to be ripped off.
Food (2/5)The food was sub par. I started with the red lentil soup which was probably the best part but nothing spectacular. For my main I had the seafood pasta which was something I could have made better myself. The noodles were from a packet, the scallops were tiny (about the size of my fingernail) and there were literally only 2 shrimp and they tasted like they had been in the freezer for too long. The creme brule was okay but it was cold.Service/Atmosphere (1/5)We booked this place for an office Winterlicous lunch (aprox 15 people) and since we didn't have alot of time, we had asked if we could preorder so the food would be prepared but Victor assured us that  everything would be quick. This was not the case. The food came out slowly, and often times one group would be done their course before another group had even started. Water was not refilled and no one came to check on how we were doing. We were at on the patio which had been closed up for the winter but it was raining and a few people were constantly getting dripped on. They also did the "bait and switch", something I had heard of before for winterlicous/summerlicous but never experience. Upon arrival, the entire winterlicous menu had changed from what was posted. On the original menu they advertised things like tiger shrimp in the rissotto or salmon fillet, but when we arrived we were offered pink shrimp or tilapia. To top it all off, we were charged 20% auto-gratuity ontop of tax which we were all unhappy about.
Integrity is just a name with this company. I was having issues with my AC not blowing cool air so i called this company out to have them diagnose the issue. Little did they know I had already called a competitor and this was more or less a 2nd opinion. The technician although professional was attempting to sell me at the door with his scripted intro and pamphlet offering me some service package. After he evaluated the situation he presented me with a 7 item list of issues with multiple levels of criticalness(previous company noted water in a pan, and low capacitor).He stated that level 1's and 2's were required to "Get me up in running for the night" Included he noted that I needed 5 pounds or $500 worth of coolant. I thought this was odd since the previous company noted that my coolant levels were good and I  also had coolant added to the system last summer. He claimed that my system took a maximum of 5 pounds and required the entire amount, when i asked him if he was claiming that my system was completely empty of coolant he stated that "It was possible". Because I was aware that this was a flat out lie I agreed to pay the service call and asked him to leave. All in all this company provided me a quote of nearly $1,500 and I had a competitor come in and remove the water from a secondary pan and clear up a blocked drain for less than $200. My AC is working perfectly and I didn't have to be robbed in order to accomplish it. I would never let this company do any work in my home, they will take advantage of unknowledgeable customers.
We have been to Millers Ale House several times.. Always great food and service, which is why we went Monday, Memorial Day..  Promptly seated..  5 mins. Go by, waitress stops at table next to us asking if everything is ok, need anything, My husband says " No" as she glances at us and passes by.. Husband speaks to manager. Expecting the manager wanting to make things correct by taking our drink order.. He returns to our table..  But NO, the manager wasn't interested in making things right, in fact, he didn't even send a waiter/ waitress to take our order.. Husband speaks to manager again - and we were told to leave!!  We will NOT return..
They will over cook your burgers unless you order them rare. The food was basic af. There's nothing special or interesting on the menu. Certainly nothing justifies the prices, other than the location. My pastrami was salty and greasy and not flavorful. The chips that came with it were vaguely stale. I would have preferred kettle chips to the house made, tbh. Save yourself. Don't eat here.
They apparently don't have orange chicken (even though it's on the menu) so they suggested "Spicy Chicken" instead. The dish was literally 75% peppers and 25% chicken. It was inedible. I won't be ordering there again.
I've never had a problem with any Yogurtini ever until today. I had to wait to pay for my Yogurtini for 5 minutes, received an apology and still had to pay full price for my half melted Yogurtini. Then as we're sitting there eating at the table the girl who was in the back for over 5 minutes was eating food in front of us with her fingers and then touching the spoons to put them away and then wiped her nose with her hand and continued to just work at the front with all the food.
Gave free home consultation, but never received a quote.  All I heard was I'll have it tomorrow... guess tomorrow never comes... even three months later
They are always so worried about rushing the customer through that they can never get an order right. 3rd time and that's annoying so I will never go back. The entire staff is RUDE!!!!
If there was NO STARS, this place would get it. This place is SO SLOW. Been sitting here in the drive thru for 10 min, waiting to give our order. Mind you.... there is no one ahead of us. If there wasn't someone behind us, we would 've reversed. Finally gave our order and approached the window... there was no line, bo one sitting inside. RIDICULOUS!!! How does this place stay open? Time to locate another tropical smoothie.
I have stayed here multiple times without any issues. On my last stay however there was a barking dog in the room next to me. The dog barked loudly no less than four times during the night and I had a long day on driving the next day. The hotel general manager Tammy Brewer said that the best she could offer is a partial refund. I was kept up all night and the best offer is a partial refund?! I'm a dog lover and have two dogs, I understand sometimes things can happen. After an issue happens superior customer service does whatever possible to rectify the matter. In this instance Tammy Brewer failed miserably and lost a repeat business customer. Come to this hotel only if you don't plan on needing any sleep otherwise you are much better off staying elsewhere.
let me tell y'all... do not come here!!! nobody in here knows how to cut hair... -"nobody" they suck!!! service suck!!!! everything suck!!!! do not enter this building my fellow black americans (tho is black barbers here) they all suck!! i got my hair cut by them all!!! avoid this place at all cost please!!!
a cockroach was climbing on the desk. only one waitress. worst service ever. dishes took one hour to serve
So was driving to this place to check out new menu since they said in the phone they changed there menu and website was not working. Keep in mind i ALWAYS get delivery so i had no idea where this place was.  I called them cuz i was having trouble locating them. After being passed to 3 different people because they did not understand me the last one finally told me the address, which I already knew, without allowing me to speak. He then after giving me the address, proceeded to tell me he could not understand me and did not have time for me. He then told me have a good day and hung up the phone. I guess it didn't have time for my money either, which by looking at other Reviews would have been a waste.
I went there on a date and got there before the live band on a Saturday night. We waited for a table to clear and as soon as one did we grabbed it. A waitress comes and tells us that we couldn't sit there because that was someone else's table and it shouldn't have been bused. She acted like we stole the table but actually the busboy cleared it. So we moved to the bar and after spending over $80 on drinks and appetizers the big bouncer came and told us we had to move again. Why? so the "girls could dance on the bar" Really! Well why did they have bar stools there. I gave them the finger, left and said I would never go back. It is not at all like TK's song...
First off, the misters that great you as you buy tickets is a much needed relief on those hot summer days.  The beverages and snacks are expensive as all get out but you already knew that.  Movie theaters treat themselves like airports.  No outside food or beverage.  What a crock.  I still sneak in a can of Mr. Pibb and Red Vines, cause like Andy Samberg said, "They're crazy delicious."  Next we have the bathrooms.  (MEN) Do Not take a dump here!  The floors are sticky and not just by the urinals, but the sinks as well.  Have people been that desperate that they try to hit the sink?  They should clean up more often.  Now we come to the viewing chamber.  Meh.  Stadium seating is here, but that's not really much of a plus is it?  They are everywhere.  It's as if there are still people saying things like, "Your minivan has TWO sliding doors?!  No way!  That's like the coolest thing ever!"  The floors were sticky.  Maybe the guys going in the sink are tracking it back into the theater...nah probably soda.  Now the screen size.  Small. I previously lived near a theater that had those mega screens.  I guess I've just gotten used to it.  There is a review here that mentions kids in Rated R movies.  I offer a new MPAA law..."R" = No children at all in theaters.  I don't care if they are teenagers.  That's fine with me I'm talking 0 to 12 year olds.  There are other people here you know.  Being an adult.  I hate when little tykes are running up and down the aisles.   Or kids trying to talk to there buddies.  Case in point I saw The newest Harry Potter this summer with my gf and two kids sat behind us.  Apparently only one of them had read the books and/or saw the movies.  The other had done neither.  I had only seen the movies so I had no idea what was happening.  It's hard to watch a movie when you have one trying to explain the previous 34 books.  Then having the other kid get confused.  This is where it got unbearable the turd said, "Don't worry I read the book, I'll tell you what happens."  Meanwhile this 4 or 5 year old is running up and done the aisles and out of the corner of my eye I see that horrid glare of a cell phone screen and not an ordinary cell phone screen but one of those big ol' dingleberries.  I prefer downloading now.  If you go on a date Do Not got to Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville.  For some reason I thought it would be a good idea (I'll wirte a review on that later...maybe..if I get good reviews on this one) Sorry this review is so long.  I just have a lot to say.  I wanted to be really thorough, but I think I might have rambled a bit.  But bear with me folks I'm almost finished.  Okay I'm done.
I have been frequenting this establishment for almost 15 years. I think I was Hunan's biggest fan, in fact. And that was for good reason. Their food had always been tasty, plentiful and consistent. The original owner (TC) sold it a few years ago to the head chef (or this is what I was told anyway). Since that time the quality of the food has declined steadily. Perhaps they are using inferior ingredients or just don't care but your dining experience will not be what it has been in the past. At my last visit (and that was literally my last visit) I had Cilantro chicken. It looked like no one took the time to chop the vegetables in an appetizing way. There were way too many cilantro stems and the chicken was chewy and fatty. I believable a piece of shrimp or scallop made its way into my dish as well. That was a surprise. My companion ordered chicken and vegetables and it was just flat out disgusting. This dish had NO flavor. I think chicken and vegetables cooked in water would have tasted better. Additionally, it had a different texture that didn't seem like chicken at all. The server was not accommodating and charged us for the bland dish even thought less than 5% had been consumed. I'm disappointed that the quality of the food has declined. I can no longer recommend this place and will not embarrass myself when dining with business associates.
The server with glasses is soooo RUDE! Poorest server I have ever had!!! There was a BUG in my dish and the serve didn't say sorry at all. Service was slow and ridiculous! Don't go there!
Really disliked this place.1. Nobody greeted us as we came in 2. When we were standing in line there were 2 ladies at the front desk, we stood in front of the one that was clearly doing nothing but sitting and starring at a computer and when we approached her she looked up at us and said nothing and went back on the computer. Not even a " somebody will be right with you" 3. Out of a few staff 2 people (the lady who cashed us in and the gentlemen that told us the rules) were nice 4. We were probably the only people in here and staff kept following us around didn't let us jump in peace.                 ****NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN DRIVE A LITTLE LONGER AND HEAD TO GRAVADY! *******
Treated me like crap. Went in bought a piece walked out went home used it once and broke. Called and they said there is nothing we can do. No refunds no exchange. Shit if I know the piece will break then why go there and by again.
This review applies to every Circle K I have ever been to. If they even allow you to use the restroom it is usually filthy and the stores overall are not clean and well maintained. They all appear to be independently owned with absolutely no accountability from their corporate headquarters
We waited 40 minutes after ordering to get our food. When it finally came it was cold. My husbands steak was medium well and he ordered medium rare. My cheeseburger had no flavor and had clearly been sitting for some time. Our original waitress left and a new waitress came to the table to check on us. We complained about the food and she sent the manager over. My husband showed him how well done his steak was and told him that our food was cold. He took the cost of the steak off the bill. This will be our last meal here. Very poor customer service.
Something needs to be done about this location. .. never go here for breakfast!  It's so crowed. Drive through and inside. Its so bad that cars on are the main road trying to get into the drive thru.  Its also attached to a gas station so that makes it even more crowed. I asked for my breakfast burrito without cheese.  The cashier said "no prob" turns out, the burritos come frozen and they just heat em up... yuck.THAT Will teach me to not eat fast food.Avoid this location.
If i could rate a 0 I would. My wife and I dined in and sat there and waited for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I had to get up and ask who was in charge of the area where i was sitting. The woman came and brought us water took our order and left to not be seen again for 15-20 min. The sushi rolls were bland and flavorless. We only went there because someone gave us a giftcard to that place...thank goodness it was free, I would never pay to eat at that dump. Please dont waste your money, there are better options.
I needed my holding tanks serviced while I was in Vegas last December and Daisy Fresh had some good reviews so I called and set up an appointment. Robert is a very likable man no doubt! What I didn't like was paying before he told me that he didn't have the equipment needed to clean my gray tanks!  So after the $ I spent with Daisy Fresh, I still had to find someone that could hydro-flush my gray tanks using the most modern methods of going up through the drain tubes. He flushed my black tank by going through the toliet, and after he did this I had problems with my toilet seal leaking.  Because of this I cannot recommend his services.
I come to Vegas once or twice a year, though I had never stayed at Paris hotel.  After this visit, not again.  The spa at Paris, is the worst place I have ever seen.  It is unkept, dirty, scummy and smells like dirty feet.  The facilities are horrible.  The attendant frankly lazy and rude. Do not waste a penny.  I have seen high school gyms more appealing.
I have given this place a lot of chances, but my past few experiences have not been good at all.  The sushi smelled rancid, but I thought it was just me.  It made me sick!  So, I tried with just their chicken lo mein.  Tasted good, but again, make me ill.  I also think it's overpriced.  The people who work there are really really nice, but it just seems like their food is not fresh.
Very disappointed eating here after all the great reviews. We had a shrimp nachos dish which was huge, but was very bland had no flavor. Most of the cheese was not even melted. We also had a southwestern chicken taco salad which had a bad flavor and did not taste fresh. This was the worst Mexican food we ever had. Beware.
If I had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.First of all, I have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, I can't even tell you how long. Every time I call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why I can't use my coupon. ("Oh, we already ran your card" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? And I'm sure if I wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. Or "Well, the you can't use that with the family deal," in which case, why the heck isn't that written on the coupon? That's really something that should be in the fine print.)Then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees ("Well, the family deal DOES come with two two liters," "UH, no it doesn't... it comes with one..." "WELLL I am looking at it right here and it says TWO liters." REALLY? YES. ONE BOTTLE IS TWO LITERS. DERRRRRRP.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. So we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with EXTRA wing hot sauce on the side. Instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than Betty White's.... well, yanno.
This McDonalds is the worst! Remember to hold up the drive thru line and make sure you have every single thing you paid for.  I'm pretty sure they are only able to make a profit by short changing their drive thru customers.
New image nail salon should rename themselves rushed low quality nail salon. This was my first time here. I came in with high expectations based on reviews from other Yelp users. Not sure if this was a one-off occurrence but my experience can best be summed up as terrible at best. When I arrived for my appointment on a Sunday, the owner (Wendy) was pre-occupied sorting out staffing issues, as apparently one of the girls working that day was not feeling well and had to go home. I waited probably 20 minutes before Wendy finished sorting out staffing issues and started on my nails. Everything was extremely rushed as she was the only one working on a Sunday. Even during the manicure her mind was elsewhere - constantly having to stop to pick up the phone, attending 2 other customers who were waiting the entire time I was getting my manicure. The end result, not surprisingly, was bleeding cuticles and botched, uneven coat, and poorly shaped nails. I let her know that one of my nails top coat created a drop that protruded from the polish,  and instead of filing it down and starting over she hastily filed it and applied another coat...what a joke.  To make the experience even worse, I observed the girl who was there before me come back to complain how her nails were ruined bc they had let her go before it was dry, goes to show quality is a clearly lacking aspect here. So in conclusion, the owner needs to figure out her staffing issues, focus on quality (which is quite lacking), and be less greedy (meaning not accepting more customers on the day when you don't have the capacity). I for one will never come back here again. P.S. Be wary, for some reason all of the negative reviews are hidden under "Not recommended" section of Yelp resulting in an inflated rating.
Very disappointed. I went with my fiance and a group of friends for a birthday celebration and waited for almost 2 hours for our meal. I had the ribeye which was just ok and my fiance ordered the lamb pave, that she couldn't eat it because the meat was very chewy and the curry rice bland and hard. Worst dish I ever tried to be honest. Unfortunately no one at the party was happy with the meal and service.I really wanted to like the place, which is nice by the way, but I won't come back again
So my family and I just ordered Gyros. Worst meal we have ever had!!!!!!  We call  to inform the manager and all he did was argue with us that he has the best gyros in town. Worst food, the salad was even bad. Will never order from here again, not only because the food was bad but so was the customer service from the manager!!
In fact, I don't want to give any star for this restaurant. I am sorry for this while I think I have to tell you that. I placed my order through taste away about 40 minutes ago, and I went to pick up my order 20 mins ago. I gave the credit as my food was on time and ready to pick up when I arrived. My order according to menu is Gheyman Plate, as stated in its description: veal stew, includes rice or fries, and soup or salad.                           It does sounds good, but but but the food is just too bad. I'm not lying to you, the stew got 3-4 slices finger tip size meat and hardly identified as veal. The taste of the meat like stuff is so-dry & awfully weird. There is no way it is something stew. More than that, I found fries in my stew! Yeah, you hear me right and clear! They put fries in my stew. The stew comes along with fries literately! The taste of the soup in the stew is bad bad bad and I couldn't take a second sip.  Trust me, I can identify whether it is weird or simply bad.I strongly suggest you NOT go to this restaurant, if you do, DON'T order the stew like dishes at least.The people in the house doesn't looks as evil as the food though.Not to mention the fries from the house is no good, or the salad (I chose Coleslaw and my girlfriend just tried one bite of it then quit eating).
I will never go back to this pei Wei again.Every time I go I'm disappointed my noodles are sticky and soggy etc
I just got a rescue dog and I called banfield because something had scarred my dog and I wanted to bring him in for a check-up because I was afraid something was wrong. I took my dog here for a checkup and dropped him off, and they told me they would call me when they did his physical. They called me and told me that the vet wanted him to get blood work and give him a pancreatitis test and made it sound like something was very wrong with my dog so I agreed to the tests, but when I went to go pick up my dog they told me his physical had been fine and refused to tell me why they thought those tests were necessary. The staff and the vet who works there ( I believe the vet's name is Kim) were very rude and it was obvious that they had just taken advantage of me moneywise and could care less about my dog or myself.I argued with them for an hour about this and they finally refunded my money for the tests, but not before commenting that they just wanted to make it clear that I would never bring my dog back there again. I have never been treated so rudely in my life.Please do not go here. They are all about money and themselves. Protect your pet and yourself.
The line here is always 15 20 minutes.  Getting fabric cut can be 30+ minutes. The employees are not knowledgable.  This store is a pot the swallows hours of your time. This is a regular occurrence.  Something should change.
Stopped by Monday for our first trip here. At least 50 people waiting outside. We won't be back.
When this salon opened, they were great.  Over the past few years, ownership/management changes have really led to a decline.  The pedicures I have had there haven't been very good for a while.  I recently found an older gift certificate I had, so I took it in and the lady (who had not one other customer, by the way, laughed when I asked if I could still use it.  She said that they expire a year after the purchase date (which is not noted anywhere on the gift certificate.) Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.  I was there to have several services and they lost an additional $60 above the pedicure value of the gift certificate that they should have honored.  I went down the road to my preferred salon.
I was at store #1665 and the mechanics on duty recommended that my Serpentine Belts be replaced. Person on duty was P. Garippa. I went to a real mechanic today and they said my belts were fine and the Jiffy Lube people were lying. It seems like a cash grab to me at that store. Very shady. I talked to Justin at the store today and he apologized , but offered nothing else. Something must change at this location.That was my letter to the corporate office. I would never let a Jiffy Lube dude (really, just a minimum wage employee with oil training) touch anything important on my car and now I will never believe another one of these yahoo's. I did spend 45 minutes at a real shop which equals Jiffy Lube wasted my time and I want to be compensated for the idiots you hire that are trying to get money for things that do not need to be fixed.   Take your serpintine belt and shove it boys.
This place used to be great with service and food. Worst experience today. Ordered Ultimate club, no greens. Got this instead. Also was handed two small smoothie drinks instead of a regular smoothie. No chips either. Keep in mind it wasn't buzy either.
I've been coming here since it opened and it has really gone downhill in the past few months. It seems they have new management that scrimps on everything. My husband and I ordered online to-go and when we went to pick it up, fries weren't ready. Further, when we pointed out that the veggie frites were half of what a typical order is, they said that was their normal. Also, when we came home and checked out a burger, the requested extra spinach was not on the burger (also, what little spinach present was wilted when it used to be fresh) and the cucumbers were so thin as to be translucent. The burgers were also very salty. Before this new management took over,  orders were ready for pick-up, toppings on burgers were actually present as requested, and sides were full-sized. This was the second time we encountered this situation at this location and it's very disappointing. For the money and the hassle, I suggest going to In-N-Out a few blocks away.
We were there over the weekend on a Saturday. The DJ was amazing the whole night kept everyone dancing. But the bartender...OMG. Never met such a bad one . We legit stood at the main bar for 30 minutes maybe 40 waiting. Trying to get his attention. He kept interacting with a group assuming his friends/buddies and flirting with a girl. So he finally looked our way and got our order I'm like good finally. 5 minutes later we see him out of the bar serving area taking shots with the group of friends basically partying . I was seriously in shock. My 7 year old can take better directions and focus more. Another bartender finally comes in (looking annoyed since he was picking up the others one slack) and takes our order again and serves us within 3 minutes. Props to him for actually doing his job. Never had such a bad experience. Other than the sucky bartender the vibe and music was a great.
I will never go back or refer a friend to this place. The customer service is the worst I've every experienced in Vegas (and I'm a local). Extremely unprofessional and I was working with the store OWNER! I found this place on craigslist which advertised it with a $5 off coupon. Checked out the website that was linked at it says for an iPhone 3gs to be unlocked and jailbroken for $20.I went into the store at they try to tell me its $15 for unlocking and $15 for jail breaking. Totaling to $30. I showed them that THIER website says $20. He tried to tell me he can "meet me half way at $25, but I can't use the coupon"...excuse me?? I asked for the owner, "wookie", but he doesn't come into 1pm. This was so unprofessional. I drove 30 minutes from home to come to this place, so I decided to just let them fix it.  It was 10am, when they open. I asked how long until its fixed, they told me the tech guy does't come in until noon. Why open at 10AM then? Its a phone REPAIR shop and the person who repairs doesn't get in until noon? I left.I called back later several times that afternoon to talk to the owner. He didn't come in until 3pm. Wookie told me to come in and talk to him to work it out. I asked when he will be in tomorrow, he told me "all day". The next day I kept calling to see if the owner was in. He didn't come in until late that afternoon again. When I got there the owner told me the same thing and wouldn't respect the prices on their own website. He kept talking to other customers mid-conversation. He gave me a lot of attitude and finally told me, "pay what you want" almost yelling t me. I am a soft-spoken young woman. By no means was I trying to fight with the owner. And even if I was, the customer should come first. I will never go back. This place is a joke.
I have taken my car here a few times now and have been pretty unhappy with the service. The first time I took it in for an oil change and everything was good. The second time I took it in to get my tires rotated and I came home to see that my hub cap had fallen off. Luckily it fell off in the parking lot at Firestone so I was able to get it back. The next time I came back to get my AC fixed. I had them run all of the tests to see what was wrong. They said it was "possibly" the compressor, but they weren't sure. They said I for sure needed the freon evacuated. They did that and had me come pick up my car and said the AC was fixed ($300 later). I drove off and the AC did NOT work! I brought it back and they looked at it again and said it was the compressor which would be another $600 to fix. I don't understand why they would send me away saying it was fixed! There goes $300 down the drain!
The last time I dined here was many years ago. I recalled it being a "decent" dining experience then, but one I wasn't exactly enthusiastic about repeating again during a recent visit with friends. As another poster mentioned, there is a small segment of the population who is rabidly devoted to this long time Phoenix fixture. Why? I'm not exactly sure. My most recent experience, days ago, left me wondering how this place has managed to stay open for so long.Upon entering the dark, cavernous entrance, no one was there to greet us. It took a while before someone noticed and seated us. The dining area on this very hot afternoon, was uncomfortably warm. Not exactly a respite from the heat.Then the salsa and chips arrived. Please see the photos and other reviews on this awful concoction which appears to me to be nothing more than tomato sauce (spaghetti sauce base) with a few chili pepper seeds thrown in for good measure. This stuff absolutely comes from a can. If you ask for the "other salsa", what appears next is a watery, minced pepper mixture that is horribly bland and only slightly better than the tomato sauce salsa. I wound up eating the chips by themselves.I ordered a chicken burro enchilada style. The rice was fine, the shredded chicken abundant, but not seasoned. The enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless. All in all, highly disappointing and completely non-authentic.
Worst experience ever! Joy is the manager on duty and she wouldn't honor the 5% discount on Yelp! She said it can't be applied because it's not on the reservation but you have to Check In on Yelp in order to do so. The manager special is for a compact car "Nissan versa, etc" and Sharron, the rep, tried to up sell us to a full size for $10 more per day. We declined and all of a sudden they're sold out of all cars and put us in a mini van which is going to be more gas. Joy wouldn't even come from the back to talk to us. What an experience.
Absolute nightmare and completely unreliable!So I called Daniel and told him about the job description with photos and all the details at about 10am.  He told me it would be no problem and he would be there at 1:30 PM. When 1:30 came around he then told me that he's going to be late by about an hour. I said no problem! He didn't call after an hour and I had to text him asking where he was at?  He then says I'm sorry I won't be there until about 3:30, I said OK, then he doesn't show up so I called again and he said he could come at 4:30 finally at 4:45 he calls and says he probably can't make it but he would have someone one else will call me. After giving the job description for the second time with photos, the woman on the phone tells me her price is $500 and didn't even look at the my condo, which was about a 3 to 4 hour job. I know because I have vacation rentals and many other properties in Vegas, so I'm not a newbie.  I explained to her I owned dozens of properties since I started in 2010 and know for a fact this pricing was unreasonable! I provided photos and details of work and again specified it was a 3 to 4 hour job and they never set a foot into the condo to give an accurate estimate!  To top it off she was extremely rude and proceeded to degrade me, About how I know nothing about my business. I find it shocking that someone could give me a verbal quote without having step foot on the property and be as rude and degrading as she was! I was so upset I simply just hung up on her! Think twice on finding a handyman here!
I ordered their new SEASONED ROAST BEEF THREE CHEESE & BACON sandwich and was totally unimpressed. The sandwich looked no where near the picture and was squished flat with a stale bun. No wonder they are closing stores!
We stopped here for lunch yesterday (8/23/14).  We were seated in a booth, and waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, a young woman came by and said "I'll be right back".  Then she proceeded to go to the hostess stand, look at something, stand there awhile; when the hostess came back, she started a conversation with her - and never even acknowledging us again.  Not even a glass of water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for something to happen (and they were not crowded, there were only about 10-12 tables filled in the entire restaurant).  Finally, since she decided her conversation was more important, we left.  She saw us leave (after all, she was conversing with the hostess) and didn't even apologize.  There is no excuse for bad service in ANY restaurant.  Guess there wasn't a manager on duty to monitor.
This Freshii location is new and their employees seem very confused and incompetent. We ordered a Buddha Satay with extra sauce with steak and it was very dry practically with no sauce. We also ordered a kale salad and added avocado which we did not receive. Definitely do not recommend this Freshii location.
If I was able to submit zero stars I would!!!My mother and I had a reflexology appointment yesterday and we were anticipating a great experience.  However, I was VERY disappointed with the customer service, cleanliness, inability for the employees to communicate and comprehend my questions/concerns.  There were wet towels on the chairs in the reflexology area and when I mentioned (twice) to one of the employees (who was a male of Asian descent) he either didn't understand my question or completely ignored me.  Additionally, the same male employee demanded that another customer pay a 30% tip.  She expressed that she wasn't satisfied with the service and her massage was cut short by ten minutes.  Therefore the tip was reflective of the service rendered.  Disregarding her concern, the male employee was very persistent that she pay 30% tip.  My mother and I decided to leave the establishment and will never return.
I would not recommend this place at all I've lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and get massages all The time I called this morning to book an appointment and told the receptionist we were driving in from California she asked for a credit card number to hold the reservation and unfortunately we hit some unexpected traffic I called over an hour to let her know we would not be able to make the appointment at which time she threatened to charge us for the full service and hung up on me stating she was the owner... I was never told about anything being charged on my credit card it was just to hold the appointment she did not offer a rain check or anything with that said I would not recommend this place and I will gladly be calling up my credit card company to dispute the charges!!! Very unprofessional
Below average food over priced would not recommend many other choice on the strip I had the filet and prime rib.. was excited with the menu
Update: Updating my original review because I had rave reviews about this place, but after tonight I have to seriously downgrade my rating. The service was awful, our server "Brian" started off the evening with a superb and arrogant display of his English knowledge and proceeded to tell us that their wine "special" for the night was cheap crap when I inquired.... Then why is it on the menu??? Then, I ordered my favorite dish - the mussels and there was a spoiled one in there. Have you ever tasted a spoiled mussel? I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant. It tastes like rotten eggs, but you can taste it in your mouth for hours to come... and hopefully you won't puke it up later. NASTY!!!  The server barely acknowledged this and the manager stated that "that's mother nature for you". Excuse me? I understand the risks of eating seafood, but you should never handle a complaint like that... an "I'm so sorry," would have been the minimal acceptable response. Finally, everyone was getting free mini desserts (some chocolate cake thing) and our server never brought ours.. very obviously... and never comped us for the mussels... not even a 10% discount... If they treat their loyal customers in such a manner, especially on their first anniversary, then I think there are other restaurants where I can become loyal instead. ***********************************************************************   Original review:   Addicting! Roasted mussels are to die for!!! I keep getting this. The appetizer menu could use some work, but the desserts make up for it. Chocolate bacon s'mores and the pint of Guiness desserts are fascinating. Service is excellent and atmosphere is inviting. It's really busy though, so you better have a reservation. Nice addition to the hood!!! Finally.
We love eating at Chipolte, but this location was the worst experience I have ever had at one of their restaurants. They were out of chips (no chips at a Mexican restaurant?!)They were out of lettuce.Black beans were crunchy (must have just come out of the can).Bathrooms were gross.Tables had not been wiped down and cleaned.This was on a Saturday night at 8 pm, so it was inexcusable to not have the basic food items available.
The quality of fish really suffered. Uni was brown and it tasted nasty. The supposedly fresh oyster is not so fresh. Not a single item we ordered tasted good. Left the restaurant still hungry. Will not return. There are a lot of other good restaurants out there.
DO NOT GO HERE. They give misinformation about your insurance not covering "out of network" dentists. They will make you pay completely out of pocket, and then when you contact your insurance company they will tell you that is not true, and you would have been covered. Reporting to the BBB.
Poor service. Terrible food. Soggy and undercooked, no understanding of the problem. Took 30 minutes to get an undercooked pizza. Had our money refunded the food was so terrible.
They would get a much lower score if possible. If you are looking to visit a JITB, drive another mile and go to another one. I was appalled at the lack of service and the inaccuracy of the order. Sauces were left off a burrito, food was burned, incorrect condiments given, SLOW service, and a group of workers that could not get their act together. It is a dirty store outside (I went through the drive through). When I complained to JITB through their survey, they couldn't even get that right! Never again!
This place sucks.The employees are stupid and mostly always mess up your order even when youre the only costumer there. If I could I would give it zero stars.
I came here to get a pedicure. Worst experience ever. My pedicure was rushed. The utensils used to do my pedicure were not clean. If I could get first class service then maybe I would leave a tip but I can't get first class service here. Over charged for a terrible pedicure $25 not worth it. Save your money and go elsewhere!
Horrible, dishonest and zero accountability for their screw ups. I had an oil change done and immediately after driving away, I noticed my car didn't sound the same. I brought my car back and they denied there was a problem.  6 guys standing around my car and they couldn't pin point the problem so naturally, they said I must've hit something and there was nothing they could do to fix it since "i caused the problem".  Frustrated, I left and when i got home, I popped my hood only to realize they did not close my air filter cover properly. 6 guys couldn't figure this out and instead of trying to fix the problem, they immediately blamed me. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
I stopped in at the Biltmore store Panera (fka Paradise Bakery) three times now over the last 2 months and more than half of their menu board is covered by paper.  There were only four or five sandwich options.  Over the last 2 months I have been waiting for the menu to change, but none of the staff know when that will happen.  Time to write Panera off my list for restaurants.
Did not like the small menu, not enough variety of food!  Way over priced for the quality of food. It is a different type of Mexican food than what I am traditionally used to.. I did not like that they charge for everything, even for rice and beans,also charged $4 for an extra taco for the kids plate!  Probably will not return..
The food just didn't have any flavor.  And now my stomach hurts.  The guy that took my order was lovely, the delivery guy (possibly same guy) was very sweet.  It's just that the food has no flavor.  Also the apps were burned.  I mean I'm definitely not hungry now, but I could have accomplished that for less than $45 (three people ordering entrees and two starters).  I won't be ordering from there again.  I heard good things about this place, but I'm just becoming more convinced good Chinese food in Phoenix (or Arizona) doesn't exist.
I had never gone to this place and thought it'd be a nice choice for Valentine's Day. I made my reservation a week before and asked if they would have a special menu for V-day and the guy said they weren't sure if they would (a week before, you would know I would think!). Come V-day and I get a call saying that they are understaffed and the restaurant will be closed. Really?! And they didn't even try to make up for it, offer a gift card, free drinks on next visit, nothing!! I guess I won't ever consider this place again.
Ordered to go through grub hub. It came extremely fast but the order was messed up. Ordered buffalo chips, got plain chips with a side of blue cheese. Nothing even remotely Buffalo. Paid for extra ranch, got no ranch at all. Buffalo wrap was soggy with hot, bitter tasting lettuce on it. Won't be eating here again.
Wow this place is TERRIBLE!!!! started with a margarita that tasted worse then pine sol(cleaning supplies). the food all looked exactly the same. weird because i believe it was all frozen and just heated up. we had a party of 5 and we all felt sick shortly after beginning to eat it. if you like salt you will enjoy this food. another reason that we all belive that they just heay up frozen food. if i could give this place 0 out of 5 i wood. DONT GO!!!!
They changed the name to Get air and won't accept already purchased groupons for Rockin Jump?!!! Horrible way to treat customers!
Do not use unless you like waiting and being forgotten!  Took me over an hour to get to my hotel from the airport. The return trip they forgot to stop at our hotel.  If I didn't call them I would still have been waiting.
Had to amend my rating for this gym. The best part about this place are the classes. The instructors are knowledgeable, really great people who love their job and it shows. They are worth all the trouble and double talk you go through once you join. Read the contract and do not listen to a single thing they say...its lies and a scam. If you do find yourself entangled with this place try the classes. Yoga, 5 star. Zumba 5 star.
HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Finding a nice restaurant in downtown Cleveland is difficult, but after seeing GHT boast vegetarian and vegan options, I was excited to try it out.  i will first start by saying that this place is NOT vegetarian friendly.  While they have had two main courses that  I could order, I chose the Winter Braised Vegetable Potee. It came  with 2 cubes of tofu, 2 cubes of polenta, and 6 cubes of vegetable and was grossly under seasoned.  It came in a plain broth that was not meant to be consumed and just made everything soggy. I could have prepared something at home that would have tasted 100% better and would have cost 10% as much.Futhermore, I was completely disgusted by those around me ordering entire pigs heads.  One came at a table next to me and I completely lost my appetite- which may have been ok because the dish I ordered would not have filled me up.  I cannot say one good thing about this place and I wish I could warn everybody to never go there.
Very slow service.  Waited over an hour to go through 8 people in line. Much rather pay a few bucks extra and use Hertz or someone who has a check-in terminal. Very disappointed with the speed of check in.
This place is the total opposite of urgent care.  I was here for 2 hours before I saw a physician.  1 hour in the waiting room and another in the private room.  The staff are not very friendly and the first thing they do besides collect your health insurance is get your money.  I guess they're afraid you're going to leave halfway through waiting and not pay them.  I would not recommend this place to any suffering soul who needs to see a doctor immediately.
Do. Not. Live. Here! Trash hole of a complex. Apartments are old. Bed bugs. Old man who lives near the leasing office will accept your packages and keep them in his apartment until you find him and get them. (Violation of privacy and it is a federal offense to take someone else's mail!). Marsha the landlord is rude and not personable. After hours maintenance doesn't exist, and if you lock yourself out or something happens they leave it up to YOU to spend YOUR OWN money to take care of it. All around miserable establishment
If you want to talk during your breakfast don't bother coming here. It's extremely loud. The music is totally unnecessary. The food is good but we won't be coming back since you leave with a headache. People have to scream in order to be heard over the music. If your looking for a nice quiet breakfast go somewhere else. Also the prices are as high as the noise.
Maybe it was just a bad night that I went. My friends and I went to this hot pot place last week to 1) warm ourselves up, 2) cheapest one in the area. It seemed like an optimal place with bubble tea and billards downstairs. When we entered, there was only 2 tables occupied. We went at approximately 8pm so we thought maybe we missed the dinner rush (I don't think that ever happened). We stood around for 5 minutes since no one was there...then a girl came out and escorted us to our table. The service overall wasn't good at all. When we were paying, I think the girl made a mistake so she kept on swearing to herself and didn't give a crap about us paying. Food wise, it was alright. Not the best I've had (given it was only for $18), it was decent. I wouldn't necessarily come back to this place again given the shitty service.
I should of known better to cut my losses when the first thing we heard from the House of Egg Roll staff was "we're out of egg rolls".  The service was terrible and when my food finally arrived, the waitress set it down on the other end of the table.  I realize there may be some cultural differences and language barriers but the staff at this place is inattentive and rude.  The food was bland and cold.  In the middle of the lunch rush, a huge delivery of the food came right through the front door.  Why the owners of this place would let his happen during their lunch rush is baffling.  They staff was overwhelmed and inexperienced.  Don't worry about them not charging for something!  I'm surprised they didn't bill me for my ice water!
Food was terrible. Restaurant seemed to be big for happy hour as that area was packed. The dinning area we were in was old and dumpy looking. Food was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted like it was reheated. Will not eat here again. Sad we wasted a night out here and money. Was not worth it. Worse than ramen noodles.
Such a shame! I have ordered food here a few times and it's been fine.  Nothing great but okay and near my home.  Tonight...I'm making myself eat some of it just so I'm not hungry.  Totally disgusting. sampler platter,  fries cold and mushy, came  with no sauce, chicken wings cold and mushy.  Chicken fingers - one not cooked all the wayand the rest mush. The soup was beef vegetable.  Something from out of a can.   Sub sandwich - vinegar completely soaked through bread and mushy.  I almost cannot believe that they serve food like this.   I would attribute a lot of this to the fact that I ordered it at 6:35 and it arrived at my house at 7:45.  The way it tastes - it sat for at least 45 minutes getting cold and mushy.   I will never order from this restaurant again and I suggest that you don't either.  With this economy, one would think that places that want to stay in business would go the extra distance to make sure their food is better.   By the way, sandwich, soup, 5 chicken strips and sampler appetizer $$43 with the $5 tip that I wish I hadn't had given now.  I feel completely ripped off and still hungry....  If you aren't good at the other things on the menu, why are you serving them and delivering them???
Had scheduled a service for Monday between 4 and 6. He never showed up, never called or texted, just left us waiting.
I can honestly say this is the worst Tim Hortons ever!!! The attitude you get from the same 2 women is so unprofessional! I will only come here if the gas station Tim Hortons is closed. I've stood at the cash while 3 people were talking for 2 Min before asking for my order I ordered two coffees and asked for a tray... the lady looked at me and just threw it at me. There bad customer service and there is this place! They are so bad they are on another level on their ownYou might be thinking I only post negative things.. but if you look at all my reviews they are usually honest with feedback
Terrible.Food is just not very good and some of the dishes are very unappetizing.Service is bad. Food takes FOREVER to come from the kitchen.Had to leave without even receiving all of our food after 2.5hrs.
I am an American home  shield customer, I requested service for central heating not working,  the issue was my thermostat, the guy replaced it with a cheaper version of  what I had, so I called ahs, to report the issue, the guy came out again,  told me that h re called the company and the secretary stated that I could have the broken thermostat, and he would leave me with no heat if I wasn't happy with the thermostat. He then proceeded to tell me, that he has a family to go to and that he cannot wait for me to call the company,  and I would have to pay him regardless if service.I am really upset that the warranty company would contract a company with such poor work ethic, I am proceedings to call BBB.I would not give this company any stars,
Totally rudeee the lady who answered the phone didn't say thank you for calling frenzy how can I assist you, she just answers the phone saying "hello" in a harsh Tone. I then asked her is this frenzy?? She says yes, I said OK where are you guys located and she says in Las Vegas. Rather then her giving me the actual address that is what she  answered. She Saw an out of town number and obviously thought that I wasn't in town... she then says I'm placing you on hold, so I told her don't bother!! Her service was completely rude and very unprofessional. If you were trying to run a boutique and actually get sales I think your customer service skills need to be highly corrected. Service in Las Vegas sucks!!!
Don't waste your money on a jimmy johns sandwich. There is nothing special about these sandwiches. This is the worst sandwich shop I have been to. You will get a better sandwich by making one at home.
My husband and I have gone to this place for a few years now. Definitely noticed that there is either new owners or new cooks. We've always ordered the same thing. Ribeye pho, wonton & bbq pork egg noodle soup & egg rolls. Several months ago I was pregnant and wanted pho. We ordered our usual and we both got sick. My husband has a pretty strong stomach & he was a lot sicker than I was. It's been a while now and we tried them again last week. I had food poisoning for 3 days. We'll never go back again. We like our health.
Over 90 minutes from the time we bought the tickets until we got to our hotel 2 miles away.  Won't even use them for the return trip I already paid for, not worth the hassle.Wish I could give less than one star.
Made the mistake of ordering the beaver bites. I saw that the bites were not made fresh to order but were only reheated in the oil. My order came out oily and soggyI'll just stick to the traditional beaver tails next time
A friend and I went to this restaurant several weeks ago. At the end of the meal, the server whose name I won't mention (Sheryl), came to us with the check. Mind you, we still had glasses of wine on the table that we hadn't finished. She hands my friend the bill and my friend handed her her credit card. The server said (not nicely), "I need two credit cards." My friend told her that I would be paying cash. Instead of leaving the check on the table and saying something such as "Enjoy your wine and I will be back for the check," she stood at the table while I opened my wallet to get the money and STARED at me until I came up with the money. She would not leave the table. My friend and I are in our 60's, by the way. I had to come up with the money and figure out the tip while she hovered over the table. Afterward, I sent a letter to the restaurant manager explaining the situation to him or her and never heard a word back. I will NEVER go to Stella Mia again and plan to tell everyone I know about this disrespectful, unprofessional behavior.
Food was good. We always love steak n shake. But we didn't get our extra fries. Server brought us the receipt. Showed as 21.76 for the total but then brought us a different receipt after bringing out the extra fries that he admitted he forgot to put in. New total was 19.78. It didn't have the fries on it so we assumed that he had taken them off to compensate for the time we had to wait for the rest of our order. So we left a nice tip and made sure to thank him. Got up to the register and she scanned in the receipt to pay and it rang up for the 21.76. I understand that this was what we got and we paid but what a shitty move. Then the girl that cashed us out pretty much blew off our issue. The fact of the matter is whether it's off 2 cents or 30 bucks, the check was different than what we were presented with. And after we paid she took off while I'm putting the change in my purse without giving me a receipt to show what I actually paid. I had to flag down one of the cooks to ask if someone could produce me a receipt. He's response: We don't give receipts on cash purchases. This is not the first steak n shake I've been too.  I know that's bs. And you don't walk away from a customer like that regardless of it being a cash transaction or not. Totally disappointed and will make sure to never stop at this location on trips back through. There's plenty of other restaurants who can have our business.
I started coming to this place because it's right next to my house & I have never waited long for an oil change. I've only ever done oil changes and smog here. I actually had nothing bad to say about this place until NOW! I went in on June 15th, 2011 for an oil change & smog. They were fast, BUT at the end when I was paying Pamela, the service writer suggested replacing the front brakes, and said I had 8% remaining. She also said I needed to replace my serpentine belt & that it's a common thing in the Las Vegas heat for this to need replacement. She quoted me $320 for these services. Due to my budget (I'm in the middle of purchasing a home & pregnant with my first child), I decided to shop around. My Dad reccomended going to Japanese Car Service, a place I used to take my previous cars, to get an estimate. It is far from convenient since its located in China Town & also takes 2-3 days to get seen. I told them all the issues Purrfect Auto found, and they said I had been lied to because my front & back brakes are at 60% & all belts are just fine. WOW, this place was so honest! I will never go back to Purrfect Auto again. If you're going for a quick oil change, I dont see any problems...but don't do any reccomended work there!
I wish that I could give one less star! This place has soooo much money poured into it and it is still Thug Central! Beautiful and historic building... Love it! Too bad though... The only way I would go down there is well armed. The only way I would send my family, is if I stopped loving them! Stay away!
So, for some dumb reason I guess Justice has taken away their store wide 40% off sales and, apparently, have lowered all the regular prices by "50%".......I find this very hard to believe when I found a cheapy tshirt marked for $29 now - I'm certain that was not a previously $58 shirt......Justice, you've just lost a few very very good customers!!! I've shopped there with my twins since they could fit into your clothes and have relied on your sales. We'll take our business elsewhere.....until you bring the big sales back. Newsflash - your clothing is not worth $30-50 per item, far from it!!!!
Pretty shocked at the customer service on a simple question. It's not even possible for me to make this up. Was going to order from here but not anymore.:calls breakfast place to inquire about daily soup cause THEY SAY TO CALL & ASK:Lady: Oh ... i don't know and the cooks not in yet so ...Me: Well I don't want to order a random soup without knowing what it is ...Lady: hold on let me check:puts me on soft rock waiting song:Lady: yeah actually the cook is not coming in today cause it's Saturday so there will be no soupMe: so ... will you guys still serve food? Since the cook is not there??Lady: yeahMe: ok ... well thank you ...Lady: Excuse me? (In an offended tone for some reason??)Me: I said thank you Lady: oh! Ok thanks bye!!Yeah. Thank you but no thank you. Your Grubhub told me to call to ask about this item. I didn't do anything wrong lol.
I stayed here for 2 nights and felt it was not worth the money (over 200 dollars). The breakfast was decent, the room was okay, but like I said, for that kind of money, I expect top notch customer service and unfortunately, that was not the case.The customer service was okay and the guy at the front desk seemed to be in too much of a hurry to answer my questions properly. I felt I was being brushed off. Secondly, the wi-fi had some problems at this hotel. Although it was supposed to be high speed, it was barely that and on top of that, I had trouble connecting each time I tried to connect and it took a few attempts each time to establish and maintain a steady connection.Too pricey for the kind of service they offer!
Worst buffet i ever had. All food are cold and look not fresh at all. Taste bad as they only focus to serve tourists from china.
Let me make this very clear at the very beginning...This is not about the $$$ I'm out. This is about this company, their service, their lack of care and follow up / through. I arrived in Vegas and almost rented a car. Since I was going to stay at a hotel which had monorail stop, I decided against renting a car. I made arrangements through this company for transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. Getting to the hotel on  was fine. I was given a receipt for return trip and told to call and make arrangements 24 hours in advance for a pick from the hotel to the airport. For the return trip, I called to schedule a pick from the hotel to the airport as instructed. The person on the phone making my reservation was less than cordial but scheduled my pick up for 6:05 PM the next day. My departure from the airport was at 8:45 PM. On the pick up day, I went to the pick up spot outside my hotel and waited several minutes and waited until about 6:25 before calling the # on the receipt but no one answered. I made 5 separate calls and no one answered. On the 5th call, by using a different option in the menu, I finally reached someone  I explained to the person who answered my call and said I was waiting for a scheduled ride. He confirmed I had a 6:05 PM scheduled pick. He put me on hold for several minutes as he tried to figure out what was going on what to do. When he returned on the phone, he told me no one in "dispatch" was answering his call either and he had no idea on what to do other than try to get to the dispatch and have them call me. He had no other option or alternative for me other than some how getting a hold of "dispatch" to call me. He assured me he will have "dispatch" call me as soon as he was able to reach them. After hanging up the phone, I waited another 15 minutes but no one called. I tried calling the # again but no one answered. To this date, I have not heard from anyone from your company. Not wanting to be late for my flight, I caught an Uber an hour later and went to the airport.Their customer service, lack of care and follow through was pathetic. I can understand occasionally missing a scheduled pick up, it happens and I get it. What is not acceptable is to leave a customer stranded without the slightest courtesy to call and explain to them what happened. Maybe one dissatisfied customer means nothing to them...But As I read the reviews, they have more than one unhappy customer. Again, this is NOT about the extra money I had to pay to get to the airport, this is about being stranded and feeling neglected as a paying customer.
I feel a bit weird even writing a review on McDonald's since it's, you know, McDonald's. I do expect good service and for my order to be correct. I was pretty hungry and looking forward to eating a big mac that I hoped would be fresh. Sometimes the food here tastes old. I finally made it home and I'm ready to eat but noticed they forgot my fries. I was a little annoyed but did not want to take another trip there besides they can make it up to me with the juicy big mac I'm about to eat. To my surprise the big mac was not dry because, wait for it, they DIDN'T put any meat patties on my sandwich. Yes you read that right, there was cheese, onions, special sauce and etc but NO MEAT. Wow - how does that happen? This isn't  the first time this location has messed up my order but they have reached a new low.
The atmosphere and management made me want to chug a gallon a bleach and hang myself. The manager looked like a child molester.
Don't come to this location unless you enjoy being harassed by pan handlers while you are trying to order and eat. The staff do nothing to solve the problem and let them harass the paying customers. I've personally had to call the police while on my lunch break.
I really like the food here, I guess because I've been waiting for one to open closer to where I live. When it first opened it was different and new. Now I think they just don't care any more. The staff changes, and the ones that remaine have a don't care attitude. The last two times I was there the manager messed up my order twice and made me and others waiting very frustrated. I will never go back, I'm sure they could careless. But I do, because you want nice businesses in your community. I'll go else where.
If I could give them a 0, I would! WORST customer service!! I bought a truck and traded two cars in for it. More than 3 weeks later, My husband and I are being harassed by Kelly in financing to bring the car back as the deal won't work out as one car that we traded in is past due. They knew from the beginning that we did not make a payment on the car and they said it would be fine, deal would still work. MORE THAN 3 WEEKS LATER!!  BOTH cars we traded in are now past due, registration and tags need to be updated since we returned those also. Worst experience of my life. DO NOT GO TO PEORIA FORD. They will only screw you.
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!! Beware!!!! I have never left a yelp review before, but I could not in good conscience let it go without a warning to everyone. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and quite possibly taking legal action in the near future. Their Plummer came out and did an estimate on my hot water heater for my home warranty company. He decided that it was a ruptured tank and would be covered under the home warranty he started disconnecting all the gas lines and put a jumper in the waterline saying that it would be quicker if he got this done now so when he brought a new tank back the next day. It leaked all night from the jumper he installed and then they sent out their water restoration and damage specialist the next morning. Now their company is claiming that they need to file a home insurance claim for water damage. The water damage they caused. Then the company called me and told me that they couldn't install the new heater until we filed the claim so they held me hostage to file a claim with my insurance company to get extra money for damages they caused. Please be advised to use any other company you can find besides this one.
The only reason I put down 1 star is bcz there is no 0 star. i would even put negative if I could. today my husband had to take yellow cab and they made him wait for 3 hours because "the distance is not far enough. I don't make money out of this trip" When he called they even lied to him that someone came and called him but he never answered. he was holding the phone the whole time to make sure he wouldn't miss the call from the driver. I constantly had problems with yellow cab but today is the last straw. I would never ever use them again, Uber is so much better in price and customer service.
The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.
Yes. Stay away.  Not only do they have bad customer service but are out right rude and don't really now what's going on.  So had them bend some rods for us before, which did not fit so we had to pay for it to be redone for us.  Now the second one was also not done properly.  So not only is it bad service but bad work as well.
(Attended in Santa Barbara CA)  Boooorrrriiing!!  They announced that 2 groups are touring simultaneously,  Clearly, half the talent was missing -- as were half the musical parts in many of the songs. Only 6 "performers"-- who could be replaced by statues. They barely moved for 2 very long hours. No sets, some blinding cheap lights, and just third-rate in every way. The entire group is shoved all the way upstage, clustered there for some strange reason, leaving them far from the audience and half the stage bare. The "orchestra" seemed very possibly to be a local pick-up group who were there to stare at their music stands and collect a paycheck.  What a YAWNer.  Such hokey, poorly-produced videos in this day & age are inexcusable.  Almost $100 per ticket?  Save your money.  I was dying to leave after 10 minutes, but my family wanted to stay to the bitter, boring end.  Listen to the CDs and forget the concert version.  Ugh!!
This is the worst machine shop to go to. I went there to get my 350 crank polished and balanced, well they polished and balanced it BUT, they did a half a**ed job leaving nicks on main journals and rod journals. And they took a grinder to the crank shaft counter weights and grinded the crap out of them to "balance" it. The owner is cranky and rude and says if his shop breaks it, its not his fault and won't take responsibility for any parts that are broken. Anything you say, he says is the wrong way and there is only one way to do things and its his way. Not only do they have crappy customer service, but they do horrible work..... FAIL
The food was not fresh. Salad seemed like it was made days ago. Cup of soup was less than half full. Staff never seems well trained. Bathroom was not clean, which made me concerned with cleanliness of kitchen.
Looking at my nails this past week has been extremely disappointing. I paid $40 to be embarrassed how terrible my nails look. I came in and had a backfill which I haven't had in years so I was asking questions about the process. Apparently offending the man doing my nails, as he informed me he had 20 years of experience and insisted on rudely "showing" me each nail as he went along. The good thing is he got is resentment out.. On my actual nails. The surfaces are clearly filed down leaving huge and noticeable markings. Again I am so embarrassed by my nails at this point and will have to switch back to a full color rather than pink and white in order to cover up him grinding down the surface of my nails. The miserable process dragged on for over an hour.. Just to top it of off he applied the gel coat but missed large portions making my nails uneven and prone to miscellaneous spots being discolored. Never going back that's for sure!
Bad attitude and bad service. There are plenty McDonald's locations​ in Charlotte, why should you waste your time at a place where they treat you bad and mess up your order. Do yourself a favor, skip this location.
They claim low rates?  BS ... my son and his girlfriend broke down in Los Angeles and needed to rent a car to get to Phoenix.  He is 22 and his 1 day rental came out to $212!  AND, he had gotten to Riverside and had to turn around because bone head at Anaheim Enterprise left his keys in the rental ... they gave a small percentage off and no help on added fuel and bill was still $212!  Go to Budget!  Cheaper and they also rent to under 25 as long as you have a credit card and they didn't charge a one way fee.  He rented at budget for return to Anaheim for $68.
Average food from prior visits.  ROUGH servers.  Sitting at the Bar, called a server who is just STANDING to take my order.  "You have to wait for the line" when there's NO line!  Could have just get me order when he's doing nothing.  RIDICULOUS!
Honestly I agree this is by far the worst nail salon I have ever been to. The lady had an attitude doing my nails and complaint about how my fingers accidentally hit her finger. She was quick but really an awful job painting my nails and filing the edges, my nails looked like I could have done a better job myself than her. My nails are looking most rough than ever and the acrylics been only for 3 days and she charged me 27 dollars for a terrible filling. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT saying filling 20$
Luchita's was a huge disappointment. The food quality was very poor.  I ordered tacos and chicken fajitas.  My 6 year old held up her taco and said , "mommy look." grease was pouring out of the taco so much so that her plate was filled with grease. I showed the waitress by picking up the taco as more and more grease poured out. In sheer disbelief she said nothing and walked away.  Trust me Taco Bell is a hundred times better!  On my way out after expressing to another waitress how bad the food was' she said "they just didn't drain the meat." Poor quality food, poor service.
I went to your store yesterday to buy Malibu! But an employee of your store, I forgot his name? Bald, with glasses, like an Asian! I don't know if it is the person in charge! He didn't want to sell the car to me! ! ! His service is very poor! ! ! If the price I said is unacceptable! We can discuss it again! But the Asian employee refused! Let me cancel the plan to buy a car! I originally wanted a fullpayment! But still thanks to Rachel for helping me with great patience!
I stayed there from 12/23/2011 to 12/24/2011.  The room was very small and everything was very very old especially the bathroom.  It is like you are walking to a Victorian house.  The carpet has some stains on it, too.  Thanks God that I had stayed only two nights.  On the third night, we switched to South Point.  Although it was far away from the strip, everything was new - the room was very big and the bathroom was also very modern and comfortable.  In addition, South Point's buffet was only $3.30/person after using 50% coupon.
Our food had no flavor at all. I ordered the panang curry (my favorite) and it tasted like peanut butter soup. It was awful. My husband had the Thai beef salad and the dressing literally had zero flavor. I do not recommend this restaurant at all.
The diner in the Silver Nugget is Hometown kitchen and let me tell you it was not the business when it came time to eat . You would have had better luck at AM/ PM or 7-11.  A party of 3 ( Us ) walk in and we are seated the waitress comes brings us water as we requested then came back and took out order .  She comes back to tell E she can't sub the sides to what I ordered ??  Ot would be a full charge to do that .. Why ??  I may be  the only person to not like okra ??  Any ways I change my order and then we wait ... person 1 & 2 ordered a Salisbury steak medium ,  with 2 sides a veggie blend and a baked potato  what comes out is a hamburger patty burnt cold mixed veggies and a cold baked potatoes  person 3 ordered a Rib eye  what comes out ?? A T - bone .. the manager who came out was dressed in street clothes . For all I know he could have been a customer.  He did not address the problem just laughed it off and said oh well the cook is new ... and the waitress didn't know what she was serving ... just bad allAround   I would not give a start if I didn't have to
Yes, you do get what you pay for!  But in some cases you can get the same product(that you sell)for much much cheaper!  Your company happens to be one of those cases.  Smart people do research and find a better price.  Your profit margin is way too high! You can find some of the same ac units you sell for much cheaper.
Terrible experience. All I needed was some simple blood work done to be cleared to have my breast augmentation done, but Dr Meena Venugopal wanted to do all these other tests I did not need for clearance. She also said breast surgery was a major surgery and takes several hours??? Um wrong lady, It's minor surgery and takes about an hour. I felt she was just judging me and wanted to do everything she could to not clear me for surgery. She also looked at me and said I should have a Hep C test done because I have tattoos! Are you serious?? I WILL NOT go back here. I'm getting my blood work done and having my surgery without the help of this place. I've never felt so judged in my life.
Took my family to this museum.  It cost $55 for 3 of us.  There were only 4 or 5 art installations.  One of the exhibits is only accessible via the elevator so you can't use the stairs.  The spaces are small so it gets crowed very quickly.  We toured the museum in less than an hour, about 15 minutes of which time was spent waiting for the elevator. The museum is located in a residential neighborhood with few restaurants so your only food options are the cafeteria or driving somewhere else.A complete rip-off.  Go to the Warhol museum instead.
Def need to watch what they charge you for. I ordered a salad and then (since it was Tuesday) asked if taco was just $1.95? Employee told me yes so I added a taco. She asked if I wanted lettuce, beans, rice and pico with it? I told her no pico. On my salad, the lettuce wasnt really cut up, like it's just ripped a leaf in half- need knife to cut it up. While getting good bagged to go, cashier gives me a cup. I told her I wasnt ordering a drink and she says it comes with the taco. I asked isn't the taco just $1.95? She said yes. Look at bill and they charged me for rice and beans....last time I was here they also charged me sour cream when I said no to having it but the girl still put it on there. Last time I'll be at this location.
If i could give this crappy place negative 500 stars I would.   Waitress gets our order wrong.   Asked her about it says we ordered it wrong.    Took her 20 min come back take our order to begin with in a not very busy place to start with.  Daughter who is 6 orders a kid plate of spagetthi.  Gets garlic bread w cayenne pepper on it.   Again tell waitress who doesnt care says her back is hurting and at this point I demand a manager.   Seriously cayenne pepper on kids garlic bread?   What if kids are allergic?   And then attitude from a waitress?    Manager comes happens to be leaving for the evening and we catch her out the door.   She adjusts the bill in full and apologizes for the inappropriate behavior and the badly chosen cayenne bread given for a small child.  As we are getting in our SUV im the lot the waitress is cleaning a table on the patio and she starts harrassing us in the lot.  Saying we have nothing better to do yelling screaming at us.   Trying to start like a fight.   All of this with a 7 and a 6 year old children and a 5 month old baby in tow.   While I see the manager pull away in her sports car.   Never ever will I go here.   Please do yourself and anyone a favor.   There are a million places to eat in Henderson and the Vegas area.   Dont waste your money here.  They dont care about what they serve children.   Or how they treat you.   Unless your dog poop.
Weekend hours for this location suck big time ! 10-6 on Saturday and Sunday? Really CVS ? U can't afford to pay for 1 more shift for your pharmacy on the weekends? AND u don't have any signs in the drive thru so we could see where the concrete barrier ends so if u have a low riding sports car like I do u end up hitting the barrier because u CANT SEE where it ends !! Otherwise the staff is awesome, just pissed about the hours and damage to my car !
Been here a few times previously.  As the other reviews mentioned, the pho sucked (thick flat rice noodles, crappy broth, etc).  No love for Xe Lua unfortunately.
Worst experience of my life staying at a hotel in Vegas. We come out here at least once a year for my son's soccer tournament and this is the 1st time at the flamingo. I checked in and my room wasn't even clean, my bathroom had feces in it (from the person before), the cleaning staff was late everyday to clean our room, the valet was full so we were forced to park on a side street..:: This is the most horribly managed hotel in Las Vegas. Don't stay here!!!
Stay far far far away!!!!!! They card 60 year old people with gray hair and kick them out because they don't know if they are 21....... but yet they took our money at the bar after we spent 300+ dollars in their bar. If I could give zero stars I would. do not waste your money!!!!
My husband and I showed up for an early dinner late lunch.  Prices seemed reasonable & there wasn't but a few other people in the restaurant. We order our meals: 1/2 a rack of Baby back ribs with fries and "fresh steamed" vegetables for him, and the Gilley's chopped salad with chicken for me. My husband also orders a beer. The waitress brings the beer after 3 or so minutes, he asks for a glass and she just leaves. A few minutes later she comes with the glass almost pissed he asked for it!  When our meals come out, his 1/2 rack are dry & looks like it came from a pot bellied pig, his fries are COLD and his vegetables are soggy. My salad is drenched in dressing, lettuce is soggy, chicken is dry and it's just a mess.  To top all of this off, our waitress continued to be very curt and short with us and our bill was $45! We just paid our bill and got the hell outta there. This town is too big with too many other restaurants with people who enjoy their jobs.  Kinda sad, we were hopeful for this place.
Went in with the hubby and the kids. We have 4 kids, 2 in high chairs so the 5 min wait was no problem. What was a problem was that the minute I sat down, one of the benches in the front ripped a hole in my previously perfectly fine $50 jeans. I told the hostess who seemed not very concerned and apparently the manager wasn't told as I requested.... After being seated, it took several minutes to get a server, including water to go with the too spicy salsa and beans. We ended up getting several appetizers because of the happy hour special. We had the nachos, mini- chimis, the hatch chili cheese crisp, and the queso dip. Our server seemed very inattentive and not at all helpful. He was not overly friendly, could not keep up with water, and forgot the side of beans we requested for our little ones. ( which means we had to go home and feed them because eventually we just said forget it!) All of the food was mediocre and was barely worth the half off happy hour price. The hatch chili cheese crisp was even too spicy for the hubby who likes spicy food. The chimis were ok, the jalapeño cream was too thick. The queso was hot, although it tasted like it came out if a can. The nachos were plentiful, but seemed like the beef was not good quality. Overall with the hole in my jeans, the bad, inattentive service, and the mediocre, too-spicy food, we will not be back. I would not recommend this Mexican restaurant. If you want good service, good quality, and good prices, go to Manuel's about 2-3 miles East on McDowell.
Worst fitness place EVER! Gyms are much better so stay far away from this unhealthy way to get fit.  You will not have proper form and therefore it WILL result  in injury.  The trainers there are not professional and don't know how to guide you. PLEASE save yourself the time and money and go to a gym. Also, when you go to cancel they will CHARGE your card for months and months after. I cancelled over 6 months ago, have contacted my credit card company changed my credit card number and they STILL are charging me. I call monthly to cancel and have gone in to cancel. They conveniently did not have cancellation forms when I came in and have called monthly since. BUYER BEWARE. I have had the worst experience, the management is very unprofessional, unclassy, rude and disgusting.
We we there Saturday night with another couple. Food was very good so no complaints there. Service was terrible, they could not wait to turn over the table. Waiter stood against the wall glaring at us. Salad plates, bread plates were removed from table immediately upon finishing. We were not asked if we wanted another drink or if we wanted dessert. Waiter grimaced when we ordered dessert. It was not a relaxing , enjoyable evening. Will not return.
Service-Brand disconnect @Biltmore. Others have commented on the beauty and layout of this store, it's true: very nice. But recent experience not so great. Went in to buy a beautiful Chan Luu scarf in orange I saw a week ago. Couldn't stop thinking about it: a good sign I should buy it. It was gone. Seeing my disappointment, the sales woman offered to get it from another store. Perfect. She took me back to the "behind the wall" scruffy service area (wow, Saks, might need a paint job back there if you intend customers to see it), and proceeded to take my address info and credit card. At the end of the transaction, I asked her if she was sure she ordered the orange scarf. She assured me yes, although could not show me on the order that it was indeed the orange one. "Well, it has to be the one they call 'melon.' There really was no other option." Hmmm. Then, I noticed a $15 "ground" charge. This was a shock. "I'm paying $15 in shipping?" I asked. "Yes, unless you use your Saks card, you pay shipping." A) You've got to be kidding me, I would have gone down to Scottsdale Fashion Mall myself. B) You assess this charge without even letting a customer know that would be the case? C) $15 to ship a wispy scarf?  Not your best, Saks. Definitely a brand disconnect from a customer experience view.
$30 to get in the old *ss place?!! Not worth it or even my $25 cab ride to get here! It opened it 1969 and it feels like it's still stuck in 1969! Maybe they should redevelop this spot into a car garage....
I worked here as a nurse and am amazed that this facility is still licensed. 1- the nursing staff is largely incompetent. In December a simple test on medications was administered to the LPNs & RNs - of the 100+ nursing staff who took the exam, less than 5 passed on the first try. 2. Ive witnessed patients fall and injure themselves and the nursing staff lie about the incidents. Falls are underreported so that the facility's reporting metrics look good.  3. The nurses pull medications for 7-10patients at a time so that they can administer meds more efficiently. This practice is highly unsafe and has resulted in many patients receiving the wrong medications. Again, serious incidents that go unreported4. There's a patient holding room known as 'respiratory holding' that has no restroom or call light for patients to use. This 'room' is NOT a licensed bed, yet patients are often placed here until actual patient rooms become available5. Since 12/14 Ive known of over 10 patients who acquired infections while at Harmon. Infections ranging from influenza, pneumonia, MRSA and C. Diff. This is likely do the poor infection control procedures. Physicians and nursing staff are often seen in & out of isolation rooms without the proper protective equipment. Additionally, equipment such as glucometers (used to check blood glucose levels) are often placed on patients' beds and tables and rarely cleansed from taken from room to room - a huge source of transmission for hospital acquired infections6. The nurse /patient ratio has been as bad as 10 patients to one nurse. This is highly unsafe and results in nurses taking shortcuts to provide care. Patients arent regularly assed by nurses or physicians. Patients complain often about Dr. Tu as her bedside manner is poor, as well as her diction. Harmon hires a lot of foreign trained medical staff and the language barriers are often the source of many patient complaints.     7. Nurses falsify documentation regarding care the care they've allegedly rendered. Ive witnessed this each day I worked at this facility. Complaints to administration falls on deaf ears, as many of the charge nurses are largely inexperienced and incompetent. The culture at this facility is one that shames and punishes staff who report unsafe and dangerous conditions. 8. When it rains the water leaks from the ceiling and in some of the rooms you can see and smell mold. 9. Patients develop pressure ulcers because they arent being repositioned as often as they should and as often as nurses document. 10. On several occasions I witnesses rapid responses and code blues, that resulted in patient deaths, largely because: the staff on the Rapid Response Team (RRT) had no idea they were on the team and so they didnt respond and because no one could locate a crash cart. 11. Harmon outsources its physical therapy department thru a company called Relliant. The therapist are great, but the nursing staff leaves much to be desired12. The administrators and physicians are verbally and sometimes physically abusive with staff. This culture makes it impossible for the nursing staff to feel comfortable voicing safety concerns13. A nurse was once fired because he thought it was ok to reuse the same needle on different patients. This was likely not reported by administration because it wouldve availed them to CMS and state investigations, as well as potential litigation from affected patients. Ive reported all incidents where I was mandated to do so. But what happens is patients and their family members rarely complain and when they do, they complain in-house and those complaints fall on deaf ears. As you read other reviews on this facility you'll hear of the unfortunate situations where a patient came to Harmon for rehab, but left in a body bag. I wish more families asked more questions and requested autopsies for family members who die in facilities such as this. Complaints about nursing care and physicians should be made to the hospital administration AND the appropriate investigatory agency. If patients and family members dont report these egregious acts then facilities such as Harmon will be allowed to remain open and your loved one will continue to sustain injuries or death
Tried to rip me off!!!!!!! Told me I needed new rotors and new brakes! $370 total. Took a blow hearing that. Called brakes plus down the street, told me that could be done for $275. Dropped it off at Brakes Plus just to find out I don't need those things, only my rotors to be resurfaced. AND there was a customer in Brakes Plus getting a second opinion after being told the same thing from Fletcher!! $120 total. $250 in savings. Thanks for nothing Fletcher's!
Reserved a room for our daughters volleyball tournament.  3 weeks before tournament she was injured so we could not attend.  When we tried to cancel we were informed that because we (unknowingly) reserved under the "advanced purchase" section that we could not be refunded!  BULL!!  We have been traveling with clubs over the past 5 years and sometimes things like injuries with the girls happens and families have to cancel.  Every other hotel we have heard of let the families get a full refund.  Sometimes with a little persuasion, but still they were refunded.  Hyatt House refused and would not even offer a partial refund.  BAD customer service.  They have the authority to refund customers if needed.  Will never recommend this hotel to ALL of the clubs we know of that travel to Phoenix for the yearly Volleyball festival.  They don't even deserve 1 star.
First time here and it will definitely be my last.  Service was terrible, food was bland which was surprising because the salsa was so hot you couldn't eat it.  Only one coors light in the resturant and it was warm.  Nothing good to say about this place. Very disappointed.
My wife, son and mother go in at 8:30 on a Sunday evening to bring back custard to our home. Clearly the worker was ready to go home. Three blendini's and two other items were ordered. When the blendini's were handed out, they were HALF full! When questioned, the worker simply said, "We fill them to the top and they settle." No solution was offered. Are you freaking kidding me!?!? That's the biggest crock of crap I've ever heard. $25 spent for 5 items and 3 of them were half full! Absolute BS!!! Dairy Queen will sell you a large blizzard that's full to the top and cheaper than that. I will NEVER go back and I will NEVER send my kids or family there again. Awful!!! Wish there was a no-star option to pick.
I would definitely not return to this restaurant.  We ate here for a work day lunch recently and regretted our choice.  I had the hibachi shrimp, and my husband had the hibachi chicken.  Neither of us liked our food.  The hibachi flavor just wasn't good.  Additionally, all of our food smelled and tasted like it had been cooked on a grill with oil that was old.  Like if you were to stir fry some food and then stir fry again in the same oil another 50 times.  It simply did not taste good or fresh at all.  With regard to the shrimp sauce, it tasted fine.  However, it was room temperature, leading me to believe it had been sitting out for some time.  If it had been either hot or cold I would have felt better about it!And another note on temperature:  the day of our visit was an unusually warm December day, and the temperature in the restaurant was so hot and muggy that we were totally sweaty by the time we left.....not a good way to return to the office for the afternoon.  Yes, it was an unusually warm day.  But it did not appear that the restaurant had turned any air on at all.  We arrived early - around 11:45, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food.  By 12:15, however, the line snaked through the entire restaurant, and we saw several patrons who had been waiting at least 15 minutes for their food.  Given the long line, it makes me wonder if most people like their food more than I do.  I'm more inclined to think it's simply because there are many businesses in that area contributing to the lunch crowds, and not enough restaurants......every restaurant in the area seems to be packed at lunch hour.Wish I could give a better review, but it just wasn't good.
I was really craving Pho and nothing was open, so my boyfriend suggested we check out Bobby Chao's in Edgemont, since it's super close. Seems like there are two separate restaurants, one for Chinese Food/Dim Sum, and one for Vietnamese/Pho. Slightly confusing, especially as we walked into the Viet side and were told to go to the other side, as it was closed. Walking in on the other side felt completely awkward. Everyone was staring at us like we didn't belong there, and nobody acknowledged our presence. We wanted to order to-go, but the menus were all in Chinese. A lady working at the till gave us another, which we then proceeded to order from. She kept cutting us off, and just being pretty rude in general when we inquired about a certain dish.  I was getting frustrated at their attitudes and was pretty 'hangry' at that point, and I guess I looked annoyed because that was when she started being nice, apologizing that she couldn't understand us. We finished ordering and waited, after taking home our food we were really disappointed. I know this isn't a Vietnamese place, but don't advertise it if you cant do it properly. And it's pretty hard to screw up Pho! Never again.
Fraudulent. Handy seems great. It was great. Until they removed their phone number from their app and the internet and started billing me for cleanings that I DID NOT BOOK OR RECEIVE. When you cancel the returning service they will still bill you and there is no way to contact them. They stopped responding to my emails by the way. I have wasted so much time with my credit card company about being repeatedly charged for services and they wont respond to my emails. The BBB and federal government needs to be involved in stopping this
$14 for a draft beer? Only reason I stopped was because we had walked all day. I know the strip can be pricey but come on!!
I went there for a nice style with layers.  The stylist chopped it up like crazy.  All I can do is where a hat until it grows out.
Before writing this review I went to the front desk and tried to explain my dissapointment and was completly brushed off. The night we checked in the room rate given over the phone through reservations was higher than what I was quoted - the front desk would not accept it ($9 difference) the Expedia rate (more than a 50% difference) and still the gentleman would not match or discount the room rate even after seeing what I had pulled up. When I checked out I was not asked how my stay was so I vocalized my disappointment with the lack of service I received the night before and all I got was "oh ok I will let him know" I was shocked! No discount no apology Nada! I then requested the managers name and contact info and she replied "that's me" as she wrote her name and email on a card. Locals, find another hotel that value you as a customer - this by far was the worst experience ever at any hotel in Vegas that I've ever come across. Shame on you South Point for not appreciating business from the locals!
Food was watered down and bland. Got it delivered. They charge 5.00s for delivery. Tip driver 10% and still wasn't happy with my tip. Asked for more. Bad service.
CAlled in advance to check time of karaoke.  Left a beautiful bar at the Cosmopolitan to get my karaoke on and get there to have them shut down a half hour in after ordering drinks.  When I asked to speak to manager about being given wrong info for times, he was dismissive and didn't even offer to complete our drinks we had just ordered.
There steak fajitas was horrible , beer and beverage size not worth what they charge you real disappointed with them
Food is okay, service isn't so great. I ordered a 5 course meal and left still hungry.  In addition, my bill was $105 total and still hungry.  Waitress forgot about me so after waiting nearly an hour to pay, I had to walk my money up to the kitchen door to finish paying/transaction.  Waffle House service at a premium price.
Wanted some good Chinese food read the reviews and decided I would try it...This is literally the worst Chinese I've ever had.  I ordered the pineapple chicken and it has no flavor, it's sitting in a "sauce" I guess and the sauce is like oily water. I also ordered the fried rice, it too has no flavor. I typically would finish a meal because i spent my money on it, but I took a few bites and threw it away. Still after just a few bites, I feel sick to my stomach. Pretty upset that I wasted my money, should have just went to Pei Wei.
Meat here are rough and not at all tender. Dduk bok ki is not at all Korean style. Taste weird and the color definitely doesn't look right. Yook gae jang, however was surprisingly good. Would I go here again?? Absolutely not. Never! Time to find a different Korean BBQ restaurant.
Food was absolutely horrible - the worst meal of any kind my husband and I have ever eaten.  A frozen dinner is better.
Proceed with caution: the lack of police/security presence and the abundance of pan handlers outside the casino creates a very uncomfortable and unsafe environment. The casino used to keep it under control. It's is very scary entering & exiting at night. I love the fact that I usually leave a winner. However, my safety is not worth the money.
TL;DR - Rent somewhere else if you don't want management/maintenance barge in your home every so often or have nowhere to park, or do not like seeing dog poop everywhere, or hate having trains passing by every 15 minI liked the property, but hated the location, management, maintenance, etc.First thing first, the apartments are really nice, roomy, and cozy-feeling. If it were at any other location managed by someone else, I would pay double the rent to live there.Now, the horrible experiences. I have never lived anywhere where the management/maintenance need to get into your apartment so much. Almost every month, there's some sort of inspection, replacement, remodeling that they needed to do so they need to come in, and this is especially inconvenient if you have pets. Once they came in to remodel the apartment to make it more energy efficient so electric cost less. After they did the whole thing, our next electric bill was about $40 more expensive than previous ones and stayed that way.. They are also very poor at handling scheduling things. They needed to fill some holes in the drive way, but for almost a year, and an entire summer break, they didn't do anything about it. Until the fall semester started, they told everyone that they would be shutting off parking lots to redo the roads, which worsens the already horrible parking situation. They also often shuts certain parking spaces down for repainting, etc during school session instead of breaks when most people are gone.Speaking of parking, the parking situation is horrifying. Each building complex houses at least 6 people, while only 4 parking spaces in front of each building, which creates a space shortage. What made it worse was people kept inviting there parents/friends over and park at resident parking, and the management kept telling us that they would tow those cars but never did. Some days we couldn't find parking at all near our building. Now onto the trains. They trains go through about every 15 minutes and they honk very loudly, which is required by law. The walls are so thin, that you'd have to pause and wait for the trains to pass if you're watching tv, listening to a lecture, having a conversation, etc. and you'd have to do this a few times every hour. And if you're ever so unlucky to be walking outside when the trains pass by, R.I.P., your ears. I had no problem sleeping through the trains, but if you're a light sleeper, rent somewhere else cuz the trains don't stop at night.People walk their dogs outside, the dogs poop outside, people don't pick them up, which is not news. Management kept sending out emails telling people that they were going to take actions if they didn't pick up the poop, but they never did anything. There're dog droppings everywhere.We had a flea problem in the apartment when we first moved in because they apparently didn't clean after the previous renter moved out. The entire place smelled like wet dog for months after we moved in. We contacted the management several times to report the flea problem but nobody did anything, so we had to take it into our own hands. Several months later, they checked in to see if there still were a flea problem, and that was it.After we moved out, they charged us a couch replacement fee, which we expected because our cat scratched the thing pretty bad. However, the fee charged was $520 total for a really cheaply made couch. If it weren't for the cat, we'd still be charged for it because the leather on the couch chipped off just from people regularly sitting on it - That's how cheaply made the couch was, and totally not worth $520. We bought a couch 2 months ago for $180 at IKEA and it's 10 times better than that piece of junk that they provided. Also, when we leased with the cats, we paid a $500 "pet fee". It was never stated what the fee was for, so we just assumed that it was pet deposit that would be used to cover damage caused by the pets. We contacted them when we received the couch replacement charges and they said the pet fee is not a deposit and is not used for replacement charges.Edit 8/16/17: Almost forgot about their internet - SO SLOW. We got our own internet service less than a month after we moved in. Totally forgot that they provided internet when I wrote this review
I used to love this place, I am wondering if it has been taken over by new management...  I order three entrees. I received two both with the wrong sides and one cooked wrong. Sent it back recooked wrong again asked if the would take off the side that I never received they argued then finally did it.  I am really hoping this is just an off night for them but if I am going home hungry they get one star.
We were so excited that Tia Rosa was opening in Chandler after eating so many times at the Tia Rosa in Mesa while we lived there for 9 years. While the decor is minimally like the Mesa one, the food is far from it. I was so disappointed with my Chicken Mole, it looked like gelatin on the top (skin of the mole sauce). My husband had the red beef burro that had no red sauce and we barley made it home in time for him to get to the restroom. The food took 5 minutes to get to our table after ordering. I have always graciously waited for the fresh cooking of Tia Rosa in Mesa, of course it will take some time it is freshly cooked and made. 5 minutes? I should have known right there. Go to the one in Mesa if you are wanting the real Tia Rosa. So sad too this was my birthday dinner. Oh husband asked me to add that the beer was warmer than the food.
If your sign says open 24 hours, but you consistently cannot sell food because you shut down all registers at 5am, TURN OFF YOUR DRIVE THRU LIGHTS. it's bullshit to drive up and then get an excuse that you do not have a single functioning register.
Where do I begin. The restaurant was clean as expected given it was their 2nd or 3rd day open. The decor is lackluster and boring. It's feels like they tried to make it high end but completely missed the mark. Cheap Chinese take out menus really throw off the experience from the get go as well. Not a place to bring a date lolSitting at the bar made things rather difficult to get a servers attention, which made ordering a hassle. The menu had like 6 food items from the kitchen and the rest was alcohol. You should study up on kinds of sushi before going in or you'll spend your 45mins trying to figure out what they have. ( yep there was a 45min limit...)The quality of fish is pretty bad, even for ayce standards. The portions were too small and by the time the item I wanted got around to me, they were all gone. ( sit on the right side of the restaurant if you don't want to leave hungry)If you want good AYCE sushi go to Yama or Kaya. If you want good conveyor belt sushi go to Sapporo. I'll try them again later this week or the following to see if they got any better. Until then, 2 stars at bestQuick update: something did not sit well with me... 1 star
My wife and I went there for our anniversary.  Right after we were seated, someone came over to confirm our names.  (My father had called them to buy us a bottle of wine.)  The waiter knew this, but did not mention it until after we had both ordered very expensive cocktails.  Once we had these and had taken a sip, then he proudly announced the wine gift.  What a dick!  We would never have ordered the cocktails if we had know that we were being bought a bottle of wine!  Then the food was no way near worth the price.  Will never go back, bad move Dresslers..
The customer service at this location was a joke. I requested to speak with a manager and the manager was even more rude than the associate. I ultimately left and went to another location where I was treated fairly and like I was valued.
I was so excited to come in for dinner being that the last time i was in this location i had excellent service (it was also their first week open and a manager on every corner) well it was a 30 min wait which i dont mind. Im also in the restaurant business so i understand it gets busy it gets busy... I felt so disrespected when the hostess Aden called my child "THAT" she never apologize and she did it infront of other guests they all couldn't believe it.  Im writting this review hoping that management can enforce better customer service & so that the employess can have better choice of words.. Its not that hard. I will not be going back...Sincerly,A VERY dissapointed Applebees costumer.
HORRIBLE WAIT TIMES.  3rd visit and each time the wait has been 1 hour +!  Very inconsiderate!  Last time was a 2.5 hour wait.
The bagels I bought on a Monday morning at 6:30 were so hard I thought I would break my teeth on them. Maybe I'll stop another time to try again one day.
I got really sick eating there this week. I'm willing to bet they use MSG in their food. It's a shame because the staff and decor is really nice but I'm never going back there.
Very slow more conversations amongst them selves than with customers. This location use to be very people friendly, that was another time.
Customer service is deplorable, the employees are not responsive to the disabled person's needs, they don't pay attention to detail so many times have ordered the wrong eqipment.They don't return phone calls, and it can take 6-12 weeks for medical equipment that is needed today! We've waited that long for a battery, or a wheel, so that my husband, a quadriplegic is bedbound until it comes, leading to risks of skin breakdown, urinary tract infections, pneumona, blot clots. My husband is now in bed for 12 days because we can't get an extendable leg rest for his wheelchair. After 1 wk, they sent out a generic one. The customer service has a record of my husband's wheelchair and can easily see that the generic one won't work on his chair. When we finally got ahold of them, they say it will be 1-2 wks and there is no way to expedite this. Then, when is comes it could be another week before it's delivered. We have been stuck with these guys for 2 yrs, as it's the only provider our insurance will work with and every single thing we're ordered has taken 6-12 wks and then longer to have it delivered and/or installed. The last thing we needed was a new seat and back and ended up installing it ourselves after waiting 3 mos for it.
This honestly was not the best. We are from out of town and there isn't much to eat but this place. The steaks are waay over priced, especially for not even being that good. And what restaurant serves steaks with green beans and a lettuce leaf and tomato slice Not recommended, and probably not going again.
Totally ovarated, nice ambiance. But food is not good. Spaghetti carbonara were soaking in sauce, very salty. That was my second time, won't go back. Out of 7 of us, only one was ok with quality of the food. Zach Bruell has to rethink his cuisine. Very disappointed
This place is bad! The masseuse do not listen. I have "enhancements" to my massage and they forget to do them! I complain and the managers don't care. They get you into a contract and they know you can't quit. I hate coming here.
I always had good memories from this store. I bought many hats, boots and coats. Just now I was there, the owner, she was not treating me well. Never will go again.
i went there sun. for the first time. wasnt worth the $8 at all. i ordered the manhattan. too many onions, not enough spread, meat wasnt that good, bread is port of subs bread.
AVOID THIS PLACE...I went to this salon to get my legs waxed and I have never ever had such a horrible experience in my life. The waxing is done on the second floor and once I got to the second floor it was DISGUSTING; it looked like it has never been cleaned in years. There was hair in the sink and all over the floor; no tissues, no soap. The lady who is doing my waxing is talking to a another co-worker in their language which i thought was highly unprofessional. To make matters worse, I got such bad rashes on my legs which I have never gotten when I go to other salons. this place is not hygienic at all and the guy at the front desk (am guessing owner???) is just money hungry and doesn't really care about providing good customer service. I will never be going to this salon again.
They just keep making this place worse. Now TSA checkpoint A is a narrow (extremely narrow) hallway that has absolutely no utility, except to bypass a larger screening area where TSA agents just stand around and do nothing. While the vast majority of passengers are sent down the narrow corridor of hell. Really great job Cleveland!
I hate this walmart! It is so messy and unorganized, and just looks so ghetto! The employees are weird too! I dont recomend you going here! Targets right across the street and its 100 times better!
Worst place ever! Warning ! Do not buy here! Bought a sofa here because my wife wanted to shop and support  small business,  3 months later springs started to pop out and poke. My wife called and Jacky made her cry she was very rude so I called, she was very nice to me. Told me to send pictures thru email so I did months passed and finally she asked me to call the insurance wich I did and they only cover fabric when we bought the sofa she said it would cover any problems with the sofa..lieafter that they didn't return my emails finally they asked me to come in and bring the pillows and that tgey would exchange them, the problem was that iyt wasn't the pillows  but the couch.. again they didn't answer my emails when finally I found jacky and she said they had sent me an email and that they would help me..she passed the phone over to her boss and he said he wasn't going to help me I bought a cheap couch and basically to deal with it $600 for a small couch, well that should teach usNever again.
Friend and I were literally the only two people there. Sat there for 30 minutes and no server came up to me. They were just chilling behind the bar. When we finally decided to go somewhere else we got up and I saw one of the servers sitting at a table smoking looking at us. You would think they'd at least try to give some customer service as we were the only two patrons. Clearly their business is dying.
Stayed at the Palazzoo so this was one of the places in the hotel itself. Walking by in the morning, we decided to stop by after dinner for some desert. Came in at 10.30pm and saw the amazing array of treats. My wife sampled 2 and decided while son was still deciding. I asked for a sample and was ready to order when I saw creme brule flavor and asked her for another sample. The tired looking, rude lady that was working (this is on Apr 12 Saturday 2015 if the managers care about customer care), rudely said only 2 samples per person. I said ok so I need a sample of the creme brule. She rudely said sorry no more. I walked out of there. She saw that most of my family was ready to order and only I was the one still deciding, but she still was so rude. Not recommended at all.
I'm so disappointed with Brake Masters. Makes me think of all the times I trusted them with my car how much stuff I paid for that I didn't really need and may have not even been replaced. I arrived on Wednesday to have my front brakes replaced since my warranty is through their company. The guy comes out with a 450$ list of items, and also told me that I had not had my brakes done in over a year. Which is a lie as I have all my reciepts. He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven't been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off. Now it's Friday i took my car to Honda for inspection. An hour later I'm taken inside shop for them to show me concerns with my car...caliber needed to be greased not replaced nothing wrong with rotors shiny and clean as if they had been taken out of box....brakes needed to be replaced..duuhi knew that thats why i took it in to ger warranty honoredas i have been doing for past 3yrs or so. I will never patronize another brake master as long as i live..you have suckered me out of more than enough money.Honda replaced brakes and replaced valve cover all for 175$. Such a weaked world we live in with so many dishonest people.. Shame on you brake masters...
So my wife and went to your establishment tonight and had a great time till we got our bill.... when we asked for our tab our bartender snapped at us and gave us so much attitude that I will never come here again... she got mad because she heard us talking about our tab, the only reason we talked about it was because we had 2 creepy guys follow us from 3 different bars, trying to order drinks on our tab so we wanted to make sure their drinks were not on our tab... needless to say this girl blew up on us for no reason, getting mad because we only ordered 3 drinks,it was 1:30 in the morning by the way.....so  we wanted to make sure our tab was right, I work in a high pace bar in North scottsdale called the village tavern and if I acted like that and treated a guest in this manner I would have been fired... I felt so disrespected in this place I will never go back, nor in courage others to go there.. don't come to this place the bartenders aweful
Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible. The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business.
The Absolute worst store!!!!!!! This is the 3rd time that they have screwed up my order and have done nothing about it. This time was really bad. I did an online order, clearly spelled out with what I wanted. Salad and smoothie. I sent my receptionist to pick up and she came back with a smoothie only and it was the wrong smoothie. I called in and let them know. The guy Billy that picked up was to say the least an idiot. He had no idea how to handle it and blamed it on me and the online order. I was charged twice for this and got nothing that I actually ordered and no food. So I paid $32 for a smoothie that tasted like crap. It was made poorly and had to be thrown out. It was that badly prepared. When I called back in the other guy was rude and had no idea how to seal with it and said a manager would have to call me after 3:00 because they did not know how to refund or do anything for that matter. I normally go to this location during the summer for breakfast and I can honestly say you have list my business over this. I will never go this Tropical smoothie again. I will travel down the way to Jamba Juice, they do not mess up my orders. My opinion is the 2 guys there need to be fired, they really do suck!
The worst hotel experience I've EVER had on the strip. I am a local and was looking for a place to take my nephew, that had a great pool, for a little staycation. First, when we walked into our room all lights were unplugged and we had find our way in the dark. Then we noticed a poorly patched up hole in the wall, all the furniture was dusty and old, the bathroom was very outdated with scratched, peeling cabinets and the sink didn't even drain. Because we were only there for a quick night, we chalked it up to being an old hotel. But then, the next morning, we found bed bugs in our bed. When we called the front desk and it took four phone calls and an hour and half wait time for he security guard to come to our room to make a report. After the report, we had to go down stairs where we were rudely helped by the front desk and then had to wait another hour to speak to the manager.  The manger was nice, but couldn't help us, all he did was give us a card of another manager and told him to contact him in a couple days. We spent the rest of the day in the pool, which was very small and crowded for families as they have cut off 3/4 of their pool (the main reason we chose the Flamingo) to accommodate their go-pool (adults only) which I can understand, it is vegas, but they took away their lounge chairs around the slide pool (where my kids wanted to spend all of their time) so we had to sit on the hot concrete. Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel, I will NEVER stay at the flamingo again or even visit it.
My husband and I were to another MedExpress location a week ago for cough, congestion, and fever.  Neither of us were feeling much improved today, and went to this location, as it is closer for us, to see what else could be done.  They seemed dumbfounded as to why we were both sick, and sent my husband on his way with Flonase, and me with Flonase and a bronchial inhaler commonly prescribed for asthma, which I do NOT have.  Dr. Demko literally told me she didn't know why I was still coughing...that the medications I received the week before should have "fixed it".  The other location (Washington) had done a chest X-ray on my husband, and a nebulizer treatment, yet missed the fact he has pneumonia.  This was discovered only after we went directly from MedExpress to another healthcare provider.  That provider concurred with MedExpress on our need for the Flonase for the nasal congestion and drip, but could not understand HOW they missed his pneumonia or did not do ANY testing on me whatsoever.
Went here with the office for our annual party and I expected decent food. We went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. From the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set,made and served.  I tried the Italian Greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it.I twitted about it and was asked to DM so that they could speak to the management about it.After about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which I have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance I have been in.They started to serve the Palenta fries which was shared between everyone.  It was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from Loblaws.The second starter they served was the pizza.  The crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever.  So... needless to stay, I just ate the crust.The third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  For an Italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  Next served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer.  These 2 I believe was the only ones I was able to eat with no problem although I think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the Pizza.The mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok.  It seemed fresh and was nice.For the main, I chose the Fettucine, which came with Shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce.I won't hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, I was hoping to be blown away.  The pasta was WAY overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off.  I think that I would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a Loblaws. I could not, for the love of God eat more than a bite full of this "italian pasta".The Chef's selection of deserts however was good.  I think aside from the deserts, decor and the people I was with, nothing else was good.  At the end of the night, I had to go grab dinner at Sushi Inn just so that I could have a proper Dinner.Unfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends.  I would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons.Food Score:Palenta Fries: 2/5Pizza: 0.5/5Polpettine/Mini Meatballs: 0/5Arancini/Risotto Balls: 1/5Shrimp Diavola: 2/5Salad: 3/5Caprese/Cheese&mozarella: 2/5Funghi/Mushrooms: 3/5Fettucine: 0/5
Rom S.will be nice to know her name, most of the mortgage co. are good, the problem is alway an incompetent agent. I bet you in the same company may be more than one   profetional agent.
Total failure. Reserved car a month out for Fountain Hills art festival guests, and Hertz on day of reservation has no cars.  They claim they have no idea when they will have cars, and advised we go to airport for pickup. Enterprise was able to accommodate. Avoid this place.
SO disappointed in this Benihana. My daughter wanted to go to a Japanese hibachi restaurant for her 16th birthday, so I made reservations for 7pm on the Benihana website. We showed up at our reserved time only to be told that our table wasn't ready quite yet. 15 minutes later I ask the assistant manager when we will be seated and his reply was "Well, I have to be honest with you - There are three other groups with a 7pm reservation ahead of you. Table availability depends on how many chefs we have here tonight." After 30 minutes of waiting and seeing only 1 of the 'reservation' groups ahead of us get seated, we bailed out. The term 'reservation' apparently means nothing to this place and I will never go back.
I have been to pretty much all the restaurants in Toronto and this is probably the worst (how ironic) one with the poorest customer services. We had a large party for reservation at 7:00pm and I arrived at 7:30pm (bad traffic on a Friday) and was denied entrance by a bouncer:" we are at capacity.". After lining up for 15 minutes and I saw people walking out, I asked again, and yet was denied again :"sorry you are only allowed 30 min grace period from your reservation even thought the other 19 ppl are all seated." Now it is 8:20pm and I am still waiting. If I could, I would have avoided at all causes. You have a choice, so do not go there as a large party especially you have ppl commuting!!!! Avoid at all causes.
Before I leave upper crust I needed to write this review... Ruben was very attentive.  The food on the other hand not so much.  Sausage, mushroom and cheese  calzone large.. very large, wish I could have tasted the sausage.  That didn't sound good.  Creme brûlée burnt sugar, the creme was soup vs solid.  The bottle of wine couldn't even make this meal work.
I waited at the speaker for at least 2 minutes before someone came on the speaker. I ordered my food. Carne Assad fries, no guacamole and sour cream. I pull around the bend and there was a grey Cadillac with a few people in it. They seemed to be friends with the drive thru person. They pull off within 15 seconds. I get to the window. It took at least 4 minutes before the guy came to the window to inform me, he put guac on my fries. Meanwhile in my car, I can hear a female and other employees laughing and having a good time. My problem is, if they weren't jacking around; they could have got my food right and not have me waiting in drive thru for 10-15 minutes. This isn't the first time. I work in this business, I know exactly how long it takes fries and meat to cook. Horse play is great but not at the expense of a customer.
Was the fastest manicure I have ever had. My cuticles were cut too short and are now taking a while to heal. All of my nail polish peeled off by the next day. Will absolutely not return.
absolutely horrible. am I allowed to give this -15 stars? terrible service, terrible food, terrible wait time. all in all a terrible place. don't go here!
They will never, ever get your order right, and will argue with you about it and make you show receipts to prove you didnt get what you ordered. However, it is the best fast food that you can pick up early in the morning, so you just have to decide if its worth the trouble. PS: If you want a hamburger, get the natural one-- the patties on the other burgers are absolutely disgusting, but the natural burger is actually pretty good. Good luck!!Update: went back again today, the employee taking my order was irritated at how many times i asked her to repeat my order back to me, yet it STILL came out wrong. There is just something wrong with the way they do things. It's slow and always incorrect.Update 2: after a month or two of not going at all, because the food was starting to make my family sick, we gave it another shot (don't ask me why, lol) and the orders were all wrong, as always, and it made us all sick again. This restaurant should be avoided at all costs.
Do NOT eat here. The food made me violently ill. I should have known it was a red flag when I saw employees sleeping in the booths in the back of the restaurant, very unprofessional... But the price was right. Anyways I was poisoned for 24 hrs. Muscle pains. Cold sweats. Heavy vomiting and diarrhea. I can only imagine the other poor patrons who were eating there probably all got sick too.
I get not wanting to make an overwhelming smell for a customer but I couldnt smell anything at all. It was cool to try but they were more focused on trying to sell their $200 massage items that you can get for $50 on Amazon.
DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HEREIf only I had the option to give this place 0-star! This place reached out to me when they came across my resume online. I was hoping to find a professional job out of state and was asked to come in for an interview.Met with Sherry who displayed very little professionalism! Red flag signs throughout the interview as she indicated that the person who I was on the phone with was "let go" and interrupting me as I explained my current job position to comment that the insurance industry that I work in is such a terrible industry. Irrelevant comments/opinions that she did not need to share with me! So unprofessional! She said she would communicate with me during the process and reach out to other offices to help find me a job in my desired state. I had not heard from her for about 2 weeks and no response after I sent a followup email. The degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here.I'm guessing this place must have high turnover rates. And also heard that appleone is the lowest in the tiers of recruiting agencies. Wish I knew that before wasting my time with them! Word of advice, avoid this place as there are much better recruiting agencies out there.
It's always dead at this location for some reason. I never ever see anyone here when I drive by. They got rid of one of the soda machines in here for some reason and the staff is beyond minimal. Very rare I come to this Arby's but I really wanted a Beef N' Cheddar lol
Needs better management. Only waited 30 minutes. Cold Tacos.Bathroom very dirty. Don't remove my post. This is the truth. Other people have put bad reviews and you guys take them down. How long has that meat been setting out. Over night but you guys still sell it. How long has the beans been setting there more then 2 hours. The health department should close this place down.You guys are totally gross you guys never wear gloves. And what about the hair in my rice Bowl. The guacamole taste like avocado all of your food has no taste. I nominate this place as the worses Mexican place to eat in Vegas!!!!!!!
Watch out at the Del Mar Lounge inside... the spineless bartenders allow the local drunks to take over the bar. The drunks cleared the bar with their loud smelly who the heck cares vulgar stories.
Got a great deal on the set if tires I bought but I can not believe the level incompetence when I spoke with the mechanics. I came back to pick up my car and found the back latch to my car to be completely broken. The lock appeared to have been tampered with and was loose. I looked inside my car and the bolts appeared to have been loosened as if someone was looking at it. I went to ask one of the mechanics and all he said was I don't know what to tell ya...
Go to St. Louis wings all the time. Came to this location expecting the same amount of customer service. The waitress was extremely rude. Never had this experience of customer service. I've Been neglected before but never had this amount of personality come from a waitress. When asked the waitress about the specials that l I noticed outside, she flipped the menu open and said she doesn't know about those ones but the weekly specials in here. Just read it. When she brought our food out, we asked for the St. Louis special sauce, she was rude about it. Brought the bill out while I was still eating. Needed to pay with credit but never came back with the terminal. Fries and burger were both over cooked and dry. Left a really bad impression of St. Louis wings in general.
Went there because they say they can finance anyone. Filled out an application, waited around for 2 hrs, had to leave. They said they would be in touch. I have received no phone call or e mail and its been 2 weeks. I have left a message for the salesman as well as e mailed back twice. Still no callback. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!!!
Never use their valet parking service. They have towing service also. They will claim your car wouldn't start, tow it, then stick you with an additional $50 towing fee. They will then threaten to keep your car unless you pay the additional $50 towing fee. Can we say fraud and a scam. DOT and FAA take note.
Terrible!! We booked on hotels.com and upon arrival hotel charged us a mandatory "resort fee" of an add'l  $60. This was never stated during booking. Very shady business practice! The rooms were subpar and there were odors coming from the sinks. DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HOTEL AT ALL!!!!
Unorganized mess! You make an appointment, only to show up & wait a hour. Then wait another two hours to see them, and another hour to get the CD with all your photos. This was an all day event, and no fun! Pictures aren't the best, and for the price you pay, you might as well just hire a professional photographer for an hour! Not wasting my time or money here again. "No sitting fee" is correct, but the prints are 10 times more expensive then any other print you will buy elsewhere.
This has to do with the delivery trucks they contract Central Valley Auto Transports Drivers Suck!!! One almost hit a school bus on the highway this morning and cut me off in the process with my daughter in the car.  I know for a fact he saw us because he had his turn signal but we had cars all around us and he just cut us off anyways. I honked at him and he flipped us off.  He was dropping cars off for Enterprise Car Sales in Henderson NV.  We have pictures of license plates and video.  Hope Enterprise would address this matter with them.
Made a 9:30 appnt , it was confirmed, show up on time at 9:30 doors are locked , call them up and he ( Sam) says he will be there at 10. !!! WOW WHAT A CRAZY FIRST IMPRESSION!!! completely disrespectful of people's time !!!
This is the battle of the misinformed.  This store is in need of new management, that can hire people that know customer service.  I was directed to this Target, by another Target location(so I was a fan of Target for many years). I was told they had a Fitbit Surge on hold for me. They supposedly had 3 of them.   Another associate at another location called while I stood right beside her.  First I don't see an associate in electronics.  When I ring the bell, a kid tells me he will be with me in a few minutes.  He could have called someone else like the Target on Green Valley Parkway did.  Instead, I waited for him, only to find they were out of stock.  I was told to go to Guest Services.  They had a Fitbit for Brock, none for me.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  I won't beg any store to take my money.  I love shopping local, but in cases like this, I MUST shop with Amazon.com. I did just that, and saved money.  Target's slogan is expect more, pay less.  Yeah, right. Thank God for Amazon. I won't have to waste my gas or time shopping at Target ever again.
I'd love to support a local business but wow, what a mess here! Don't expect quality, tasty food, or for your order to be right. Don't expect it to be fast, and definitely expect to be charged extra per entree for your carry-out order. Portion sizes are pathetic. We will avoid cuco's waunakee location. Don't recommend at all.
This mall has a horrible selection and they have horrible mall management. The mall is so cheap they don't have the AC on during the summer and they have the heat blasting so high in the winter that you sweat no matter the season.
boo. messed up my order and had over-the-counter-static.
Like the rest of Vegas..overrated ...the fries were cold...and did not have the taste of duck fat!   The service was rushed...they want to get you out to get the next sucker in your table.   The Mac and cheese was yucky..the Caesar salad was overdressed....and the stake was very salty and near raw!   Skip this place!  Not worth the price!
I'm so upset.The first time I came here, I was super impressed with everything they did. I paid a pretty penny, but felt it was worth it with the results and customer service I had.Fast forward to about a month ago, I brought my car in. The guy I told what kinda wash I wanted was awkward and unsure how to talk to me which made me feel uncomfortable but I ignored it. He said, "It'll be ready by 5." It was 1:00 when I brought it in, I couldn't believe it would take four hours. I had stuff to do (I got married 3 days later). As I stayed in shock, I went in to the receptionist to pay. I asked her, "So he said it would be done by 5. If they are done sooner, will they call me and let me know?" She said "Absolutely!"So I try to kill time with what's around me since I'm car-less and walking around. Hours go by and it's 4:15. So I walk over and lo and behold my car is sitting in the parking lot, done. I ask a guy for the keys and as he hands me my keys, he notices some nasty rag sitting on my hood and tries to grab it quickly. I get in and notice the seats are dry-- my car has been done for a long while and no one called me.I'm so angry and hurt. I've been trying to find a car wash that I could take my car to regularly. I thought I found it but was left disappointed. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS!
Beware. DO NOT PICK THIS HOTEL!. The staff is very rude. We got a room that was not cleaned at all. The toilet wasn't cleaned, floors were sticky and dirty towels everywhere. A friend booked a room and they told him room wasn't available because of maintenance and every manager was in a meeting at that time and couldn't be bothered. Please pick a different hotel.
This is the worst company ever!!! Both times they have been to my house they have done more damage than repairs. NEVER use this company. Very unprofessional and inexperienced service men.
Usually I have no problems at this location but a sassy little Hispanic young lady with too much makeup on had nothing but attitude.
The work I received was really good. But have a breathing problem and am not to breath the fumes In the salon. I was also recovering from a broken leg and hip when in the salon. I asked the manager for a mask. Oh brother, you would have thought that I had asked for a million dollars. The rude response was unbelievable. I would have paid the 25 cents or so that it costs the shop for the mask. So I used my walker and returned to the car to get a used mask. Had my daughter not had her request to have a pedicure there for her Birthday, I would have left. I spent well over $100 and will never return.
Horrible. Horrible. Horrible experience. This has been my worst experience with a hotel in Vegas. Parking is $12 a day, I parked at the Venetian for free and walked about a mile, in through harrahs and in through the linq. It's worth it. The elevators in the parking structure at the flamingo are super slow and skip floors, it seems longer when the weather is 111. The lines are suuuuuuuper long and slow. The second night we stayed the power went out in the casino for 5 hours, we had no wifi but they still charged the resort fee for it. The outage caused the check in line to get backed up more than it already was, it was probably about a 2 hour wait just to check in. Hey at least they were handing out mini water bottles for the wait. We stayed in the " King studio" room, it was an older style room. Basic amenities, basic room, the air conditioner only cooled the living room area and kept the room warm. We upgraded to the "Mini Go Suite" TOTALLY WORTH the extra fee, you'll thank me for it. The only problem with the room was again, the air conditioner. We left the room around 4 PM and left it at a cool 65 degrees, we came back and it was 75 degrees! No one told me there was a sensor on it, and stopped pumping cool air once you left the room. I called the front desk, and it took about 2 hours to get a technician up to our room. Very nice guy, he bypassed the sensor so our air could keep cool. Our tv remote wasnt working, I requested a battery twice, it never came. Oh and let's not forget the fire alarm going off at 3 am and recieving a message on the loud speaker at 4 am indicating it was a false alarm. Lastly make sure you check your statement if you're using the kiosk, they over charged me for the wifi, which is included with the resort fee. They told my I had more than two devices logged in, which I didnt the only devices used was my phone and my boyfriends phone. I wanted to give the flamingo a shot, but I would never stay here again, choose the linq next door, the rooms are much nicer and the service is quick and easy.
The food is good the waitress was from Mexico and she makes you feel right at home even though it's a Japanese restaurant she is great my wife and I both think she was a great hostess
Longest line I've ever been to. People standing in line to get one stamp to mail a letter. They have two people working and 15 people in line. Do not come inside a post office unless it's absolutely necessary.
Rude Pharmacy Tech and the Pharmacist refused to fill my prescription because this was not my "usual" CVS. Tech was snotty about the fact I was there and their inventory was low. Despite having my medication in stock, they refused to fill it, saying that they would need to order it. I'm not kidding. They had it in stock and REFUSED to fill from stock.But because someone else who may, or may not, regularly filled their Rx there and might show up in the next few days, they wouldn't fill it. Another CVS is "expecting me" they said. Not caring that I was filling because I just got the script on my way out of town and didn't have time to drive 30 minutes back, wait, then leave town. Most unhelpful staff ever encountered. Zero customer focus.
Thought we'd try this theater on a trip back from Mesa. Sat for 40 minutes with audio--NO VIDEO!  Got up and went down the hall TWICE to tell management but they were too stupid to fix it.  "it's run by a computer....I sent a guy up there to look at it..." the manager said.  On the third trip to see management and hearing dumb excuses we asked for our money back.  Got our ticket prices refunded but were out $16.75 for popcorn and drinks..  They could care less that their customers were unhappy and that their equipment doesn't work.  We will never go back.  Bless you Dan Harkins for true movie experiences.  We are back to giving only you our attendance from now on!!
I'm not usually one to write bad reviews, I honestly don't often review things but I had to with this one. I used to come here often, every time I needed to go grocery shopping I went to this store. It used to be so much better. When they check you out the staff often doesn't even greet you, not even a "hello" or ask me if I want paper or plastic, they just go automatically for plastic. The produce sucks, nothing is fresh. Bought spoiled chicken the other day. If you need a refund or special help you'll stand at the counter for a good 10-15 minutes before they even acknowledge you. I just joked with my friend that they don't have bad customer service, they just don't service you. I go to Hyvee  now: friendly service, fresh produce. So much better.
Overpriced, rude staff, dishonest on giving you a fair price for your items. Talk behind your back in Spanish. News flash, lots of people know Spanish. Overall bad experience. Selection of clothes not good and all the toys way overpriced. Yard sales have more to offer and nicer people to deal with. The owner complained about me having a cat and was an overall downer. Save yourself the hassle just donate to friends or Craigslist used baby items.
Sad, uneventful food. Went for lunchtime on a Saturday and it was incredibly dead. Only plus is that my son and I didn't get food poisoning.
Bad service and overpriced mediocre food. Save your time and money and go to Jacob's or Barberian's instead
absolute garbage. 0 stars. flies crawling all over the slices. smells gross. pizza barely had any tomato sauce. pepperonis were like the ones from a lunchable. cheese is plastic crap. I'm royally PISSED off & papa ceo would be too!!!!!! gross!
I walked in Malee's and ordered takeout totaling $40 and waited about 15 minutes. When the server brought out my order, I asked to use my Groupon that I purchase a few months back. He said I can't use it for takeout and said he has the documents "to prove it" from Groupon.  Very defensive in front of customers in the restaurant! I drove 20 miles to get there and checked on the Groupon website and it said nothing about not for takeout. The server said the only way I can get the food is to pay full price. I said I want to use the Groupon and he could not care less. I also asked "is this what customer service is all about"? And "what is the difference between takeout and sitting in the restaurant"? He said with takeout you won't spend extra on your tab. After this heated discussion in the lobby, he said he did not care and he grabbed the bag of food and steamed to the back room. Now I'm out my original $20 I spent with Groupon, drove 40 miles, and had a very embarrassing experience in front of other patrons. I'm not so concerned about the money, but what terrible customer service for a potential new cutomer. I also used the "contact owner" e- mail on Malee's website to provide feedback about this. I never got a response for them. Guess this was no surprise if this is the way they want to treat their customers..
So my wife loves Swiss Chalet's rotisserie chicken and overall this restaurant has done that fairly well. The fries are often cold and dry but we order delivery through the app so that is almost understandable. Where my understanding stops however is right there. I'm a hot chicken kinda guy and almost every time they screw something up. I've had dark meat when I paid for white, I've had bread that was so hard and stale it felt like I came out of a toaster, I've had a bones in the chicken sandwich, I've gotten my order without gravy and a few other significant screw ups on a simple order. I have complained to corporate and they always refer it to the store where I get the usual apology and we'll offer you a complimentary meal next time you come in. Which we never have or intend to. Today though I thought I outsmarted them. I ordered a chicken pot pie. I know this shit is pre-cooked and frozen so they can't screw it up right? WRONG.This was delivered just like this photo shows and it smells like vomit. It must have soured or something because I couldn't stand the smell much longer than it took to take the picture. There's another Swiss Chalet closer to my house that is serviced by UberEats and I may give them a chance but I'm officially done with this one. If I could give zero stars I would.
Stay Far Away From This Place!!!!I have visited a couple of Urgent Cares in the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, but this was by far my worst experience.  I arrived and was seen rather quickly.  I was in a lot of pain, but thought that I was off to a wonderful start.  This all changed once the door opened.  The technician who took my vitals was very cold and aloof.  By the time that the nurse practitioner Pamela Pritchett arrived my blood pressure was through the roof, which it NEVER is.  Mrs. Pritchett walked into my room in a huff.  She slapped her computer on the table and rarely made eye contact with me.  She was very belittling and condescending.  Both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience.  I will never return, and cannot recommend this facility to anyone.  There are several other offices in the area that can least provide a shred of human decency and compassion!!!
We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  Horrible customer service.  If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!
I have nothing good to say about The inner sleeve. I am very disgusted and a little pissed off. I brought some records and a turntable in to see what they were worth and the person behind the counter said everything i had was very common and not worth anything accept for 2 records that  were worth 5 DOLLARS the rest was worthless. I agree that what i brought in were not great records but to say and do that is not nice or a fair price which is stated on there web site. The turntable was working accept the belt for the turntable was broken and the person said it would cost 30 DOLLARS to fix WTF!!! What is the belt made of special rubber !! That some special belt in conclusion i will not ever do business with this establish again and for those who do you are fools. I understand they are there to make money that's fine i am all for that but it is how you do it that makes you a good establishment what you said and did to me was not nice or fair. I did go to your all you can carry once and what a load of crap you had if it wasn't for the Montovani and Nana Mouskouri records you would have had very little to offer.The record i brought in will be amongst next years all you can carry. I did get 10 record sleeves for my trouble and WTF should i support you for something that cost maybe 10 cents a for a piece plastic no thanks. All i am talking about is goodwill if you don't have that you might as well fold up your business and close your doors.
been coming here for awhile just for its chile relleno and I get this on an order of three piled in one container instead of separate containers like always and no cheese. Inconsistency and especially human laziness is always the root of nothing good! Check your cameras and do some remedial training with the lazy ass excuse of a human responsible for this. A lazy ass will always be the bacteria infection to the success of any business.
The worst night sleep I've ever had. I was in Pittsburgh for an important interview and I thought staying at a Marriott would be a safe bet. The room was spacious and well decorated. But there were long hairs in both the sink and shower and had clearly not been cleaned-gross. The curtains were not long enough for the windows and the light shone in all nights because of street lamps right outside. The shower knob also wasn't screwed on and fell on my foot-surprised it's not broken. The air conditioner was SO loud and rattled on and off all night-causing me to wake up too many times to count. It also wouldn't stay on for more than a few minutes at a time and there were just so many noises. When we told the front desk our issues, they just said "I'm sorry about that" and nothing to try and rectify our terrible night. We are silver elite Marriott members and stay at Marriotts all the time-but YIKES!!!
Horrible - avoid. Greasy food, low on taste. I nearly choked on a metal staple in my food -- not kidding! This however didn't figure heavily in my rating. The owner stated," oops! Next time we will give you a free dish!". I'll never return though.
The worst service I have ever experience I've had and I've been coming to Serrano for years. First they forgot the lemon then they got my and my grandmas order wrong the whole time the server was rude from the beginning. They couldn't understand I asked for chicken as a substitute or nothing and gave me ground beef then remade it into something completely different. Server and manager are rude and incompetent. We were here for so long for them to remake food and still expected us to pay full price. Never again
You've got to be kidding me; $10 for 6 pieces of mediocre sushi?!?!  Highway robbery...
Ummm, I went in there to have a bunch of keys made.  $16 worth.  Yes, nice and friendly people there, but that doesn't make up for incompetence. Not a SINGLE key worked.
We live in the neighborhood and went for beers and appetizers to watch a basketball game.  Ordered chicken nachos which were good.  However, we got there a couple minutes before 5:00 for a 5:00 game.  Asked to have TV by us switched to ESPN2.  Waited 15 minutes before they turned it to ESPN.  My wife went up to bartender who was the only one the waitress said could turn the channel.  He told her he would change it went "he had time."  Waited another 6 minutes until I went up and complained.  They finally changed it with 8 minutes left in first half.  By that time we got our check so we could go watch somewhere else.  We will stick with Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers in our neighborhood instead of here.  Very disappointed.
Do yourself a favor and go with any other cleaning service. The maids are all sweet BUT the owner is a terrible business man and does not communicate with his houses.  This week we were suppose to receive our bi-weekly clean at 10:00 on Tuesday.  The maids show up at 11:30ish and had no clue they were suppose to be here at 10. So I asked to reschedule for the following day and they were booked up (okay that's fine) so then they say they will come on Thursday.  Well 10 rolls around then 11 and still no maids.  We had to contact the owner and he said one of the maids was fired "due to her personal issues" okay that's fine but let people paying you know.  So they FINALLY come on Saturday they "clean" the house in about 1.5 hours (it's about 2000 square feet) so they do an average job.  The cleaning was suppose to be free- well we were then charged. TRUST ME when I say it is not worth the hassle of dealing with this place.
I have no idea how this place could get over 2 stars. The atmosphere is okay, our waiter very attentive but the food, gag.
Today i saw lax food safety standards at Chippys and alerted the chef to the issue and was shocked at their flippant reaction.A cook in the restaurant handles raw fish and frozen fish with bare hands and then handles cooked food at the same time, not even pretending to wipe the hands or kitchen surface (and cross contaminates the whole kitchen). He then cooks the rest of the food, and serves it. The finished food, chips, etc are placed on the same counter as raw fish preparation. There is not an actual food service area separated from prep. There is a pool of fish juice. The chef was in the rear of the open kitchen filleting fish (during a busy service) so I stepped over to talk without having all of the customers hear the issue. I asked the chef telling him I've experience as a chef/food handler and am concerned, wanting to speak away from customers and told him the issue. He responded that since he is a George Brown teacher he knows the code and I don't. He questions if I really have experience as a chef, He says that the food was being prepped on one side of the counter and serve on another. I pointed out that fish juices were literally spread all over this small counter and that the other cook wasn't using gloves and that bacteria migrates.I asked for my money back and said I didn't want to argue with him if he completely did not care about proper food handling but he just kept arguing at me angrily. My girlfriend came over and stopped things from going further. The chefs tone was very confrontational and rude.I alerted dine safe about Chippys.
Just like Culvers except not as good. Pricey because it's in Scottsdale. Went there for lunch on 3/29/16 got the smoked stack burger and a small shake and it was $13. Went with people from work all 4 of us had stomach issues and felt ill the rest of the day. Save yourself the trouble and go another trendy burger place in Scottsdale than this one. I can think of hundreds.
They messed up my drive-thru order AGAIN! 3rd time this month!  How difficult is it to look at the screen and grab the right breakfast sandwich off the warmer?  I ordered and paid for a sausage McMuffin with egg, and not until I get to work do I realize that what's in the bag is a sausage McMuffin - no egg. That's a difference in price of about $2! Really!?! Not the best way to start my day!  I know it's always a struggle to get the drive-thru line moving, but it doesn't mean you sacrifice quality control and efficiency.
The linguine di mare I ordered for takeout was missing it's lobster
Wife and I have been going to Abuelos for years, so when we feel like Mexican food there was no other place we considered. We like it so much we drive out of our way to eat there. We frequent Abuelos where ever we find them including but not limited Phoenix, Chandler and Kansas City MO. So for my wife and I to give a 1 star should hopefully get the attention of the owners. We were extremely disappointed with the food and lack of service during our last few visits to the Chandler location. I would bet on it that the management were not there yesterday during our visit because there was a lack luster attention to service period. We arrived at 330pm, to find 3 seated tables and a bunch of staff some making eye contact with us as we stood there waiting to be seated. As we stood in the lobby waiting to be seated for 10mins, I turned around to walk out before my wife waved down a waiter who noticed us when we first walked in to seat us. The host was no where to be found but did show as the waiter grabbed the menus. Out of the corner of my eye the host gave our waiter a dirty look, yes I did see that rudeness coming from the host with long black hair. I'm kinda glad someone decided to do her job. But after the food and service, I should have went with my gut feeling and walked out. After all, going to eat at the odd hour has its chance of being served leftover dried out food, but I felt Abuelos was a different place to eat, NOT SO.  The Pasta La Paz my favorite was lacking sauce, the chicken was dried up leftovers from lunch and had been placed under the salamander to heat then left on the counter to cool to less than room temp when served. My wife's fajitas tacos where not fajita stips but chopped up leftover beef from the lunch. We pushed out empty drink glasses to the edge of the table for refills which finally got filled after 15mins. We could not wait to get out of there, we are so disappointed since we loved this place so much. We started noticing this on the last few visits, when we have ate there during off hours. Sadly,  I won't spend another $40 to find out if they have change, that was our purpose for our recent visit. We enjoyed our multiple monthly visits to Abuelos, but that will not be the case any longer. Hope this helps improve on what once was a great experiences for us.
Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.I was there REALLY early but there were so few "ladies" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.Then again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).This is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ... Scottsdale.
Do not visit Maya, that is unless you'd like to see racial discrimination and pure Scottsdale douchbaggery in play. Myself and a friend went on a Saturday night. There were maybe 10 people in line in front of us and we waited 15-20 minutes. That part wasn't bad. Our friends were inside and had clearly stated they paid $10 cover. When we got inside, the girls in front of us paid $10. When it was our turn, they said cover was $30 each. My male friend and I were shocked and asked how this happened when the girls in front paid $10. Basically they said their GM changes prices whenever he wants. Their GM, Jason, came to speak to us and was extremely rude and unprofessional. When we asked again why the cover changed, he asked us to leave. By this point, we didn't want to stay anyway as his attitude was so condescending. He does not know how to provide customer service and did not want to answer our question in a straight forward manner. Be careful Jason. Treating your customers like this will only result in Maya ending up like Axis Radius across the street.
I went in for a baliage and did not like the results because it looked like nothing had been done to my hair. So I had them re do it, but it ended up even worse. It looked like they just straight up bleached my hair, no blending or depth, started way too low, looked like one solid color instead of highlights, and I lost 3 inches because of the damage they caused! I had to go to another salon and pay $185 to fix what they did. You can really tell the difference between the photo in my other review and this one how a correct baliage is supposed to look. Also, they don't even style your hair at all after they color it unless you pay extra. Worst experience I've ever had at any hair salon. I wish I could get my money and my hair length back!
I'm am very disappointed in this store I have always had good service here. I ordered 2 gyro salads they gave me Greek salads no meat for 12 dollars. I've gotten salads here with meat. I got all the way home before I saw no meat. If some one orders a gyro salad you would think they would at least ask if I wanted meat. If i would have wanted a greek salad i would ask for a greek salad. I said gyro.When I called them on the phone they were not too nice. I'll be finding a new gyro place. There's one by my post office I guess I'll give them a shot
This St. Hubert is literally the worst I've ever been to. The customer service was absolute garbage. I took the time to order my food online a half hour before getting there. This is an express counter which means it should take less time than the restaurant - but I get there ready to pick up my food and what seemed to be the manager tells me that they just started cooking the meats because he told me he wanted it "fresh". First of all, don't bullshit me and tell me you haven't started my order instead of lying about the freshness. We waited an extra 15 minutes for our food and then once we left in a hurry - they forgot to include my soup. I called back and demanded a delivery of the soup and I never got that delivery. Point is - WORST St. Hubert I had ever been to and WORST customer service.  You won't be getting my business anymore and if anyone ever asks me about you I'll tell them to go elsewhere. GARBAGE.
Awful. Simply AWFUL experience. I was looking for a new doctor because I don't really click with the one I have now. I asked friends who they would recommend and one of my friends highly recommended Dr. Wade so I called to schedule an appointment. Dr. Wade is eight weeks out on new patient appointments so I ended up with an appointment with JD, a PA. I think first time patients should always see the doctor, not the PA but I decided to give it a try anyway. My bad. I should have insisted on a doctor and not a PA. Maybe then I would have been treated better. Or not.I should have gathered that this wouldn't be the right practice for me when the woman who FINALLY answered the phone after I pressed this and that and this and that number asked me what kind of insurance I had BEFORE she even asked me my name. I explained to the woman that I have BCBS but that my husband's company had just merged with another company and there were some glitches in their new health insurance but that BCBS was aware of it and that the office would just have to use my husband's card since BCBS hadn't sent mine yet. I also explained that BCBS was on hand to answer any questions they might have about my coverage. The woman on the phone said that was fine and made an appointment for me. That's when she FINALLY asked me what my name was.The next day I got a call from Desert View's business office saying that they couldn't get my insurance to go through. I explained to yet another person about the glitch and gave her the name and number of the person at BCBS to call to get approval for me. Obviously she never did that and that's where things really started getting bad...I showed up for my appointment and was herded back to a little cubicle and had my picture taken by a sour-faced girl who looked like she REALLY hated her job. I explained -- yet again -- about the insurance issue and rather than call the contact at BCBS, the girl tried running my husband's card. Not surprisingly, she told me I didn't have insurance. Again I asked her to contact the person at BCBS and she refused so I called them. She refused to speak to them. The person at BCBS asked if the doctor's office could wait until the end of the day (it was already 3:00 p.m.) to run the insurance info to give the servers a chance to upload my information. Uh, nope. They wanted payment NOW -- before I saw anyone. So, I asked her how much it would be if I paid out-of-pocket. She had to make a call. (Really? She had to CALL someone to find out how much a flipping appointment was?) After she hung up, she told me that it would be between $100 and $250 depending on the "level of appointment" I needed. "Level of appointment?" Huh? Obviously though, if I were to pay it out-of-pocket, they would have had to have waited to get their money until AFTER my appointment was over so they could figure out what "level of appointment" my appointment was so why couldn't they wait a half an hour or so to run my insurance info?I finally just looked at the girl and said, "I've been looking for a new doctor. Unfortunately, I don't think this practice is the one I'm looking for. May I please have my paperwork? I'm outta here." She had the gall to look at me and say, "Does that mean you want to cancel your appointment?" I didn't even bother answering because the only answer I could come up with was, "Duh." I ripped up my paperwork on the way out of the building and it took everything in me to not toss it on the floor.BTW: Their address online is still their old address. I drove to Mesa only to find out that they've been located in Gilbert for at least three years. So many people have gone to the old address that the receptionist at the old address (a business not affiliated with Desert View) has the address and phone number memorized. Not changing your address is not good business no matter how you look at it. It cost me 20 extra miles in 111 degree heat because their old address is the first one to come up when searching for them. You would think that in this day and age businesses would be swift enough to change their address. Guess not.Between the complete lack of personality I was treated to and the lack of helpfulness and being treated as an insurance number and not a person, I'd say it would be a cold day in Hades before I ever graced the doors of Desert View "Family" Medicine again.
23 min wait for two chicken tacos with rice and bean, Uber eats orders were expedited fast and efficient during my wait, however there was only two tables when I walked in that already had there food I was the only one in line , place was dead decided to go there instead of Costa Vida so I could get a bit e to eat fast, a couple of girls ordered after myself but finished there whole meal before I got my order to go, brand ambassador not present. Weak for a new place trying to get traction in a competitive market
Avoid this place at all costs.  Ordered a brisket for Easter about 5 days ahead of time.  Called the day before to see if I could pick it up that day, was told, no, the delivery for the day hadn't come in yet.  So fine, no problem. Went the next day about 11am.  No brisket.  No call, no apology, not able to contact the delivery man to see when/if arriving. Had planned to cook that day so the meat could rest a couple days in the fridge, having company and a tight weekend so had to re-arrange everything because of these incompetents.  I am puzzled as to why they asked me for my phone number in first place if calling never occurred to them. Thankfully was able to get Butcher on Butler to help me out.  Great service, great brisket.
The only thing that ever made this place good was their Old Fashioned. The food used to be terrible. Maybe it got better after that chef guy left? Anyway, Bud light. No locals allowed. Well maybe the VIP. This is not who we want in Phoenix. This is not what we've been fighting for.
I was at Momma's Organic Market which is a farmers' market in Peoria and Mollies Tamales was there. I bought 2 different kinds of tamales to have for dinner. The older man bagged them up and I paid and when I got home I was shocked at how small they were, what a disappointment. Next, after I steamed them, I noticed how hard the masa was when I cut into one with a fork. The masa was dry and had no flavor. It was truly tasteless masa. But here's what was disturbing more than anything else. The pork and beef weren't shredded as one would expect. It was mushy and greasy. There was a strange film left in my mouth after I took a bite. The filling was kind of like a tub of processed pulled pork or beef that you'd get in the freezer section at Walmart. It was also pretty tasteless. How on earth are they getting away with charging $30 for a dozen small, tasteless tamales? Thankfully, I only bought 3 pork and 3 beef. All in all, I was not happy with paying $15 for 6 small tamales that had no flavor and mushy filling.
Over time threading service has kept declining. A lot of inexperienced people doing threading. Make mistakes then dont take accountability. Have gone for many years when convenient, but have now have had too bad many experiences in which I will not return or recommend.
Perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high for Vegas hotel eateries, or perhaps this place just sucks. A friend and I were visiting Vegas and staying at the Circus Circus hotel when our dinner plans suddenly cancelled. Hungry and tired of searching, we settled on just eating at the hotel. First, there was live music, which is to be expected at a Motley Crue restaurant. What was not to be expected was a man in leather chaps and a cowboy hat belting out country music. I'm sure many patrons would love this setup, however, my friend and I despise country music, so this was equivalent to sitting right at the gates of hell. Seeing as it was pretty late, we anticipated we wouldn't be there long so we stuck it out. I got the Mac and cheese, which took waaaaay too long to come out. We waited a while for the server to even come to the table so we were able to order immediately when he first arrived, then waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. The bacon in the Mac and cheese was way too salty, the plate was hot as if it were just thrown in the microwave, and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out a while. Not appetizing at all. We had a total of three encounters with the server: once to order, when he brought our food, and when we asked for the check. In summary: long waits, terrible atmosphere, sub par service, and disgusting food.
It started with a long check in, and ended with a sad breakfast of cereal and well past ripe bananas.  In between was an extremely dated building, old furniture, ridiculously slow "free" wi-fi, and missing amenities,   I've stayed at a number of discount hotels, and extended stay facilities.  This was on the lesser end of the spectrum.  The lone positive was the young man at the front desk who was very friendly, meant well, and in spite of zero support, tried his best to work for you.
The boss trying to sell me something they want to sell, which sucks. And the food is very low quality in all the Korean restaurant. I have had. Donot come here in Uiuc!!!
Just for fun, let's pretend that you, gentle reader, have never set foot inside a Walmart Supercentre. Let me set the scene. Since we're obviously in the 'burbs you must first manoeuvre your SUV or minivan into a parking lot that can only be measured in football fields. After acquiring a spot nowhere near the store, get out of your car and see if you can feel the gravitational tug of the small-business-crushing blackhole that is Walmart. As you make way through the no-doubt-strewn-with-blue-shopping-carts parking lot, remember: this isn't even close to the worst of it.The action starts right away. In fact, I've never entered a Walmart without someone else simultaneously leaving. It's an endless loop of consumption: coming, going, buying, breaking, dawdling, vacuously staring, slowly dying. Think maggots on a decaying steak. Be prepared for sobbing children. You might be greeted by a man or woman in a blue vest who you will avoid but still want to embrace and tell them it's OK. You will be unable to get any help in the store. This is normal.Once you have crossed the 20-foot long, three lane vestibule that is the antechamber to savings, you will have entered the no frills fluorescence that is Walmart. At a Supercentre you need only *ponder* a saleable item (a towel, a toaster, skis, a pear, eye drops, a step stool, a USB hot chocolate stirrer) and as God as my witness: it will be manifest. It will also  be of middling quality and priced so competitively you'll think you're at a garage sale, but you'll probably find it.It would be foolish to attempt to distinguish this Walmart from others, and I shall not. A few positives (aside from their Olympic selection and human-rights-defying prices), are their sensible approach to the express queue (bank style), and their generous return and exchange policy.Negatives include: their detrimental effect on small businesses in a community, their mostly-imported low quality merchandise, and the People of Walmart themselves. The POW effect is less pronounced in Canada than the US, but trust me, it's there.In summary, if you can get it at Walmart, you can get it anywhere else. I recommend you do.Obligatory Title Pun: All in all, it's just another brick in the WAL.Menu Readability: Geez, even their logo is cheap.Need to mention: Avoid any and every location in the month of December (or any time of year really).What this place teaches me about myself: Not a damn thing.
The front desk staff are nasty, rude people! They don't want to help, they make you feel like you are an inconvenience!!!! As if we enjoyed going in! It's obvious that if people go in there is because, they are in need of medical help! Otherwise we, wouldn't go in! I will not be going back there, nor would I send people there anymore!!! This place either needs to close or the front desk staff need to change!!!! It's ridiculous, to be under stress because of injury or illness and to have these people make you feel worse!!
I have to be honest here... I went inside this place last week and it just seems like a disaster. I walked in around 6 PM or so and was looking to buy a vape pen.  The place seems like it had a ton of selection but the place is tiny. With two people in the store, I had a hard time negotiating around the store. I wanted to pick up a vape pen but didn't know where to start. No one said hi to me when I walked in.  I could see that the woman behind the counter didn't really seem like she knew what she was doing. She was on the phone with a guy on speaker phone and it seemed like he was guiding her around the store to show her where stuff was while a customer was waiting for her to find it.  I was behind someone else and really didn't feel like I was going to get any level of knowledge  out of this place so I just took off. I went online, researched and bought  a pen online that had good reviews.  I went to this place cause the amazing reviews on yelp and google but seems like the place where you need to know what you're buying, and just pick it up..
Had lunch with work colleagues today and the eggplant parmigiana was the worst ever! I swear to God, the thickness of the eggplant was 1 mm I repeat 1 mim!! Can't even fathom how someone could create such a ridiculously thin slices and then have the nerve to serve it and then call it eggplant parmigiana! The layers were 95% floured coating then heavily deep fried - never order that. Next time I crave eggplant parmigiana, I'll just get the Costco,'s frozen version - so much better! The  accompanying sad garlic bread clearly tasted stale! The restaurant is just riding on its reputation- cannot imagine how.
Ok so they charge a lot just for a single slice of pizza but what gets me is they charge a lot for what looks like old pizza that they reheat just to give to you which is one messed up and two gross I recommend going to Paris casino and go to La pizza same price but man is it worth it the pizza at that place was amazing definitely worth the walk and and use your money for better food!
I don't even see how this McDonald's has an average of 2 stars!? I But it doesn't matter what time of day you go you WILL receive the WRONG order even after you specify to the worker. The managers are a joke as well, you try to speak to them to get what you originally ordered and they tell you that your basically wrong & ordered what they give you. I always regret going to this McDonalds but it's literally a minute away from home or less & I know I shouldn't be complaining this bad about a fast food place and simply because it's McDonalds but it's not often that I go and yet they still manage to mess up every order that I have asked for. Heck if I was to ask for a water they'd probably give me Sprite.
Worse experience ever!!!!! And I'm from the east coast!!! I would never treat anyone how the 2 people the young lady and guy working treated me . I wanted to like this place sooo bad I walk in I got totally ignored! Not only did the hostess young lady ignore me she didn't even say hello welcome to such and such nor did the other guy . Did ask if I had any questions she found tons of stuff to do while I  waited for just her to notice me . Extremely rude I'm the kind of person that when I find a good east coast place I tell my east coast friends but that will never happen extremely rude and I WILL NEVER RETURN and tell everyone to not go to your establishment !!!! Find better staff that don't mind being social with every race !
Unfortunately they did the worst service to my dum sum lunch. ..The day after backed from China, HK and Japan for one and half month trip, I was so exited to have a lunch at Yu restaurant. Since their fish mart is very high quality in GTA, who gonna doubt its food quality. We order a plain congee and several dim sum. It was a busy Sunday lunch time so most of table is occupied by the family with small children. Then big surprise. There was a chunk of metal sponge in the congee. I was busy in chatting so almost swallow the piece of metal if my family did not stop my spoon. We called restaurant manager immediately. And another surprise. He grabbed the congee plate quickly and said ' oh, cancel it' and left our table without apology nor follow up. We asked him again what happened inside the food but he kept saying that today is my last day (so what ?)I can't do anything. !!!! After that I do not remember what I ate. The new manager came and said sorry to us. However, I have a trauma now. Just imagine what happened in the kitchen. Hygiene management is the basic of restaurant business. No matter how they cook fancy dim sum, I may not go back there again. It's a metal contained dim sum not edible at all.
i was here today....i had combo of shrimps,it was no good,and too dark....it was very diffrent with the photo in the menu....too bad......i will never come back to this place...
Spent weeks working with Jason O. First I was told he would locate a vehicle for me and getting financing will be no problem. Then I find a vehicle and again they will get the financing and see what kind of payment we can get for your credit no problem. Then I get a phone call saying they want $7000 when I had a trade in. What? My husband and I are both extremely upset and will never do business with these people. This is a perfect example of car salesman that just want to get You in and then run and mess with your credit. Shameful!
If I could give negative stars I would. It's horrible. I would never want someone to go through the mess we had to with my 2 year old. They are not friendly, careless about the kids and hire anyone. It's a horrible place
I tried with these guys.  I tried.  I was extremely patient and extremely nice and easy going.  They came and repaired one of our AC units which needed a new compressor motor through our home warranty.  Although they did not show up on time, and did not show up to several recall appointments, they did initially schedule to come out quickly, within 24 hours and did the initial repair then, so luckily we were only without AC for 1 day. However the tech did a lazy job and left all our wires exposed to weather and moisture.  After contacting the company, they scheduled a different tech to come and correct the problem. It took me several messages and two weeks later to finally get this tech to come and "fix" the problem, only to find when I returned that he left the ground wire still out and exposed to weather and moisture.  I contacted the company right after that, which is now a month ago, and am still waiting for them to respond and fix this problem.  I have two air conditioning units, and the unit not touched by Air Pro has absolutely no exposed wires.  Ground wires and any electrical wires should not be exposed to weather and moisture outside of any protective casing. This is lazy and sloppy work.  I have attached three pictures.  The first pic is of the first terrible job, the second pic is of the second horrible job, and the third pic is of my other air conditioning unit and how it is suppose to look.  I hope that I can update and let you all know that Air Pro did the right thing and fixed this problem, but considering they've yet to get back to me, we'll just have to see.
My boyfriend and I have heard great things about the food at this place and decided to try it out. I called around 630 to try and place an order for pick up. The girl I spoke to said they currently weren't doing take out orders. Before asking for a manager, the only answer to any of my questions was "I don't know" with an "I don't care" attitude. Supposedly they ran out of to - go containers (in the middle of downtown Cleveland..? Really..?) and were not able to take carry out orders. Poor planning and Very unprepared. I've heard great things about the food at this place, but not about the service. Working in the service industry myself, I know that customer satisfaction is key to having a successful business. If the actual service is any reflection to the rude phone conversation I had with an employee then I'm more then happy to take my business elsewhere.
It took over 20 minutes to get our food when we sat inside. The food was disgusting. I would say that I'll be sure to use the drive thru next time but I won't be returning!!!!!! I gave 1 star for customer service. Otherwise buh bye Farmers Nastiness!
Free crazy bed my A** lol. Blonde girl made some bull excuse. Saying we had to of just ordered. We've been here for four minutes lol and noticed the sign. So don't bother asking for free bread sticks that their sign specified "if we don't offer you a crazy combo ... it's free" lies
If only NO STARS!! I have never received this level of rude service, this takes the cake as number 1 worst experience.  By the way the couple to my left were not of the African American descent and receiving a better service. The couple to the right of me noticed the same as they were also receiving rude service.  I can understand a bad day but this was ridiculous. I walked away not eating and vowing never to come back. Horrible service and mishandling of the food.   My fiancee and I decided to walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and noticed Johnny Rockets to grab a quick bit. We weren't greeted but still sat down at the counter to eat, still no greet but luckily there was a menu available. So we waited about ten minutes as I observed three servers on shift. Finally, the gentlemen server approaches the couple next to us and says "I see no one took your order yet" it was pretty rude but true. After he took their order, I asked "can I please place my order as well as I've been waiting,he replied "I'll try". He then takes the order and walks away to the back. So we waited another 10 minutes, I ask the tall waitress with red hair "can I please get a water" she gets it and slams it down. The couple next to us asked for their drinks and the waitress said "I didn't take your order so what do you want". So about another 15 minutes passed, in that time I observed the cook on his phone and then heading back to the grill without washing hands, bacon that wasn't properly cooked from a previous order placed on another order. I didn't walk away then. So I wanted to check the status of my order so I asked another server (short female w/black hair)about my order, she went to check and came back to say "who assisted you" I described the gentlemen with the glasses. She asked him about the order and he replied "transfer the checks, I'm out". To hear that upset me, I spoke my frustration  to the wrong employee. The female with the short hair was very polite and I felt bad that she had to deal with the rude service I was receiving.
If you want hair or plastic pieces or bugs on your food - all found on our food tonight on our table, come here. Their original broth was bland. Services are average as per Chinatown standard, the waiters seemed too busy and rude to care about their dirty food. Would NOT come back.
Horrible! Not one good thing about this place. We were one of 3 tables on a Monday night and it took almost 45 minutes to get our food AND it was completely wrong, items were missing or cooked wrong. Completely trash. Don't waste your time.
If it were possible to give less than one star, I would do so. RUN away from this hotel! They are undergoing renovations and begin jack hammering at 8 am well into the evening (past 6 pm - until April 2018). The hotel did not bother to disclose this fact when confirming reservations nor will they move us to another room away from the noise. I explained to the front desk that I had to come down in person because the noise was SO LOUD that I could not hear "Guest Services" over the phone. They refused to move us to another room nor give a considerable compensation. So BEWARE! They will trick you into staying at the Flamingo only to force you into leaving the hotel to go elsewhere. Why not just go to a hotel that is all about customer satisfaction?
Just stopped there for a breakfast taco. As my order was taken just a few feet away two guys were standing on the food service counter using power screwdrivers above. This is not good to have people walking and working on the food counter. Plus some plaster and debris was falling. All while the clerk is serving customers.   I wonder what goes on in the back ?  Probably would not go back.
4:20pm  just walked in and then turned around and left! First time I've ever seen a Paradise Bakery that dirty!
I have  been using their oil/lube shop for some time.  I actually take 2 cars for oil changes.  Now that it is winter, I decided to give their car wash a try.  I printed a coupon from their web site and was appalled when they would not accept it.  When I asked them to explain this, I WAS CALLED AN 'ASSHOLE' IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS.  There is no reasoning with the people who own this operation.  They recognize me from my oil change visits, yet seemed OK to insult me and simply act in an explainable way.  My suggestion to anyone who visits this shop/carwash is to stay away! They do not deserve your business. AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT FAIR AND REPUTABLE BUSINESS PRACTICE.  STAY AWAY!
It is really sad to have to write a 1 star review for this place. The food 4 stars, the fact that it is family own and run is a 5 stars, but service that I have received from the manager, David is a -3 stars. On the first day that the Yelp coupon was released I bought it and used it. When I checked out, the cashier was confused because I was the first one to use the coupon. I later discovered that she originally charged my cards for the full price, $34.18. She then charged my card for $26.04. I know my math skills are a little rusty, but that is not a $14.00 discount, plus I was charged twice. That is not where the major problem lies. The major problem was that I had to make several phone calls attempting to get a hold of the owner or manager. When I finally did get a hold of David he told me that he did not call me back because he did not know who I was or what I wanted. He also stated that I "should have left him a message about what my concern was." First David, you should call everyone back regardless of if they leave a detailed message. Secondly, I was not about to leave a detailed message because the person that answered the phone each time struggled with their English to the point that they could hardly handle my name and phone number. I have no problem with the fact that they struggled with English, but don't provide me with poor service by not calling me back because I didn't leave a message under these circumstances.Here we are more than 2 weeks later and I still am struggling to get my money back. If the owner reads this, then it would behoove you to reach out to me to resolve this. We were so excited to have found your place just 2 months ago. We were on our way to being devout customers, but this might have changed that, primarily due to David's attitude with me.
They totally DESTROY my hair, I want ombre, maybe they think I can't understand Korean, and the girl that own this store always use Korean say "quick quick" to another girl. I have long hair before, but when I at home, I cut all damage hair that they ombre to me.I never want been there anymore.
What not to do while trying to get into a hip happenin (please note major sarcasm there) Scottsdale club after a few too many drinks and a sassy streak running on full steam by stephy s.Me: "Ohhhh shit, are we goin' to da cluuuuuhb? Awwwhhh yeeeahhh!!!"(Walks up to door guy who we'll call Aggroman to protect identities of big headed ego inflated jackasses)Me: "Hey, I like your emblem!"Aggroman: "What."Me: "Your emblem (reaching out to tap gold emblem on macho man's blazer whilst giggling like the smart ass drunk girl I am)"Aggroman: "ID."Me: "Jeez, was just saying I liked your broach, sheeesh."Aggroman: (visibly aggro and motioning me in) "Go."Me: (under my breath, which probably was rather loud) Dang, isn't this Scottsdale, what up with the attitude?!!? This ain't LA, shiiiiiiit (clearly I think I'm from the hood now with my gansta speak)Inside da cluuuuub what do we find? Well sadly, not nearly enough scantily clad sluts. I mean, I go to clubs for one reason and one reason only...sluts, hoochies, hood rat hood rat hoochie mamas and this place was strikin out big time. It did, however offer up a fun variety of cougars and possums, though! This gave me some hope as I was also told earlier in the evening that Scottsdale has, per capita, the highest number of Sugar Daddy's in the nation, so let's face it, I wanted to meet one of those too. Hey, why not, it was Wednesday after all and I was staying at the Valley HO!! :)After striking out in the Sugar Daddy and slut categories, I decided to entertain myself by taking camera phone pictures of random girls dancing, but apparently people are too cool to pose for fun pics like this. My theory is that Girls Gone Wild killed it for everyone! Thanks a lot Joe Francis!! Whatever. I got a shot of a half nekkid girl dancing anyway, so there. Moral of the story. Don't take me out to da cluuuuhhhb. The end. :)
This is a whiskey bar in Vegas located in the MGM. We went up to the bar maybe 1am post a concert on a Sunday night and had the hardest time getting the bartenders attention to be able to order a drink. it took probably 10 minutes for me, and then i waited with a friend another 15 minutes for him to be acknowledged. I ordered two buffalo trace old fashions and the bartender reached under the bar and pulled up two glasses that apparently had been prepped with what appeared to be mashed up maraschino cherries and some ice and then he just poured in the bourbon and then charged be $34.00 for two drinks. It was hands down the WORST cocktail I have ever gotten. He completely ruined the bourbon and if I had known that was how he was going to make that cocktail I simply would have ordered the traces on the rocks. You can't mess I was disgusted and felt completely ripped off. I make a lot of old fashions at home and it doens't take a lot of time to make this simple yet classic cocktail. It was like the bartender did not even give a crap about the cocktail. Take some pride in your job if you are going to charge be 17 for a drink  made incorrectly that took you two minutes. We make ours with sugar cube, dash of bitters, muddle with a splash of water, rocks then the bourbon and garnish with a zest of lemon and orange. No cherries and certainly not mashed up cherries. I don't right a lot of reviews but I still find our experience at this place to be disturbing. It is Vegas and its a bar in the MGM and it should be this great place where cocktails are crafted with a passion and that you give a great guest experience. Sorry but after visiting High West Whiskey Distillery in St. Lake City where they take making their cocktails very seriously, including egg whites in a whiskey sour, this place was like a dive bar.  Totally disappointed.
The art of bartending and serving food is not that complicated. Be attentive, constantly observe your customers to see if they need booze or more food and smile from ear to ear. They have failed to to all! tips should not be expected, but rather earned. This all points to poor management. I didn't like the service but food was good. cheers
So first off, there is no parking in the parking lot.  So you have to pay on the street.  But that's fine...if it is worth it.  I went in around 1045am on a week day, not busy at all. I wanted a smoked meat sandwich and was rudely told they don't make that until 11am, I had to order breakfast.  So, reluctantly, I ordered a bagel, cream cheese and lox.  I explained it was for a child so to make it plain.  After paying over 8 dollars, and the cashier who couldn't seem to find change for a 10, ok...just call it a tip...so between parking and the bagel, I'm now up to 11 dollars...for a bagel.  Get home, open it, and it is covered in capers and red onions.  Not sure how this is child-friendly.  I am a BIG deli fan (from Montreal and Ottawa originally), so I KNOW good deli.  This isn't it.
This place has some good beer but it's really kind of gross inside and is essentially a dive. I can't understand how it's so packed all the time. The service is average and after seeing some of the people I'd be nervous to order food here.
Dropped my Ford Fusion off at 12:07. They even wrote the time in white marker on my window. I went inside, paid, and waited until 12:48 for my car to be finished at the other end with the drying. In the meantime, 4 cars who were 100% behind me in the line (based on the white marker on their window), finished before mine. A young man who had 2 cars there, a Cadillac and Mercedes, took about 4 guys to clean his two cars, which left one guy to man the remaining 6 cars that were in line to be dried. I then get in my car to find out the interior was still not cleaned, which I paid for on the Works package. $16.99 to get my car washed on the exterior, with a mediocre interior wipe down, and waited 41 minutes for it all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE. When I mentioned it was slow, he merely said, "Keep your receipt in case of raincheck."
Worst airline experience ever! I have never been treated so poorly. Went back east for my grandfathers memorial and on my way back home EVERY American airline employee was extremely rude and unforgiving when my flight itinerary email said my flight was delayed and they said wasn't. (It was) I got to my gate 30 min prior to the flight, they insisted the flight wasn't delayed and I couldn't board. I had my 5 yr old son with me and they were rude to him and made him cry. After asking for a manger and being declined, I finally got through and made it on the plane. Never again will I fly American.
Let's talk about the 800 POUND ELEPHANT on the STRIP!!!!THE STENCH!!!!!!!It takes a strong person to walk on the Strip from Spring Mountain to Flamingo, especially on the Harrah's side!! The sewage smell is overwhelming! I have been told by many locals and workers that there is nothing that can be done about it!REALLY!!!!Hey Your Honor, Ms. Goodman....com'on....let's take a walk....just bring your barf bag
I'm never going again. I have air bubbles and all my nails have a different shape. I said don't make them to thick. Some look and feel like they have a flat others don't.
Brand new McDonalds but is super slow! Waited over 30 mins for our food-slow service!!! Get it together people 30 mins was way to long.
Dos Juevos is still wearing the hand-me-down clothing of former tenant Julio G's.  The sign has changed and that's about it.The Good:To my surprise though, decent food at very good prices (had the beef burrito w/cheese.. take out).Drink prices are affordable considering it's Old town Scottsdale.. be advised you'll need to drink a lot to endure the atmosphere so it's probably a wash.Bathroom was clean so points for that, BUT... out of paper towels.The Bad:Slow service with a bartender that has no interest in the business, bored and inattentive wait staff.  No propane for outside patio heaters.  The Ugly:Something fresh is needed for decor.  Bad mojo leftover from amateur that last decorated the place. Cheap black and white tiles at a Mexican restaurant? Looks more like 50's style diner. Recommendations: Hire new staff or try to train existing on good service procedures.Perform a total remodel or tear-down/re-build.  If the owner is a cheapo tightwad type, at the very least, tear down all the wall tiles and throw up some drywall (yes, paint it also).  Paint the outside also and remove all traces of the Julio G's failure.For locals, suggest take out for now...  well, if you can find someone willing to serve you. For tourists, run away as fast as you can.. there are dozens of better choices in the immediate area.Wrap up:Great potential for a profitable restaurant. Missing fundamentals though.It really takes some juevos to run a place like this. This is not typical of Old town Scottsdale restaurants.
We are totally grossed out after eating at Zinburger today. First of all, while we waited outside for a table, a man stood right next to their fencing between Zinburger and Pomo and blew his cigarette smoke onto all the customers that were eating outside. Not a single employee at either restaurant said anything to him. After we were seated and ordered our food, another customer was seated alone outside. As soon as the hostess walked away, her male friend went into the patio area with a large dog. The dog jumped up onto the upholstered bench and then the girl's lap. The dog proceeded to sit at the table as customers inside watched and commented on how gross that was. As we waited for our lunch, we noted that every employee that walked passed this couple stopped to chat for quite some time. We're assuming the dog owner is also an employee because everyone seemed very friendly with her. Most of the employees also stopped to pet the dog, bring it water, feed it fries, etc. and then they would immediately serve food or fill water of other customers. One waitress (with her blonde hair in a knot, large black earrings, and a black and white headband) petted the dog on several occasions then brought food to customers, picked up a water pitcher and rubbed one hand all over the spout as she carried it, etc.  Next time I eat at Zinburger, I think I'll bring my pet ferret to run around the table and between customers' legs.
I am disappointed in their cancellation policy. We had two memberships, one for our teenage son and one for my husband with both having the ability to bring a guest. We were told we can cancel at any time for any reason. Since my son was using a different gym, we no longer needed his membership so I called to cancel and was told to call a different company to cancel. I called them and they told me I had to send an email confirming my cancellation. I was told I had to give a 30 day notice so I was charged another $24.95 for the month. Then the next month another $24.95 was charged. I call up the location they said they can't help but to call the other company again. I call that company and they say they can't help either. Then I'm calling the gym to talk to the manager who says she will try to get it refunded, it's been months and no refund. Then I send an email 2 months ago to put my husbands acct on hold while he's recovering from surgery and restricted from lifting weights. We are charged a $5.95 fee for the acct to be put on hold. I send an email the other day and say, just cancel the acct, I'm giving a 30 day notice, keep the $24.95 that you owe us and use it as the last payment for the 30 day notice and today we are charged $64.95. I send another email and no response. I'm not a fan of this location because it smells and is always crowded. I like the one on Sahara better. I never would have canceled my husbands membership but did because of the lack of correspondence. I'm contacting my bank to get involved with the shady charges. Avoid this company or be prepared to pay even after you cancel. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed!I emailed and received no response!
In my time I've never seen such a unorganized place. Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as "Family Friendly" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths. Filthy Mouths and Filthy Minds shouldn't be serving your family food.
What went wrong is the service. We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later....
My food was plain and boring. Our service was sub-par; we asked for water when we first got there and it didn't show up until shortly before we got our check. The dumb ass waitress spilled water on the floor by our table but didn't bother cleaning it up so when one of the older ladies that was joining me got up she slipped and fell. The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.
Overall SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE!!!!  Food way over priced .....we had a group of 20 and we all were unhappy with everything.... Never will come back here!!!!.  Never ever again.  The manager didn't even come over to recognize us.  Don't waste your money.
This place is always busy. The wait is not worth it at all. the food is not well prepared. It's as if the cooks are so busy that they dont care if they overcook or undercook. The last time i was there the eggs had way too much oil/butter and the has browns where undercooked. Just go somewhere else. Vegas is full of places to eat, this is the worst.
Avoid the strip at all costs. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.Every time I go there, I regret it.And now that paid parking is approaching, it's even more unappealing.The strip is absurdly expensive due to revenue-sharing between the businesses and the casinos (about 1/3 of what you pay goes to the casinos), and it's full of mostly trailer-trash in shorts and flip-flops, and overweight Taylor Swift wannabes awkwardly walking around with what seems like concrete blocks for shoes, all pretending to "live the dream".For those who have a brain, that "dream" is nothing short of a nightmare.There are so many wonderful restaurants, shops, and forms of entertainment off-the-strip that are more worthwhile....especially in Chinatown....just do a little research....starting here on Yelp.
The food is the same as downtown, but the service is so bad! How do they have a 2 h limit if they can't even bring all the food in 2 hours? I'm very disappointed with the service.
Canceled my subscription on Sunday 2/21/16 after yet another missed delivery.We only get the paper on Sunday and the carrier can't even get it right one day a week!If its raining, I am guaranteed a wet, soggy, unreadable newspaper because the carrier will not take an extra 2-3 seconds to tie the bag closed. If its dry, its a guess as to if I will receive a paper or not and where I will find it, in the road, the ditch, the neighbors bushes and on the rare occasion, in the driveway. Did not get the Thanksgiving day paper that I paid extra for either. It was just not worth the aggravation any longer.Complaining does no good, because you get the same scripted response each time-We're sorry, we'll talk to the supervisor and the carrier, we'll extend your subscription, blah, blah, blah.When I canceled my subscription, the apologized for their "apparent" error and wanted to know if they could speak with someone else in the household that would continue the subscription.That would have been the wife and she would have said Hell No!I didn't even answer them back. I am so over The Charlotte Disturber.
You're better off calling Verizon Wireless and getting help over the phone. From the moment I walked in their customer service was far below average. I was not greeted and both employees were helping out other customers. I was never told how long the wait was going to be or anything. I had my phone stolen and waited over an hour for them to just tell me I need to call a different insurance number or do it online because they can't help me. If I would have just gotten greeted in the beginning with a, "What can we do for you today?" Then it would have been a good experience.
Torture.  Walked right in @ 10 pm on Saturday night, it was busy but no wait.  I imagine it can get very busy (good for them, not so good if you dislike lines/waiting).I'd suggest get the $7 nacho sampler; that only took about 10 minutes, the 16 spice chicken (name?) took over 45 minutes...  One item??!! (and yes it was very good but small portion)  Brutal, it's so loud inside, just an exercise in patience that we weren't looking for.  Staff was friendly, I would never return, nor recommend it to anyone.  TOO DARK.  TOO LOUD. WAY, WAY TOO SLOW.
Terrible Gym, the ceiling in the mens shower room is falling apart, Sauna has not worked properly for 6 months, change rooms are freezing cold in the winter and the Management could care less. Stay away from this Good life.
Have been a regular customer but today there was no change to be had. I swiped my credit card and got 8 minutes of nothing...no water, no soap...nothing! The place was filthy. The box for complaints was chock full. I got ripped off!!
Was not impressed at this location it's 8am the store Nasty they just opened tables an floor Dirty sticky. Soda machine wasn't clean last night bugs flying no ice machine..The sweet tea taste like water. The manager a tall man causian with Glass with The I don't Care attitude with tattoos Cute but attitude makes him look unpleasant to talk to. So they get a D
This cab company ripped me off then tried to double charge me today Feb. 23.  First,  the ride was just over $33 for an 8am ride from the Venetian to the airport. Not happy, but paid by CC. I knew the fee and a tip brought it to about 40.  Then the cab driver rushed into the terminal and said the CC did not work despite the reader saying my payment was accepted. I told him I'm not leaving the terminal and I will call my CC company to see if there is a pending charge.  He kept insisting and I told him to get the police while I'm on the phone with the CC company. He then left. The CC company said the charge is pending.  Will never use this taxi company again on my next trip to Vegas.
This place is a total rip off they have vet come in and then have people come in after diagnosis with huge estimates for treatments unbelievable prices ... Went right after to another animal hospital and was given a price from the vet themselves and no huge outrageous estimate... My puppy was dying and all they could see was $ signs... Needless to say my puppy survived parvo but with no help from craig road animal hospital  and all the help in the world from another pet hospital not far from this used car dealership of a vet office ...
not true at all. you have to authorize the credit card company to give me a credit.. you refused.  you say you own a business.. we all know you are the one to call them and put through a credit.. so stop lying and put through the credit.. i dont know how you can continue to lie to people..its a simple process. call the company and say i want to credit this cc number.. stop lying to peopleyou say you refunded your fee?? not true at all..there is no refund..your service still is just absolutely terrible. full of untruths.. not only cant you find leaks but you lie about giving me the refund on your service fee. how bad is that?????do not deal with a company like this.. misinformation about their work and more information about sending a refund for their non service..terrible people
My girlfriend just got an oil change done here, she asked that they check the car over because we are going out of town. It is roughly a 100 miles later, 12:21pm, and we stopped for gas. The transmission fluid(measured hot and with the engine running) is not even showing on the dip stick, the belt cracked pretty bad, all the fluids are low there isn't a drop of washer fluid and who knows what else they didn't bother to check.
RACIST ! I called this location and kindly asked " hi are you hiring any new nail techs?" She said "are you vietnamese?" I said "no" and she said "ohh then no" so in order for me to get the job i have to be vietnamese? Discrimination in the work place terrible thing, i cant believe this even happened
I should have listened to Mike M. - This practice has deceitful billing practices and ate up $2,000 or more on a teeth cleaning also.
I went here before the chili peppers concert. We got there around 4:00pm before it was packed. The food was horrible and nothing like the Buford's in Moon. I ordered the chicken fingers and my friend ordered a burger. The food came out within minutes of ordering. It was so fast that we initially told the server it was the wrong table because we had just ordered. The fries on both dishes were hot but the chicken and burger were barely warm. My chicken looked like it sat under a heat lamp for a couple days. Neither of us could stomach the food enough to finish the entire dish. The only good thing about the visit was that the server made sure we had drinks. If it wasn't for the server, I would be asking Yelp to allow negative stars.
Walked in at 2:15pm and left at 2:30pm with no service.  Only two other tables and they already had their food.  Store needs new management and wait team!!
I went in genuinely looking to purchase some high end beads. The owner seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. When I asked about some beads he gave me an outrageous price tag. I know beads well enough to know that they were over priced. I was friendly and said "Thanks so much, I will think it over" and he turned his back to me and walked away ignoring me. Not a word. OKayyyyyy. I actually won't think it over, I won't go back every again.
Am I the only one who feels this place has gone down?  The last 2 x I went I have been disappointed.  The first time because they changed their breakfast preparation and got the order wrong twice.  This time food was wrong and not well prepared.  But worst of all this is what I observed.  Food handlers not wearing gloves and using their cell phones before and after they prepared the food.  Also one employee was carrying loaves of bread basically resting it on her chest with her ear buds dangling and hitting the bread.  eeeewww.  I feel the manager is not doing well.  The place was very dirty in the food prep area.  I am done.  Not going back.  Very disappointed.
Had the carne asada nachos 4 dollars more for carne and it had very little of it. Not recommended to pay 18.95 for it. Good server though.
Phone line is awful (if a bus leaves 30min late then arrives at destination 1h late and you had something important planned, they don't do anything! Very "your problem" kind of company. If you're desperate/want a cheap ride and don't care if you arrive arrive, guess it's ok.
Horrible service. Ordered a plain hamburger at 7:16 pm. At 7:30 pm they hadn't even put it on the grill (needless to say there was nothing on the grill for about 10 minutes). Not sure where the disconnect is between the cashier and the cook who is 8 feet away. Everyone is complaining and the customer in front was waiting even longer. Samantha did nothing about it until people started demanding a refund. Said she was sorry and couldn't give a reason why everyone's food was so delayed. 7:43pm we got our plain hamburger. Corporate please help before this location fails !! Update: the burger had cheese.
I travel for a living I eat out a hundred times a year. Sunday evening full restaurant full bar no bartender servers getting their own drinks can't get service you fail.
Once in a lifetyme, you freaking suck!How could you have it in you to take my money two days before you would be theives in the night and leave me with no dress and no money?!You ripped and pissed me off! I really hope you owners get whats coming to you! hopefully I can get some of the other women that you ripped off together to start a lawsuit!! Best believe Im bringing the heat to you!I recommend this place to NO ONE, that is if its still around.Karma is the biggest bitch out there so watch your heads!
The 2 hostess' was very unorganized and couldn't keep track of the people in line and when to bring more people back. We watched 2 other couples go in front of us who came after us. When we asked about it they didn't remember we were even waiting. They weren't writing down names to keep track either. Once we finally got sat, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us. We were ready to order our drinks and food by the time she got there. We got fish and steak tacos and they were ok, nothing special. Steak tacos were too spicy and the fish tacos were just bland. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that you don't get tortilla chips brought to your table either, you had to pay extra for them. I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time going here.
Ordered delivery, came the first time but was missing condiments, the sour cream for my baked potato and utensils. Called them, the manager said they will resend, but after 1 hr of waiting, it still did not appear. Called them 3 times, but they were closed so no one picked up my calls hence I called customer centre. The girl was prompt to connect me to the store and the manager said that apparently they did but "someone's husband answered the door declining the sour cream"..... I HAVE NO HUSBAND!! As a result, because they were closed at the time, they can't send me my sour cream so they will resend my entire order to me the next day, I even made sure to ask that they will get everything perfect right? And the manager said of course. The next day (which is today), they did as they promised, BUT AGAIN NO SOUR CREAM OR UTENSILS OR CONDIMENTS. By now, I'm really upset that this happened twice. I call the restaurant again (this was around 8pm today) and the manager again promised to send my sour cream out for me. Never happened. Called the restaurant after 1 hr of waiting and like the previous day, no one picked up my call (but this time the restaurant wasn't closed yet, they were still open for another 30 mins). Once again, I called customer centre, after explaining what happened, the girl tried to connect me to the restaurant twice, but no one picked up so said she will rush out my order for me and leave a note for the restaurant to call them back about compensation to me. About 30 mins later, I got a call from customer centre saying something about either a rush out or a $5 credit and how I can't have both. So I said I have no idea what you're talking about so she connected me to the restaurant, and they picked up! However, the manager was very rude in dealing with me, he was yelling about how they were very busy as it was a Friday night and that his TWO delivery guys were out for delivery for TWO HOURS (it has been 2 hrs since I made the call to the restaurant about my still missing sour cream). I told him that he should give me some compensation in addition to my sour cream, and he got upset, asking me what I want. As I was very upset at my missing sour cream and his rude attitude, I replied, would you give me whatever request I made, and he said to be fair with him. He told me to give him a break, but as a customer I told him that it was his duty to fulfill the order I put in perfectly. He apologized, not very nicely though mind you, but said he can't do anything cuz there are no drivers at that time, BUT THEN a driver came back. So I have FINALLY GOTTEN MY SOUR CREAM after 48 hrs. Unbelievable.
Just had a terrible experience at this location!! Took over 30" to get food. They had mixed order up and gave it to someone else. I finally had to ask for where my food was and then it still took time to o get. Then, while I was eating it, a find a food wrapper mixed in with my food that I didn't realize what it was until after I put it in my mouth and started to chew it!! I SO disgusted. I have had it with crapppy service and food prep. They gave me my money back but that doesn't cut. I patronize this particular restaurant chain quite a bit and no longer will be coming back. I plan to call the health board and file a compliant.
This place it a mess-smh they took 15min to make a slushy, and there was no one in front of me. Then the guy comes and grabs the slushy from me and says "I'm sorry I forgot to put sugar, I'll make it again".. At this point I don't even want it any more. I'll never go back here!!
Only two words "Don't Go". Unless you like food poisoning!  And I ate Cooked food!!  2 days in the hospital -- save yourself the money!
I was in there with my son the other night.  I ordered him a chicken teriyaki bowl. The chicken was burnt and dry, when I brought it back to the counter, the guy looked at it and threw it in the garbage right in front of me with an attitude the whole time. He said he would make me a kid bowl. I said no that's not what I paid for. He then proceeded to tell me that half the chicken was gone, which was untrue. I then said are we really arguing about this. I then demanded my money back and left. I will never be back in this establishment again. My husband and my family are regulars at this location. Ever since new management  has taken over there service standard have gone down. They are very unwelcoming. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for 20 years, and would never dream of treating a guest that way, let alone arguing with one and tell them they were wrong.
Despite how nice a business is, if it's unethical then it deserves 1 star no matter what.  Not as if this is the nicest hotel I've stayed at, the bed is very comfy though.The unethical part is when I ordered a double bourbon on the rocks at the bar, and walked away with a $30 bill.  I inquired the next day about the price of the drink with the Restaurant Manager, and her response is "That sounds about right."  I said the menu upstairs has a cocktail with the same bourbon listed at $14, but I didn't receive a cocktail, just a double bourbon ($14 per shot).  Her response?  "Oh that's because the cocktail only gets a half-pour."WHAT!!  You mean to tell me this hotel not only exorbitantly over charges for alcohol that already has a high profit margin, but you are selling cocktails for $14 that don't even have a full ounce of spirit in it?  That is called shady and wrong.  Good job Hilton.  I hope this review makes you lose the money you are trying to save by ripping people off.
I was ordering a few donuts , and made a  Uhmmmmm sound while making a decision on my next Donut and I hear one of 3 girls behind the counter imitate my Uhmmmmm sound and were giggling and chatting even as I was paying. I will never go back to Bosa Donuts. They need to have there employees respect customers , not make fun of them in an other language.I was very insulted being a citizen of this country , why do I have to go out of my way to figure out their culture etc. They should be speaking in ENGLISH , not Thai or what language it was , it is very RUDE.
Customer service is horrible. Came in to buy a fronto leaf. Get home to find that it's stale and growing mold inside. Drive all the way back to EXCHANGE it for another. The clerk returns my $ but would not allow me to buy another one. Not sure what his deal was. I was 100% polite and professional. Completely unnecessary for him to treat me like that.
I'm in Tucson, but was willing to make the drive to Phoenix if the right car was available. What looked like the right car was posted at this dealership. I called and communicated I was in Tucson but interested in the car. The woman was very friendly and expressed this was a great find. There were four long shots of the exterior posted, but no interior shots. She worked to get me interior shots, which was appreciated. I spoke with the dealership three times - two of the three times I asked if there was any damage, etc., I should know about. Both times nothing specific was mentioned, so we made the two hour trek north.When we arrived, we saw immediately that the car had a four inch gash on the back passenger door - like a car door had hit it - it was damage I would have expected to be mentioned during my previous conversations with them. I understood that I was buying a used car and was prepared for some dents, but this was deep. My husband  has rehabbed many cars and determined this would not be fixed by paintless dent repair - the dealership disagreed, but said they would not fix it. We called our friend who assesses auto body damage, explained the damage, and he said the repair would be in the $600-800 range. We suggested that they could adjust the price to accomodate us having to fix it. The sales guy agreed that seemed reasonable and went to the finance guy. He came back with the full sales price. They said they had already spent $2,800 fixing it when they normally spend $1,800. We then asked what was wrong with it - they said they preferred to think of it as them fixing the problems for us (except the door). The two primary items they listed as having been fixed were the tires and the 40,000 mile inspection. Tires are expensive, no doubt, but not $2,800 expensive. And the car had 47,000 miles on it - meaning the previous owner went 7,000 miles over the due date for the inspection. This expense should not have been held against the new purchaser. After some haggling, they offered $200 off. We walked ... then drove two hours home.Glad I held out and found the perfect car elsewhere.
Do not come here if you are hungry.  We waited 10 minutes before someone sat us. After ordering our drinks it took 15 minutes to see our sever again to order food. After we ordered food it took 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive. I have never waited 30 minutes for tortilla chips and spinach artichoke dip. The server warned me that the bowl was hot. The bowl was very hot but the center of the dip was still refrigerator cold...... I informed the server and she said she would be back with another.  15 minutes later she arrived with ANOTHER cold dip. I changed my order and waited.... after another 45 minutes without our entree we asked for a manager. After 10 minutes no manager showed up and we left without our food. If you own a tv and a microwave save your time and money, just cook at home. All these guys do is use a microwave and they cannot even handle that. I should also mention that the restaurant was not even half full. They will receive none of my business. ...
I have booked with this car rental company for the May long weekend, and just less than one week prior to my booking, they emailed me to say that they have to cancel my reservation due to some system error. That's not cool.
Let me tell you about this place.  Not only am i 2 hours still waiting for my delivery.  when i called i got pretty much yelled at for asking the eta for my food. i mean its two hours. i hope my food doesnt come cold. The male that i talked to didnt even look up my name, instead bluntly yelled out "yea" many of times then hung up. I called like 5 more times and no one answered.  Now to talk about when the delivery actually showed.  The driver was very sketching. I was paying cash and he didnt even know my total.  He was standing there saying "ahh umm hmm. 17 18.. eh how about you just give me 20 bucks."  I was givin no receipt.  I been in the food industry for a long time now to know that he probably pocketed the money.  I was also missing the chips and salsa that i ordered.  The food is like miniatures. 1 Little rolled taco the size of my finger. 1 tostada the size of my palm.  The most itty bitty taco i have ever seen and the chicken meat in the middle was so over cooked it was like plastic. The pepes platter was like 9 bucks for all that waste.  No offense but the food was so bad, i didnt even bother calling to complain. because trust me i do not want to eat there food ever again.My whole entire experience here was the worst ive ever had.  LOL  Your whole resturant should just close down.  Its so pathedic. I got pictures. can i post pictures on here?At least you hit my number one place NEVER to go to again. Is there a 0 star button?#ElMolinoMexicanCafe You make scottsdale look bad...
I was totally dis-satisfied with the service provided. The barber seemed to be in a hurry and it took a total of 15 minutes to walk-in, taking haircut, and making payment. I pointed out within 2 minutes of when haircut was started that he is making my hairs too short, and I don't want that. Instead of acknowledging and course correcting, he kept on arguing that he is professional and he knows how my haircut will look perfect in the end. When I said that he seems to be in a hurry, his argument was that he is a perfectionist and he doesn't waste client's time and judge him when he is done. Well, I am done with this shop and judging him now for his arrogance and behavior. Even at the payment table, when I said that I am not satisfied, the guy argued that he is a professional and he thinks that my hair looks perfect and I SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM. Well, you should first listen to your customer. I am not coming back for sure
I have a friend who loves this place, and goes a couple of times a week, but I don't understand the hype.  For the price of a sub-par salad, I could make three salads with all the trimmings without ever sensing the presence of a sneeze guard.  My wife and I both had the Cuban panini, I ordered mine without pickles (which, of course, had the damn pickles on it) and we both were unimpressed with the fillings (though the bread was good).  Later, indigestion was the only sign that we had been there, haunting me through the next morning.  If you want a salad, make a salad, and spare yourself.
If I could give zero stars, I would. Disclaimer: This review is wholly based off of service. I placed a to-go order and upon my return home, realized they forgot my cheese crisp. I'd argue that I shouldn't have to check my order if this was even a mediocre establishment considering they read my order back to me when picking up, but fine, I'll take the hit, my fault for not checking. I had my wife call to let them know they forgot our cheese crisp while I drove back. They confirmed that it would be ready when I got there. Upon my return, not only was our cheese crisp not ready, they had the audacity to ask me if I was sure they didn't give it to me. After waiting for them to actually make a cheese crisp, I headed home. When unpacking the remainder of our dinner, nothing was correct in regards to the substitutions we made. I had red sauce instead of the green I specifically ordered. No added shrimp on one of our dishes. No side of sour cream. No guacamole. The entire restaurant lacks any degree of even mediocre service. When you can't even get the most basic of details for an order, it's pure laziness and lack of care for your patrons. DO NOT GO HERE. The lack of service, the mediocre food, and the relatively exorbitant prices are not worth your time or money. This place deserves to fester and die for its serious lack of...well...everything. You'd be better off at Chipotle. At least they get your order right.
This is the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL company I have had to deal with. Total was $70.00 and driver charged $90.00 for tip without my consent. I have called their office several times to see how we can resolve this issue and they continue to hang up on me. First time I called, the woman answering the phone couldn't stop laughing and sounded like she had food in her mouth. She answered the phone by saying "yeah?". I am so displeased and overall disgusted with this "company". Do NOT waste your time and/or money with them.
From the moment we walked in we should of just left. It took 5 minutes for the hostess to even acknowledge us with no wait. When we gave our names, mind you it was just me and my husband her response on wait time was, I'll let you know. The restaurant was half full but it took 15 minutes to seat us. Waiter started off great took our order right away and the. It then went awry again. People say after us were getting there appetizers and drink refills. Waitress comes over and says there was a problem our order was never sent to the kitchen. Mistakes happen I get that no harm done. BUT it took 25 minutes for them to acknowledge the mistake as me and my husband sit there twiddling our thumbs. She puts the order in but gets our appetizer wrong. It was nachos... So 45 minutes happen and we get our appetizer and she tells us the manager will be over to talk to us and discount our meal. Never happened. So we get our entrees and finish them and have to sit another 15 minutes after staring at everyone else getting service when we are ignored. We finally got a box from a different server we flagged down as ours was no where to be seen. Ours finally makes her way over to us and gives us our "discounted" bill. They took off 5 dollars. I kid you not. Never going here again.
One of the things Publix prides itself on are their employees. Today I experienced one of the most rude employees I've ever experienced at a Publix store. My wife called snd spoke with the manager, who didn't seem to care.I won't be back.
Very unhappy with dishonest service by Adrian.  I have rented cars for almost 40 years and not once have I signed up for insurance because I use premium credit cards that provide complete insurance.  This includes all prior rentals with Enterprise.  When I rented car, I had a severe of eye strain form looking at computer and from Vegas dust, making me unable to focus close up due to watery eyes.  I told Adrain that I could not read the fine print in contract and that I had full insurance coverage, so I asked to waive all coverages.  Instead, he had me initial each of the boxes, signing up for coverage, which I explicitly told him multiple times I did not need or want.When I returned car, the bill was way higher than I expected, but I could still not read fine print.  The guy at counter explained he could waive 1 day of insurance, but not the other days, when I explained that I had refused coverage verbally, but Adrain had me sign boxes that I was unable to read.  Very dishonest....
Delivery:The crust was soggy,the box was full of a liquid  every slice fell apart,the salad was a joke I weighed it and it was only 3 ozs,what a rip off Don't waste your $ on this dump.
Very bad service. The girl at reception desk is confused and lazy.  The waitress was very rude and acted as if she owned the place. She gave us wrong info about their specials. She did not know the menu! The place is VERY old and did not look like it was updated in years however it does have a nice view. Workers do not smile. The salad was not fresh. It was kinda soggy and tasteless. $2 extra for some blue cheese on my salad ?!! The steak and lamb chops tasted good. The food is definitely overpriced. Overall, i do not recommend this restaurant.
I called and placed an order for 2 veggie burros because I'm a vegetarian got about a third of the way into one and there was MEAT in it. Also a veggie burro is suppose to have cheese which it did not and fresh avocados in it but instead it had the pico de avocado and they did not tell me this would be substituted. Just ended up throwing them away. Also the first time I called a girl named Hailey answered the phone but said the wrong address and then said "wait what" and hung up on me so I had to call again and a different employee answered the phone. Very disappointed in this Someburros location. The one at 101 E. Baseline Rd. in Tempe is much better!
A group of us from work spent $10 on a Groupon and went for lunch.  The waitress was extremely upset that we had Groupons and CURSED at one of us when she found out we were using them. After she scanned all our vouchers she tells us that we are losing the remaining amounts left on the voucher. If we knew that before hand we all wouldnt have used our vouchers at once.  Overall terrible experience.  She should have educated us about how to make the most of the groupon rather than getting upset and cursing. I've never been so appalled with service in my entire life. The food was approrpriately priced for lunch and was pretty good. If it wasn't for the terrible service we would be back again.
I guess I have to leave a 1star minimum EVEN THOUGH I was ridiculed, for being there during open hours and had cash stolen from me by Lamonte the smog attendant who lied to my fiance's face and stole my money. I showed up at 5:29 knowing they're open until 6 p.m. . Lamonta comes out shaking his head looks at me and says you're what I call a do it at the very end of the day kind of guy, a last-minute guy. I said I apologize I worked 10 hours today and this was the only time I could come by. However your website and sign says that you're open until 6pm He then looked at my car and shook his head again and complained that my car, a 94 Honda Accord was the kind of car that required a tailpipe test he clearly did not want to do that. He then stomped around my car opening and closing doors and gas cap door making every check possible to try and fail my car which it did not my car passed as it always does.  I had a coupon and gave it to him along with the $20 bill when he told me it was $17. I said here is another 20 to use on my fiance's vehicle, her minivan was behind me online and according to lamonta she was another last minute person, she has a coupon as well when you're done give her the $6 in change. When her vehicle was done my fiance asked for the change and he said no and kept it or rather, STOLE IT. In addition A car pulled up and by this time it's only 5:45 and he turned him away. This guy is a criminal, lazy and cannot be trusted. I've since called the general managers number three times and left messages to no end and no response DO NOT take your car to this place they're rip offs and thieves !!!
Went there on 8/13/12  Was the worst chicken we ever ate. After our first couple of bites my wife and i looked at each other and both said this chicken doesn't taste right. In fact it tastes like it was spoiled, we just threw the rest away. Was not planning on going back anyway, the service was just as bad as the chicken and its very expensive for what you get considering on those 3 blocks of rainbow there is cane's, Popeye's, albertsons, el pollo loco, and the worst church's. Now I know why its called Church's because you have to pray you don't get sick.
Everytime I come here they're slow the service is low quality and last time I went through drive-thru and they didn't even give me the utensils to eat the meal. Roberto's used to be really good but all Dave done is raise their prices and lower their quality of food and higher bad staff just another company's going downhill due to Greed.
Chicken and shrimp over cooked no Popeyes sweet tea or jambalaya. Not a great Popeyes restaurant.
Why doesn't anyone answer the phone at this location??  I'm trying to make an appointment for a passport.
This company has not paid me my final payroll, as of now its two  months. This is not the way a company should treat people, it's not nice or right!
Went here for a birthday dinner because I wanted to experience Schnitzel...and I am still on the hunt for a proper Schnitzel. Wurst is a good looking place which tries to cover the fact that there food is not so up to par. I mentioned to one of the staff that I did not enjoy my meal and she just shrugged it off trying to defend the place. The portion sizes are not that great either for a "German" bar restaurant, so don't go if you are looking for a good German meal. The service  was great though.
Young guy cleans my pool. Comes on Fridays. Sometimes early, sometimes not; sometimes NOT AT ALL. My gate is usually locked, and I admit I sometimes forget to unlock it. However, I work from home and I am here ALL DAY. This guy can very easily ring my doorbell and ask to be let in, but he doesn't even bother. He'll write a shitty note and leave it on my door. I haven't seen him 8 out of the last 12 weeks. I have refused to pay my bill for the weeks he hasn't serviced my pool. Now they say I owe $270. My pool is dirty. He didn't even come today to clean and I did unlock it at 7:30am. When he does come he doesn't clean out my filter. I am required to pay to keep the pool up by the terms of my lease and he's not maintaining it and therefore causing me to be in violation of my contract. My husband & myself have called the office and left messages and we never get any response from anyone. I am beginning to think this business is a sham.
If I could give this Walmart negative starts I would give them many! They are rude, and will not price match anything! Every time they have a reason. Other walmarts price match, but they resist every time! I would never step foot in this Walmart again, and I suggest you stay away from this store! Go to Bashas, they are way better!
This is the SLOWEST BK I have EVER been to! I take my breaks there once in a while but the wait is sooo long I always have to eat on the run! I ordered the new "Turkey Burger" and it was HORRIBLE!! Both my boyfriend and myself ordered them and BOTH of us about got sick with the smell! After taking one discusting bite (to give it a chance) we immediately told the manager it was awful. He told us they had not tried it....but never offered to exchange it! We needed to eat so we each got a chicken sandwich but we had to PAY FOR IT! I believe it should have been offered to us atleast with a discount! (we paid 3.99 for each turkey burger!). We left the turkey burgers on the counter and they threw them out, but we left discusted. I took the survey offered and told of our experience. I also wrote customer relations of BK but didn't even get a response.  I will never go back to this BK and warn all of you .... there are plenty of other BK's around the area where I am SURE they would offer you a cheeseburger if your food was unedible!!! The staff and managers are who make the "chain stores" so I will now visit the Elliott and Kyrene or Ray and Dobson store where you are treated like the "Queen" to BK's "King"!!! LOL! :)
If I could give this place negative stars I would. The radiologist cancelled the appointment for a study where the referring doctor ordered an exam that was not going to yield a higher amount for them. For example: ordering a diagnostic mammogram is an upcharge than a screening mammogram for radiology departments. It's the same exam but for diagnostic the radiologist shows his presence for a brief moment and the screening is more cost effective exam with the same outcome where a doctor reads is. Another exam: CT chest for lung nodules -- the radiologist at PMI will only perform the test with Contrast. A person is subjected to more radiation and same exam yielding the same results in without contrast was ordered. Dr Eisenberg cancelled the procedure and was sent away.HORRIBLE!!!!
What a nightmare this store was today. First at the pharmacy I'm next in line but have to wait 10 minutes while a solo cashier is open. She had to go back 3 times to correct a problem but they decided not to open another register as 10 other pharmacists and assistants stood in the back
I used to see Lynn Kasch, whom I liked very much.  Unfortunately, he retired.  A day or two before he retired, I called his office asking for a referral for a specialist because I was having a very serious issue going on.  Since mid September, I've made several calls to his office asking when I could expect the referral, only to be told it will be mailed to you.  Today is Oct 24, 2017 and I still have yet to get the referral.  Really disappointed with the staff there.  The doctors are double booked and over worked.  Will not be going back, ever.  They obviously do not care about their patients health or well being.
Unbelievable.  It's 5pm on a Sat.  I have a page out of the Teacher's Health Trust that says they are open to 7pm.  My 9-year old daughter has strep. What is that, 5 minutes to write a prescription?  They said the doctor is there alone, so they want to clear out the office.  Nice way to care about your fellow man, heartless bastards!  What goes around comes around. Hope you get what you deserve over there!
This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me. My food was cold (especially the curly fries) leading me to believe that they had prepared my food and then left it sitting while they prepared the order for the car ahead of me. No thanks!
Stupid, rude waitress. Didn't even understand what I said. It's okay if you didn't listen properly but shifting the blame to customers is just unacceptable. I don't care how old you are, but that's just poor customer service
This place used to be better :( The most recent visit I had was pretty bad. The fish tasted disgusting, my broccoli was old, and my mashed potatoes were dry.The cheese biscuits are still good though!
I called this location on Friday September 8th at about 8:30pm to see if they have the pumpkin spice glazed doughnut so as I began to ask the person who answered the phone they hang up on me so I thought maybe she couldn't hear me and hung up, so I called back 4 times after that and no answer, very unprofessional!
Lunch review. Will not be coming back for lunch. Calamari salad was good but needed xtra avacodo. Shrimp and Grits was bad. They used small and ugly shrimp and the sausage suck. Chicken sandwich was dry. Tuna gyro was over cooked with no taste and thier crab and pasta salad tasted like garbage. The service was awesome.
I'm not sure if I will be back. Some of the shrimps in one of our dishes still had some tails on which was hard to tell since they were breaded and had sauce on it. It is an unpleasant thing to chew on!! The chicken was way too lemony. The pot stickers were too crunchy, the sushi was warm. We had also ordered the lettuce wraps and the amount of meat in general in all our dishes was mediocre. The vegetable was also grated carrot basically. You had to look for the other vegetable . Quite disappointing!
Worst gluten free food ever! All the baked goods are greasy, gritty & flavorless. Just gross & way over priced!
Absolutely worst experience ever. Produce is over priced, staff is rude. Probably not coming back here. Staff would not help wife with two toddlers. Got on intercom to ask them to move tables instead of asking in person them (tables were wide open and not used). And best yet, the Costco strawberries taste better. Avoid if you can.
A week after sending an email to Flamingo concerning a very disappointing experience at the resort, I have yet to hear from anyone regarding the matter.  Just one more strike against the Flamingo.  Below was my original post concerning Flamingo.We travel to Vegas a few times a year, and after many years of avoiding it, we decided to give Flamingo another try.  After another less than fantastic experience, we can say that location and value were the only things we found appealing about our stay at Flamingo.  Neither of factors are appealing enough to get us to return to Flamingo.  If traveling with a teen, the pool is basically non existent because of the fact that there is a 21+ pool and a pool for kids and those with kids.  The under 21 pool is small and overflowing with 5 to 8 year olds; definitely not a welcoming sight for adults or teens.  The dining options at Flamingo are lacking in comparison with other resorts, however, its location makes it easy to access the better food options in the area.  The AC unit in our room was not working upon arrival.  It took us a night to realize this because we spent most of the day after arriving on Fremont St.  When we notified guest services of the discomfort in our room, "Thanks for letting us know," was the response we were first given.  After prodding them, they agreed to send someone to the room to try to fix it.  This didn't happen.  When checking out, we reiterated our displeasure with the conditions and their lack of attending to it, and we were told that we didn't bring it to their attention because it was not recorded in their computer.  In the end, we were comped the resort fee for one night out of four ($28).  Absolutely an unacceptable resolution to the situation.  After telling them that we were displeased with their attempt, or rather their lack of attempt, at resolving the issue, they told us that if we have problems in our next stay at the Flamingo, to let them know right away; again implying that we did not notify them of the problems to begin with.  We quickly informed them that we would not be staying with them again, and they seemed to have absolutely no problem with that.  I highly recommend thinking twice before staying at Flamingo.
My Camaro ss was involved in a collision due to a vehicle running a red light and hitting me in the passengers side rear quarter. Gieco and brighton collision center were both beyond helpful and did great work on my car (had to return a second time for some minor tweaks to get it to my liking but they handled it for me without question) so why the one star overall you ask.. I had a very expensive gopro camera stolen from my vehicle while it was being fixed! Maybe it was their tow truck driver, maybe it was one of their shops employees.. I don't know. But what I do know is it happened in the time it was taken from me and I got it back from brighton. No solution was attempted to resolve this other than gieco telling me to file a second claim and pay a second deductible to be compensated for my camera.. I'll just buy a new gopro to save myself the hassle, just very dissatisfied with the theft. Hope this saves someone from loss of personal property!
i have been to this place 5 times......EVERY time i feel like i get treated differently than everyone else. Most of their clients are as we call them "gringos" I immediatly notice the differnent attention I get for being a latina...............but it still does not stop me from buying their amazing cakes. ive tried all of them best is the whitechocolate raspberry, worst is lkemon tastes like made out of a box.
We really wanted to like this place!! We love Ground Control in Litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in Surprise. Unfortunately this didn't live up to the hype. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table. We asked to be moved and you'd think we asked to move to the moon. They put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird). We ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share. The "beer cheese" was really bad. It tasted like it came from a jar...they need to try the Mellow Mushroom beer cheese!! The burger was small and bland, fries were greasy. With two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! What a waste. We won't be back.
What ever happened to the customer is always right?I have several life-threatening allergies that make dining out a challenge at times.  I travel with a detailed (bilingual) card outlining all my allergies and always present it to the server before ordering my meal. More often than not, the server will check with the chef before I order and I am presented with options. 5 Saisons WAS one of my favourite local restaurants and I have eaten there many many times.  Up till now.  Last night, we ordered the same dishes we always do - and were shocked!My meal came visibly swimming in allergens.  Thankfully, I noticed and the plate was returned to the kitchen.  The next attempt was equally poisonous.  The waiter acted put out and aggravated and even asked if it was a bad allergy!  (We told him I stop breathing within minutes!)When we complained about the issue - one of food safety - it was very rudely pointed out to us that we got our food, so the problem was solved. I spoke to the manager who told me to do whatever I want.  So I am!Food allergies are serious.  THey are not food preferences.  Those of us who live with the risk of anaphylaxis understand it is a risk and inconvenient and make our choices carefully.  We inspect our food before ingesting.  We understand that mistakes happen.  But we should not be forced to accept rude, poor and dangerous service.I understand the restaurant business is difficult and that picky eaters are unpleasant to deal with but I still do remember a day when the customer was right.
Went for lunch.  My second time there.  Waited 25 minutes for one roll.  Waitress said there was a miscommunication between her & the chef.  Asked to have some food boxed up.  Waitress took the plate & never came back with the box of left overs.  She said she threw it away.  Manager said the best they could do is $2.00 off the bill.  Oh, and I overheard the next booth complaining & wanting to see the manager.Never again Momo!!!!!!
Startlingly bad experience. Went for dinner and ordered a breakfast burrito (the standard: egg, cheese & ham in a tortilla). First bite in I hit eggshell. SIgh. But, okay, it happens. Then, a few bites later, more eggshell. Then it happened a third time. I cut open the burrito and found another piece of shell that would have covered most of a dime. So I went to the counter and asked for a manager. There isn't one, I was told. An owner? Nope. So I described the problem to three women who were up front and showed them the shell. They stared at me like I had a second head. So I gave up and rejoined my wife. But then I got annoyed and went back and said I wanted a refund -- after all, I'd given back most of the burrito. The clerk said, "Let me call the manager." Yeah. I waited there to talk to this mystery manager but heard that she was too busy to talk to me. That's the kind of people who work there and who run the place.
These rooms are dumps!! For 200.00$ you would think they would give you a decent room. The walls are dirty, the carpet is ripped, the bedding had holes in it. I will never stay here again. Don't come here!! Oh! There are only 2 elevators working so the lines to get to your room are about 15 mins long!!!
So far, not a happy customer.  I am only able to give this rating in regards to the reservations I made.  I made reservations for a bigger party (14 people) and had these reservations well over one month in advance.  I received a phone message today letting me know that my reservations are to be canceled and to call the Hofbrauhaus back.  I have called 4 times with no answer and was finally transferred to the hostess desk to be greeted by a voicemail.  I am not pleased with the fact I have been canceled on for such a large reservation for an important event.  I am also upset that I received this info by voicemail without an explanation and have yet to actually get in touch with the restaurant to understand what the meaning is.  As of right now, I have no desire to ever make a reservation or even stop by this place for a drink.  Hopefully, this will be cleared up and I can change this review to a better one - but I believe first impressions are important.
Great childhood memories but absolutely horrible pizza & customer service Tuesday night! If I could leave NO stars I would. Both our pies had no cheese or at least not enough to be considered pizza. When we called to complain the young man did NOT want to hear it & firmly stated all ingredients are weighed out period. Left my name & # for the manager/owner to call me (because he was too busy) and still have received nothing. I WILL NEVER GO BACK
I'm from New Jersey, and was a police officer. I have met my share of rude people. Having  said that I have to say that this man is the rudest  and  the most condescending a** hole I have ever met. I was dumbfounded at the extent of his rudeness and his insults.  To top it off his store is a rat hole filled with 99% crap and junk. Do yourself a favor, do not even go in there.  AGAIN.......do not go in there. And most certainly do not buy anything from this J**K A**.   Such a shame that I had to actually post a star to get my comment posted. Yelp should change this because if anyone deserves no stars, it's this j**k a**!!!!
I used to love this place until today - I called and made a reservation for 3 one week in advance only to be told when I got there that my name is not on the list When I said that I was told this was a confirmed reservation, the rude hostess said that since I didn't get a call it meant it was a no goI think this place has started thinking way highly about themselves with really poor form of dealing with their customers RUDE
I typically don't write reviews but I went out to El Hefe May 25th for my birthday, I reserved a table with 2 bottles two weeks prior along with my friends. We got there around 11pm and spent almost $1,000.00 only to be asked to come down from our table around 12:30am because it had been resold after we finished our bottles. Long story short, do not buy bottle service from this place. Specially from Xavier who's the one that resold our table.
I'm British so I have been to my fair share of pubs and this is an utter joke! The menu is a relic of 70s greeb fare that would even make a Wetherspoon's look gourmet. The barmaids look utterly silly in their outfits and the décor is absolutely hilarious! Don't fool yourself for a moment if you consider this a cultural experience. It's just another Las Vegas gimmick out for your quid (money)!
I really wanted to like this place. I was so excited to check it out. I even held off on purchasing my bow because I wanted to support local businesses and also figured I would get better service and advice from a place like this rather than a big box store like bass. I finally made it in to the store today with plans of purchasing a new hoyt as well as a sight, rest and everything else I needed to be hunt ready. I also brought my 8 year old daughter to sign her up for lessons as she has been showing interest in archery lately. When we walked in we were greeted by nobody. Checked out the thin inventory on their wall and was finally asked what we needed by an employee. I told him I would like to buy a new bow. He said give me a minute. I have him 30 minutes and finally my daughter and I decided to leave. He watched us walk out and did not say a word.  Crazy. Afterwards I was so distraught I reached out to them with a comment on social media describing my experience and my comment was soon after deleted with no response and no message to me. No concern whatsoever. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this place and planned on frequenting there. Looks like my hunt continues for a good spot.
On October 6th me and my husband went to this H&M in the evening. He went to try to some sweaters in the fitting room and I followed him in there. There was a guy who was working the fitting rooms at that time and watched us walk in there without saying anything. About ten minutes later we heard a loud voice yelling at us over all the fitting rooms that only one person was allowed in the dressing room at one time due to 'fire hazards' and she was going to "stand outside until the second person came out and sat on the bench."  I understand now that the policy of H&M is that only one person is allowed in the fitting rooms and I would have happily followed it had someone knocked on the door and told us that or if the guy who was working there in the first place had told us. We felt very embarrassed and disrespected. We didn't even want to buy any clothes at all. This H&M needs to really rethink the people they are hiring because we will NOT be going back to this store and I will definitely be telling my family and friends about our terrible experience. The employee who rudely yelled at us was the only girl I saw working on the H&M men floor. I didn't get her name but she had a dress on, her hair was in a bun and she acted like she might be a manager of some sort.
I don't even want to give one star but you can't post if you don't mark anything so against my better judgement, one star, under protest, it will be.I have to say I will NEVER go back to this place again!!!! I don't know if management has changed but I can tell you that the service here has been continuously declining over the past year and TONIGHT was the W-O-R-S-T!!!! They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it. Even when the place is almost empty, it takes FOREVER to get your sushi. We've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs, meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants, especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe. When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home, at the time the service was excellent and fast, and the quality and quantity was worth the price. Forget that! You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. We ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!! Holy crap, sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER, yes I said AFTER, we did but not our 2 measly rolls. We also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink. Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself. Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well. I finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave. When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something. She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible. She said OK thank you, so we walked out. Hey, wait a minute, I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress. You know, we love, and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills, no pun intended
Liars and Crooks in disguise here.  Grabbed me on my way to pick up my rental from another company.  Offered me a car for $20/day.  Talked me into the insurance after I declined.  I told them I may be a little late returning, they said not to worry as there is a 59 minute grace period, it's only $7/hour for the first 3 hours, then a full day charge.  The total when I walked away from the counter was $63.I returned the car about 25 minutes late, and expected to pay an extra hour.  On the contrary, the guy who processed my return said "no extra charges, have a nice day".  I walked away feeling good, and happy I found a new place to rent from.I got an email of my bill a couple of hours later.  $115.  I called to ask why, and like a robot, the manager Kayla just protected her staff and the charges.  This is bad business and they know it.  Never again, stay away!
Best advise to give, save yourself the time, effort and unnecessary aggravation and just drive to one of the other locations. Do not waste your time here. Not only will you receive the help you need, but any additional information, paperwork etc. that only they are able to provide.
Due to being a loyal Houston's patron, I decided to give Bandera a try because of their direct relationship. The difference was night and day... Bandera's servers were very inattentive and almost rude regarding all aspects of communication during my dining experience. My filet was mediocre at best and not worth the price tag. This place gave off a very cold and insincere vibe. I will most definitely not be returning.
I have never written a poor review in my life, but I felt compelled to say something. During my time of service, everything was great. Water was delivered on time, they called ahead, I had zero complaints. I was needing to move with my job from AZ to CA, so I cancelled the service.First off I have never called into Customer Service without waiting at least 15 minutes on hold.  Secondly, the rude customer service agent told me I had 10 bottles missing that I was going to get charged for. I told her this is impossible as I only get 2 bottles every two weeks (and always put them out front). She was very combative and rude and said she would work to resolve the problem. I said thank you, and then the next day she charged me for all 10 bottles. I waited another 27 minutes on hold when I had the charge, and they were still insistent. Please be sure you keep up to date on your bottles as they will screw you if their accounting system is off.
went two nights ago. Upcharge for Martini was $2.00 for Smirnoff bringing it to $8.00. Salmon was the salty side of the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea. Worst we have ever had despite the manager saying it was the best. Green chile was good but again salty. My wift threw up upon getting home. Will not return. The $15.00 coupon was not worth it.
Worst KFC I've ever been in. Restrooms are horribly maintained. Always out of things.
I am cancelling my newspaper. The Az, Republic should be ashamed of itself for endorsing Clinton. 126 years hugh!!  It's a shame money dictates it all doesn't it . People afraid there money train will change. We are really disappointed  but not surprised. The people in this country want change & we will have it, remember- By the people for the people!
Restaurant was deserted. Almost didn't go in but did after 10mins of peeping in bc didn't want to spend too much money. Had to keep calling waitress for napkins, to order, for drinks. Came here with 6ppl total. Ordered 5 dishes to share. All we tasted was salt. A bit too oily, too. Seemed like a family business that is too comfortable like at home and not like a restaurant environment. Better off going to Panda Express bc it's good and you don't have to pay tips for bad service.
This was the worst experience with a company I have ever encountered. I hate that I even have to give a star! I purchased the living social deal for 2 movers for two and a half hours and a 27 foot truck. I called and left 3 messages on the voicemail before talking to a person. When I set up the appointment for 2p, I was given a window that it could be as late as 4. At 330, I received a call from the owner that they were picking up my truck and would be on their way. About 5 minutes later, I received a call that there was not a truck and a mover had passed out, but I would definitely be moved before that night. I called several more times, with no answer. At 930p I finally spoke to someone who had excuse after excuse. I asked if they were canceling and if I would receive a discount. I was told they would still come after midnight and that I would "definitely NOT" receive a discount and then I was hung up on. I have three small kids and only had one day to get everything moved and was extremely disappointed. If you want your belongings to actually be moved, never call this company!!!
My husband and I went here yesterday for our first and only time. To start, the place reminded me Chipotle or Qdoba, but not. It seemed to have some type of structural problem. In the middle of the dining area there was a section blocked off. I ordered the bean(pinto) and cheese burrito combo(drink &fries) and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito combo. We never got a receipt, that is my #1 pet peeve when it comes to fast food dining. I have been overcharged at many "berto"s style restraunts in the past. They have a skimpy selection of soft drinks and the condiment/ drink area looked kind of sloppy. There were no forks, no black pepper and the knives were all sitting "blade" up, which is kinda gross. Our burritos came in baskets, the amount of french fries was equivelent to what you would get with a child's meal @ McD's, dissapointing. The tortillas were dry and flaky. My beans were whole, unmashed, and pretty watery, so it was hard to taste the cheese. I was told upon ordering my burrito came with pico and sour cream which was not in my burro when I got it. My husband's burrito came with black beans, mushy white rice, pico, sour cream, and of course carne. He said it was flavorless and had to add hot sauce for flavor. We decided then the place sucked and we wouldn't return. Then it got worse...We both got sick about 6 hours later. To keep it vague, intense lower GI issues. NOT pleasant.**UPDATE- exactly one day after my review, Nov 23rd, I received this message "Hello, We are so sorry for you terrible experience. It's not what we are committed to. Not at all. I realize you didn't get a receipt, but if you remember the approximate cost of your meal, we will send you a check to refund your money. Thanks, Vanessa Shaw, the Owner"I sent Vanessa my address that same day and have yet to receive a check from Bueno Burger. AGAIN, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! WHY DID SHE EVEN CONTACT ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?
WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! I GOT SHRIMP A LA PUBE HAIR. So I just left this roach motel and I am sick so I am letting people know. I went there because my co-worker heard it was ok. Unfortunately for me I paid before eating so the chairs all have holes in them and the place looks creepy and no one, and I do mean no one, speaks English, which would not have been a problem  had not pulled hair from my food! I had not eaten very much when I asked for the manager, who I now refer to as, "Chow Mein". She was the rudest monster I have ever seen, and I watch horror films. Chow Mein screamed at me in Chinese and refused to do anything. Unfortunately, since I had paid already ofcourse she would not give me back my money or do anything to make up for the fact that her hair was in my food. All she did was scream at me. The waitress even told her that I did not eat and was there to witness me pull the hair from my food and Chow Mein was mad at the waitress for admitting it was in my food. Needless to say I urge you to eat anywhere else but here! i am sick and I may leave work early because my stomach is so upset.
1 hour and 30 minutes later and we still don't have our food. Haven't seen our original waitress. Was told it was because "big" parties were here. There was a six top that was seated in front of us and we were skipped. Didn't get our drinks for 20 minutes. People who were seated after us were done and paid before we even got our food. Won't be returning.
I took my daughters to Petco recently to consider purchasing a hamster.  My girls were heartbroken as their two year old hamster had died about a week earlier.  An employee was paged to come and assist us.The first thing Stephan said to us was, "Are you going to buy the hamster.?"  I said, "What kind of question is that?"  Stephan said, "Its store policy that we can't pull the hamster out unless you are going to buy it."I told Stephan, "We can't even see the hamster as he's completely concealed in his shelter."  My girls were becoming noticeably upset by his resistant attitude so we left.I called Petco at 888-824-7257 to share our experience.  The person I was speaking to had difficulty understanding me and I had difficulty understanding him due to a language barrier.  I asked him to transfer me to someone more fluent in English.  After waiting on hold for a long time, I hung up.As an American, I don't appreciate being outsourced to the Philippines to express concerns here in the United States.  Petco and Stephan would do well to remember the retail adage, "Without the customer you don't exist."  As palsrewards members we find this unacceptable and will take our business elsewhere.
The name of this place should be changed to Gross & slow, I meant to write avoid this place YUCK !!! They just do not know how to cook anything.
For a place that has such wonderful reviews, I expected both good food and good service. The food was unexceptional, but I did not try the entire menu, so my review is not negative for that reason alone. The service is what motivates this negative review: it was terrible. I do not know whether we had a new hire--a fast speaking fellow that wore red framed glasses--but it was apparent upon our first introduction that he didn't have much time for us. The real indication arose when we (my date and I) received a lackluster artichoke marinated in vinegar. It looked and tasted like something pre-prepared at the grocery store. I gave it a try, hoping that it might taste better if I tried the heartier bits, but it was no use. It sucked. We left the artichoke untouched, expecting an inquiry by our server as would be common at most high end restaurants. We waited, and waited, until the server came to take our plates away. He finally asked how it was, and we told him we didn't like it at all. He took our other plates and left this grocery store concoction on our table. We waited again. We discussed between ourselves whether there was some miscommunication, so we awaited the waiter's return. When he arrived, he asked if we wanted him to take our untouched artichoke. We said yes, and tried to imply what he should do. We very kindly asked if we could have another appetizer instead. He didn't seem to understand, so we said it again. At this point, he seemed visibly annoyed. He asked point blank, "so are you saying you want Empanadas?" Assuming he'd understood our plea--or just hoping--I said yes. He returned with them; they were alright. And then the check arrived. There I was greeted with the charge for those nasty artichokes in addition to the Empanadas. I was perplexed. I flagged our waiter, and reminded him that he forgot to take the artichoke off our bill.  He was even more perplexed, and visibly annoyed. He asked, "didn't you order that?" Yes, we did, but it was terrible, and we spoke about this already! He sharply exclaimed that he'd talk to his manager. He must have because the bill was quickly and hardly plopped on our tabletop without a word or look from the waiter. The artichoke billings had vanished as quickly as our resolve to return. I hope this was an aberration. But I wouldn't feel comfortable returning to possibly run into our friend with the red-rimmed spectacles.
Awful customer service... AWFUL. Like I don't care about your safety awful.  DO NOT STAY HERE FIND ANOTHER PLACE IN DOWNTOWN VEGAS. I stayed here last year for Punk Rock Bowling we figured it might be a cheaper Golden Nugget since it still had a pool and the place was huge. Boy, was I in for a surprise. I reserved a smoking room, a friend of mine also had another smoking room. We both got there at the same time since we carpooled. We get non smoking rooms. We ask why their reply "We already filled up the smoking rooms we only have non smoking". Ok then why have us reserve anything in the first place.... kinda annoying but whatever we can smoke in the casino I guess right?Rooms are whatever, at least they look kinda cleanish but what does that matter when we're out partying all night and just using using the room to sleep and nurse our hangovers just do it all over again.Second day I wake up to a banging and the sound of a door jiggling. I think maybe its my hotel roomie half awake/ still drunk trying to get in. When I get up I notice she's passed out in her bed too. The room next door is banging on the door that connects our room and TRYING TO OPEN IT. WHAT THE HELL!? Call management. They go in and talk to the other room which denies it. I ask to have my room changed. I tell them I don't feel safe. "Sorry we can't do that". What about my belongings I ask.. "there's a safe by the bathroom" Thanks... its about the size of an iPhone... The issues with the room next door continue. Its not funny anymore and I'm genuinely scared to be in my own hotel room. I ask a friend to stay with us and tell him what was going on. We call management again. We all talk about it AGAIN. I tell them how unhappy and unsafe I feel in this room. I get denied another room AGAIN.Our last day.It happens again. This time our friend gets up and sternly tell them to stop. Goes outside and knocks on their door to try and see what is going on. Nothing happens but we can hear movement from next door. It doesn't happen anymore. I finally get home happy that I don't have to fear for my life anymore when I go to sleep and what do I see on my credit card bill.. an additional fee from Plaza Hotel. I call and ask what it was about. " Management saw you with an additional person in the room." ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? YES, BECAUSE YOU ASSHOLES DIDN'T DO SHIT ABOUT 2 GIRLS BEING HARASSED EVERY DAY IN YOUR HOTEL. After a couple of minutes going back and forth and speaking to one manager then another I've officially had it and Im tired of repeating the same story. They have no record of what happened with the room next door and the times that we spoke to management. But some how they know that our friend stayed with us because we felt scared to be alone. Charged me the extra money so that I could feel safe in your piece of shit hotel because YOU didn't do anything about it. Thanks Plaza. I hope you get shut down. You're a huge waste of space and judging by everyone else's reviews I'm not the only person that thinks you guys suck.
Use Lyft instead . Download the Lyft app on your I phone and in the payment section put the code Denis322 and your first $25 in rides are FREE !!! It's that easy. And guess what, they show up fast in nice clean cars and are friendly. Try it once and you will never have to subject yourself to these crooks again.
Website advertises Happy Hour from 3-7pm and we were seated and then told only happy hour in the bar. We have a 7 year old and that's not an option. We decided to leave.
Cox is among the worst customer service providers I've ever met in my life. If you have the opportunity to select anyone else to provide cable do so. There is no "customer service." Rather they will give you a series of excuses why they can't help you -- or quote a ridiculous fee associated with what should be routine service.Cox Cable would go out of business were it not a regulated monopoly in the region.
Thirty one minutes waiting in line observing dysfunction and chaos behind the counter--unfortunately all too familiar with this location. When I complained to the manager about the excessive 31 minute wait for an 8 minute meal, he barked back at me about his 150% employee turnover. Perhaps it says something about the management. One employee behind the counter was joking "free sandwiches at Panera" to reduce the line and his work load. I!d encourage all to take his advice. The Chipolte product is great . The service, a disaster. This place needs a major reorganization.
Reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... With that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... Food is mediocre but always frozen ya I can tell.... With that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at Madison's or Boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull
Has to be the WORST fish and chips I have ever eaten.Was in town with some friends and we thought we would try it. CRAP! Can't say anything good about the place. How people love it or how it has stayed in business for so long is beyond me. Frozen right out of the box. Fish is horrible. Shrimp is barely palatable.I'm done, don't want to waste any more time on this place!!!
Horrible customer service. After getting blamed for stealing I emptied my pockets for them to show I didn't take the item. Then the "manager" blames the 2 kids I was with who were 12 and 14 and they also empty their pockets and too no surprise we didn't take nothing. Then I ask him why he continued to look at us like thiefs and he says "I can look at you however I want". Yup that's the autozone customer service right there
If I could give this Jamba Juice 0/5 stars I would. I generally like this location, however today the staff changed that. The staff was uneducated regarding their policies, unable to resolve an issue or even attempt to do so. I got the response "I just work here" Everyone I encountered looked miserable. No one smiled or seemed upbeat. The guy that poured my smoothie asked me how my day was and I told him "horrible" (considering what I had just dealt with when purchasing the smoothie) The guy respond after I said "horrible" he stayed quite and looked down as if not knowing what to say. Someone please tell me what kind of costumer service is that and who is training these kids? The smoothie itself was awful tasting. I buy the same smoothie every time and I know what it's supposed to taste like and what I received today was nothing close to it. It did not taste fresh or sweet. It's one thing to have an awful tasting smoothie and you deal with it because the staff is awesome and you leave with a smile on your face. BUT it's another thing when the costumer service is just as bad if not worse then that awful smoothie. Overall a horrible experience from the lack of costumer service to the disgusting so-called fresh fruit smoothie. I will not be returning to this Jamba Juice location for many reasons and will recommend my friends and family do the same.
The hostess here was such a nasty, rude and untrained mess that I'll never know if the food is as good as it smelled. The words "I'm sorry" and "Let me see what I can do" were never uttered. She acted as if the entire dining experience was really a way for her to get attention. The music was too loud, there was a very tight parking lot and there's just no reason to put up with this kind of nonsense with all the offerings in Phoenix for lunch.
Ok so now this has happened about 5 or 6 times in past month. The staff working in the evenings/nights are very rude and untrained. Ordered an iced caramel latte tonight and they messed that up. Absolutely no caramel????? Its 3 ingredients and not complicated. Went back in to have it fixed and the so called elderly lady that is being paid to manage this establishment was utterly rude and disrespectful and refused to fix my drink. I get this coffee at least 5 to 5 times a week. And for this to continue happening is a shame. As well as it has happened to several of my staff members who I got hooked on your coffee. Not Starbucks and not Dutch bros. Our hard earned money is paying for a product your establishment offers and when a mistake was make failure to solve the issue shouldn't be the customers problem. Time to solve this issue
There should be an option for 0 stars. My wife was in a car accident and came in an ambulance so she went in right away but it took over an hour for someone to examine her. 3 days later she was released after just having a seizure 4 hours earlier and passing out when getting up. Further more no prescription for pain medicine or muscle relaxers. They say just follow up with you primary care physician. She didn't make home before I had to take her somewhere else.
We had our daughter's birthday party at Uptown Jungle today. I would have to say of all the places we have had birthday parties this was by far the worst experience. Our party was from 1-3. When confirming the details of the party we discussed with the party planner the strategy needed in order for us to set up some of our own decorations. She stated that we should arrive 15 minutes early so we could get it done in time, we just needed to let the people working the party counter know what we were doing. Today we arrived 20 minutes early. We were ignored (along with 2 other groups) for the first 10-15 minutes of us standing there with decorations and balloons in hand, hard to miss us. We finally got service and at that time were told that we would be able to have the party room at 2pm and the kids would be jumping from 1-2 then from 2:30-3. We were now stuck with our party decorations for 1 hour, and had no clue that would be our party room time. They tried to accommodate and gave us a room cart to store our belongings on until it was our time for the room. My mother, who was now livid, went over and talked to the manager. He told her that we already new what time we would have the room and it was communicated via email to us prior to the party. After receiving this information I pulled up the emails sent to me and talked with the manager. I asked him to show me where in the emails is stated that we would have the party room at 2pm and I do not appreciate basically being called a liar. He showed me on the email where it states "Your party has 90 minutes of playtime and 30 minutes in the party room." I said I understood how the time would be allotted, but it doesn't state when the party room would be ours. I said according to what was just told to us was we would get to play for 60 minutes, the party room for 30 minutes, and finish with 30 minutes of play. He said no you get 90 minutes of play, then 30 minutes in the party room. I asked how this was possible if our play time started at 1 and the room was ours at 2, that's only 60 minutes. He was not following. He then went to the computer and checked and said our party room time would be at 2:30. I told him to go check the paper where the young woman wrote down 2pm not 2:30. After a little bit of back and forth in a civil manner he stated that the previous weekend. He had the same issue. I stated that the issue would be solved if the wording was "you will start out with 90 minutes of play followed by 30 minutes of the party room." This would have solved the entire issue. I would have known ahead of time when we would have the room and I could have let the elderly guests we had arrive later into the party.Once this was all taken care of we were off to the party. The place is too packed. I understand wanting to make as much money as possible, to have the place as packed as it is was very unsafe. They need to have a certain head count then stop people from coming in until a later time. Since you can continue to buy more time it is imperative to keep track of how many people are there. The kids that supervise the area do not do a very good job. This is the 4th time we have been to this location and every time it is the same thing. No supervision, older kids being too rough with the young kids, and too many people for anyone to truly supervise. During our 90 minutes of play there is no offering of beverages to the kids as they are playing. With the amount of money you pay for a party there is no reason free carafes of water are not offered to the birthday party guests. Instead we spent an additional $60 to have beverages for the children and parents in our party.During the party session we found the rooms to be extremely uncomfortable and warm. The girl helping with the party was not much help. We ended up serving most of the pizza to our guests along with the beverages. She was very helpful with serving the cake though which I feel was only because she wanted to hurry it along.  30 minutes is NOT enough time to eat, open gifts and have cake. The manager told my mom he suggests gifts be opened at home. Why wouldn't the birthday child open their gifts in front of the guests? Once you are in the party room it is just a rushed and stressful situation because of the "time limit".  The plusses are the facility is great for kids 11 and under. There is a lot for them to do and have fun in an indoor environment to help keep them cool while being active.
Management sucks! Manager placed me on hold for over 15 minutes. Never ever going here and I will never recommend it. 2 thumbs DOWN!
Isn't this fantastic that we can voice our real opinions so just maybe this restaurant chain will wake up? Literally hospital cafeteria level quality! Hadn't eaten at a Red Lobster in years. The salad was iceberg lol..shrimp??? Tiny greasy crumb coated cheap junk! My husband's soup was so watered down with zero flavor or any clams to be found, he took it back. I understand this is a chain but come on! Better shrimp at Rubio's tacos!!
40 minute wait, non full restaurant on a Friday night. Waiter, Mike, came right away, but just said hi, he didn't ask for drinks before leaving. Came back in 10 minutes to take order.  Had a sweet tea. Mid drink he topped it off with water.  I questioned him about it and he said it was tea.  Took his time with things, cleaning tables before even being our drinks initially.  Food was ok. Won't come back.
Terrible service. Waitress and hostesses are too concerned with themselves to provide decent customer service. Used to be an average place but has taken a turn for the worse. The food is bland and not authentic,  pairing that with rude servers.. thats a no go
I see all the 5 star reviews and wonder "Why?" If they're going to make me wait an hour and a half for an oil change (with an appointment), at least have comfortable seating and decent wifi. Maybe they treat you better when you don't have a discount card. Will not return but I'm sure they couldn't care less.
What a HUGE waste of time, effort, and money. Save yourself the agony of sitting through this disaster of a "show" and watch a Netflix special instead. My two teenage sons and I were majorly disappointed. They both said that they kept waiting for a "mind freak" but only got a mind f*ck. Luxor should be appalled at this drivel they support. I want my money refunded. Two enthusiastic thumbs DOWN!!!
This place is over priced and under sized. The wait staff doesn't seem to know what a Pho restaurant is. I was in a hurry, so I sat at the bar and gave my entire order. The waiter goes into the kitchen comes back and starts texting and chatting with me. Fifteen minutes later, neither my appetizer or Pho had arrived. I asked what was going on and that I had a time limit. He went back in the kitchen then came back out, punched in my order. I'm sitting three feet from the screen, I can see. The waiter told me the food runner took the food to another table. There was only one other couple there and they had already eaten  no food came out of the kitchen, it's a small restaurant I can see. The cook comes out of the kitchen and prepares my spring roll. Start to finish my spring roll took three minutes. I ate the roll and it was ok. 45 minutes after I ordered my pho had not arrived. Any other pho restaurant, all your food is ready in ten minutes or less. I told the guy I need to leave soon, he tells me that the cook is cooking the steak. IDIOT ALERT!! You serve the steak sliced and raw in hot broth. I had had enough. I was late. I dropped $10 for ONE ROLL and told the waiter that I was leaving for a movie. He said that he could make the order to go. I told him I couldn't take it because of the movie and left. The worst part. I was told very loudly, "Don't come back". Don't worry, I'm not.
Foods just not the same. They changed there red chili and it's nothing like it was. Was recently there for lunch and our waitress was the rudest person. Sound like the family needs to reevaluate what made them who they are.
I think this is my first time I'm actually giving a 1 star in my review and they don't even deserve it. This place is filthy! The girl behind the register, ohhh to tell you I was afraid to drink my smoothie for the fact that I have to watch her make a drink, not wash her hands, and her HAIR is all over the place! Her hair is not even in a bun or a hair net at least and did I mention her hair is thick!!! It took them 5 minutes to say hi or acknowledge the fact that we are staring at them waiting. I WILL NOT COME HERE AGAIN!!!
Dante's hell had nine layers, max & erma's only had two because no-one was risking dessert. There are bad experiences and then there are how can so many things not be right simultaneously.  This is the later.   We taxed the staff with a party of four, complicated by two people arriving later.   The first party ordered an appetizer and this would be high point of the dinner experience.   First problem was the coffee refill that never came. It was requested with the good order of the second half of party.   Or about ten minutes later.   The first two meals were a chicken salad and a black bean burger, they came cold.   The salad was skimpy on dressing and chicken. The black bean burger was not good and worse was the cheap tasting guacamole add the only flavor.   Second problem was two orders of soup taking 20 minutes, but when you order French onion soup, it takes time to Brown the cheese.   Oh wait the cheese wasn't even melted but floating on a slice of bread.   The chicken tortilla soup was awesome (something had to be right).  That French onion soup was a $2 up charge because it only comes in a bowl, not a cup! Here's the surprise the food arrives right after the soup,right after.   So the food is getting cold before you can get to it.   Third problem the Cajun shrimp & pasta should have more than six shrimp for $13.99 and the cream sauce would be nice to have enough to cover the pasta!  The other meal here was Laredo steak and was nothing either good or bad about it.   Well maybe the string beans should be bigger than a piece of twine.   A hour of meal bliss and a talk with manager led to a free meal. But att last the draft beer was good. There are much better places near here like Perkins, arby's, speedway gas station, .....
So, this I my first review. All I'm going to say is ship everywhere except for here. Recently, I sold an item on eBay, made a shipping label, and went to this location. Once I made it to the front desk, I asked the lady if this was were I dropped off packages, she said yes, and I hand here the box. She then looks at is for a few seconds and says "Sorry, we won't deliver this" and then hands it back without telling me what's wrong. I later realized I messed up on the packages weight (thanks for telling me), and by now it's been about 2 days since the buyer bought it and I still haven't shipped it yet. I make a new label, and dropped it off without talking to anyone, they were gonna deliver whether they like it or not. That was last Monday, the 18th, it's now a week later, the 25th, and I have my buyer asking me where the package is. I check online, and the people never scanned it (and possibly never shipped it). I paid for media mail which takes 2-9 days. Hopefully they secretly shipped it without telling me, or else I'm gonna have a claim filed against me. Never coming here again.
Took and out-of-town friend for dinner @7pm before a night out in Plaza Midwood. We were seated quickly at a patio table. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, and watched others be seated, served beverages, and orders taken. I left our table, found the hostess and asked if we had a server. She responded "He got held up but he's coming." We waited, and waited, and waited. The hostess finally came over and took our beverage orders. We waited, and waited, and watched as the other (later seated) tables received their food orders. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Our server finally arrived with our drinks and said "Are you ready?" No apology or acknowledgement of the long wait. My friend asked for fried chicken and was bluntly told "We're out of chicken." I stated "Yes, we're ready. Ready to eat somewhere else." The server seemed dumbfounded and clueless as to why. We left. Absolutely horrible service this evening.
The management of this property is horrible. It was previously managed by Mark Taylor and now by Weidner. I had no problems with previous management company but this new one cant keep a resident if they tried. The worst is the current property manager. I dont think she has an ethical bone in her body or compassion for anyone but herself. You would think they would want to retain residents year after year, instead they just run people out.They like to collect money by fining residents for just about anything you do. They also let the city into the "private" garage to ticket and tow cars. Not to mention when your car is broken into they just shrug their shoulders. I could go on and on about the issues here but im currently looking for a new place to live. Try other properties in the area they are cheaper and cant be any worse than here.PS.  THey like to avoid communicating anything about the multiple suicides that have occurred in the building or jumps from the roof!  A dead body in from of your leasing office needs to be addressed people!
I made a reservation for 16 people several weeks in advance for my bachelor party, and when we arrived the manager refused to honor the reservation. He was rude to myself and the rest of my party. I will never be giving this or any other Hofbrauhaus my business again.
So i went to this taco spot today,i usually go to tacos El Tizon on Eastern and Trop and i love their food,i went over to Roberto's today because i was going to walk to Target afterward.I walked in and got no greeting or hello from the person at the counter she acted like she couldn't understand me,i was tempted to order in Spanish to see if she would make more of an effort but decided against it,maybe as another reviewer suggested living in Los Angeles for years means i am used to a higher standard of Mexican food but i doubt it...........I ordered 7 taco's,three for me in the store and 4 for the hubby for later,when i order taco's at a Mexican place i expect soft corn tortilla with fresh Carne Asada,what i got was deep fried shredded beef tacos with lettuce and cheese......i mean i have literly ordered better taco's at Taco Bell.I immediately went to complain to the girl she said that is how they serve them,they have no soft tacos and that i never asked her anything.I spent $15 on these taco's which i think is alot and i was denied a refund so i left with 6 Taco's i will not eat and  was completely irritated.I think this place is a joke,the picture of their Taco's on the menu board is no reflection of how they serve their food,the meat tasted off and the taco was dripping in grease totally disgusting.I go to Taco's El Tizon and i can get one taco with beans for $1.25 and it comes with a whole choice of salsa sides and pickled veggie's the staff are wonderful and the meat is cooked fresh,the Taco's i bought at Roberto's were $2.09 per taco and i wouldn't be surprised if they came from a box in the freezer.I will never go back and would never recommend the place to anyone........very disappointing
This place made me want to vomit. This is by far the worst restaurant in Phoenix Arizona. There food tastes like vomit. I tried some of their nasty carrot juice and spit it back into the flowers they put on the table. This place is for old smelly people who have lost there tastebuds and don't even know what they are eating. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend UNLESS MY FRIEND WAS 100 YEARS OLD. Although if my 100 year grandma are here she would probably die because the food is so disgusting. This place is disgusting please shut down this restaurant NOW. Watch out Flower Child this girl is very upset.
It was our first time there and we were looking forward to a great meal however we were very disappointed.  If it's your preference, the facade of a trendy hipster restaurant is alive and well, however the menu is very limited and they missed the mark regarding the meal itself. In my opinion our meals were extremely overpriced for what was delivered.  The service was fine and the employees were polite.  I wish them the best of luck but I don't see us going back.
I honestly want to give this place 0 stars. The Bloody Mary was awful and nothing like what they have on their yelp page. And the Stella was ridiculously flat. I would not recommend this place unless you literally want to walk away with a bad taste in your mouth
Absolutely awful. Do not under any circumstances ride this shuttle. There are many more options in the airport that I would recommend and are 100 times better. The ladies who sold us the tickets were extremely rude, cold and unhelpful. And then after we bought the ticket it took OVER AN HOUR for our shuttle to arrive. This is after the driver of the previous shuttle we were supposed to get on told me that she had "too many stops" to take us. She had plenty of seats open on the shuttle and could have accommodated my family and I easily. Then when we started to follow up to see how long the next shuttle would take, the ladies were even MORE rude at the stand. In a city where tourism is crucial to the survival of the local economy, you would think Showtime Tours would have at least decent customer service. Take a taxi instead, it will save you a lot of stress and aggravation.
I went to the Rogers and Hollands store in West Towne Mall in Madison this afternoon at around 2:30pm. My visit started out fine, but ended so unpleasantly that I was still feeling completely distraught an hour after I walked out the store.I brought one white gold chain and a necklace with broken clasp to the store for estimate and repair. The manager (I did not take down her name) was informative. We spent 15 minutes discussing options and I settled on trading in my old chain and purchasing a more "substantial" chain from the store. The manager was with me on the traction up to the point where I swiped my card, signed the receipt, and waited for my receipt to be printed. She called her assistant and instructed the assistant to continue with me. She herself went to take care of another customer. The customer was a gentleman in Harley Davidson jacket, who came in the store shortly after me. Apparently they knew each other since the manager was frequently chatting with him while working on my transaction.The experience went downhill from there. The assistant was on the computer for a good half an hour. First she had to re-enter my info (either my info was not saved due to the hurried leave of the manager, or she did not know how to pull it out), then she had a hard time figuring out how to fill out the estimate form. In between she had to answer incoming calls and put me on hold. The assistant was very genuine and apologetic. Finally the receipt for the chain I purchased was ready. I read the receipt and saw the return policy, so I asked her what would happen to the trade-in chain should I decide to return the chain. She said we'd have to talk with the mangager.I was already on the edge of being late for my appointment, so at the moment I decided to "abandon" the estimate for the necklace repair and reverse the transaction on the chain. The assistant said, "Oh, for that we would need the manager as well." I asked whether she could get the manager for me, "I just need 5 minutes from her to reverse the transaction because I really need to leave soon."The assistant went to the manager, who was almost done with the gentleman. I very calmly stated, "I was here first, I have been waiting for long and I really need to go. Please reverse the transaction on the chain so I can leave." The manager reluctantly came over and asked me what happened. I briefly explained and assured her, "I really need to be somewhere soon. I will come back some other time and purchase the chain, but now please reverse the transaction." She finally started the return process, I swiped my card, signed the receipt, and she printed out the receipt.Just one second before she was about to hand me the printed receipt, she looked down and said out loud, "Why is there a phone on the desk blinking?" She picked up the phone--she just had to pick up the phone right before she could hand me the receipt--and started answering it, "Sorry for putting you on hold, we had a distraction here." After she said that, she brought her hand over the counter and gave me the receipt without even looking at me. This moment was so upsetting to me that I almost wanted to cancel my appointment, sit down, and talk with her about why I cancelled the transaction and her unprofessional (and almost vengeful) handling of the situation. However, being the non-confrontational type of person, I did not do anything. I just took the receipt and said, "I am not a distraction." Of course the manager pretended to be busy on the phone and not hear me. I hope she learns and improves.I am still very troubled by the experience. The manager could have completed the transaction with me as a common courtsey. She could have done better recovering the sale. She definitely did not need to be so MEAN to a customer who decided to reverse a transaction due to her inefficient and ineffective management. I hope she learns and improves.
Dash pass Check in ahead of time not working.  Had to wait 30 minutes in info line to get number in the system and was quoted a 2 hour wait time.  Left and came back at 2 hours and still waited another hour.  I can't believe dmvs are still this bad.  Almost 4 hours of a day wasted on something that took the barely pleasant dmv employee about 10 minutes to process.  The DMV needs to get it together and figure out a way to be efficient and stop wasting people's time.
I now hate this place if I could give no stars I would! I used to love it here this was my second home but now every salesman is just out for your money they don't care every time I tried to sell something here they'd tried to rip me off till I called them out about it then I was disrespected by the manager. This guitarcenter was never about trying to sell you the most expensive thing it used to be about the music I will never come here again nor will anyone I know!
Pray you are not in an automobile accident and the party at fault has Erie Insurance. I was driving home from work. As I was making a legal left turn a lady with Erie Insurance ran a red light and smashed into my car. She admitted fault. This was Monday night. It is now Thursday and after many calls Erie Insurance has still NOT provided a rental car. My car is not drivable and was our only means of transportation. As a result, I have missed work and may face disciplinary action up to dismissal. Fortunately, yesterday a coworker drove 30 min out of his way to give me a ride. Erie Insurance, you do not choose to do the right thing.  At this point, we still have no transportation. Why Erie Insurance, why!!!
You will wait an hour for check in! Nobody answers the phone when you are calling the front desk! Valet parking is full for guest!!! Carpet in room was poorly done! I wouldn't stay here again!
Nothing worse than false specials.  We are all smart enough to know anytime you see buy 2 get one free or buy 2 get 2 free, you're really not getting 2 free.  They jack the prices up to make it very close to their true price.  I get that.  But come on m, 2 tires for 605.00 bucks .  So I drove down the road and was matched by pep boys.  No questions.  Got better tires and better warranties.  All I ask is to be a little bit honest.  This is why you never just purchase without verifying.
The employees here suck! So hard. Screw this place. Your food is decent but the losers serving it suck ! Bye
For a minute I thought the commuter terminal at PHX didn't even have a bar, then I stumbled into "All Star Sports Bar."  After spending about an hour here I wish there was no bar at all. This place fails on almost every level imaginable. First of all, it's not anywhere close to being a sports bar.  2 TV's and bartenders in referee uniforms doesn't make you a sports bar.  Furthermore, the food here could not be worse.  Look - I'm not opposed to the plastic cheese from a can on nachos, but if you can't even make that taste good, I can't even begin to imagine what the rest of the food here is like. Unlike the other reviewers I actually found the service (at the bar) to be fine, if not indifferent, and the one good thing I will say about this place is that they do make a pretty good Bloody Mary. You can credit that to the Ocean Spray mix they used so it's not exactly rocket science ... What can you do though? They have a captive audience though being the only game in the terminal after the security check point, I'd imagine this place is a zoo on Friday afternoons ...
Probably one of the worst Starbucks I've been to. Out of breakfast items and slowest staff ever.
The salmon was burnt and the manager was rude. My family will never go back. There are too many good restaurants around this area.
Worst bar ever. Bartenders stand around chatting and when I waved one over finally and said how long we were waiting the manager tells me I should leave. I ignored him since we were w a group and got my drink.  The female bartender did comp me that glass but every drink for everyone was a 5 to 10 minute wait. Guys at bar drinking were also annoyed.  Mind you there were 3 people behind bar and probably 30 people max in the bar.  The owner should restaurant spy his staff for sure!  Manager is a train wreck.
Holy Hell I will never go back here again! ok here is how it went we waited for about 15 mins there was a total of 9 people there. it wasn't that much going on. well i ordered our food it was good for a price that is not reasonable. I normally go to china town or a real sushi restaurant if I'm going to eat at one. well the point is i spent about 80.00 and I didn't like the service the woman never would come back and to fill our drinks and when she gave us our food it was not complete our order was wrong and we spent more time there than we should have. I didn't tip because of her lag time on serving and no apology for her mistakes. we paid our bill and left but get this the woman ran out and said to me did you like your food. i said yes but you made a lot of mistakes and i didn't like staying here that long. she said to me " you like food you give me tip" ! I was so confused i told her i don't tip bad service i tip good service. she said i work on tips i told her i do too! but you are wrong to chase me out the restaurant and tell me to give you a tip. i will never come here again. i called the owner they didn't see a problem with what she did. even knowing what the services was like. so over all this place is slow too slow and shitty employees and owner! i would tell anyone don't go here but try at your own risk of being chased down for a tip. JUST GO TO SURU BBQ there open till 2:30am and it's all you can eat buffet its better then your near buy sushi wow crap! REMEMBER SURA BBQ KOREAN BBQ AND SUSHI JUST GO! OR kRAZY BUFFET
Went to this location once. The incompetent morons charged me twice, on two different days, for one visit. Called to talk to a manager, told he wasn't even there. Clearly, the incompetence starts at the top and goes down at this place.
I love Fair Trade. The atmosphere is great, especially in the back near the fireplace, and the coffee is excellent. But the customer service is lacking. While studying on a busy Saturday I was approached by the owner and asked if I could please purchase something or leave because of customers looking for a place to sit. I, waiting for a friend to return and not wanting to leave our computers/phones unattended, waited to purchase a drink. I was approached a second time and scolded for still not having bought anything. I explained to the owner my plan to wait for my friend, but she would not listen. To make this worse, there is a sign in Fair Trade that says "Thieves are afoot. Do not leave valuables unattended." Interesting how that's what I was trying to do but I was chided for it. I am not impressed!
Don't come here for a drug test unless you like waiting for an hour when you probably already have to pee. Front desk staff were uneasant as well.
The service was super slow. They had MAYBE 5 people inside and another 15 outside and we had to wait close to an hour for our pizza we NEVER got. Wouldn't suggest if you're hungry.
Used to come all the time and it was great. Went again About 6-7 months ago and the wait was about an hour. Food came out Burned. Ppl who came after us got their meals before us and I was very annoyed. The waitress came to the table and said "you look mad, are u mad it took so long".  In an u apologetic way. I said I'm fine. She said 2 more times that I looked mad, very rude. SO on to today. Went again thinking it was a fluke visit. No. Got there at noon. Got MY food at 1:50pm. The person I was with didn't get her food for another 15 mins after me. Cheese wasn't melted and the potato pancakes were undercooked like raw rubber slabs. Cooks walking around listening to music like it wasn't busy. The owner manager whoever... Same lady that was asking if I was mad was out of the kitchen just talking to a friend for like 30 mins. No apologies for the wait time. No one came back to ask how our food was. We had to wave a waitress down to ask for a drink. We were both so mad we just had to go up and pay without waiting another hour for our checks to get the hell out of there. Will never go back ever. Terrible service. Mediocre food u can make at home.
It's a shame that I have to write this review due to the fact that I've been here on other occasions and been happily serviced. But this one instance has ended my wishes to return. My mother and I have been going to this location for a couple years now with both my nephews and brother and just us ourselves as well and haven't had awful experiences as those who have reviewed so negatively below. We used to love this place. The owner seemed knowledgeable and somewhat friendly, but we never needed to pester her with too many questions so I can't say we saw her "mean" side as many have stated before. But my grandmother, mother, and I went in on a Tuesday a few weeks ago and were so excited to paint some Christmas presents for a few women from the church. We had been planning this day for about a month and had everything ready, even the coupon for my grandmothers first painting experience we had found on their website. The same website we found their hours, all listed accordingly. But, we were sadly mistaken when we as arrived to their location. The door was locked and unlike the hours stated online, it had said that we're closed on Tuesdays. Tuesday's? Really? Such a random and pointless day! At least update your website so that customers can plan better. We decided to go to "As You Wish" on Gilbert and Germann instead and had a far better experience we had hoped for. I am sad to end our business here, but something better came out of it.
The beer was cold and even though it was not happy hour only $3.00 for an 18oz goblet. The decor was very nice and the bar was spacious, but only a few patrons even though it was Thursday and the the football game was on.The salsa was terrible: All I could taste was cumin and tomato. I added some lime juice and a few dashes from the store bought hot sauce located in the condiment basket and it was passable.I had ordered the steak nachos, but luckily I saw a plate being delivered to another patron and immediatly asked to order something else. In my opinion... Nachos should be a heaping mess of tasty goodness without ryme or reason, not 14 chips spaced evenly around a plate with exact portions of steak, beans and cheese neatly applied and dressed with 3 jalapeno slices and a scoop of guac and a scoop of sour cream. Instead, I ordered a combo plate: Fish taco, steak taco and a pork tamale with beans and rice. The fish taco was surprisingly good: Deep fried fish, pico de gallo, some type of southwest sauce and cabbage, but I have had much better from several restaurants and trucks around Vegas for allot less. The steak taco was a mixed deal: 5 slivers of steak, some type of southwest sauce and breaded and deep fried, but soggy, onion strings. I have never seen deep fried onion strings on a steak taco, but gave them a try... Disgusting. All I could taste was grease so I took them off and put them into my napkin, but then I had so much grease on my fingers I had to wave over the manager hiding behind a pillar to bring me more napkins. I asked for some pico de gallo, lime  and cabbage and the manager and waitress watched in wonder as I re-built and ate my taco... Decent taco: The steak was tasty, but there was barely any on the taco and I have had much better for allot less around town without having to make modifications for them to be edible. The pork tamale looked like hot dog wrapped in a thin masa casing with a dark brown gravy on the top. I would say it looked and tasted like it came out of a frozen microwave dinner, but unfortunately that would be unfair to microwave dinners. At least the other stuff looked like it was edible!I am not sure how you can say you are a Mexican restaurant and not have edible refried beans, but "On the Border" managed to do it. The beans tasted like smoked paprika, which overpowered the beans and ruined them. Beans are so easy even Taco Bell manages to not ruin them... Just saying!The rice was surprisingly good: Buttery with just the right amount of what tasted like soy sauce. I ate them all, but was craving a fortune cookie after I finished.  Kind of wierd, but I was hungry.In my opinion, "On the Border" is another chain restaurant that spent a ton of money on marketing and decor, but neglected to invest in their menu. The staff apparently knows the food is terrible, because they never ask, "How is everything?", but instead ask, "Do you want anything else?". The bar area is beautiful, but deserted, which is a shame, because there are only a handful of restaurants in the Centenial area and a ton of potential for a decent Mexican restaurant and Cantina to be successful.
i'm so angry they are always out of food and they never have anything ever I went to get a potato bowl and they told me they they were out of mashed potatoes then when I tried to substitute them for a another alternative they told me that they couldn't do that and when I asked for just chicken strips they were also out of those I will never spend my money here ever
I went their last night for dinner after reading the review here on Yelp.  They mailed a "buy on; get one free" coupon to my house which how I learned about them.  I was really looking forward to it because there aren't any Gyro places in my area.  My friend is from Turkey and loves Gyro.  They offered us a free Falafel tasting while we were standing in line to order.  I'd read an unfavorable rating about their Falafel so was looking forward to trying it for myself.  We both agreed it was dry, overcooked and tasteless; actually terrible.  With that we decided we'd both order a standard Gyro sandwich.  It was the worst Gyro either of us ever had.  They have a nice concept of healthy ingredients but unfortunately they don't have their recipe right.  It was tasteless and for us worse, a bad taste.  We frequent Mediterranean, Middle East and Israeli restaurants frequently and have both traveled the world extensively.  We understand they make their own pita, it was OK but not pita as we know it.  We didn't like the sauce.  Their gyro at least wasn't the standard prepackage frozen gyro we've received at many places here in the valley.  It was our last time their.  With this introduction, we wouldn't even risk a second visit.BTW, there staff and service were wonderful.  However when my friend began asking question it was obvious they didn't have any knowledge about "true" Mediterranean food.This is more of a fast food American version of a tasteless "American" version.  I was disappointed because it's conveniently located near my house.  We came home and made Turkish coffee just to get the bad taste out of our mouths.
Yuck! Had dinner with a group of four on Saturday.  None of us would eat here again. Any other restaurant in the casino would have been better.
I love Pizza 73s pizza. But this place uses the same spatula to spread the sauces on the pizza. Many times when ordering a creamy garlic based sauce because I have a tomato allergy. I have found tomato sauce mixed in with the creamy garlic. Not impressed
OK so Metro car wash did do a great job cleaning my car I even tipped $5.00 to the lady that completed the cleaning. unfortunately someone stole the change from my coin slot. I get it they are not responsible for your personal belongings and it is just change. however, stealing is just rude, unprofessional, unnecessary and seriously questions the integrity of your business and employees. I don't need the change but I don't like thieves so I will no longer be getting my car washed hear.
Horrible experience. Manager and bartender were discriminating against me for no apparent reason. They tried to blame because I had an out of state ID  but then I asked the manager and she said it's cause we do not want to serve you. DIAMOND BAR DISCRIMINATES AGAIST I WOULD BEWARE
Shocked. After years of being faithful customers, we received inedible food and a too bad/so sad.Sesame Chicken looked hushpuppies. No sauce. Mongolian Beef was bad. Could not eat it.I called the restaurant to find out what was going on, we have been going there for 20 yrs. I was told and I quote "I've sold twenty dinners, and you the only complaint". Really?No where near their normal quality. I have had better tv dinners. Refused to allow me to speak to manager.They have to have new owner or chef. Never been treated with such disrespect!
This was my family's go to Mexican restaurant. We would eat here several times a  month up until about 2-3 months ago.  The food doesn't  taste as well as before. Maybe a new cook but we can't even eat the food the last 2 visits we threw away more than we ate.
Very crowded. Didn't have the beer I wanted that was listed on the CHALKBOARD which is so easy to change. Terrible service. Only two servers on Saturday night? Last call at midnight not announced. Refused to serve at 12:01. Never going back.
I was in a hurry to my appointment yesterday and was hungry since I hadn't had breakfast or lunch. I saw this Panda Express close by my appointment facility and thought this sounds good. I ordered to go so I could make it to my appointment on time. I took a few bites of my Kung pao chicken and found a short thick curly hair which made me spew. I am so disgusted that I will NEVER eat at another Panda Express. I called and spoke to a Wilson he said to bring my receipt in and I could have something else REALLY!! I don't want something else I want my money back because I surely didn't pay for some either arm hair, armpit hair or pubic hair in my food!!!! Forever grossed out!!!!!
Nothing to write home about.  Fancy noodle guy making the them from scratch. ....but the window dressing really didn't match or meet expectations.  In fact, a trip to Panda Express would have saved me $70 and we would have had a better meal.    Never again!
This company does nothing but volume sell timeshare sales spots for the various timeshare locations in Las Vegas.  they get paid by how many people they bring in...and this is by promising what they don't deliver on.  They will bait and switch, for example initially offered The Jockey Club as the stay location ( where the timeshare is) then switched to another property, then to the substandard Riviera.  So it is basically a switch from a $250 updated property to long long lines for check in,tired $50 a night hotel. And they lie about other properties that are alternatives, then switch in the substandard hotel.  When I noticed that the Riviera even wanted to charge a "resort" fee, Resort Stay said there were no fees we would have to pay, then said they were not responsible for this "incidental." A real shady operation, and even when complaining, a "supervisor" will not give a last name to what sounds like a concocted first name.
Only got one star because I cannot give Zilch!   Stay Away! The staff make it a dump!Manger and staff could not have been nastier!I had booked a mini Jacuzzi Suite as my husband's valentines gift. We had concert tickets for that night. Thursday I phoned to confirm, no prob, they even sent an email to confirm. Arrived at 6:00 on Sat and they told me that my suite was not available, and they had DOWNGRADED us to a regular room. I explained that we were local, for a reg room we could stay at home! This was a special occasion! The clerk would not bend so I asked to speak to the manager. She told me that my booking only entitled me to a room not any specific room!!! They could upgrade me for $100 to a full suite. I was over a barrel ( thuis was a gift and I was mortified to be arguing over the price) so I had to pay., almost $300!!! I paid more for a suite at the CRUMMY Eastside Cannery than I would have paid for for a 5 star on the strip!Incidentally the casino stinks like an old ashtray. Even with reservations we waited 45 minutes for a table in the Staekhouse.
I feel really bad because they are really nice, but the food was not edible. I ordered a ton... wontons (both pork and cream cheese) were chewy and gross, shrimp noodles I couldn't even pick out the shrimp to save, the orange chicken was the most edible.  Nice place! Nice people, but the food needs work
Seriously don't go here. Me and my husband went here to try it...and we left right away. Reason reason we left right away was because the sushi chef was blowing his nose, and then he rinses his hands under water without any soap and just wipe his hands on his apron dips his hands into the sushi rice and started to make a roll. How freaking disgusting is that. When the roll came in front of us we told the sushi chef about him not washing his has we left because we were so disgusted. go here if you like boogers in your sushi. totally on hygienic place to eat at
I just moved in the area. I went to try it out, the food tasted great but I got really sick a few hours later. My friend who was with me also felt bad.Spoke to my neighbor about it and he told me he also got sick after eating there on a previous occasion. Not good...
Food was good for the price but they did not take Steak n' Shake gift cards.  I find it absolutely ridiculous that they do not even take their own gift cards.  Where else am I supposed to use a Steak n' Shake gift card?
Not sure what has happened but the prices are higher and the quality is poor (stay away from the shrimp!). No real witty way to say it...they are off my Thai list forever. Good thing there are a plethora of uberfab places in the Chandler area!
I had high expectations of this place due to the reviews on Yelp. However, my actual experience was anything but good.First, I ordered house chow mein and instead of getting chow mein, I got a box full of bean sprouts and other vegetables with a few shrimp and a little pork sprinkled in, with a separate bag of wonton crisps. There were NO noodles to be found. I was amazed - never have I ever been given chow mein without any actual noodles. Second, my boyfriend got house fried rice, which tasted good ....at first. We both found hairs in our portions, short hairs that I don't even want to know where they came from. Third, we had the house special chicken, which was the only dish that wasnt terrible. There was more fried flour than chicken meat , but the sauce was good. Finally, we were excited to try their massive egg rolls, but they were just 99% bean sprouts. The theme of New Garden seems to be reliance on endless amounts of bean sprouts.This was a truly disappointing experience. Im not sure if we just ordered the wrong items, but none of the items we ordered met my expectations. I will not be going back.
This was the worst pizza I have ever had. The cheese and sauce had both a sour taste and smell. The crust was bland and hard. The price was right at $3.99 so I gave it a try instead of going to a pizza franchise...but it was too horrible to eat.
Garbage car wash. The owner always seems to be in a bad mood and doesn't make the customer's feel wanted there. I've been here 3-4 times and I always thought maybe they'll change. I guess not. What made me write this review was that the last time I was there, they did a horrible job. The car was still dirty and they didn't even dry the car 100%. I drove literally 10 miles away and I had a ton of water marks near the spoiler, side mirrors and trunk area. They're cheap for a reason. Save yourself a headache and treat your car to a real car wash else where.
Just can't believe these people. Needed an item that their website said was in limited supply in this store and I should call ahead to ascertain it would be in stock. On a Friday, during their business hours, called for 2 hour straight, every 5 minutes. Continuous message that the line was busy. They have ONE line and they apparently keep it off the hook?  The item I wanted is fairly pricey and I will now buy it elsewhere. This is not the way to make customers happy or bring people into the store. Very frustrating experience, especially since I have patronized this store more than once in the past.
Poor service (despite arriving at a slow time) , prices are super inflated. $16 for the perk scramble (!!). Vegetables not well cooked or seasoned, red peppers didn't taste "fire roasted", and really, no cheese?Will not be back.
Cheese was not melted, taco shell tough and chewy. Very little meat in taco, which did not taste good to me. I was very disappointed
I'm doing this review as I wait on hold on the phone with this UHAUL location for 34 minutes, and counting. This is unacceptable. Every time I go here to rent a truck for my business, there's only one employee doing everything, from looking up the reservation, to inspecting the vehicle, to checking the customer out. The employee leaves out to go inspect the vehicle, when there are 5 customers waiting behind in line. This place needs at least two more employees, and better customer service. They are also sometimes unreliable, as they say they have vehicles, but don't, and sometimes don't call to notify us. I know they can't control if someone brings their vehicle back on time, but please, at least give us a call to let us know if we're S.O.L. If there was another nearby location that had better service and fleet availability, I would never visit this place again.
Poor service, waitress was snippy and rude. I have been in this restaurant numerous times with friends and family. Twice with people having a birthday. I brought my sister there because it was her birthday and from previous experience, I knew she would get a pancake treat if she wished. When I asked the waitress about this she said "well no one has ever asked me that before and no we don't do that."She then stated she went back and asked two managers and they "all" said no. If the policy changed then fine, the problem was the woman's rude demeanor. We said ok and continued with our breakfast. I was sad for my sister and was very displeased with the way the situation was handled. Food is ok. I can get "ok" food with amazing service at ANY breakfast spot in this city and will do so from now on. I brought a lot of business in this restaurant and will not do so any longer. Disappointed.
Ordered the pizza on my phone. It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Went to pick it up. Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? I don't know. But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem.
Is there a way to give these people less than one star? How about rating the manager who tries to cover for incompetency on the part of a groomer, by telling me that they only do poodle cuts in the Happy Valley store?They have a lady groomer who doesn't know an unaltered male from a female and who doesn't know her breeds. She couldn't tell that my dog was a poodle, which was really disturbing. An hour after he was left, she called me--and also my daughter- to run two differing stories past us: My story: the dog was difficultHer story: she was overbookedWe took the dog to Petsmart and he got groomed easily; they said he was excellently behaved for a six month old puppy. We thought that the management would appreciate the feedback and made time to talk to them.The weekend manager, a male, was receptive. He probably would have called and spoken to the Petsmart groomer, but it was late in the day. He also told us the woman groomer would soon be replaced by a male counterpart.The female manager, however, sought to deflect obvious criticism from customers by telling us one of the selected stories, the one that the dog was difficult. When told that I would play the phone call about overbooking--the woman obviously didn't want to groom the dog--she told us poodles could only be groomed at the Happy Valley store, which is 45 minutes from where we live.Don't expect satisfaction from management and I am beginning to think that corporate at the lower echelons is tone deaf too!Do yourself a favor. Go to Petsmart. They don't specialize in specific breeds. They just groom dogs. And don't deal with Ceeda. She doesn't care about the customer.
After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting.   I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  And ordered a child's pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. He got a thin crust. Our deep dishes didn't come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust. We were there over 3 hours.  OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  Instead covered in olives which he hates.   I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place. The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn't deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. "We swear 10 more minutes max and it's out" waited another 20. This place doesn't deserve to wear the name.
The last time I went to Mimi's Cafe, at 7450 W Bell Rd, Glendale, AZ 85308, was June 29th, my wife's birthday. We arrived at Mimi's at approximately 3:30 PM. The place was empty except for a small section that probably comprised one-quarter of the place. There was a couple waiting where one normally sits to await a table. Jokingly I asked them if they were waiting for a table. They responded, yes, we're waiting for a booth. Still not sure they weren't joking, I told the hostess we're a party of three and we'ed like a booth. The hostess said you'll have to wait after this couple, they're waiting for a booth also. I asked really! This place is empty! I said okay, we'll get a booth at Ajo Al's (a Mexican-American restaurant that shares the parking lot with Mimi's). We walked over to Ajo Al's which was just as empty as Mimi's. The hostess told us to sit where ever we'd like. The waiter was friendly, helpful and very attentive. I don't know if I'll ever go to Mimi's again. This is a classic example of a business thinking they're too successful to bother with customer service.
So Captain America: Civil War was sold out, except for the handicap seating. Which there are only 5 of. We bought two, bought our pickles, and sat in the seats we purchased. Right as the movie is about to start and all the seats were filled, a sixth person shows up with the seat number that was next to mine. We didn't bother looking at our tickets, assuming AMC workers would know what they are doing, but my boyfriend's seat number was actually non existent. We proceed to go to the front where they notify us that we purchased a non existent spot. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??? How the hell do you sell a non existent seat?! They sold us the middle section in between the seats!!! And all we got was a refund for the tickets, not even for the pickles.
This place has some rude and racist employees here! I kept saying nooo it's not jst that person but this has been my third visit and I will never ever return! After the old lady rang me up today I had an e gift card I wanted to use since I had 40.66 left on and she's like we dnt even take those ok tell me how was I able to use it last week and now this time was an issue?! So since I wasn't able to use it, I told her to cancel my to go orders and she yells out to her boss who was jst next to her Oh void THIS since she can't afford to pay for it! I didn't say I can't afford to pay it I wasn't going to waste my money since I had the gift card with a balance on it! Then manager says u need to print it out next time what's the difference of me bringing in a copy of the e-gift card when u could easily scan the barcode?! Ridiculous!
People are VERY rude. ClassLESS place. nobody cares about everyone! dont go here!! worst hookah bar ever!
Every large university area I have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. Some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. In this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.OK I know this place is an iconic Pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. First of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. LAME.Second complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. It's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctlyThird complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? You have two main components: The dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.Fourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. You would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. Also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.Fifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and I'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.FOOD 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did itSERVICE 1.5 stars - I think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.VALUE 1 star, OK I have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.Total: 1.33 starsFor hot dogs in PA both The Frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while Wiener World (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns.
After walking through the cloud of cigarette smoke at the back entrance we found the hostess stand and were greeted with "we are out of bone in wings". Um ok, table for 2 adults and 1 kid. We got the last table right next to the bar. The bar tender waited on us then we really never saw her again. Food took forever, was brought by the hostess and was cold. That is the worst - waiting for cold food. cause you know it got cold cause no one bothered to bring it to you. I sent my cold nachos (the cheez whiz kind) back and they microwaved them. Let me repeat that. They.microwaved.nachos. Lettuce and all. It was disgusting. I woulda drank some water to get rid of the one bite of soggy lettuce taste but we never got any refills. I asked the manager to take them away and to just forget it and bring the check. He made me some new ones  anyway - but we had to go, we'd been there forever already and did not want to listen to the insanely loud dude with the guitar who set up shop in the bar with a screeching amp. Never again.
They sold us several pair of Lucchese boots at what seemed to be great prices, all the while lying to us and telling us that the prices were going up and they were brand new perfect boots, but they're factory defects!! They totally lied. They don't fit near as nicely as my other boots from Lucchese and they're not backed by the company in the same way as retail boots are. Not cool.
Decided to try the monthly membership. Went down to cancel it because I noticed a few scratches that weren't there before and I didn't plan on using it anymore. Canceled two weeks before the end of the month and I just looked on my card statement and I have a new charge for the monthly membership again. Seriously? When I signed up not only did they say you can call and cancel(asked specifically) and then I called to cancel and said I had to come down. So I drove all the way down there to cancel. And NOW I have a charge on my card.
My CEO was livid.  First we were supposed to be in the speakeasy room as we had 16 people. Originally I requested the lounge but later requested the speakeasy.  I called and spoke with the event coordinator to make sure again that we got the speakeasy room.  When we showed up at the restaurant we were seated right next to the band in the lounge vs the speakeasy room.  We had to wait 20 minutes to be seated there.  We were hungry and the tables were not set up.  After being seated we waited another half hour for a waiter to come by just to order wine and appetizers.  We had to get up and track down a manager to serve us.  He was great but a little too late.  After finally getting our wine and appetizers and finishing that, we waited again about 15-20 minutes for a waiter and finally had to track down a waiter again to order food.  We spent over $3,000 to get such terrible service and to be put in a place right next to a loud band.  Not cool.  Would not recommend for large groups.
The food is garbage - fast food Mediterranean at best. This place thinks its the Mediterranean Chipotle but doesn't come close to executing and the food quality isn't good at all.The food quality is poor on both quality and taste. If you're expecting all white meat chicken, you'' be disappointed. And fresh pitas? Nope, pulled straight out of a packaged bag right in front of you.There are definitely better alternatives available and there is no way I'll be going back to this place.  Very disappointing.
I waited for four hours in the blistering cold and asked for crushed red pepper and you still said no... the pizza is pretty shitty man they had no pepperoni pizza he likes it more than I do... I ain't that mad but I just don't like getting diabetes. The customer service was good nothing bad to say .. but the pizza tasted like frozen diabetes with sesame seeds.
Like I don't even know where to begin !!!! We have gone here so many time and was satisfied with everything mind you we have a 4 month baby girl. So tonight we where going to go see rough night that funny chick flick and yes I had my baby girl with me and they said I couldn't enter because I had a baby like wtf I'm a MOMMMMMY like you want me to just leave my baby behind UMM NO and my spouse and I where trying to just have a good night out and they fucked it up. Like it's almost a form of discrimination towards couple who have babies but still wanna have a good night out. Just to let y'all know before you decide to go there on a Tuesday date night DAY !!!!!
This place started out great, but the quality and service have really suffered. The staff is uncaring about your needs, and unresponsive to your requests.When seated, we were given glasses of lukewarm tap water, we were never offered refills on the drinks we ordered, coffee and iced tea.Food was mediocre at best. Two of us ordered eggs Benedict, which comes with poached eggs. At first, we were given the wrong meals, when the correct meals were brought, the eggs were not poached, they were hard boiled. My meatball eggs Benedict was mushy, and the English muffin was like a piece of soggy cardboard.They did comp the doughnuts we ordered, but this was still $77 that I wished I had spent somewhere else like Park Brouge in Highland Park. I was a regular customer, but I will not be returning.
You currently have well over 40 people in line and only the register at the PINK store open. There's also only one person at that register. However, you have at least 6 on the floor offering free fittings. Come on priorities. Horrible customer service!!
Although everyone was very nice, good décor and decent service, the food was overpriced, portions small and food just generally not good.The waitress tried to sell us 2nd portions of certain items as there were only 3 pieces for our party of 4.  After we ordered, the runner then told us for an upcharge, they would have put a 4th piece on the plate.The ox tail croquettes were burned, the large lettuce leaves overwhelmed the pitifully small portion of Peking duck, the pot pie  balls were dry... you get the idea.Thank goodness they gave us cookies at the end for my birthday, otherwise my party would have left hungry.I predict that they will be closed within a year unless they bring in Bar Rescue!!!!
Long Lines, Bad and Rude Service. Hotel Hallways smell like sewage and carpets are dirty. TV didn't work in room took them three days to fix it. Pubic Hair in bathroom, and AC unit sounds like a drill over head.
After reading previous reviews of how good the brunch was, a friend and I decided to check it out. I was disappointed though. I ordered an eggs benny with back bacon and white cheddar potato cake. The potatoes were  just roasted with some herbs, no cheese in sight and the back bacon on the egg Benedict was a small piece of deli meat that I couldn't see under the poached egg. I had one bite near the end where I actually tasted back bacon.
My wedding is coming up, so where better to go check out suits/tuxes? Man, was I wrong. I was only there maybe five minutes and felt like I was not wanted. I walk in the door and I'm asked how many groomsmen and they give me a price instantly like I couldn't afford to be there or something. Before i even saw one tux or suit. No big deal though, so they tell me the girl in the back will help me even though they already started. Ok, I get it the girl in the back does the rentals.  She points at 6 suits on the wall and says those are my choices and asks me if she should measure me. I thought, um yes you will need my measurements for a suit or tux. She measures my chest only and tells me if I dont want something not on the wall I need to go back and talk to the other people. Then acts upset while she says if I want to try anything on from the wall she has to take it off the mannequin. What!? Im here to rent a suit or tux. Why do I need to see another person. Why can't I try something on after being measured? I was so confused by the incompetence and awful customer service.  Go to Nick's or Celebrity Tix and Tails instead!
Chaos on earth, no enough cashiers, too expensive stuff , slow service. God bless Amazon
The supply service ended so I called them and they told me Pacific Pulmonary took over the business and to call them back in a few days.    I called again today and was waiting on hold for 18 minutes before hanging up to call my doctor for referral for another CPAP supply company.  The website is down too.  Great start too lose new customers PP.
I rarely leave Yelp reviews, but I HAVE to leave one for this place. I generally give local businesses more leeway in terms of not being on top of everything since they are often still figuring things out (vs. a large corporation), but this place was just horrible that I felt I need to warn people. I've gotten a lot of massages across many different cities around the US & around the world, and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had. I received a Groupon to Fairmount Massage as a gift & when I tried to book it, it was SO hard to contact Elena. I called at least 10 times over 2 weeks, left 5 voicemails (she never called back), and eventually messaged a fellow Yelper that had left a recent review to see if she could talk to her when she went to her next appointment. I also contacted Groupon to see if they could get in touch with her. After all of this, I finally get a call 2 weeks later from Elena asking if I want to book a massage. I finally booked my appointment. A little annoyed a this point, but I figured the worst is over so I can just look forward to my massage. A few days later, I get a call asking if I can move my appointment because she mixed up her schedule. I know things can happen in any business, so I told her no problem and we rescheduled for a day that worked for her. (she was not very nice or apologetic unfortunately...) Then the day that we had scheduled the massage finally came. I left my house & started driving to my appointment and 10 minutes before my appointment (my house is 30 minutes away from the massage place), she calls me to cancel the appointment! She tells me that she will give me an extra 30 minutes of massage as an apology, so I said ok (even though I essentially had wasted 40 minutes driving there and back). So I called back a few days later, rescheduled the appointment, and went in for my massage. The place itself is not great. The massage bed is a portable massage table so it moves a fair amount when you get massaged. The massage itself was ok. Not bad, but not great. My Groupon was for 60 minutes, but she had told me previously when she canceled that I would get an extra 30 minutes of massage for the inconvenience (which I confirmed when I made the appointment). After 60 minutes of massaging, she said I was done and I reminded her about the cancellation and about the 30 minutes. She said she can't do it & to come back another time! Given how much work it was to even get to the original appointment, I was not about to waste another minute trying to book a massage with Elena yet again. Now I have a free 30 minute massage card with her but instead, I am writing this review so everyone can save themselves and find another place to get a massage. This was such a colossal waste of time.
Been a couple of times. Brought my friend for the first time. Then my locker got broken into, took my friends wallet, smh. Then we heard from the staff that another guys locker got broken into an hour before we found out about ours. Smh never coming here.
I have yet to find a decent little Mexican food joint in the area. Sometimes you just want awesome neighborhood Mexican take out. This is not the spot. I've been here many times because of convenience and today I promised myself I wouldn't go back. Bland food, rolled tacos were soggy in the middle, regular tacos and even the salsa just are not flavorful. You'd expect more in AZ. I wish there was one of those Berto cousins close by..
FOOD POISONING!!!!  I have gotten take out 3 times.  First 2 food was good enough but not great.  3rd Time-The worst food poisoning I have ever had.  Will NEVER go back here
After paying 250 something for 3 nights! This hotel charged me 300 for "1" night!!! Once we checked into the hotel they gave us a "non-smoking" room. Which turns out to be a smoking room that smelled awful got my entire family sick! Then our neighbor decided to throw a party in their hotel room!!! We complained they gave us a new room. This new room had a non-smoking sign on the room smelled clean when we entered my husband went and sat on the bed and the bed caved in! Let me tell you my husband is 160! NOT a heavy dude! After receiving RUDE service by hotel front desk!! They did not want to refund our money even though we did not stay the night they STOLE 300$ for a piece of shit room we didn't even sleep in!! ARIEL the "manager" is rude and unprofessional threw a bitch fit about giving me back my money for the night I was not going to be staying!! Don't waste your time with the hotel they will not accommodate you!!! Waste of money!! Beware!!! They will steal your money over charge you and give you CRAP!! they don't give a shit!
This may be a knock on all trop smoothie shops. When ordering a smoothie they ask you if you want sugar or an artificial sweetener??? How about providing us with better options like agave syrup , stevia, etc? After all, you guys are all about nutrition. Also, why have a refrigerated case next to your cashier stand when it's only 1/4 full of items. Looks extremely cheesy! Come on mr owner, get with it!!
Used to be a great place - not any more. Hair found in two of four of our breakfast dishes. Food was cold. Biscuits and gravy had weird flavor. Place is Not as clean now either. Stay away!!!
Probably the worst service we've ever experienced. We were a party of 4 (myself, my wife, our 3 year-old and 6 month old). We ordered water and they only brought 2 of the three we asked for (nothing resembling a kid's cup) we eventually got another water when we ordered our food but it set the tone for the rest of the evening. Food arrived relatively quickly and was average sushi, nothing remarkable. We ordered udon with chicken and the waitress though the best place to put it was directly in front of our 6 month-old. Before we could even react he grabbed the plate the bowl was on and pulled it, causing extremely hot udon to splash out onto his hand. Just about every other customer saw or heard what happened and audibly reacted, some even asked what they could do, not one single employee even bothered to see if there was anything they could do. As parents we understand and accept it is ultimately our responsibility to keep our kids from harm but who in their right mind would put steaming hot soup in front of a 6 month old...?Our last roll was brought out about 5 minutes later and that was the last time we saw our waitress until we stopped her and asked for a container for the remaining udon. That was also the only time our water was refilled, after our food was gone and we were waiting for them to bring our bill. When we arrived it was not very busy, by the time we received our food the dinning area had filled up  but there was never more than 1 group waiting to be seated. Had they been swamped with customers I would better understand the lack of service but there was no obvious explanation. Needless to say we won't be returning; average food at best and even if the food had been exceptional the quality of service would keep us away.
Worst half-assed imitation of a poorly run buffalo wild wings I've ever seen. Terrible service and idiot hostess made sure no return trips will ever happen. Pathetic.
Today, yuck. Fake, I don't know what chicken in the pasta. I couldn't eat was so gross. Used to live across from scottsdale location and was always a fan. I live near this location and don't think I can go back sadly.
Sad and depressing. Well, Ohio you had an election and you voted for this, so it's not Dan Gilbert's fault. The only reason to go is for the morbid curiosity factor. I kept walking around thinking, this was the set for "The Christmas Story" and now its a shiny piece of garbage.
An update on Peoria Ford. 01/27/17Not two days after I wrote my critique, a manager called me, (unfortunately I can't remember his name) but he called me not to apologize, or see what he could do to make me happy. He called me to defend Peoria Fords position!! I mentioned that Peoria Ford has 2.5 stars, which is not very good or flattering. His comment was, "Yelp customers just comment on the bad experiences, not the good. So he expects this sort of rating."I am here to tell you, the only thing he offered me was a free cup of coffee the next time I'm in, and a deal on my next purchase.What the heck was that?  I won't be in, EVER to purchase another vehicle or for that free cup of coffee.My advice to anyone, is to stay far away from Peoria Ford as possible!!
This place is quite comical.  There were late picking me up.  The car smelled like smoke.  I asked for another car that had a USB port (I need to listen to a lecture) and the other car had a huge dent in the front and didn't have a USB port.  So then I kept smelly smoking car. I'm just not happy with this place
The food was not good I order 2 bowls with ex meat for both paying over 24$ The meat wasn't cook through. Me and my boyfriend both got sick. I called to let them know the lady ask me if I wanted a refund or to remake the food. I went back 2 days later for my refund. I would never eat at a Chipotle  again.
This is the second time I have come here. The first time, I ordered Avocado toast and they were out of avocados, I asked for sprouts instead but they were out of that too. I got a smoothie that was disgusting. This time I ordered avocado toast and they were out of bread. Don't bother coming here.
The worst gel manicure by far, I have polish all over my skin and barely on my nails. I've been going here for almost a year and in the beginning it was great but now it has really gone down in customer service. Very disappointing and will not be returning again.
Omg..this place really pissed me off..it took more than 15 minutes before they took our order..than another 20 minutes at the window..the woman behind us asked if we would let her out cause it had been so long..so we left she left and the car behind her left..more than 30 minutes in drive thru is RIDICULOUS!!!!
I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again.
We really needed a pick me up so stopped in for some iced coffees.  We were all turned off by the burned fry oil smell right away...   and we smelled like that for the rest of the day... it was in our clothes, our hair... everything.   We asked the 2 girls working there what flavors for iced coffee there were... the answer we got was "anything you can imagine"  We asked if there was a list. They said no but to just mention a flavor and they would tell us if they had it.  The flavors we ended up getting didn't even change the taste of the coffee... I could have made a better coffee from my keurig at home.  It was very weak and bitter.We were even more upset when we found out the prices we were charged were over a dollar more than what is posted on the price list!!!! When we asked, all we were told was "I'm sorry"
My grandson and I had the displeasure of ordering from this restaurant. A waste of 32.00 and I tipped the delivery person.  The crust is bland, the fetuccine was like gooey. Tasteless Italian food should be deemed a crime
Men of X is the worse show I have ever paid for, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, these guys have no talent and cant dance.  whoever choreographed their show needs a new job he has no talent
I came in here a couple weeks ago to get a couple keys made for my Jeep. I walk up to a man at the self check-out and ask him politely where to get a key made. He doesn't bother to look up from his computer and then finally says "Over there" and gives me no direction. I walk over to a desk where a few of employees are sitting. I ask, "Excuse me, is this where I go to have a key made?" "No" I stand there thinking they would redirect me... Nope. So I ask, "Well, where should I go?" A woman points one way and the man points the other. Okay... Finally I found some one to help me. He was nice and helpful. I'm not sure if it's because I'm a 19 year old girl they didn't feel was worth their time or what it was, but I didn't realize it was so hard to show someone in the right direction. I won't come back here.
The salad they serve with the pasta is just a bowl of the same kind of shredded lettuce they put on sandwiches at subway. I ordered the creamy pesto pasta which was pretty good but just barely above average. I also found a what looked like a hair baked into the garlic bread they brought me. They told me it was a bristle from the brush they use to brush the butter on the bread... still gross. I was literally the only person in the whole restaurant as well. The prices were great but the food just isn't.
Update the tIme. I went at 8:40pm Monday night and they were closed already. Not 9pm.
This is one of the sadder bars in Pittsburgh. It's mostly populated by people who work at other bars in the area, and there's a rather desperate cliquishness to it. Some of the wait staff are super friendly, but the main barman is roided up, snappish, and generally deeply unpleasant to interact with. You'll get the real measure of this place by reading the pathetically sexist, misogynist menu - this is the kind of bar that thinks that 1950s-era sexist jokes make the menu sound edgy and modern. Utterly and irredeemably classless, the kind of place that wouldn't survive a month anywhere in the northeast other than Pittsburgh.
This is a terrible company. We waited an hour and 20 minutes for the shuttle to show up. We called several times to ask about the shuttle and we told that the driver was in their way to get us..... You might as well walk to your hotel you'll get there faster. I would give them no stars but unfortunately that's not an option.
I have to say I have never been met with such awful customer service ever. When I called to schedule an appointment for a groupon that I had purchased not only did they tell me basically I was lying about it and that it didn't exist. Instead of being polite and trying to book a service at a discount that I would have gladly paid for I was met with rude responses. So basically thanks for turning away a potential customer. That's not a good way to run a business. I would give 0 stars. Yet that's not an option
Lol omg this place sucks...the only thing I can thank is for the table but they were playing hip hop music from 3 years ago..i can't believe body english failed before these guys did ..??Riddle me that.
This place collected my keys and did successful inspection at move out and now 5 months later I've been contacted by collections for a cleaning fee and a water bill. When I called and spoke with the property manager Christina, she had no file with employee name who inspected my unit and took my forwarding address. When I asked her why they didn't call me if they failed to record my new address, she claimed that's not in their policy. She hung up on me after providing me her supervisors name and number. This is one more instance in the 10 months I lived there of the staff having no communication with each other pertaining to the business of their tenants. It's such a shame since I paid the last 2 months of my lease when I didn't live there, had carpet shampooed, scrubbed the bathroom and kitchen. This place is my worst nightmare come true.
This review is on the lack of customer service at this studio. I purchased a groupon for 10 classes and was not able to use it because no one would call me back to schedule my appointments (I had questions regarding the individual classes and wanted to talk to the person.) I left messages and even went by the studio during "open" hours but the doors were locked. So I wasted $30 and countless minutes of my life due to there unprofessionalism. Double thumbs down for this studio!!!
This place is near my home and offers alterations and fixes. My dress, was thought to need a new slider and ended up needing a new zipper instead. It has been there since January 28 and it is still not done today :-(
My boyfriend and I were in town for our anniversary getaway. So after seeing an excellent show we both decided to go to a drive thru to get food for dinner so it'll be faster and we can have it in our hotel. We agreed on going to Smashburger to try it out since we've never been to one. Although the cashier was very nice, I cannot say the same about the food that we got. With the price we paid for, we were given food that wasn't our order. We ordered Avocado Club Beef and Smashburger beef with salad and we both got Bacon Cheeseburger and salad. I'm surely don't think it was a mixed up because we were the only one waiting in the drive thru.The worst part is that my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning. Surely it came from what he ate from that place because some of it came out when he was throwing up early this morning. We will not be going to this place at all and will not refer it to anyone.
Horrible horrible horrible.  Didnt have our car, talked me into a $50 upgrade which I agreed to, then advised me the upgraded car wasnt available. So now I've been waiting for over an hour for the Advantage people to get another car ready.  The line is 15 customers long with only two nitwits working.  Never again with these clowns.
Was excited to try location closer to us. Went in on non busy weeknight last week. Server was very quiet, couldn't hear her and not much of a people person. Put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later I asked if her meatballs were coming out. Oh I forgot to put them in. No apology or here let me grab them at no charge. So we just forgot about them. Had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot. Never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did. First and second half of pizza came out almost cold. Couldn't guess why on that. Only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time. Leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them. Will not return would rather drive extra distance to Scottsdale or just go to Pomo downtown Gilbert!
Their bathrooms are so disgusting every time I come here. No paper towels. Dirty floor. Smells awful. I don't know how you can even stand to work in a place with bathrooms like this.
First question I asked was, "Will you please show me only frames that will work with my prescription?" With an affirmative, we went on to select 4-5 styles and finally selected one. After computer forms pricing and measuring, the machine spits it back: frame not compatible with my prescription.  An hour wasted. Will not go back.
It is obvious what this window and blinds department thinks about customers. One employee sitting at the counter said only the gentlemen there does window treatment quotes, so she would help today. Then the male employee said he was going to lunch after he finished with a client and would  it help me either. He proceeded to say that there was another lady who has been waiting three hours and was really upset with him for going to lunch. Apparently the store and employees are not trained well enough, staffed well enough, or caring enough to get more business. It was a waste to drive all the way over to the store and then get turned away. This was after calling earlier when the employee asked me to call back in 10 minutes because they had to walk across the store. Home Depot service has gone down hill over the years.
Probably the worst run business I have ever dealt with in my entire life.
Used to love this place but it's changing with time. Perhaps they still ok with fake nails but they cannot do a good manicure if life depends on it. Used so much drying chemicals on my cuticle that it flaked the skin around the nail. All nail polish bottles are empty and diluted with alcohol, they look old and  gross. Had to repaint nails three times cuz nail polish wouldn't lay evenly. The station where you would dry the nails is covered with grime and gunk - no way I'm placing my hands there Here's the pic of the finish job - the lady didn't even bother putting lotion on cuticles or cleaning the smudges of polish cuz she was in such a hurry. Nails also not even painted evenly.
This is the worst Starbucks in this city! Unfortunately It is the closest Starbucks to me. Horrible service every single time, the drinks are always blah, and they can never get the order right! This Starbucks likes to play the game I'll pick the size of your drink for you,no matter what you order and you will never get the size you ask for. It happens every single time and God forbid you tell them they are wrong, horrible attitudes all around, they like to roll eyes and snatch drinks out of your hands. It shows piss poor leadership/management/ownership that nothing has changed, it has been going on for a long time, just check the reviews. But luckily there is a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf close to me as well, so I will take my money there from now on. Done with this Starbucks and possibly Starbucks in general.
I am a makeup JUNKIE! So naturally I have to visit the stores of all my favorite brands. I went to Vegas on a trip and discovered there was a new nyx store. So I come to visit and I walk in, and no greeting. I'm used to warm welcomes at cosmetic counters/stores. I think the only person who remotely said hi was this pregnant lady and that was toward the end of the experience. There was a young brunette fair skin girl doing makeup and walking past me to grab things and doesn't even say a word to me and I had so many questions. Anyway I figure out what I want and I grab it and I walk to the front and there's a young African American girl minding her own business. I believe her name is Amanda, as it showed on my receipt. She doesn't say a word to me as well. I wanted to look at a gloss but there was no tester so I hand her the live product and ask her if she had a tester for it. She grabs it from me, still no words said to me, checks that there is no tester and then goes to make a tester then hands it to me. Still doesn't say anything. I'm ready to ring up and I let her know I wanted the gloss. Still no words!!! Only thing she said to me this whole interaction was, "your total is $13.14." And that was it. That's insane!! Give your job to someone who will appreciate it!!! I would never get away with that kind of service at my job! But maybe the difference is is that I love my job and she doesn't. Horrible service and representative for the brand!
My experience with Maggiano's was terrible. Our first impression was of the host, a young man with a very snooty, rude attitude. We were there on a Monday night and asked for a table on the patio. His response was "the server already has 7 tables out there and I'm not giving her another". We had Crystal as our server. She was less than pleasant, not smiling or friendly at all throughout the entire meal. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. It was terrible. The eggplant was a mushy mess and the pasta was very underdone.  My honey had the spaghetti with meatballs which neither of us cared for. My daughter had the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Hers was the best  meal of the three. We will not return to Maggiano's and would not recommend this restaurant to others.
Food is not good, im entirely unimpressed with this place! I ordered all of my food dairy free, asked for my toast to be dry ( unbuttered) I explained that I cannot have dairy and yet my food still contained dairy and my toast came buttered. I've eaten here a few times and something has been wrong every single time.
We were honestly disappointed. When you go to a pizza place you expect at a minimum soda?? You can't drink beer there bc they have no liquor license so if you want a beer, you have to go next door and then they bring you your pizza.. and if you want something besides tap water with no ice, you get a choice of 3 seltzer waters..: with no ice. Seriously SO weird. I ended up going next door to the coffee shop just to get a coke. The pizza was okay, the service was terrible.. nobody came outside to tell us we had to order at the counter, give us menus etc. for just opening up... we were disappointed.
Not really sure why it takes over an hour to make a salad with no meat and a chicken sandwich. The moose dip was disappointing. No reason to come here ever.We asked for our check and wanted to leave. While the owner said he'd buy our dinner, we had spent enough time at this establishment. We asked the owner how much the tab was he wouldn't tell us. He just kept saying he wanted us to stay and eat our dinner. We just wanted to pay our tab and waitresses. He never told us. We left $60 to cover our $9 appetizer, 2 cocktails, and one beer. Sure, he tried to rectify the situation but we told you no, we don't want to stay countless times. Sometimes you can't fix your poor service. Icing on the cake... My night off of grad school and work... Wasted. Waitresses, you did well.
If I could give one star I would. There are so many nail salons in the area I don't understand how this one could be in business. They are rude and do a half ass job. I should've looked at the reviews before coming here. Save yourself your time and money and go somewhere else.
Don't eat here. Go to Holstein's at Cosmo instead. I went here and ordered the waffles. When it came out it was cold. I had them return it and I went to grab Starbucks to hold me over. The girl that serviced us need to go to customer experience classes or something. Terrible! I would my come back ever again.
When we walked in they waived us to a booth where we then waited and chatted for a good twenty minutes. And then one of the girls I was with got up to ask if we could get a menu. She brought back the menus herself because they didn't.We waited and waited and waited and eventually they came over to ask what we wanted and we ordered and waited and waited. One of my companions got up, cancelled her order and decided to go elsewhere. Wish the rest of us had done the same.Probably one of the most uninspiring meals we've ever eaten. Maybe if the food was good it could have made up for the non-existent service, but it was very lackluster.  Do not recommend.
Had two orders of half chicken, the bones around both were black and really unappetizing. Wont be ordering here again. Customer service was good its just the product that is really bad!!!
So my wife and I wanted some sweets.  We came here they asked if we wanted to dine in. I informed the lady we would only be getting dessert. The lady sat us and walked away.  People payed and left. Came and sat down and got drinks had the menu  explained to them. After ten plus minutes  of being ignored we decided  to leave. On the way out asked to speak with the manager.  He was the manager for the night.  Explained  what had happened  and he didn't care. He did say if I wanted to stay but I showed him they already sat my table.  I am a visitor. A tourist. I do not expect  extra treatment. Just service. I asked for a corporate  number  he refused to give it.  I am here for 3 more days and was very excited  about the menu  it looks fabulous. But if they don't want to serve you because  you will not be a regular that's a shame.  Could have said sit here I will make it right.Or let's get you a better seat over here and we will make the dessert  right now.  I would have even taken here is a sugar cube but instead it was oh well post or call what ever bye.
I went to the Hualapai Location at Destination Spa.At first I was excited about giving this a try as to help boost my energy levels to help with motivation to reduce a little poundage I've been trying to lose. I purchased a groupon for "Let's Wrap" figured give it a go. I was treated by Susan Cintron. Mind you this is my first exposure to something like this so I had no idea as to what to expect or what goes on with this. Susan's demeanor comes across as brash, hard, and firm. It was a little uncomfortable for my liking. She did mention she gives people one chance and that she is a good judge of a person's character. To me that was a bit uncalled for to say. I would prefer a kinder, more nurturing demeanor, as it was I was in unknown territory not knowing what to expect in a session. She did mention I was doing good for my first time because I was on a high setting than usual for most. I thought I felt okay given what I knew or didn't know about having a wrap session. Well, a couple of days pass and I developed blisters on my right thigh. Then it turned into a 3" raised hard circle of skin. There was oozing and scabbing that started forming. I wasn't able to wear any pants that would be tight on the thigh because of this horrible formation and open sore(very bad burn- 3rd degree). When I was finally able to get back to the Spa to inform them of what happened apparently the owners were not interested in even looking at the pics of what happened. When I went in the spa manager on shift at that time was empathetic and showed concern. I did speak to another wrap technician, Heather, she couldn't apologize enough and she graciously returned my money for the future wraps I was going to do, that I had purchased at the time of my first visit. Heather had mentioned this has never happened with her clients wrap sessions before and she offered a free wrap but unfortunately I've been scarred from what happened and am too afraid to try this again. It was also discovered that Susan has only been doing wraps for a very short time. Supposedly, Susan is to be retrained in doing wraps. Also, as a special note Susan is good friends with the owner, John's wife and has said that she doesn't like dealing with John as much as she does with his wife, whatever that's suppose to mean. In my opinion, the owners of "Let's Wrap" seem incompetent with their response to this matter. If I had it to do over again, after meeting with Heather, I would have gone to her. She has more experience. In my opinion give Heather a try she seems more focused. Allowing friendship to rule over safety is unacceptable when it comes to health and well-being. In my opinion it is an unsafe environment!
Absolutely and positively the worse customer service ever. I purchased a new iPhone and went it to see if they could transfer all my stuff from one iPhone to the new iPhone. He said that they weren't able to do that because they don't have WiFi capabilities. I've had co workers tell me that their carrier ATT did it for them with no problem. I couldn't get Verizon to do it nor did he even bother to look at my phone. Low and behold the new iPhones you just need to put your phone side by side and it pairs from the other phone. If the unhelpful employee even knew anything or even gave me more than a minute he MIGHT have been able to give me that tad bit of information. Great employees you are hiring Verizon! Keep up the good work on selecting employees that lack the motivation to help others when your store is completely empty and hd couldn't take him 5 minutes or less to help someone out. This is the 3rd time we've been in a Verizon store and the employees have been lacking in customer service. The other Verizon store that lacked Good Customer service is the one on Eastern and St. Rose. Hopefully ATT or TMOBILE will get better with their  coverage so we can leave Verizon soon.
The hotel walls were so paper thin I could hear someone farting next door! ! They were screaming and yelling and we could hear every part of it! ! Since the flamingo installed the fake wooden floors, we could hear every single click of their heels as the group of girls came and left, it was terrible!!! My husband was trying to study for an exam he had the next morning, and I was under the weather, and neither of us slept well at all. You could literally hear every person walking and talking in the halls, aside from hearing our neighbors all night.  THE BATHROOM WAS OLD AND DISGUSTING!! The shower fixtures were corroded!! There were cracks in the tile where the wall and the ground met!! I was worried about possible roaches coming in!  It was a dump! I felt like I was in a cheap motel, not a Las Vegas Strip hotel and casino! The blankets on the bed were SO THIN, I don't even think there was a duvet or coverlet!  It was a thin pad of some sort between two sheets! The top layer was a sheet!!!!HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE, WE WIll NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!! I feel extra terrible because we booked a room for my inlaws and their experience was exactly the same!  All four of us said "NEVER AGAIN"!!The check in kiosks were nice, until I realized it probably puts you in the dirtiest rooms so the hotel benefits, never the customer.  I advise anyone going here to check in with the front desk, and demand an updated and CLEAN ROOM with privacy and dignity!!
This is the single worst Wells Fargo Branch I have ever visited and will never set foot inside this branch ever again.I went it to simple have the tell cash a check and then deposit the cash into my account.The Teller decided to argue with me about it.Now I didn't expect to be given treated so poorly because I wanted to cash and deposit my paycheck.  Then on top of it the teller could get the deposit right.I was standing at the window looking up my available balance through my phone app.  and it didn't show the deposit.  But the teller kept telling me that its ok the money is in there and here is a paper receipt to show it.I don't know about you but what good does a paper receipt do when the money isn't showing available in your account.  And why would I trust that it will all work out when I have never had this happen before.  I felt like I was being ripped off and my money had been stolen and that I should take it on faith that my money was in my account.  When nothing showed that and nothing was being displayed via the banks phone app.Then the teller decided to "reversed" the deposit and I had to walk outside to the drive drive up ATM, because they don't have a walk up ATM on site.  and put my money in there.  which then instantly showed up in my phone App and in statement that I could see.I have never been so insulted in my life.If this kind of treatment continues from the people at wells fargo then I guess I will just have to find a new bank and close my accounts with them.
$10 voucher for $5 is not honored. cashier said i have to spend $20. this is misleading advertising from yelp.
Unprofessional! Why,the photographer had to ask someone else how to pose us. Two adults and 2 children. How could that be hard. He couldn't get the lighting right either. When we finish I couldn't even look at the results until the next day. Why, because the person was to busy visiting with a friend. Looked at the reviews thought this place would know what there doing with 5 stars. Never ever again!
They keep shrinking their hours at this location. Seriously thinking about cancelling altogether. Love their pool and facility but they used to stay open til midnight. Now they close 11pm desk people ok, not very friendly but not rude either :-)
WORST customer service I have ever experienced.  From the sales staff to the service staff...they are all slimy guys trying to rip you off!  Horrible service!!!
I usually go to this location. This past week I had a horrible experience. I mentioned to the drive thru attendant that they had made my order wrong on my last visit. She really didn't care and said "yeah we always get orders wrong". I ended up paying for my order anyways but I prolly want come here again.  It's sad because all the girls working are usually very nice, the brunette who helped was out to lunch.
This place sucks. Twice now I've gone. The first time they put onions in my pad Thai. Who the hell does that? Doesn't say it has onions on the menu. So whatever, I'm over it. I go back to give it a second shot. I get the panang curry. How can you screw that up? Right? I get home and guess what? More onions!!! Again, didn't say it had onions on the menu. If you didn't notice, I hate onions. Also I don't appreciate paying 10 bucks for a meal, when your menu lies about what's in it. Screw you papaya Thai.
If you pay 9 dollars for a meal you should get a burger that doesnt look like someone played hacky sac with it
Well if the web site state kitchen till midnight maybe on a Friday they should be open till at least 11:00.O well will not try again considering I live five minutes away that a-shame Casey's kitchen says till midnight and they took my order at 11:00 with no questions asked . Looks like Casey's is the late night spot.
This place was one of the worst dining experiences my wife and I have had since moving to Phoenix. We had a reservation for 7:15pm and didn't get seated until 7:30pm. The waitress, when I asked about the deviled eggs appetizer, was rude and just continued acting that way the entire night. No surprise here because of how lax our waitress was, but our appetizer went to the wrong table, and the manager apologized, which was the only redeeming thing about the experience, sadly. But then our entrees took a really long time and were subpar at best. Short ribs were overcooked and seasoned poorly and the combo of everything on the plate just didn't make for a great bite. Too heavy. Wife said scallops had an odd smell and taste and were too earthy. Fried potatoes and chorizo with scallops? Not the best complement. Again, too heavy. I wouldn't go back here.
They listed 2 cars on the internet (bait cars).  I arrived and the salesman said yes they have them and walked me around the lot stopping me at 'other' cars to find that neither of the 2 listed cars were still available.  But wait,check out this VW EOS.  I said no please dont wast my time, please.  He said we can get you into this one, it's the end of the month.  I argued right off the bat saying my time is critical that I not waste it.  He assured me I can get into that car.  Long story short, it didnt happen.  I complained the next morning via email and got a call from manager telling me because of my hardship they have agreed to offer me a brand new altima sedan for 17,800!  He sent me a link to this actual car but did not realize it had the price on it at $17,100.  He offered me a 'great dea'l on a car I have no interest in and for a higher price than they have it listed for!  I asked for the owners contact info 2 times and never received.I went to Moore's in Peoria the next day and purchased that same EOS fot $4000 less,and  nicer. They also threw in a 3 yr powertrain warranty.  That is how a good business succeeds. I will also make a point to rave on their reviews.
How does this store stay in business?  I try not to come here for the very reason that happened today.  Walked in looking for a specific item.  I saw three Home Depot people chatting away by the popcorn machine.  I waited several minutes for any of them to acknowledge my presence.  It was as if I was invisible!  Could not even get popcorn!  They were so involved with talking amongst themselves.  I found another Home Depot employee actually working and he "pointed" me in the right direction.  When I got to the aisle I found what I wanted, but if I did have any questions, there was no one to be found.  How does this store stay open?  Terrible customer service!  I will spend more and go to Ace Hardware.  At least they have someone who helps you!
I went here for the second time, with two friends during lunch hour on a Saturday. I ordered the Greek Lamb Burger, it was the worst burger I've eaten in a while, because it was overcooked and burned. And not just my burger, my friends burger was burned as well. When we asked the waitress how long it would take for the food because my friend was in a rush, she hastily said "I don't know" and walked away. Not coming again.
Would give this place Zero stars if it would let me...I have been taking my car here for a while now and for the most part have been satisfied. I have a monthly pass continually for several months now HOWEVER, on my most recent visit I had a HUGE issue! I have a 2016 Honda Civic and have had no problems with the car whatsoever until this day. After they were done cleaning my car they called me over and I went to start my car and somehow my car wouldn't start and the battery was dead! When I finally got someone back to my car to tell them the issue there was already someone trying to lift my hood to jump my car and it was magically jumped within second and then the guy tells me to take the car over to their oil and lube area and they would run a battery test which they "supposedly did" and the guy told me the test is reading I have a bad battery and I need a new one...funny so I scheduled an appointment at the Honda dealership and see the printout below of what Honda's battery test said! Will never take my car here again and I will be cancelling my pass ASAP and I will be coming back in to speak with a manager about this crap because it's completely UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISHONEST!!
This place is by far the worst place I've been to. I paid 70 dollars for a gel mani/pedi. The price wasn't the issue but they done a rush job. I absolutely hate rush jobs because when u rush the job looks messy. And for that price and a crappy job I feel it's bad business. Especially when you don't get what you pay for.
I have accounts at both Chase and Wells Fargo.  Wells Fargo is a complete nightmare.  Every time I go into this branch I have issues.  When first opening up our accounts the ATM cards we received did not properly line up to our accounts.  Once we got that settled, our online banking did not work.  It took four trips to the bank to get everything working okay.  Now, many times when I use online banking the site times out on me going from one page to another.  Trying to pay two bills took me logging in three times.  RIDICULOUS!!  Hate this bank and will be moving my accounts elsewhere.
Went here often for a few months for the cheap prices and large portions. The noodles are tasteless and dry. Plain long grain rice, not steamed sticky rice. Meat is tough. I usually ordered the lemon chicken, which tasted just like that. Lemon sauce on chicken. The bf tried different things, but always had to ask for more sauce due to the dry crunchy noodles. And they didn't seem intentionally crunchy, I think it stemmed more from a lack of freshness.The final straw for me was when I ordered wonton soup and the broth tasted like dish water. I haven't been back since.plenty more cheap Chinese eats in the city. Avoid this one.
It took over an hour to park. I called the hotel and said the lot was full, they said to park at another hotel. The hallways are full of loud drunk idiots at 2am. The elevators are messed up. Who's running this place? I'd save your money and go somewhere else.
I went in to exchange a 55" TV that I got no longer than 2 weeks ago. I was told that I would get a refund because they didn't carry it anymore. I got home my fiancé informed my that we had a factory warranty, so when I went to retrieve it I was told my bank card had to be swiped a 3rd time. I contacted my bank and was told target never reissued the funds back onto my card, after I put Emily (the rep whom was helping me) on the phone with my bank i was told that I had to wait 3-5 business days. I didn't wait 5 days for them to take the money off of it. Longstory short I have to wait to make my claim to the manufacturers due to targets horrible customer service. I forgot to mention that the first time I went in an elderly group of people were raising hell, because of a five dollar coffee maker and was accommodated for their trip. I asked on my third trip what was my accommodation and was told I would have to come in again. I don't want to use the race card but I definitely think its because I'm African American with dreadlocks that I received such a hard time.
Asked if the pulled pork was spicy... (I don't do ANY spice with heat)  the waitress said no there is no spicy in it.  I said I don't want ANY spicy.  It comes and is spicy.  When told it was spicy I was told "that's the coleslaw in top"...really?  Lemon curd is delicious. Nice concept but will not be back. My waffles using krusty's are much better. and the bacon was yucky
Nothing like ordering Postmates from The Vig and opening your steak salad only to immediately see a piece of plastic sitting on top of it. Wow. It even has some dried black gooo in the middle, like they clipped the top of a chocolate dispenser and the ring landed in my salad. Well, I figured I'd separate that garbage out of my food and eat, I'm hungry. First bite I put in my mouth is an ice cold (if not thawing) piece of squash. If I wanted something plastic and frozen I would have went to McDonalds or something!. Won't be ordering The Vig again... thanks for the $24 edamame!
RSVP for 745. 815 still no table and told I have to give up my spot at the bar. Bullshit.  Get it together. Not new enough to forgive that.. left and went for Thai.
I have had great service at the Main Street location but the AIRPORT LOCATION is less to be desired.  Also, I pre-paid my reservation and then there was a better deal a day later.  They would not let me change but the girl on the phone said that she would put it in my notes to have it switched to the upgraded car at the same price at the airport.  No dice!  The airport guy didn't let me do that and he said there was no note.  I will NEVER pre-pay an offer with Advantage again.  There is no benefit to giving your money up front.  I could make a reservation and cancel it at the last moment and get something else from another company.  You would think that advantage would give the benefits to people who are willing to pay ahead.  Never again at Advantage Airport no matter what the price!!!  Oh and I asked for a Corolla which they had available and he gave me a Jetta.  I didn't care too much for the Jetta and would have liked the Corolla better.  Why couldn't they switch it to what I requested?  There wasn't anyone getting cars at advantage where Thrifty next to them had 7-9 people waiting.  Next time for the airport location I'd better go with another company. That being said... The Main St. location is great!  I usually fly with Vacations Hawaii but this time we didn't.  That was an unfortunate decision. If I used Vacations Hawaii, I would have had the opportunity to use the Main St. location and had better service and a better car.  If this was the Main St. location, I would have givien all "9-10's".
I went to this nail spa twice.  It looks so nice on the inside BUT on both occasions my nails looked awful.  So I give it a big MISS from now on.
The food is delicious the reason for one star is the extremely poor customer service. The lady taking my order was very cut off she didn't even open the screen when taking my order.  She was just in a foul mood which is honestly not my fault. If you are unhappy with your job, just get one that will fulfill you don't make it a bad experience for everyone else.
DO NOT EAT HEREWe came in here for lunch. The service was horrible. Our good took forever to get our food. And we ordered food that was in the case. We also ordered poutine, and it came out cold. We had to get our own water.
I have never felt so let down as a costomer. My 7 month pregnant wife and I have been in a vehicle debacle for going on 3 weeks. We have been searching on Craigslist for 3 weeks and have had no luck. We finally decided to try a delarship.  We arrived at this delarship. We met with one sale man, who then passed us off to a drunk sales person who smell like booze and cigarettes.  We let him know that we were looking for a reliable, low milage, and at a specific out the door priced vehicle. We were then informed of a 2009 Nissan Altima. As we were getting ready to take the vehicle for a test drive we met a 3rd sales person. The vehicle drove well. Every one knows that purchasing a vehicle is a big decision.  After the test drive my wife and I let the sales person know that we would take a couple of hours to make a final decision. Prior to leaving we did meet with the used care sales supervisor who did know of our cash purchase intention. We left then returned a short time later. No welcoming sales person and watched 2 separate sales persons act like they did not want to have anything to do with us. Then the use care sale supervisor arrived with a paper with the out the door price of 4 thousand more than what we advised in the first place. We again told them that they knew our initial intentions and advised that there was a miscommunication, no reasoning from the sales staff to make things right. Pinical Nissan staff need advise in truth and honest business reputation. We wasted 4 hours of time we will never get back. This could have all been fixed if the would have just said that they do not have anything on the lot in outer cash price range.
Wow the pizza is cold and pepperoni is falling off like an afterthought ...WTH sbarro?  Now mediocre isn't even bad enough u have to go sub par with it... Smh
DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Not only was the food cold, and poorly put together, there was a bug that came out of the ice machine. I went up to the manager, and all he did was replace the drinks. He is allowing customers to still use the ice machine. I would give zero stars if I could. Eat at your own risk!!!
I was honestly disgusted by my meal. my over easy eggs were over cooked and tasted like rubber. my toasted bread was soggy and the corn beef hash had absolutely no flavor. the only good part of my breakfast was my glass of orange juice. I couldn't even eat the food I had bought. not worth the trip or price. this place is beyond gross.
The assistant manager Allie was super rude the minute she walked out to inform us of the delay in check in. They kept having us come back and forth to check on and no positive or professional manner of answering our question. She was yelling from the beginning without any word from our mouths. And slamming pens and business cards on the floor while the girl checking us in was laughing in the back. This is so rude when we come here every year with our entire family as a trip. We love the classic ambience of el Cortez but as of today. I feel and know we will never return . It is such a rude and disrespectful hotel employee environment that makes me want to cancel my check in and go somewhere where I would pay a little extra for some quality decent service.
Nice place.  Bad service.  We left after only being served cocktails during our 1 hour wait.  No bread, no salad, no service.  Never had a chance to try their food.  I mentioned it to Shannon a co-owner, she seemed not to care.  But they sure like selling drinks while you wait for no service.  We ordered from the restaurant week menu, we had no other choice.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We were offered cocktails 3 times, we still had cocktails yet they still tried to sell us more.
I had the crab cake dinner. It was expelled by my lower body less than 15 minutes after I got home. DON'T EAT THE BAD SEAFOOD IN THIS PLACE!!!!We were dumb enough to try again. I had the Tilapia topped with crab. Terrible, Fish overcooked, dry. Crab was like eating cream of wheat. Please, I will never go back.
Very overpriced for what you get. I had the skirt steak which was stringy and tough. I've had much better meals at mad mex. Our server was extremely impersonal and we were rushed out. Will not return.
Where to start? The begging homeless outside, the screaming kids, or the over crowding at the registers?The begging homeless are a group who form a business and beg all over town. The kids well their parents are too busy shopping and lose their kids a lot. You see them screaming alone a lot. The registers are lines long, ask for one to be opened and you get ignored. They have revamped the store. Still I only come when I have to cause I'm too tired to deal with traffic. Yes I'd rather go someplace else first.
I paid to have the wiring redone on the back of my bike and a new 3 in 1 function tail light as well as have the back and front brake switches replaced because the brake function was t working and would only get bright lights. Went to go sell my bike and the guy who bought it knows a lot about electrical on bikes and had to redo all that work that I paid tons of money to have done. Not sure what my money went to or the work that was suppose to be done but it all had to be done all over again 3 months later.
There is nothing Armenian about this restaurant unless you consider Arabic food to be Armenian. Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it. As for the Arabic ( yes Arabic) food they served us, nothing special about it. Shawarma plate was tasteless, falafel was eh, barbecue was terrible. Will never be going back here again.
Disappointed!I went in rushing because they were closing in 5 minutes and yes I know it can be annoying to be the last customers. But the lady decided to lie to me that  her " register was broken and it would let her ring someone out past 10pm and that it was ahead five minutes" just bec she did not want to make one more sandwich and my sandwiches are the easiest I get tuna with just lettuce on it! Very upsetting.  Her excuse didn't even make sense. The reason I know they weren't having computer problems is bec the day before some dude was raving they got new computers. Very annoying.
Horrible customer service!!!!! Nicole & Marina have no kind of patience. I was very upset the way I was treated, they did not follow up with me after I was constantly sending them emails to confirm the package deal I needed for a bachelorette. In the beginning I was confused and was not sure what to choose from their website and these two girls were no kind of help, they just want to sell anything & make their money without trying to assist you the right way. They have no kind of patience!!!! Go somewhere else or do your research like I did to find better service & better deals!!!  I will never use their services.
Lately this Jack-In-the Box has just been a disappointment. We typically always check our bags because they seem to always forget something...it was a mistake we didn't this time. It took 30mins to get through a drive thru with 3 people in line I had to repeat everything multiple times & before I could even get my order out he would interrupt me just before I was going to say what he asked. There is a somewhat scripted protocol I get it. But allow the person to speak 1st if they don't answer what you need then ask...I sat there for 5 mins just to order, I know exactly what I want, let me tell you please...don't make me talk to you like a prompted robot, that was a headache. Then we gave them a $20 w/ exact change, they give us $3 in quarters...they didn't have anymore $1s my honey paid for it & his biggest pet peeve is "dirty" change...that why we give exact. Now he has $3 he's gotta dig out his wallet which I had to hear about, thanks to whoever's poor planning...I go to ask for Ketchup & he interrupts to tell me bye & have a good night...do I not get condiments???Come home & figure out apparently you don't get the fries with your combos anymore either. We upgrade to a large because all he wanted really was the Jack Fries...then no freakin fries!?!?! When there was 3 people to serve you took 30mins!!! You couldn't even give us a complete order!!!! Now I have to blame myself for not checking the bag as we speed out just to get the heck outta there, but no it's their fault! My honey is saying he doesn't even want to eat out anymore because of all the poor customer service, great now I'm getting more cooking duties, thanks Jack
I was kicked out of the pool here by a security guard named Richard L. because he said I was dancing in the middle concrete slab. When I told him it wasn't me, then he told me to point them out. I wouldn't point them out, and he told me I had to leave. I filed a complaint with the security supervisor and was not taken seriously. I don't plan on ever coming back here again
ABSOLUTE DENTAL Don't go there if you like your teeth!!!! Ann location is the worst. The manager is RUDE they cracked my tooth and wanted to blame it on decay and then they are going to ask me if the DR put a note in the file about it. ARE you kidding me. I called my insurance company and they agree that I need a second opinion and to stay away from there. Here is the topper the tooth they did pull they didn't even file a claim with my insurance company and its been over week. They are the worst no accountability, unreliable, and of course the DR calls out sick and of course instead of let me talk to the DR to verify what I'm saying you go to straight to my tooth is decayed. Here's a question why would you want to cover a tooth up if its decayed?  Ask your other DR at the location of Cheyenne? None of this makes any sense, except for bad services.
This place is very loud and the staff are not friendly.  The food is ok and the drinks are pretty plain.
Love tropical smoothie, but my experience tonight was less than subpar. Poor guy was working alone with a line of people out the door, so I can't blame him for the service. My health nut smoothie has way too much whey protein that it's the consistency of sand. And as for my "PEANUT BUTTER" crunch wrap.... Well there's a serious lack of peanut butter. Not to mention he also didn't chop up the bananas. (See photo)  Just to be clear, the bad review isn't for employee himself but rather the management of this store. Seems like you're working your employees like slaves and that's why the reviews here are so horrible.
Do not go here! My wife had a terrible time scheduling an appointment for our 2 day old son (extremely rude).  When we finally went got the appointment scheduled she had to wait over an hour with our newborn.  No empathy or apologies, just "you're next".  Compounding the issue there was no place for her to nurse.  Literally wouldn't go here if this was a free medical service.  We will never go back here!
this has to be one of the absolutely worst mexican food restaurant that I have been to. Came in starved. Had the guacamole ($10) hmm, thought quite steep for portion, BUT IF it was good quality, portion size doesn't matter, this  just tasted very watery - and the tomatoes on top were mushy and old, which didn't add much to the dish. This also was on a thursday, not beginning of week. The comp nacho chips and salsas were very nice. we had ordered fish tacos, and were told that people come there specifically for them. I have to admit, they were actually the worst I ever tasted, and I love fish tacos. Is it because we came in around 9pm? The fish was so limp, greasy and, just not at all fresh tasting either so not sure when it was actually prepared, earlier in day? The cole slaw had no taste or flavor at all, or crunch of any kind. Chilli relenos looked great and were fine, but then ¼ of the order was just onions.  Bottled beer was good, but margarita was so very watered down. This was just a big disappointment overall. I suggest trying some of the other mexcian restaurants in the city, where freshness and quality play an important role in the food served
I DO NOT recommend moving into this place!!!!Moved in last November and they enticed us with a "brand new" club house and new amenities. The clubhouse hasn't been finished and it's almost a year gone by!They also said they would replace our washer and dryer since it takes 3 hours to do one load and it's from the 70s. Never replaced after a few calls and messages.Said they would fix our outside storage door and fix our carpeting since it was installed horribly and is coming up with nails sticking out. Nothing.We have to renew our lease since budget is tight, and they tried to raise it on us. Keep in mind the downstairs apt and a few others by me have been vacant for 2 months atleast.Probably going to renew the lease..but that's cause of the location and the hassle of moving to a new place.DONT MOVE HEREThis is an update..front office said maintenance will come Tuesday August 4th between 9-11am. And would come over the next couple days to fix things.NO ONE showed and it is already Friday!! They said someone would come first thing in the AM 8/7. Let's see if they come.
WARNING: don't speak Chinese,  expect to get no service. They prefer to serve Chinese speaking customers. I'm Chinese,  but I'm born here so I don't speak it well. Got no service. Actually I got bad service. If i could give this place a ZERO STAR I would. And I see myself as a veey fair reviewer and rarely give a 1 star to restaurants. But this place just broke that record for the worst service and lack of organization. First of all, Good luck getting served here if you speak English and not Chinese or remotely look Chinese. We waited 20min for any server to give us service once we got  seated ... that's actually kind of ridiculous. My friend and I didn't speak Chinese we spoke English which got us less service as the waiting staff didn't want to give us eye contact. What are we? ALIENS or something? I thinking living in Canada you need to know English as a language no? We literally had to flag someone to give us some attention 2x before they actually took our order. Secondly, when my order came it was missing parts to it (I.e. the sauce bowl that came with the plate was empty) took us another 10 minutes to flag someone to let them know they gave me an empty sauce bowl. The waitress took it to the back kitchen and then came back with my meal 5 minutes later. Once my meal was plopped in front of me, I then begin to notice a HUUUUGE LONG piece of pewbby hair on my rice (notice on the photo I am attaching with this review). I was so disappointed and now disgusted with my order I don't even know how we continued to wait here and eat. My friend was hungry so we toughed this one out and stayed. Finally all our orders came but after a long wait. I felt that after I complained about the long disgusting piece of hair in my meal, all they did was pick it out with their finger and plopped it back on my table. GROSS!!!! I didn't eat my rice at this point. By the time we finished our meal we realized they didn't even serve us our soup which came with our meal. This is literally an hour later they didn't even think to check if they got our order right or wrong. Here I am frustrated with this nasty place. Service is horrible and kitchen is possibly dirty. Please do not go here unless you want to be ignored and not get any service at all. I'm a very fair reviewer but when your restaurant gives bad service to paying customers, I think someone has to speak up and say something otherwise restaurants that are run badly will continue to run badly because they don't know. I won't be coming here again. I'll be going back to my favorite one which is NEW CITY located literally beside blue ocean restaurant. This place gets a ZERO star from me if it was even possible. Fix your customer service weather you are a small restaurant or a large restaurant. Otherwise you will get bad reviews for treating your customers badly. Dining should always be a good experience especially if your a paying customer to eat at such a place.
ehhh, this place is overpriced for what you get. Poke eats has better bowls! i wanted to explore different poke bowls, but wouldn't go back to this place.
ahaha hahaha ahhahahah ahahaha.....uhhh.... no.No.  simply... yeah.  no.
Greeted with a damp musky smell of freshly mopped up vomit.  After drinking half of a Manhattan I discovered that there were two dead flys at the bottom.  Classy.
Probably one of the worst experiences I've had. We sat down around 6:20pm and it took over an hour to get our food. One table got up and left because it was soooo slow. The salad that was promised took 15 minutes to arrive and we never even got our breadsticks even though we were told 3 different times they were coming. Apparently there was only 1 person working the whole kitchen. I wish they would have said something before we wasted our time waiting. Honestly I've had better Italian food down the road. The service was sparse and not very friendly. I ordered Linguine and Meatballs. The meatballs were actually very good but the pasta was over cooked and there was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta given. I most likely won't be returning. I get better food and service at Olive Garden.
I've only ordered delivery from this location twice and BOTH times they've gotten my order wrong. Not things like topings either, straight up forgot items or given us the wrong size sandwiches. I'm done ordering from these clowns. Take your $$$ elsewhere.
Response to company: As Scotty L. also had the same problem in his review and there are many more less than favorable reviews about your company concerning communication, there must be an issue with this part of the business. "Criminal" was the wrong word to use but misleading and poor customer service are completely accurate. I wish your business cared more about reputation with their customers and less with increasing profit.
I mean, I'm not expecting much but...1. Ask for honey bbq sauce, they gave me buffalo.  2. Ask for extra gravy, didn't get any.3. The wings were UNCOOKED  on the inside!!Feel like I need to spend hundreds  of dollars on doctor bills to check for salmonella after $15 meal.
you need to train ya gurl amber because she doesn't know the art department or where to find gold leaf paper. anyways. you should probably just hire someone for the art department in general. thx. bye.
I did not stay, I was extremely disappointed to find out you had to be over 21 to sit on the patio at 6pm. I had my 12 year old with me and it was a beautiful night and the inside atmosphere couldn't compare to being outside. I've never heard of such a policy and couldn't justify staying.
Pros:Good fries. Open 24 hours a day.Cons:Waited 20 minutes though for my to-go fries order. Can't call downstairs to order take out. The servers are NOT helpful. The hostess I don't think completely understood English. Did I mention I waited TWENTY MINUTES for a side order of fries at a DINER!?!?!
BEWARE!! Do not go here. They have absolutely no customer service. I showed up 1 min late for a class. Besides not letting me in the charged me a late arrival fee. They then told me to callback at noon to get into a later class. After calling for over an hour I kept getting a voicemail. I left 2 voicemails and an rvw of my experience. I get a call back from a woman who would not give me her name and after calling me dumb and cursing at me she hung up. I called back the same woman said they don't want to talk to me and stop calling. A paying customer!! The owner then sends me a long email saying I need to pay the late arrival fee. No apology or anything for the complete trash of customer service they offer. I called groupon to get a refund and explain the situation and the groupon rep was completely surprised at couldn't believe it. She issued me a refund with no problem. Stay away from this business. I searched reviews after this experience and they all say the same thing. They wanted my credit card info to "keep on file" for a groupon purchase.
That had to of been one of the saddest sandwich experiences of my life. First off it took an inordinate amount of time to go through the drive-through. It was 10 bucks for a sandwich with chips and a drink. They totally skipped on the protein of the sandwich and it was basically a giant piece of bread with a lot of veggies. Mine was supposed to have pesto on it and I didn't get even a hint of pesto.  I'll be heading back to Jimmy John's where they don't skimp on the protein in the sandwich.
First off this is my first review on yelp. I don't do reviews. That should mean it's either really good or really bad for me to post this to the public. Unfortunately this is a really bad one. 4 stars? Wow! What are people thinking? This place is horrible! Salad was old and full of water with nothing else really. Whatever that white sauce with cucumbers in it I believe was nasty. I'm assuming it was a type of taziki sauce. Chicken is fine if u like unseasoned meat just grilled. I expected more marination of sorts. Basically no effort except cutting chicken and putting it on the grill. My girlfriend bought two meals. I had the chicken kabob. The yellow rice is completely tasteless. I could buy one of those instant rice packets at the store and been more satisfied for .99 cents. Not sure how this place is still in business. Wouldn't go back for free. I would not recommend it to anyone! If you think this is even half way decent food from anywhere, well I feel sorry for you and I should make you a meal that would easily surpass this place with just about zero effort. Just to let everyone know I had no expectations of this place good or bad. I would be happy to help the owners for free to provide a better product. I work for a very large hospitality company that serves all kinds of food and different types of experiences. This has to be one of the worst places I ever ate and paid for it. I'm a food and beverage manager in Vegas who is from Chicago and let me say this food needs a lot of help. Save your money. Really, if you need help I'd give my consultation for free if wanted. In fact I wouldn't mind a refund if possible. Sorry:(
You can skip this place. .too many pretend cowboy wannabees..if you don't look the part they won't dance with you. .you will have more fun across the street at What the Hell bar and grill. ..
Writing this review as I'm sitting inside Kaka... filled with disappointment. - the batter on all fried items were bad, had to peel off the batter for it to be edible- rolls look and taste bland and no falvour at all....this make T&T sushi taste delicious in comparison...- fried scallop and chicken karage didn't taste good either. Again, no taste I do give it to them that all the ingredients are relatively fresh. However.. this is no way worth the 35 per person price tag. We are giving their speciality rolls a try as we speak. Wish us luck Update: speciality rolls are decent.. if you have absolutely no choice and had to eat here.. just get the specialty rolled and dessert. But I do hope this never happens to youUpdate 2: dont get the desserts...
The service was soooo slow and we were one of 6 tables! The food was cold and lacked any flavor! One star is being generous!
Worst customer service from the short old woman who claims she is a manager. Absolutely the rudest and most obscene experience I've ever had at a location. Always grouchy and treats every customer and employee horribly. Rest of the staff is absolutely phenomenal but that old woman is the worst experience I've ever had. Will not be coming back if she is still employed.
I had a really bad experience with the fillings I had this Wednesday. My appointment was at 3:40pm I didn't get called in until around 4:00pm and the dentist didn't come in until 10 minutes after. That wasn't the bad part. The bad part is  I didn't really have issues with the 2 tooth that they suggest I get a refill for (#30, 31). I was eating fine, didn't really notice any chipping and I was able to eat food much better than my other side that had crowns on. But I decided to trust their judgment and it was a big mistake.  After he drilled the hole and put in the filling, he filled it down and his drill (or whatever tool that dentist use) touched my top tooth on my upper jaw. If you're working on my bottom tooth why is your drill touching my upper tooth? I tried to open my mouth wider so it won't happen again, but it HAPPENED AGAIN! Now I can feel and see an indent on my top tooth. I feel like he did it on purpose so I would come back to and fix the top tooth and get more insurance money out of me. But after going through all of that unnecessary procedure my teeth are not any better, it's super sensitive now and I can't eat anything hard or crunchy. The filling on one tooth even looks lopsided. It looks like he filled down too much on one end.  Now it really looks like it's chipped. Trust your gut, don't always go with your dentist recommendations if you feel like you don't need it. I've been going to for a few years now but after this, I'll be looking for a new dentist.Updates:The dentist called after he saw the review and explained that the reason why he filled my top tooth was because it's a canine tooth and he filled it down to fit my bite line. But I thought #30 and 31 is a molar, not a canine tooth.  If that was the case, I would have been nice if he told me before he did it because I was very worried. He did offer to fix it at no charge. I was waiting to see if the tooth will settle and it has been a week and my bite is still sensitive.
We chose this hotel because it was close to where my brother was getting married. We stayed for 2 nights. The curtain would not close completely so there was a strip of sunlight that woke us up each morning. And housekeeping missed our room. No clean towels, beds were not made, trash was not emptied. They simply didn't do it. Disappointing because when we came back to the room later that night after the wedding with friends and relatives, we were surprised to see it had not been touched. Embarrassing.  The next day when we checked out we told the front desk and they barely squeaked out an apology. It's as if they didn't care. So, I guess we stay elsewhere next time. The only reason I gave it one star is because it had a nice deli, and ice cream place.
We waited almost 2hrs for our food the lady on the phone said they were behind a little. I waited again after another 45min called again. No very happy with the service at all. You could of at least refunded me and I would of ordered from somewhere else and probably would of gotten it faster. I don't recommend this place to you.
Beso Off  is the best way to put it. A restaurant that needs to be shuttered - and in a city where there are many other choices, most likely will not continue to survive as the place does not seem to really care about the issues with the restaurant.And cheap food  - as in quality, not price. Or, the head chef is just way too enamored with salt, which is usually used to hide the cheap flavoring of sub-par steaks, especially the way that they slather it on everything.So, this is a cluster beyond clusters. We came here for a business dinner because the Los Angeles location has good reviews. Big mistake.The wait, etc was not bad. We made a reservations, they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our party there. The wait staff - Craig and Angie - were super nice, very charming and had more common sense than the assistant manager on duty, Chad Jahn. Yep, totally using the full name.So, let's start with the cluster:A) Fire in the kitchen (grease fire) that made the whole place smoky. The grill is right there, so you can "see" them cooking steaks. Big whoop, sorta cool, but OBVIOUSLY too small for a restaurant of the size. And, apparently, the back kitchen is just as bad.B) Our salads/soups come out fine - nothing spectacular, but not terrible - and then we wait for the steaks. And wait. And wait. Oh, by the way, it's only 8.30 when we sit down but they're already out of the bone-in filet which the waiter talked up. How do you run out of a steak by 8.30 PM? Kitchen incompetence??C) We're still waiting for our steaks. It's a good 45 minutes post-finishing our salads and appetizers. We're still waiting. And still waiting.D) Angie and Craig are proactive, and good wait staff; they come up to us and apologize about the wait. It's not their fault - the kitchen is run by incompetents, but they do their job and do it well. E) The steaks come out ... medium rare. Not the medium that was ordered but the medium rare. We send them back, and one comes back ... charred on the outside, but still rare/medium rare. He's too nice to send it back, and the issue is that the kitchen is backed up so just sending out steaks. Good way to settle a problem with an incompetent kitchen staff: send out undercooked meat and hope they don't send it back to cause more setback in the kitchen. Idiots.F) I ask for the manager - the man with no freakin' sense to come to our table. This would be Chad Jahn, who looks like a former bouncer that has been elevated to restaurant manger. Demote him back to bouncer, that's what he seems he'd be good at. We talk to him, tell him the issues ... and he never checks up on us again. Good management skills, asshat!! Oh, and he doesn't acknowledge our issues when we leave. He did take care of the bill, but I think he had to be told to do that (I told him we're getting free desserts). G) I got churros. I like churros. The churros at Costco are better than Beso. Um, useless kitchen staff, churros are served hot. H) So, while walking outside with the colleague for her to smoke, we pass by former colleagues and they ask how it went. We told them it sucked, to leave. There was this long-haired guy listening to us. I'd noticed him for a bit walking around, so I said "are you one of the owners" and he said, no, he's just waiting for a friend. Um, found out he is one of the owners. If, as an owner, you cannot take responsibility for your poor service and food, the restaurant as a whole are doomed. Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!! His (or Chad's) solution to the fire and the wait was to offer free Sangria. Thanks, and those that don't drink thank you also. Idiots.I) Like I noted, the food was salty. The steaks had a salt layer that should not be necessary if they are really Harris Ranch. The string beans, mushrooms and other vegetables were slathered with salt as well. Salt is a lazy additive for poor quality and tasting food. Draw your own conclusions here. We got out of there 3 1/2 hours later, when it should have been 1 1/2 hour dinner. It's not because we were socializing, but because it was just waiting and waiting and waiting and then sending back food and waiting. The place is a train wreck rapped up in hipster clothing (well, like most things hipster) and the management (and owner) seem unable to manage or take ownership of the problems and issues. Good riddance for when it shuts down (the chef should not be a head chef), but our wait staff rocked and should be at a better place.Eva Longoria Parker should be ashamed her name is associated with this place. But, it might not be that long before others force it out. I heard Mastro's is opening in Vegas...Update: Yay!  A fake review posted by an employee or PR person for the restaurant!! Thanks Megan!
THEY ARE RACIST AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST Non-ASIAN CUSTOMERS.  I had been here in the past and was disappointed with the service.  Today I was in a hurry and was passing by so I thought I'd give it another try.  My experience has taught me that the best Chinese restaurants around are frequented by Asians.  Look no further than Cravings and Golden Harbor to see this.  They are outstanding establishments with the best Chinese food in town.  Evo also has a strong Asian following; however, if you are not Asian you will get different service, which is what I experienced.  The employees were short with me and gave me a fraction of the food that they had given Asian students in front of me.  Outside of this post I will not make a stink about this.  I will just choose not to eat there.
Grossest Chinese food I've ever had. I ordered the PuPu Platter last night and all the appetizers were overcooked. (The egg rolls were almost burnt). I also ordered teriyaki chicken. It looked like no teriyaki chicken I've ever seen. The chicken wasn't pre-marinated and had a sauce the consistency of water that stank. I couldn't eat it. Hugely disappointed and wast of $30 (including delivery fee, tax, tip, etc).
Wife and I both got sick over their pizza.  It didn't taste right.  I did like the peppers they use.  But that's the only nice thing I have to say.
The long haired dude that served me looked and acted like he wanted to chop me into little pieces with a machete, so I just left. Thanks for nothing :)
Horrible concession lines. Stood in line for 40 minutes for a water. Missed entire second act. Horrible system! Never be back. Pouring a can of beer or water into a plastic cup and creating more garbage and adding to your wait. Ridiculous!
if i could give them no stars i would.  worst bedside manner, and no human manners in general.  vulgar and rude doctor and his staff follows his lead. dr hisham sirsy and his staff should all find a job that better fits their personalities and makes them happier people....or better yet save children and their parents the fear and aggravation and RETIRE
I bought a audi 4 and it was the worst car I ever bought...check engine light consistently keeps back on, the owner  Jacob "tried " fixing but couldn't,so I end up fixing it myself with a little research. The car came with a spare tire that was flat,less then a year the rear back window went out,glove compartment hinges broke,fuel gas leak and til now check light still lighting up . Before you buy any car,trucks or SUV make sure you check every single details on the vehicles and ask for carfax or call your car insurance for a carfax. The audi a4 I bought is a lemon car.
As with some of the other reviews I've read we've had a TERRIBLE time with customer service and how our account has been handled by Sparkletts since they took over O Premium Water.  They said they would honor our contract with O Premium which was an unlimited amount of water monthly for the amount we were paying O Premium (we use the water for cooking, ourselves and our five pets and also wanted extra bottles that we could use for an emergency situation).As time went on they began taking back water bottles and not replacing them.  I called them and was told they did not do unlimited water and I spent an hour on the phone with them and finally settled for 16 bottles of water a month for a similar cost.  Again after a while went by they began taking bottles and not replacing all the ones left out.  When I called them this time I was told the account manager had changed our water amount based on our usage.  I again reminded them that we were also using the water for water storage purposes (and by the way they did not reduce our monthly bill).  We went back and forth and finally I was told the account manager would call me back.  This never happened and I have been working on an alternate solution since.Funny thing although they didn't honor the orginal O Premium agreement nor their verbal contract with me they wanted to take back the water cooler (which is about 10 years old and was paid in full 5 years ago) and to charge me the $52 cancellation fee that O Premium had in their contract.  Apparently the contract only protects them and not the consumer.  I'm really glad we can be done with this company the customer service has been abhorrent.  Honestly I don't even want to give them ONE STAR.
This review is against the sales and finance department.  Never have I felt so taken advantage of in my life!  We have purchased new vehicles from Nissan in the past and had great experiences - this dealership obviously doesn't hold itself to a high standard.  Lets start with the sales process - we informed them we didn't want to be in there for hours and would appreciate them respecting our time - 3.5 hours later with the ridiculous back and forth we agreed on a price - mostly out of exhaustion.They made so many mistakes with our service plan and extended warranty that it took over 9 phone calls and an hour and a half in their showroom trying to get our issues resolved - at the end of it all we were offered an oil change and  a tire rotation - big deal!We will never buy Nissan from this dealership again
If this was the LAST moving company in the world I'd move all my stuff on a tricycle first!!!!!No furniture pads were used unless I asked. Numerous nicks, scratches and gouges in furniture and apartment fridge (I use for drinks). I finally told my husband to have them drop everything in the garage. When it came time to pay they only take cash. No credit cards NO debit cards NO checks (understandable). BUYER BEWARE.
Slowest service.  Drive thru took 25 mins...Just got home and updating my review. The drive thru was a horrible experience. Multiply cars just left in front me after placing their order and before paying. So they had no idea who placed which order once I arrived at the pick up window and no one even cared either. This place has a great location and they seem to be busy at most times during the day, but if they do not approve their customer service and wait time they will not last too long.  Great location for a Chick-fil-A is this place goes under...Food is okay.  General Tso and the Kung poa are the better options I have experienced so far.
This club is by far the worst in town. Bouncers have no manners, treat people with no respect. They forget that they're there to help customers, not to give attitudes. Dress code policies seems to be very random. One day you're allowed in with this outfit, that shoes, the next day you're not. We all left because one of our friends were refused of entry by the same outfit that he wore the week before, and he was able to enter with that same outfit the week before. Cover is $20 after a certain time, and IT IS NOT WORTH OF YOUR MONEY. I repeat, NOT WORTH OF YOUR MONEY.
My daughter went inside to ask how long the girl said right now, she said OK and went to to tell me as I parked my car.. Then we waited and waited, I asked the front desk girl,  I thought right now? Girl forgot to ask for my daughter's name, so others went ahead...ok...waited a bit then got seated, in room with older chairs and dirty as well...she wipes down .. now it begins..both of us decided to get  45.00 service,  most expensive one, my person went to open a plastic case of tools..while two others doing other peoples feet got tools opened in sterile envelope, along with my daughter ..I stated to her I would like that as well and you are supposed to do so for each new person...then had to also ask for new file and new buffer, also items each person is required to have per health dept . Person begins my pedicure, doesn't clean sides of toes thoroughly, doesn't scrub off callous properly. Left over undone areas, so had to get redone at another spa, I usually go to but decided to try here since friend said great place lol..my place is where one never has to ask for sterile tools, and you leave with new baby feet, no callouses, awesome massages, now back to experience..My person doesn't massage properly at all so other girl doing my daughter's feet translates, my person laughs, then my person keeps doing what she was doing...NOTHING, not even strong enough to rub lotion into skin...really ...then I decide before she starts my other leg of A MASSAGE THAT FEELS LIKE  NOTHING... I told her I no longer want the deluxe..forget the mask step and call it a day...so I could get the heck out of there...the front desk girl was very kind and apologetic and viewed my sub par callous removal and didn't want us to leave unhappy, so lowered our prices. I appreciated her doing the right thing and might give them one more chance in the future.. This unfortunate experience has tarnished my feelings and that they are truly trained in hygienic processes..
I wish I could pick zero stars.....     So dirty...the bathroom floor had hair, hair, and more hair... I did try wiping some up with a wash cloth, but without a vacuum, mop, and bucket, forget it...there was no helping this place. The bottoms of our feet were filthy just from walking back and forth between the bathroom and the bed.      We folded down the quilt, so it was on the bed, but wouldn't touch us, as it looked dirty. (At least it didn't have yellow pee stains, like the sheets on our friends bed, in a room on the first floor!)     There were 2 bars of soap, no shampoo, no blow dryer. We got 2 towels and 3 wash cloths for a 2 night stay. Our bed was not made, after we were gone all day, and no clean towels for night #2.      The smell was, well I can't even explain it. Maybe something had rotted in there?  That is what it reminded me of.      I don't expect much for $100 a night, but I do expect a clean room.      I went and spoke to management, but was not offered any type of compensation. The new GM offered to get someone to come and clean up, but my husband was already in bed, as he was not feeling well. The girls in the office, Stephanie in particular, were very nice.      We would have left, but couldn't get another room, in the area that we needed to be close to for those particular days.
Our service experience was as bad as I have ever received.  They are over booked and only completed one of three items that needed done.  The service tech was more excited about telling how superior they were to our previous provider, Gaudin.  He is delusional.  When I received my car back it was dirty and had a bad smell that lasted two days.  We had to go on a road trip, so we just endured it.  We will travel to Phoenix or LA for future service.
Burgers weren't bad. The fat cow behind the drive thru window had such a nasty attitude. Shoved money in my hand, when food came she handed it and said "here u go". Closed the window and turned her back.
I went to this Rita's location on April 3. I had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon for my birthday so my husband, daughter, and I got in the car and drove 15 minutes to the store. I ordered 2 regular gelatis (listed on their sign as $3.30) and a kid-sized custard (I didn't see the price but I'm guessing it's less than a regular gelati). I asked the girl for lids so I could take them home. She didn't have any lids for the regular sized gelatis, so she dropped the regular size cup into a large size cup so she could put a large lid on it. I handed her my buy 1 get 1 coupon and she then rang me up. As she was pressing buttons on the register I heard her say "a large gelati..." I reminded her that I didn't get a large gelati, I got a regular and then she plopped the regular cup into the large cup so that she could put a lid on it. She said "oh yeah... That's what I meant to say." Yet she didn't fix it on the register... She said my total was $9.03!! I asked again if she has charged me for a regular gelati and rang up my coupon and she didn't seem to get it... $9.03 was obviously way too high. My husband and toddler were in the car waiting and I could tell this girl was never going to understand what I was saying, so I paid and left. On the drive home I regretted not insisting she fix the price... The only reason we had driven 15 mins was because of the coupon. I emailed the store as soon as I got home. I explained what had happened. I thought maybe the manager of the store would at least send me a coupon for my free gelati I was supposed to get to begin with. That was over a week ago and I have not gotten a reply.My husband and I are huge Rita's fans. When we lived in Ohio we went there just about every week. Our local Rita's in OH was amazing. They sent us buy 1 get 1 free coupons every single month, and the staff were very friendly. We moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago and this is the first time I've gotten a coupon from this location even though we signed up on their email list. We've also had issues with their Italian ice being extremely soupy from this location, even on cooler days. We will never go to this Rita's again.
I wouldn't normally take the time to write a review, but my HORRIBLE experience today has driven me to do so.  Their Customer Service Call Center is atrocious!  Not only are you placed on hold for forever (my combined calls amounted to nearly an hour and a half in wait time), but whenever they attempted to transfer me to another department, the call was dropped!  They never answered any of my questions, only repeated what I had stated in the beginning.  I suggest to request to speak to a manager (the one that actually took my call was quite helpful) if you want to get anything done.
We must have gone here on a bad day.  I had read great reviews and brought people here to eat for breakfast.  Everything was cooked very poorly and tasted bad.  We were really hungry and not that picky, yet not one of us finished more than half our breakfast.  :(
Met the head chef Shane or Forrest, whatever his name was. You would think he walked on water the way he treated you. Great music, cheap drinks, but don't expect much else.
$14 for a matinee is outrageous!  Was told I am paying for the amenities the theater offers.  Shouldn't the customers using those amenities be paying for that?  They have a bar and an ice cream shop which is great if you wanna spend a mortgage payment. I think most people just wanna see a movie.  The inside is very nice and clean. The seats are nice too.  Not are usual Harkins we go to. For some reason this Harkins really wants to stick it to its customers!
Do not order from this location. I never received my order after 1.5 hrs. I asked for my order to be refunded but was told they could not do that and I had to contact Eat24. So no food and a charge on my credit card.
It has been hit or miss with this location but they missed the mark with me for the last time. I purchased a pick a couple of months ago only to have it break. I took it back to exchange it and the lady at the returns desk wouldn't exchange it. I get that they no longer carry the one I had but give me something for an exchange. The sales associate tried really hard to get her to look it up online but she wouldn't budge. I left the pick there (a piece of junk) and went to Lowes. I will no longer spend any money at Home Depot.
This company was sent out through home warranty. My a/c broke on a Saturday. Warranty company said they can't send someone out till Monday. Air pros get here on Monday and says my blower fan is broken. Says he has to order the part and could take 3-4 days. WTF, I live in Vegas! Parts should be readily available. A week and a half later, and the hottest week so far, I'm still waiting for the part to be installed. Thank god for Sam's Club and portable air conditioners.
The girl working the front desk was super rude and unhelpful. Had to ask her several questions to even understand the process. Finally got in room and it was not cleaned. Bed was messed up and tv wouldn't work. Never even got an apology when we asked for a new room. Will never stay at this hotel again or any microtel.
The pizza was not that remarkable.it came barely warm. One person in our party ordered a chicken wrap and as the rest of us finished our pizza the wrap still had not been served. We eventually cancelled it . The staff was apologetic .
As someone who has worked with many museums, I was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call "cozy" or "charming" - basically any euphemism for small.That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to "just look around" and "do whatever." At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.
This actually used to be one of my favorite hotel/casinos back in the day.  Oh, how things have changed.There are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.The biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. The "Space Lounge" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.With their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their "big draw" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.The arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  There's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was "ha ha" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.Ladies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.As critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called "Triumph" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.The sad part is, Hilton's one of those "history rich" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.This place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.
Decent food. Fishermen lobster or even congee queen can do better than this. Nice decor but that is it. I don't expect too much service from a Chinese restaurant but I gotta say that the hostess and waitress weren't welcoming at all. Won't recommend this place to anyone.
Pros: Fun atmosphere, great for people watching, mechanical bull is unique in my experienceCons: I had the chicken tenders and fries and while the tenders were alright, the fries were pretty terrible. I've had fries that didn't taste good before, but these were the first fries I've experienced that actually tasted bad. After dinner, I felt sick and had to drink lots of water to get the taste out of my mouth. Would not go again!
I love bookstores, and I love to spend some time browsing and flipping through the books and having a generally pleasant time. I would have enjoyed it more, though, if this store were organized better. It was nothing but an exercise in frustration going through the fiction section. I am not sure if it was a matter of the store being in transition, or what was going on, but the "General Non Fiction" shelves included a number of books that should have been filed in the fantasy or science fiction shelves, which were incredibly tiny as it was. It make finding anything incredibly difficult, as it was hard to tell if they just didn't carry a particular author, or if it was mistakenly shelved elsewhere.Service was perfectly polite, the Starbucks inside is pretty comfortable and a good place to relax. However, if a bookstore wants to compete with Amazon, they really need to have their stuff together and not annoy the customer.
I passed Five Guys, In-N-Out, Carl's Jr, and Sonic to get to The Habit.  It won't happen again. I don't know where all these five stars are coming... but their burger tasted like an unseasoned Sonic burger... and more overpriced than Five Guys. I WILL SAY THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT!
I just want to note that I am all about eating quality sushi. I have been to many sushi places  and I know when the sushi is worth the money. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there. We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor. If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest.
The reviews for this place on Facebook are great so despite not having a presence on Yelp, I made an appointment.  I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.
3 stars for food, but the service was awful. Appetizers were ordered and all the food was brought out at once after wondering where the food was. Saw multiple tables served while we sat around waiting for the check. Won't be back!
There are good things, and bad things about this tiny airport. The bad things are, no food, no bar, just vending machines a couch and a big screen TV. The good thing is that this airport is so small, only American Eagle flies here, that when you show up for your flight, you can sit on the couch or an easy chair and watch TV while you wait for the security guys to show up. Then everyone on your flight (~32 people) go through security and get on the plane.
this place is lame! my boyfriend and i decided to check it out because it was their very first 80s night and some dude working for the club gave us a free pass.so we waited in line about a half an hour, dealt with the rude doorman, got in and um. not much else to be said. "80s night" was going on outside on the patio, and they were playing the worst of the 80s. bad 80s/hip hop mash ups were going on inside with trashy mid-westerners dancing on tables.we chugged our drinks and were in and out in about 10 minutes.
Some really great produce prices, which are what pulled us in.  We got a newspaper flyer from them last week and decided to check it out, based on that.  Still, I kept thinking, isn't this the place [friends of ours] went to and said wasn't that great??The produce is priced well but it seems like everything else is on the high side.  Bulk food section was small-ish, I though.  I meant to bring a pen and paper to write down prices of items I usually buy, to compare RBN, WF, TJ's, and EEFCO - but forgot.  But long grain brown rice was $1.99 here, which is same as EEFCO.  I think walnuts are more at RBN, though.  Basically - don't believe the low price claims!I think we may go back for produce and that may be it.  Free parking is nice, though - they cover 2 hours, which would give you a little time to wander, too.  Parking is covered which is oh so nice.One negative for families is no changing table in the bathrooms.   I had to change a diaper  on the floor of the bathroom on my husband's coat.  Yeah, the floor was pretty clean, but still.  Ugh.  Not a good thing for families!update - they did eventually add a changing table, but I guess their low priced produce and high priced everything else model didn't make many people happy.  Defunct!
I've been to almost every cigar store worth going to in Phoenix and I have to say that the Tinder box has a lot of potential and that's about it. The store itself is nice but once you enter the huge humidor you quickly realize that somethings not quite right. the humidor is only 30 to 40%  full and of that 30 to 40% of cigars it's a lot of off brands, bundles and empty boxes of cigars on the shelves. When the cigar inventory improves the tinder box will warrant another look and probably 4 stars but for now it's 2 stars, you can't call yourself a legitimate cigar store without legitimate cigars.
I was excited to try this place after seeing the reviews. Unfortunately this place was a real let down. The best thing about this place was the corn tortillas for the street tacos. Service was friendly. Ordered the tinga, viniargretta, and carnitas. All bland and nothing special. Salsa's ranged from very hot to hot. Most were hot without any flavor. We won't be back as there are better options with more flavorful protein and salsas to choose from.
Hey, I love the Vig Arcadia. I would go there all the time if it was closer. Great food, cool place, good atmosphere, and the best band on Sunday. I even had my birthday party there, with people driving all the way from Gilbert and Queen Creek.  I like the Vig McCormick ranch, same great food and cool atmosphere but still a bit of a drive. I was so excited there was a Vig being built right in my neighborhood. I watched the construction progress on my way to and fro work. I told my friends who didn't know about the Vig how awesome it was and how excited I was to have one close. It was going to be my number one go to place.  I have been going to Local Bistro, Modern Sports Grill in DC ranch and Isabell's. Now there would e a Vig which is closer and better.I went to the Vig and it was ok, I figured they had just opened and they were still hiring and getting organized.  I went  again. Food was great, bummer no band due to Scottsdale rules but DJ is nice. Service ok but its busy on a Friday. I went again, food great as always but service still lacking. I figured its just busy. At this point I had gone 4 Friday nights in a row. Its close great food and I have always loved the Vig. I don't get why I have to wait so long to get a drink at the bar. I don't understand why once I get a drink, I'm not offered a refill or second round. I'm trying to unwind on a Friday night, I don't want to have to work to get the bartenders attention to get a drink. Ok had my cocktails, now time for dinner. The food has always been great. Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times. The food comes out quickly enough and luckily its good since the wait staff doesn't check back. My friends and coworkers know I go out to eat quite a bit. I am often asked for recommendations, I had said to go to the Vig but I feel I can't recommend it anymore. If anything I would say to go somewhere else. I fell like the McDowell Mountain Ranch location has been open long enough to be running smoothly but its not apparent in the bartenders and wait staff.  Please get better with your service. I want to love this Vig as much as the others but its getting hard. I work hard for the money I spend at the Vig and don't like feeling unappreciated as a customer.
I was so excited to try this place after many people recommend this place. When we arrived we had to wait in the entrance for couple minutes.  Than we were placed at a table and the server came 5 good minutes later.  When he arrived we ordered drink and food.  We had time to visit all the shop and after wait at the table. The food arrived  and all our meats were dry and hard. The tabooli tasted like the presley was old... we all left more than the half of our plates and very disappointed..
I would have given this place 1 star if not for the service from the front desk.  I checked in on Saturday during memorial day weekend, waited 30 minutes to try to valet park my car and failed to get on the porte cochere due to mismanagement and understaffed valet crew.  There is no excuse for that kind of thing at a hotel especially where there is no self park option.  Ended up parking across the street at the mall to check in, ridonkulous.The service at the front desk was good to great, they were apologetic about the valet and whenever I called down for my car (once I was able to valet my car), they fought to have my car ready by the time I got down.  Accommodations are decent, nice big jet tubs, good sized rooms and a mini kitchenette in the studios to boot because these are condotel units.  The location, despite being off strip, is workable because you're walking distance to the Wynn and directly across the street from Fashion Show.  If you're staying here, you probably don't want a casino and so being next to fashion show is a plus.  I can't stress how understaffed this hotel seemed to be and so I probably won't stay here again if I'm paying the same price as a on-strip 4star hotel.  I was able to book at a $100 discount to other comparable hotels with a casino though so something to keep in mind.
Last night we had a take out of Butter Chicken. I ordered it as medium spice. The butter chicken sauce tasted like sweet tomato sauce. It reminded me of panera bread tomato soup. It was that sweet. Tamarind used to have good delicious food. I don't mind paying more for delicious food but their quality has gone down. It's more expensive than other local establishment and food quality has degraded as well.
This is not the place for Italian food.  It is a pretty generic Americanized Italian food chain joint but if you ever want Beignets, come here and order the zappolis... They call them Italian doughnuts but they are basically just beignets with chocolate dipping sauce and are great!  Other than that... I sat at the bar and the bartender was super sweet and nice, his name?? but the check said "khutso C."  Sooo, I think his name may have been Chris?? He was great, the staff at the bar were very friendly and cool but there were two guys at the door when I came in that had an attitude problem... I walked in and said I was going to the bar and they stood there looking at me like "whatever!"?? I mean... Come on, they didn't even have to seat me, thus do their job, so what was up with the shitty looks?  While I was waiting I tried the crispy asparagus app and it was good except it came with this heavy sauce.. I asked for balsamic instead and it was much better!! Also I have to say they had no problem with me using my small vaporizer at the bar and Chris and the other bartender even complimented me on it;) love a vape friendly bar!! All in all, for a chain the bar is great but if you want Italian food this isn't the place... It's like any other national chain, pretty Americanized!  Chris and the other cool bartender should be working somewhere high-end, they were the best part of the visit!;)
I've always appreciated how fun this place is. Great food and drinks, but dining here during the day is another experience. A little too laid-back for those of us who have a limited lunch hour. Why is it always the "other table" has the fun waiter that is attentive to service? Food was delicious (when it finally arrived), and as always, the fish tacos were great. Be careful of filling up on the fresh, warm bread and cinnamon butter while you wait for the main course.  Obviously this practically became our meal while we waited for our waiter to stroll over with our lunch.If you truly want to experience this place at its best, try the late afternoon, early evening when the sun dips and people are darting in and out of the various stores close by. Great place to meet with friends and sip mojitos.
The pizza wasn't very warm when it arrived (they didn't use the warming bag at time of delivery) and the order was wrong, but the pizza tasted good.
Parking is tough to get here so I don't get to go much. I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.Pro's:- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck- Good burgers- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcoholCon's:- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.- Really expensive hot dogs. - They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.I do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out.
I was really excited to eat at this place because it looked so nice from the outside and the yelp reviews were all great. I was incredibly disappointed in their sushi because even though the fish was real..not imitation..it tasted very old. I'm from the pacific northwest and we have amazing seafood...so I should have known desert seafood wouldn't have been very good.
A disappointing cacophony of in-your-face flavors.  Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.Here are some details:  Pasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.Sauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.The le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  The carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti/lasagna place.As a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.
Food was great! Loved the pepperoni rolls and the zamboni fries! Service was sub par. They hustled at first; however the server entirely forgot our pizza. When we inquired, she proceeded to blame it on the kitchen. She never apologized, nor did she offer a discount. She coerced us into paying our tab and did not offer to get us any additional food or beverage. Furthermore, she did not pass on to another server that we intended to stay and eat and drink-even though we explicitly stated that. We stayed for 45 minutes waiting to order more food and have our drinks refilled. Our plates were cleared and we were not offered additional food/drink. No one addressed us. LOverall: good food, bad service.
Ok so I've come here a couple times for breakfast the first time my order was wrong I figured a fluke, I go again and yet again my order is wrong. Sucks because it's close to my job and I like it but I doubt I'll come back to this location. Nothing worse than having your food wrong.
The photos posted of the rooms are definitely NOT indicative of the room I stayed in except for the one of the broken electrical socket.  The plug for the tub didn't fit properly hence I couldn't take a bath, the electrical socket was broken and didn't seem to even work enough to charge my cell phone or the portable charger, there was bird poop all over the window of my room, there was food sitting outside the rooms next to mine from room service for the ENTIRE time I was there, and the breakfast buffet was bad.  The lettuce in the salad bar was wilted, the scrambled eggs were runny, the "soup of the day" wasn't labeled. It may have well been mystery soup as it had a creamy base but with random spinach like veggies and tasted a bit over salted. For the over all price I payed for both the room(almost $200 for a MONDAY til TUESDAY, 1 day stay), I could have stayed at a better kept or newer casino.  The last time I stayed at the Flamingo was probably about 15yrs ago and it was better kept back then than it was now...Maybe they spent all the gambling revenues towards the birds and fishes in the courtyard as there were only flamingos there the last time I stayed there.
Honestly I expected a lot more from this restaurant due to rave reviews of the others in the area. I ordered a burrito with steak and the quinoa brown rice. It was obvious the steak wasn't super fresh; it was kind of cold. The burrito, although super large, didn't have too much flavor and the quinoa brown rice was pretty unappetizing. The dining area was pretty dirty too, tables had food all over them and hadn't been cleaned for a while. I would  give this another try and order something different but until then the 2 stars stands.
A store that specializes in cheese curds doesn't have any? Well, they had bags of jalapeno cheese curds ($5.99 and less), but regular cheese curds were non-existent. Apparently, I need to return on Thursday's when cheese curd production is higher and they fill all their Costco orders or some explanation similiar.    There is a giant cheese/milk production facility right behind your store and you can't make some more curds or make some more cheese that makes more curds available. This is basically a waste of a store. It seems to serve as a sort of a Circle K for the white coated and masked milk employees milling around at the corner of Hardy and Broadway. Ended up buying $2 worth of jalapeno curds, but they could do alot more with this place than serve grab and go crap like a convenience store.
I've had both good and bad experiences at this location.  It may be far fetched to expect at least DECENT customer service.  I know it is a fast food restaurant and the cashiers are likely making minimum wage, but come on!  At least be happy you have a job (for now) and stop treating people like crap.The only thing that keeps me coming back is that it is a 24 hour drive thru and really hits the spot if you've been drinking.  Although, if you hit it at the same time as the rest of the drunks, the line can be really long, and it seems like the food takes forever sometimes (although I will not complain, at least it is fresh).
There are better and worse Y's for sure.  This place is nothing compared to Dowd or Davidson, but it does the job.  I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.The front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.The locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.I've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.All in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do.
Plus: Chips and salsa were warm and plentiful, with a nice heat to the salsa. Jarritos soda was refreshing after an afternoon of drinking in the sun. Our waitress was also lovely and attentive. Hubby's salad was ok. Minus: BLAND, flavourless food. My rice seemed like they it had been sitting under a lamp, very dried out, and the beans were basically kindergarten paste. Not worth the money.
By far, the worst sushi place I have been to.  I would like to give them a one star and I don't think I'd like to give them another chance.  Friendly service but speed of sushi delivery is horrible.  This place seems to be busy and it's bring your own alcohol.  Students also get a discount.  If you truly love sushi, you will know this is not the place by pure observation and presentation.  The taste speaks for itself and the rice isn't sticky enough and falls apart.  If you check my other posts, you will know where my favorite sushi place in Montreal is.
Poor service, been waiting for my check for 30min! Still waiting after asking another server for it..... Yay, finally, someone else dropped it off, what happened to our server?! :( Left hungry and feel everything was overpriced... Sad because I never right bad reviews but this was not a good first experience...
The service was friendly and attentive! However, a San Diegan is familiar with Mexican food and this isn't. Margaritas shouldn't be made with sour mix, nachos aren't 4 large chips with toppings on each of them, and no one should need to salt their food when it comes to the table.With all the superb dining in Vegas it's disappointing when you dine out and have a subpar experience.
The most disgusting Chinese food ever! My hubby ordered some lunch specials since we like like 5 mins away.. it was terrible! Oily food and service was horrible! The lady had charged our card twice. We had to call her back twice to get our refund.. Never ordering again!
Robuchon was the first 3-star michelin my wife and I had been to (Daniel in NYC only recently attaining their third star).  However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.Our standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  The main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure.  The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  Overall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.
Went there yesterday with high expectations after the raving reviews but was disappointed ... Their website n online menu says they have trout fish but in real they only have cat fish !!! Food was mediocre below par ordered pad thai with tofu... V average taste n burnt fried tofu with no vegetables have to sent back .. Came back with raw not seasoned vegetables ... Hubby ordered basil fried rice with shrimp which has two shrimp n bland tasting ... Only good part was tall manager who was very nice and friendly but i guess their cook need some serious improvement !! And yes the calamari appetizer was totally tasteless like stale have to sent back ... Manager was nice and admitted all seafood is frozen .... Would not go back ..
I come here every so often with friends to get a quick sushi lunch fix, however that is all. I will never come here for dinner or for any other occasion. Service is terrible, although we write everything down in the menu they give us, we receive only half of what was asked. They'll mix up our orders with another table more than once. I was watching one of the waitresses as they had food in their hands, and they looked so lost as to where the food was supposed to be served. Honestly if you do plan to come here, just come for some quick sushi and that's it, otherwise don't waste your time.
As a vegan I am pretty good at finding great food on menus at non vegan restaurants.  I was super disappointed last night when ordering the vegetable fajitas to find out you use butter to grill your vegetables and you put milk in your tortillas.  The waitress, who was super at her job, was only able to offer me a salad.  She said there wasn't any vegetable based oil in the kitchen to grill my vegetables.  Super frustrated for myself but the rest of the party really loved their non vegan choices and they will definitely be back.  Me, not so much.
I was looking for a really good wings spot so I came here. Wedges were soft and tasted good however could not really eat them cause it was over seasoned and heavy in salt. Wings were ok not good for it to have "Wings" in the name of the establishment, but to each its own. sauce ok. Atmosphere was welcoming server was great. The attraction for this place is good to get a drink with friends if in the area or if you want to try a different random sauces with names like "Voodoo" then you will like. Glass wear wasn't very cleanEntrance not easily accessible due to construction.
Too much gringo, not enough gourmet. Pico is overly chunky and hasn't been allowed the time to sit. Salsa verde from a jar. Raw onion everywhere, mayo chipotle sauce in the burrito... It's good Mexican style food, but it's not Mexican food. On the same page as Mucho Burrito in my book.
My sister got married here tonight. I'll start by staying that the venue is gorgeous. There is not a lot of parking so just plan on that. I am giving this place a one star simply because the owner Betty was terrible. She was cold and unkind. At 8pm when the part still had one hour, she started going table to table dumping out drinks and cleaning up. It Made the guests uncomfortable and my sister (the bride) felt anxious and started cleaning up and asking others to do the same. I thought that was unprofessional. She was also drunk and smelled strongly of alcohol. Not that I care if you're drinking but perhaps that altered her mood.
This place gone down in last 5 years. Steaks are not up to par anymore, certainly not in this price range. Regular, okay steak. Expectations not met at all. Presentation is slaking.  Take your dollars somewhere else. There are plenty much better steak houses with much better in the same price range. The only good things that are still left: Bread basket and wine list. But these will not make me come back anymore. It's not that I did not like it, the place is just not good anymore.
I'm a return Audi customer and I've had Audi for 10 years.  So far I'm a little bummed because I waited in the lobby for 10 min and nobody would help me...
Quite a disappointment really.  Over priced non-specialty grocery store that only has you coming back simply because nothing else is close by.  Limited produce selection due to space, nothing is fresh, huge sweets section, not sure why. They do have prepared meals hot and ready to go but they are served in hot plastic and the plastic is placed on a heated table to keep the food warm and toxic, hot food and plastic is pure poison,  by now you know how I feel about plastic and hot food. Plastic is the root of all evil when it comes to healthy eating. Speaking of healthy, they have a Good-life located just above with a lot a traffic as a result, you would think Longos would make some effort to provide some healthy alternatives at this location. Get rid of the Starbucks or white sugar counter and put in a juice bar and replace the white sugar section with some products conducive  to the gym and healthy eating.
This place gets a 2 stars because while the food is delicious heir service is horrible. Every time I order from here it is always some kind of issue. The first time I tried to order their 4$ ginger salad with extra vegetables she informed it only comes with iceberg lettuce and shaved  carrots.... pause- FOUR DOLLARS? Never mind! I came to dine in today and we order our appetizers- I ordered sushi and Tom Kia soup with modifications to it. and everything came out of the kitchen out of order. My soup came before everyone it was not modified the way I asked for it. And when she sent it back to be corrected the main dishes came out not the appetizer so we said never mind and my soup never came out. I only recommend eating as take out and check your orders to make sure they are correct!
Had lunch here the other day and wasn't all that impressed.  FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.The high point was our great server. She was very friendly and really nice. So I think going here for chips and beer on the patio would be cool.
Had a 11 Person dinner there. Service was good, but Everything is over priced compared to quality. All the stakes and meet was over done (even when sent back to re do).
I thought this place would be super good & a new sushi spot to come to but I'm going to pass. Our server was great, very nice & attentive although we were the only customers for a whole hour. The ambience was a little "weird" arriving. No music just silence. I had shumai, nigiri, tempura,  fried noodles and oyster shooters. The food wasn't anything special I feel like it lacked taste. The side of fried noodles was just.... fried noodles, no veggies or meat in there. After having tempura I had to take benedryl on the ride home because I was having an allergic reaction to the shrimp which is caused by being undercooked. That was my first and last oyster shooter I'll just say that. I was really optimistic coming here but left with an allergic reaction. Sorry bonzai.
Not impressed.    Only giving 2 stars because the toro was amazing.  The waiters were a bit rude, they recommended California rolls, and they made us feel like we were peons and it was our birthday.  Not cool.    I don't recommend this place.
Food taste Ok. I like the pasta selection. However, there is No seafood choices at all. If you are looking for seafood, skip this place.
Well, I've been to lots of Ardene locations but this one is my least favorite. Still cheap, but not as cheap as locations further north and I found the store to be small and cramped. They still have some really neat stuff and the staff was friendly , but it's the first time I've walked out of an Ardene's empty handed. Sorry, this location just isn't for me.
Overrated.  Maybe I just don't get it. I do enjoy divey bars, such as the places on ossington, leslieville and junction.I do not think this is the best patio- not even close.The bar is small and divey. Basic stuff here only behind the bar. it's small so be prepared to be bumped into once in a while if you\re sitting in the front room. oh are you ordering Whiskey ginger? sorry No jamiesons. bartender told me "They don't take credit card or debit. And the ATM machine may or may not work at times." Thanks bartender. You are so cool and helpful. ps: Washrooms are gross.
Our server was very nice and attentive.  Margaritas were delicious.  But unfortunately the food, no bueno.
This is not the place to go if you want to have a good conversation - it was so noisy it was difficult to hear (the same can be said for all the restaurants in this group so it wasn't a surprise to us, but be forewarned). The tacos are varied and really delicious. My big gripe is the cocktails. I'm a huge tequila fan so I was excited to try some interesting twists. My first cocktail was supposed to be "spicy" and it barely had any heat. If you're adding jalapeno to a drink don't be timid. My second drink was, according to the server, not going to be too sweet but it was so syrupy I couldn't finish it. A big disappointment, and while we might go back for tacos we definitely won't linger over cocktails.
I understand that is billed as a "boutique hotel" so I expected some level of quaintness. What I wasn't prepared for was run down and dirty. First of all, it's very easy to miss this place, we drove by it twice as it's wedged in between two other businesses and there is not a single hotel person (i.e. valet) waiting outside. We ended up having to call the front desk and ask where we were supposed to park the car to unload our bags. She seemed confused by this request and after a few minutes she told us just to leave the car in the service entrance behind the hotel. Weird! What hotel doesn't have some sort of established valet system for their guests arriving in cars. Check in was fine and the staff was nice but I knew as I walked in this wasn't going to work out. The lobby was super small. It was cramped with four people waiting at the front desk. We were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite, so I was hopeful the room at least would be nice. The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. As soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy. The bed was lumpy, everything from the curtains to the dust ruffle were wrinkled and stained. The linoleum was cracked, the burner carpet looked like it had been there for roughly a hundred years. Needless to stay, we checked out immediately and headed to the W Hotel. I would highly recommend staying somewhere else unless this is your only option.
The pizza was great, but the guys that make it , while we were there they were scratching their heads, taking  their hats off to run fingers through their hair. And one guy that was cutting up something was eating. They need to wash their hands after scratching. Will not be back to this one
I thought Mezes was over-rated. The food is very similar to a bunch of Greek places which are much better value. I thought it was over priced and not all that great.
This place is really falling apart.They did put up a big mosquito net in the one bottle-service area though.And since the other cooks left they now have food again.It's just really dead and boring and the one DJ is shit but Paul is great.Note that I only talked about non-stripper things? Yeah, that's because the other things are the best part of this place..
This review is based solely on the food. Service was 5 stars, but we probably got such great service because we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. I ordered the special Cuban Torta, meat was a bit on the skimpy side and flavor was very lacking. No salt or pepper on tables so we had to ask for it. Portion to price ratio is way off, ordered rice with my Torta and after 3-4 spoon fulls rice was done. To sum up this place I'd say it's best for drinks and appetizers.
If Giordano's is looking to compete with Lou Malnati's, they are going to have to improve their dough recipe. The crust tasted like a flaky hard biscuit which is not pleasant on pizza. Lou Malnati's dough has a wonderful yeasty dough flavor while Giordano's doesn't taste like much at all, same as their garlic parmesan french fries. C'mon give us garlic, we can handle it!To someone who just shoves food in their face and doesn't overly think about it, Giordano's is fine, but if you consider yourself a pizza buff you will probably be let down after the fourth bite. Overall Giordano's is not horribly disgusting but it isn't impressive either. They could also stand to hire extra staff to be refilling drinks. If you're looking for a truly spectacular pizza, do yourself a favor and go to Grimaldi's.
Four of us went during the first few days this restaurant opened. we ordered the fries (delicious, with rosemary and salt) and each ordered a burger. I had the steakhouse which has a red wine sauce and was really very good it came as I ordered medium well. The other three people who were in our party all had a problem with the way the burgers were cooked. Everyone else's were too overcooked, my parner's burger was cooked to a crispy well done even though she had ordered it medium. Our waitress was happy to send my partner's burger back and have it made correctly. Our waitress also seemed very nervous and seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown.Overall I liked my own burger but was unimpressed that 3 our of 4 burgers that were ordered at our table were cooked incorrectly. I will likely not be going back to this restaurant. I felt it was also a little overpriced. For a great burger I will continue to go to Tessaros
Ever since Tsujiri opened up, feels like a lot of copy cats are opening their own, or had the idea to bring over a brand from Japan. To me, it's ok. As long as you do a good job I don't mind buying from a copy cat. Saryo is a 2 in 1 shop with ramen (Konjiki) and the Saryo café. This review is for Saryo.I'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. Also, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. Customer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo. I might try their houjicha as that seems to get a lot of praise.
I went to Museum Tavern last night for summerlicious and was really disappointed.Service: 2/5When we arrived we asked if there was space on the patio and we were told that there was not, and everyone on the patio just arrived so he wasn't anticipating that there would be space any time soon.  So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.  When we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.  But throughout the night, we saw many people ordering burgers (that were not on the summerlicious menu), so I'm not sure why everyone other than us could order off the regular menu...?Food: 2/5I had the buttermilk fried chicken as an appetizer and it was good.  My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b/f had to cut it for me!) I decided it wasn't worth the effort - and thereby made history, as it was the first time I've EVER declined a dessert!Other:The restaurant was nice inside but not nice enough for me to return.
Service is good, but the food is just disappointing. Didn't live up to the expectation at such a high price ($45/person with tip and tax). Won't consider coming back again.
Rich is such a cool guy he could sell just about anything to anyone at a high price. He is also smart, so I think that is just what he might be doing. If you dont care about getting screwes on price, I think there may be a good chance you could be happy here. But if you are on a budget (arent we all in one way or another) then you may not appreciate their "you have to come in before I tell you what it costs" game and even when you come in they still dont tell you what it would cost, only that their guys charge hourly and almost as much as lawyers. That was not was I was personally looking for. Finally he tried to sell me a DIY polishing machine that he supposedly invented himself because he is a chemist, and instead of telling the specs he gave me some sales pitch how it "circulates instead of rotates". That was probably a salesmans way of describing what ordinary people would call an orbital polisher - that is not unique but he tried to present it as such which I percieved as dishonest. Sorry. So instead I went and waxed the car myself with high quality Meguilar stuff I got from Walmart at around $30 and now it is nicer than new!
So I put off writing this review for a couple months because I was kind of pissed. I want to be fair. We will start with the good stuff.We stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....And that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.I hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.
First off, this review is for the intercontinental suites which is a very different hotel than the intercontinental reviewed elsewhere on Yelp.  The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  On the overpriced side, they're well over $100/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 / day, plus wireless for $10 / day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.I ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  The exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.If you're looking for a nice hotel in the area, I hear the other intercontinental is much better including an enormous workout facility.  If you find this place on the cheap and just need a place to crash, it's great for that.
Went for the 1st.time to CPK on the advice of a friend, there were 8 in our party. We were seated at a table that was made for 6, kinda cramped for space,we endured because they said the wait for a bigger table would be 20 min. Although there were 2 areas  bigger than where we sat that were empty.           Now when your waitress finally shows for drinks (about 5 min) and the first words out of her mouth are.  "They must think I'm  wonder woman, I already have a table of 7 and a table of 12". Translated= hey guys, your service is gonna suck but that's not my fault. And it did!!!!          My wife and I split the pepperoni, sasuage and mushroom pizza, obviously  'shrooms are the cheapest ingredient cause that's about all we could find. Pizza was bland, 'shrooms  overpowering and service sacked. If that's what your looking for in a dining experience, then this is the restaurant and location for you. If not  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was a very interesting place. Prices wise I rather go to Popeyes or Canes. What got me was the hair in my over priced chicken tenders. The fries were eh and the roll wasn't really rolling with me. Save sometime and just go to Chick-fil-a or McDonalds.
Horrible customer service. I have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but I was wrong to hope for that. I once called and they answered "Hold on" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered "Hold on" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says "Well what do you want to know specials on?" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use "fresh ingredients" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service. If you want WAYYYY better NY pizza go to rockos pizza. Way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better EVERYTHING.
So,if you are thinking of eating here but haven't gone to any one of the other acclaimed steakhouses in Las Vegas, I'd highly recommend you go elsewhere.  This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.First thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  Secondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.Well, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  We ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.Next up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  My steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  And then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.
i've had better. it is really nothing special, but you could not tell that from how crowded the place got after i sat down in my booth. the burgers were on the thin side, but the fries were really good. i ended up eating all of my fries and my friend's when he wasn't looking. i ordered a milkshake, but it really was not a milkshake at all. it was a soft serve ice cream with hershey syrup frozen drink disguised as a milkshake. how can you do that and call it a milkshake, i will never fully understand?so either i was really hungry after spending the day at hoover dam or it was actually a decent meal. i think i was just hungry. the jury is still out on that one.
Slim pickings at this buffet.  Half filled containers of cold food.  The food was a little better when they finally refilled.  The shrimp and hot and sour soup were good.  The deep fried stuff was mostly bread with a little piece of meat.  The salad was basic, lettuce only and maybe a carrot or two.  Wasn't really worth the $6.99.  Rather pay a bit more for something edible.  We won't be back.
It's ok. Customer service lacking. Not the "fun" experience its made out to be. It's a $5 ice cream sandwich. Definitely not worth the trip.
This a very SMALL museum and at $8 A head which includes anyone over 2 years old, My wife and did not think it was very good value for the money spent.With my wife daughter and granddaughter plus tax it was almost $35 for the four of us and it took maybe 30 minutes to go through. At the end I said "Is that all????" expecting more but it ended quickly even going out doors and walking the nature trail down to "Fort Wild" an outdoor play area. Now I wasn't expecting The Museum Of Natural History in Raleigh, and we did enjoy some of the exhibits, but at  $8 a head plus tax we were expecting way more than what we got.After our granddaughter finished playing outside, we went back through again to feel like we at least gotten a little more for our money. If your trying to find an activity with the kids to beat the heat this summer, this place won't give you a very big bang for your buck. Also with it as small as it is, we had several summer camps coming through with small children and it was getting way to loud in there, so thank goodness we were leaving.As most reviewers have said, save your money and go next door to Freedom Park, Its free!Two visits in one for us, first and last!
Food is good but they dont let you mix match like bdubs ... So for that u get two stars bruh
Update: wasn't surprised to see CLE ranked dead last among medium sized airports in North America! I got a glimpse of the outside renovations/entrance and it looks good. Now just fix the shitty airport operations....------------------------------------------Hopefully the airport completes its rehab quickly... The check in area is in disarray... People walking all over the place with no clear indication/signs for where each airline ticketing location is... I agree construction can be a disruption but clear signage and airport staff guiding passengers will be helpful. Just a note: I have been flying out of CLE on a weekly basis for the past 2 months...To add to the chaos, TSA at CLE is the worst (not that they are good anywhere but you can't get through security in less than 30 mins). One Sunday evening the security line was all the way to the other end of the airport, and guess what there were 3 TSA Pre agents and no one for the regular line??? What were they thinking...Once you clear security check, the boarding area is clean and organized. Airline and restaurant staff are helpful and there are multiple flights leaving to all major hubs. There is a Starbucks right after clearing security and the line moves quick. They are open early am (5:30am) so you can get your fix. When landing, I recommend using the departures/ticketing level to exit as the arrivals level can get crowded pretty quick.
I wish I could give a better rating. It really isn't a bad place. It's chill and hipster. But what I had there tasted awful.I ordered iced tea but what they gave me was not lemony nor did it have any citrus flavour typical for iced tea. It wasn't even sweetened!! Furthermore the color was blood red! What are they playing at? Sorry, this iced tea detered me from wanting to go back. Maybe the coffee drinks are good, but definitely not this damned "iced tea".
So I was in the mood for Asian food and after countless research on yelp and Google, this place looked like it would deliver. Boy how wrong I was. The service was terrible. The server tried to get my friend to order two separate entrees when she just wanted a side of rice to go with her general tsos chicken. After we got our meals he disappeared and didn't return until about 15 minutes after we were done eating. My friend ordered the general tso chicken. It was bland and more breading than chicken. I ordered the chicken and mushroom noodles. The hand pulled noodles were slightly undercooked but still really good. The chicken was horrible and didn't even seem as if it was chicken. The texture was more of the organs than the meat. Needless to say it was very questionable. The experience all together was crappy but our server put the cherry on top when he took the bill and never returned with the change. Normally I tip 20% or above but he seemed ok with his 10%. I won't be going back there, I would have been more satisfied with panda express.
The quality of the meat amd the banchan varieties were good. Ive been meaning to go to this spot for a while and finally got to try it out. The wait is horrendous of course but expected, 30 min turned to 1 hour and 10 min. So dont come here hungry. LolThe prices and quantity is expected as well very small, its not an all you can eat joint and dont expect alot of meat. We had to order another plate pf meat and cold noodles on top of our combo. We told our server maybe we shpuld have ordered the 3 to 4 people portion, he said no its too much food. The portions are really small, the pictures are deceiving. Our server was in a rush on everything, our food, the cooking and when we said we want to order more meat he kinda got dissappointed. Lol. We had to ask for cups for our water, more water, rice, napkins pretty much all the basics. Top it off with a piece of hair on our salad which we pointed out and he just said oh I get you a new one. No sorry, oh my gosh, nothing. Well I tried it and everyone seems to give this place a 4 and 5 star which Im sure at times deserves it. Its just not this time.
I usually give companys a break but i truly think this company needs great improvement,  the service as far as how long it took to get a burger was very poor it took 25 to 35 minutes  after the initial 15 minutes it took just to get our server to the table to receive our food the food was ok but not really very good, my friends said they had Mexican food and it was definitely better it hot on the patio no misters .
Been dining with Muramoto for a number of years and generally been pleased with the sushi. However, today my wife and I waited at lunch 40 minutes for 3 rolls and a chicken teriyaki. This has happened several times in the past and seems to only happen when ordering one of the less expensive lunch specials. I finally asked our waiter to check on our order after 35 minutes. When the sushi finally arrived about 1/2 the rolls we falling apart. All 3 rolls were warm. The tuna roll was about the size of my little finger and tasted as though the fish was off. The cucumber roll was simply chopped cucumber in rice (no flavor or seasoning at all). My wife's lunch arrived about 5 minutes later and it was fine though probably should have been served a bit closer to the sushi.This has happened several times in the recent past. I think this is strike 3. Don't see myself going back again.
Beware the sushi...Not only is the rice extremely dry, but something about the fish is off (for the salmon, tuna, and eel). Honestly, the premade sushi you can buy from your local supermarket is better than this and definitely fresh.
This is the second time I've been here with my mom. We ordered the cold noodles, kimchi soup. The cold Noodles were still raw, you could even bite through them. The kimchi soup is suppose to have pork in it, and it had no meat. But it was still okay. The service was another thing that got me. The waitress, she wasn't friendly at all. She came up to our table after we were sitting here for 10 minutes, she didn't even say a word to us, just looked at my mom and myself as if we were just ready to order. Do they normally not greet people here ? Even if there was a language barrier, my mom speaks fluent Korean. She could at least tried to greet us. My water wasn't even refilled. I've been a server at numerous places , this isn't how businesses are handled. It was $40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it didn't even taste good. Ugh!2 stars because we still ate the food,but taking home a lot of it. I don't think I want to come back here though.
I was staying across the street at the Wynn and my post-Disneyland Half Marathon legs weren't really up for a lot of walking, so I suggested we check out TI for dinner. I think the buffet at Treasure Island used to be called Dishes or something and I remembered it being pretty good. Unfortunately, "The Buffet" as it's now known has declined quite a bit in quality.First, all of the meats are pre-sliced which is crazy. The slices of prime rib were totally dried out and starting to turn grey. The turkey fared a little better, but gravy rescues pretty much everything although either the turkey or gravy was very salty. Speaking of salty, I was curious to try the pho which was, you guessed it, super salty. There is no salad bar here and instead you can get various salads made that looked really good - too bad no one was manning the counter. And finally, the most ridiculous thing of all was the pre-scooped ice cream in dishes which had melted into a soup. On the plus side, the crab legs weren't bad and I enjoyed the mini donuts and chocolate covered strawberries.I hope this buffet gets their act together soon. Sightly unrelated, but this was my first time at TI in a long time and I couldn't stand the smell of the casino! They pump some weird coconut sunblock smell all over the place which is way worse than stale cigarette air. Yuck
Slow service. Neglected our table repeatedly. Food came out cold and drinks were delayed by 20-30 minutes.
Since moving to the area we've been here a number of times. The place impressed me at first, however lately it seen the food has become a bit normal and giving you the wow factor. Sushi is decent not great, and the hot food is ok. I'd pass this one by until they updated the inside and maybe add or change the menu a bit.
First time ordering from here, but was VERY disappointed. Delivery took almost an hour,  but I can forgive that on a Friday night. Food was generally terrible,  but maybe I just ordered poorly. Summary of my order:Tofu Pad Thai - bland and awful even with medium spicinessCrab Rangoon (cheese wontons) - not terrible, very cream cheesy. I prefer China One for theirs. Egg rolls - strange filling  (I wasn't a fan)Pot Stickers - Fair, but dry by the time they were delivered to me.
Way over price for the entree. Too much msg ! Got so thirsty afterwards. Sad that we don't have a decent pho places in the north Scottsdale area.
Oh my gosh!  Italian tuna sandwich?  Honesty, it had about three table spoons of tuna with TWO HUGE pieces of focaccia bread and a hint of vinegar!  THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions.
Great service and atmosphere. The food and drinks are way overpriced though. If you like your Mexican food mild to bland, this is the place for you.
Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as "kind of like Coors Light".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  The food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though.
Subpar food, eggs Benedict was nasty and thick. Consistency was like mayo. Service was so slow, everyone looks like they hate their life. It took forever to get attention for refills on drinks.
The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   Food quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  Overall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food.
The craft beers are very good, but that's about it. The BBQ had been sitting under a warmer far too long, and I wasn't really clear on the seafood/BBQ connection. Might be a nice place to hang out on a Friday or Saturday night drinking with friends, but the energy is lacking, the food is overpriced and not all that, and the menu doesn't make much sense. AVOID ANY OF THE FRIED ITEMS on the menu since it's pretty obvious they never change their cooking oil and everything tastes the same-- terrible-- and is WAY over-cooked. Their fries, cajun or otherwise, are like eating a mouthful of table salt. Awful! Stick with the bags and corn and you'll be OK. There's really nothing special about the place that would recommend it over other similarly-themed sports bars in the area, and the manager could use a visit from Jake Tapper at Bar Rescue. No effort is made to make the outside patio tolerable during the summer so nobody eats there. What a waste. The restaurant itself is located way in the back corner of a strip mall where the confined location guarantees it will be like an oven.
Can be better if they put bit more attention to finishing foods and customer needs...masala tea is ofcource nor good
Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed.
Went there last Friday before going to see a movie at the Queensway cineplex, the food there is good. I ordered the small chicken burrito and it was more than I can eat. Thought the food was good, the service was, lacking, to say the least. The staff there were doing everything but providing good service. I was the only person there and it still took 15 mins to make my order. I didn't even mind the long wait time, but the unfriendliness from staff there was awkward and not welcoming at any means. Though like the food, I WON"T be returning due to poor service. I will however, try a different location in the future.
Island must be a Malaysian word for bland. We had the mango shrimp which tasted like water boiled bland shrimp with a green mango shredded and drowned in sweet and sour sauce. Chicken fried rice was bland and the mango sticky rice tasted like house brand rice flooded in sugar water with a half ripe mango. If you like food, this isnt the place to go. Maybe just a bad day for them, but no excuses
sadly I have to write a bad review, I got food poisoning from here, I called to speak to the manager just to inform, but when I asked for the manager one of the employees told me to call back later, so I did, then I kept trying to call back and I never got an answer. Other than that when I ordered the food, the front service was very polite and nice.
I've eaten at Akahana 8-10 times. I love sushi and can't resist a bogo offer. But I've never been completely satisfied with the food. We've had the salt and pepper calamari on multiple occasions - sometimes delicious, sometimes over cooked and inedible. Food inconsistency is such a bummer. Most recently I called in an order for sushi take out. When picking up my order, I asked the attendant (whom I later found out was the manager) for some low sodium soy sauce. He seemed annoyed that I asked, grabbed a small, unmarked clear plastic container and handed it to me. Upon arriving home to enjoy my meal, I noticed an odd fishy smell about my food. Noooo! After a couple of bites of sushi I had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund. I did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. I suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. I'm sad to say it because I love supporting Plaza Midwood businesses, but I will be taking a break from this spot for a while. I hope things improve.
I don't like gristle in my hamburger so that did it for me. I doubt I will ever return. I don't mind paying $10+ for a burger if it is good quality. Also, way too much gunk on my burger. I like to be able to taste the meat. We shared onion rings. They were wet with grease but they didn't taste greasy nor did they give me stomach issues later. I'm more a fan of batter dipped rings than breaded but I liked these.
The Better Half (TBH) and I were antique shopping next door and she decided to stay much longer than I expected, so I walked over here to watch some basketball in the Sports Book.  This place is a dump!  It's old and very smokey.  The last time I was in this casino, was in the late 1990's and it still looks the same.I watched basketball games for around 2 hrs while TBH shopped and when I walked back to see her, she said I reeked of smoke....yuck.Return Factor - 5%
I remember very well now, why I always avoided this particular joint.  For a place that seem to operate within the Fashion district-  and I assume they make big $$. I strongly suggest to the owners to invest 20$ in the hygiene and look of the place. Feels like you're eating in a 3rd world country cheap noisy cafeteria.Yes they might have good coffee but if you decide to eat there....they  will trick you into taking a plate and will slide in side orders. They will not be shy to charge extra ....so be careful. Portions are small but taste is ok. If you want something,  you'll have to chase for the waiters -  they will never make the effort to ask if you need anything else.Other than that- its good place to keep up with the industry gossips or the annoying sounds of the sport tv's.
For the money I expected more. Food was ok, nothing to ooooh and awww over. Service wasn't great, more like a diner and not what I would expect in fine dining. Ali gratin potatoes were undercooked and my steak was also underdone, but my husband's was over done. The decor was very nice in the front rooms but we were seated in the back overflow room with none of the nice features. Overall it was just ok and I wouldn't go back.
More like 2.5 stars. I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.I really wanted to like Strada 241. It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja). The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest.
Well, I'm not quite sure how they were lucky enough to get a 4 out of 5 on Yelp. My trip there last night was less then stellar. We were out for my sisters birthday (a table of 12 of us all drinking). The place was dead inside . By 10pm they closed the kitchen. By 11pm they did last call, yes last call at 11pm on a Saturday . Yes there drinks are nice but who does an 11pm last call on a Saturday night ?!
I really hate giving bad reviews for small businesses but I wish I went to Harvey's :(  the people Are very friendly but they forgot my coleslaw and my gravy. When I got  to work to eat it they gave me malt vinegar for my halibut! No lemon wedges either. The fries are the only thing I can eat and they are nothing to brag about. The halibut is very greasy too
I would give this place one star for customer service but I'm giving it 2 stars only because my nails turned out nice...  my original nail shop is in green valley & ever since I moved I was being lazy to drive all the way there so I decided to check this place out.. I just wanted to change my nail color (shellac) so I called and asked how much would it be and the guy said $20 so once I got there I picked out a color and told her I wanted silver glitter on the top. She picked out the glitter that was more pricey and didn't even tell me it would be another $5 charge.. I knew it was gonna be extra $5 because I get my nails done all the time & usually get that kind of glitter so I didn't mind but I feel like they should tell a customer ahead of time if there will be more additional charges.. and so when it came to paying she charged me $30 to just change the color without a manicure.. I asked her I thought it was $25 for shellac nail color change & the glitter and she made up some excuse which I couldn't even understand. So I will not be coming to this salon again because they just make up there own prices depending on the customer... Other than the lady being kinda rude and not talkative, the guys that work there are more talkative and friendly so if you go there make sure you go to the guys instead of that lady..
The flavor was off, hard to describe but it tasted weird. I had the thai tea and my friend had a milk tea, both tasted weird and we've been to dozens of boba shops. The boba was old and very hard, when I asked about it the staff said that's the way it is and he implied I really didn't know what I was talking about. In addition, staff was abrasive and frankly kinda rude.
I've been to the salon 3 times now - after the last, I dont think I will go back, even with the price in mind.The owner is very nice, and was cleaning and constantly busy. But the lack of hygiene is what really turned me off this time, and the other times I have been. Even though there is a pan by the sink with rubbing alcohol for the tools, I never see them disenfect the tools between customers. I watched in horror as they took a file just used on a woman having a pedi and bring it over to me and use it on me. They dont even wipe off the tables in between customers. I wish they took more care to show that they disenfect the stations properly. I know this is the 'no frills' of nail salons, but cleanliness is still an expectation, even with a basic service.
Have to wait about 10 minutes. Mediocre drive-thru service. Something either out of service or they ran out of.
Didn't have a good experience with this restaurant.. The service was slow, the tables are too close to each other, and most importantly the food was horrible. My steak was undercooked and the waitress took it back TWICE until it got the way I ordered it which was well-done!! We waited more than 30 mins to get a table and after that another hour and a half to get our food!! Never going back againThe only good side was that the fact that they removed my order from the total bill..
No wifi. Very small, low ceilings. Equipment is very close together.
My favorite thing to eat is onion rings and mine were way over cooked and dried out. They were nasty. The burger was good but it is pretty hard to mess up onion rings so I was very disappointed. Not sure if I'll go back. Deep fried foods are one of the easiest things to make and a lot of the food on the menu there is deep fried.
Food is suspect but service is very good. Haven't been there for a while but went a couple times in the last month. The nigiri had a bad odor and the chef did not do a good job trimming the fish. Screaming O and jalapeño yellowtail sashimi were also cut poorly.  To top it all off the rice had a rock in it which resulted in a visit to the dentist to fix a filling!  I would choose many of the other local sushi restaurants long before this place.
If you're able to get fiber internet, it's worth it. Fast and had minimal downtime in the 2 years I've had it. I work full time from home and I only had a handful of issues over 2 years.So why the 2 stars?If you have to deal with customer service or god forbid the billing department, prepare to spend most of your day if not a couple of days on hold and repeating the same issue over and over again until you finally reach one intelligent person that helps you. Their downfall is their customer service. It's probably the worst I've dealt with and I've dealt with Cox and Comcast. The bonus to having fiber internet is that you get L2 local phone support. As a software engineer I understand networking and computers, their L2 fiber support is great because they are knowledgeable people, not some tech moron reading a script. Also, never settle for their advertised prices. Don't get a contract either. I was paying $80/mo for the fiber internet only and not on a contract. tl;drFast and stable fiber internet if you can deal with complete incompetence when you need "customer service"
Mediocre as far as Indian food goes. It's relatively more authentic than fast food chains, substantially more expensive, and definitely doesn't hit the spot. Very disappointing.
really? TWO AND HALF inches room from the top of my grande frap. i asked why it's not filled to the top, it's for the whip!? that's what the rounded cap is for. hogwash!  as for lattes, poorly made as well. taste more like a cup of steamed milk, barely espresso.  baristas should be better trained in making drinks here.
Place and food was great... but we came in as a group but per our server they can not so separate check... and we have to calculate our bill and plus tax... ahmm ok.. we end up using venmo... in one check... so for those who plans to go in a group... not a good idea... FYI...
Very hot inside!!! They charge more than all the other boba places I have been to... They're okay though, no real complaints. They take their time when making them though.... A very very very long time...
Le service est excellent ma note ne viens pas de là mais plutôt de la propreté générale des lieux et des plats peu ragoûtants. Ça fesait des années que je n'avais pas mis les pieds dans un buffet et après cette expérience je ne suis pas prête d'y retourner c'est à n'y rien comprendre que l'endroit soit toujours bondé le soir
I originally came in here in January for a dislocated big toe that happened over the weekend and have been here a total of 6 times at $35 co-pay each time. Every time you show up for your appointment, expect to wait 15 plus minutes in the lobby and another 5-10 minutes to see the Doctor once you get a room. My last 3 appointments I see the Dr probably a total of 5 minutes each time. I'm satisfied with the initial care in resetting my toe, but these last few appointments have been a waste of money and time.After my sixth visit, the Dr also recommended a customized orthotic to fix the way I walk, I honestly didnt think I have a problem walking, but the custom orthotic cost $550 that was not covered by my insurance. Needless to say, I passed. P.S. My brother also went there for a fractured ankle, after his surgery procedure and after many follow up visits, the doctor also recommended orthotics to him as well.
Okay, we all know this restaurant is a love child of the most celebrated chef in America, Thomas Keller.  It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's "bistro" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:Service: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.Food:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.Wine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.I've been here for breakfast/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  But for dinner?  A disappointment.  This restaurant needs an overhaul.
Met a friend for lunch today as he wanted to try this place. We sat inside the restaurant as opposed to the food court. The server was very attentive and got our meals out quickly. The bean soup was okay, nothing special with very few beans. The laffa bread left on the table was very tasty.Interestingly and strange is that we were told that they didn't have any chef salads with only vegetables but had these salads were available if meat were added to them!  Odd.. Ordered the  tabouli salad which was fresh and tasty. Odd that coffee refills aren't free. Lots of mishegas!My experience over the years with kosher restaurants has lead me to avoid them. This one wasn't as bad as most but not good enough to bring me back.
My friend and I were excited to check out the burger that's rated #1 in Charlotte and couldn't wait to take our first bite of this juicy delight.  Well I hate to admit it but, I was very disappointed once the order hit the table.  We both looked at each other and asked the same question...is that it?We ordered the Cowboy burger and if I had to describe it in one word, I'd have to say it was BLAH!  No flavor at all, dry bun, tiny flat burger that looks like I cooked it at home and barbecue sauce was on the side in a little cup.  The only thing that saved this meal were the French fries and the free refill of beverage to wash the burger down.As far as I'm concerned, I won't be going back to that establishment for a $13 burger, fries and a drink.
Not sure why all of the 5 Star ratings. Food was just average at best and with price considered it's less then average. Fries were meeh, sandwiches the same and service slow. The only saving grace was the pleasant young man who took the order was both knowledgable and courteous. Too much money and slow delivery, not a good combination.Removed from my bookmarks, won't be going back.
I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.Today saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........I've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.
the store looked awesome.....the kid behind the counter was super annoying !!!!!!!!He must have been like 19 or 20.....trying to test me on gas mileage and math....im a 32 year old grow woman who just got off work, all i wanted was a few bucks in gas and be on my way....NOT be on 'are you smarter then a gas attended' game show....really turned me off....
Very fun atmosphere they do have the best fried chicken with wasabi mayo. I had their ramen noodles. Lacking in flavor and their pork belly could have been better. Best ramen so far is Ippodu in NYC.
I tried Pita Pit for the first time a couple years ago when I received a free gift card from work. I was flustered from beginning to end--- I handed the cashier my gift card as payment, and he just thought it was some sort of promo card. He then asked for my debit card, which I passed over. When I questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. Then, I ordered the Gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. Well, I was confused by the fact that I was asked what I wanted on my Gyro (um, the usual Gyro ingredients?!) and that Hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the Gyro).Maybe I've never gotten over this initial experience, but I have yet to truly enjoy Pita Pit. I think the Pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. Though initially tasty, I always feel very ill after eating here... I only plan on returning when I get dragged here yet again by a co-worker trying to avoid the other two chain options on this block of East Carson.
I am not sure what all of the hype is about. Based on Man vs. Food recommendation we had the Torta Del Ray sandwich and it was VERY disappointing.  The meat was dry, sausage was not browned and it was totally tasteless. I think the cook neglected to season the meats. My buddy ended up dumping salsa on his sandwich and I put hot sauce- anything to get flavor. Don't waste your time on this one. MAJOR disappointment.On a positive note, the service was excellent.
Take your dog somewhere else. This park is fantastic, but bringing my dogs here has become a hazard. People do not pay attention to their pets and let them run free. My dog has been hurt twice now. A smaller park is much safer. Do not recommend.
You know, for the price, this isn't a dump.  If you're looking for something cheap and acceptable, this is it.  However, what I really didn't like was the deception.  That's why I'm dinging them down to two stars.I booked this through expedia, and the Website clearly stated that there were no resort fees, just $45 total for two weeknights.  Okay, no resort fees.  So on check-in, I asked what the final rate would be."We can't tell you, because you booked this through expedia," she said.  "They don't give us any numbers."Okay, all right.Then upon checkout, they charge a $20.22 resort fee for two nights.  WTF?!  That brought the total for two nights up to $65.  Okay, so that's still a good rate.  But why deceive us?This is an old hotel, and it shows.  It didn't disgust me.  The room was clean.  There were some small problems.  I had a problem with the shower when it suddenly went cold on me.  And for some reason, they don't put blankets on the beds, only sheets, and it took me a couple hours to figure out how to turn down the A/C.  Small things.But hey, they had free wifi and all the cable I could consume.  I felt safe in the parking lot because they have some pretty strict guards making sure that everybody who comes into the lot has a room key.  So I used the El Cortez as home base to do business away from downtown.When I did stay downtown, it was fine.  At 2 am, I saw a couple hookers, and even one walking into the hotel, but during the day, it was nice to take a stroll down the Fremont Experience, which is just a block away.
The only reason I gave this two stars and not one, is that they have a half-decent selection of modern lighting.  But if you need to special order something, go elsewhere.Try Living Lighting or Royal Lighting.
Had such high expectations from all the recommendations I got to try this place. I must say that I didn't see what the hype was all about after my visit. We ordered the traditional breakfast and build your own omelet. For starters, the toast was burnt and the eggs weren't cook as ordered. The hash browns, eggs, and omelet needed some serious seasoning. I ordered bacon and ham in my omelet, but if they were there they were masters of disguise. The person that brought our food was helpful, but nothing to rave about. She got us non-burnt toast, scrambled eggs, and jelly. Nevertheless, we won't be returning anytime soon. For the price paid I expected more, could've got better tasting food somewhere else.
It seems this Lenscrafters has two account, so I don't mind post on both. Their policy(30 days adjustment guarantee) is great and the specialists are professional and nice. However, the managers(a man and a woman) are terrible. I deeply felt I was treated unfair and discriminated either because of my race, or because the purpose of my visit was to fix the glasses's problems.Instead of fixing the problem of the eye glasses they provided, the male manager would prefer to spend time on getting new customers. I went to Lenscrafters to fix a problem of my new glasses and unfortunately it was a busy day for them. He said to me that he would recommend me to come another day because they were busy. Before and after he said this to me, he didn't say the same words to all other customers who needed to get a new glasses or to pick up a glasses. He quickly assigned them (many people came after me) to specialists' tables and let me wait at the shopping area for 30 minutes. Was that because I was Asian, or because he didn't taking my request(fixing the problem of the glasses) seriously? Both.What the female manager only cared about was getting you out of there as quick as she can and getting more customers. The third time I went there to pick up an adjusted glasses, the female manager assigned me to a specialist's table. I had been waiting for 20mins at the table, which I thought it was totally ok because they were busy. However, when a specialist finally came to me and started to help me to adjust my glasses, the female manager came to talk to the specialist right away and said "after you get this done, I want you to go to another table." She pointed at the table where two white female customers JUST CAME 1 minute ago. That specialist hadn't even started helping me yet and I could sense that he felt awkward, too. He was nice and tried his best to adjust my glasses. During this time, the female manager came twice to our table to rush him go to another table to serve the white ladies. I ignored her and kept talking with the specialist about my glasses. I needed to get my glasses adjusted right since that was the second time to fix this problem. The female manager kept standing 1 meter away from our table and starring at us the whole time. I guess to this female manager, white customers were more important, their time was more valuable and they should not be waiting for a "long" time. Therefore she believed that she could rudely and frequently interrupt the service I was receiving and ask the specialist who was helping me to quickly get my part done and to run to help the white customers. If this wasn't her logic, I didn't know what her logic was.I wouldn't go to Lenscrafters again. Terrible experience.
Food is good, coffee is good, location is relatively easy to get to and park at...so why the 2 stars?The service sucks a lot.  Started going to Coca a few years ago and the service staff used to be super nice.  I always expect a long wait, but they always made you feel welcome, so I didn't mind.  However, the past 3-4 times I've been there, the service has gone WAY downhill.  From the greeting to the service at the tables...wow.2nd to last time I went I was told "1 hour" for 3 people.  Stood around outside for a bit...got cold and went inside to buy a to-go coffee (which I've always been able to do before).  Was told by one of the servers that it was "discouraged" to get coffee before we sat down, so we can go get coffee down the street...in a condescending "why are you bothering me" tone.Um...you discourage people to buy coffee from you?Last time I went, another 1 hr wait for 2 people.  Came back 30mins later, and wanted to see how far we were on the list.  The server snatched up the list, and said "An hour from whenever I first told you" and walked away.Nice.So we went to Square Cafe instead in Regent Square...just as busy, just as many people...but far nicer and actually apologized for the 20min wait time.
I've totally given up on this place.  The staggeringly bad choices for Asian food around Moon / Sewickley are just all around.  Since I live nearby, I hit this place as a default setting.  Kung Pao Chicken ($11) and Shrimp Toast ($7.95).  It adds up in a hurry and by the end of the meal, you wonder, "Where did it all go?"  Or if you are feeling a little on the existential side, "Is that all there is?"For the price, the Kung Pao Chicken tastes cheap and rubbery.  On the good side, you get plenty of this cheap and rubbery chicken.  Flavor is just meh.  A bit on the bland side sometimes.The Shrimp Toast is OK.  Most times I have ordered this, it comes burnt.Since it's mostly pizza places that deliver to our house, Hunan is the only non-pizza option that delivers.  If I order Kung Pao and Shrimp Toast, I easily get to the $15 minimum delivery threshold.  But, in the end, I should have just driven myself to Leetsdale or Robinson for something better.On the upside, if you do end up eating inside the restaurant, very nice people work there.  But, the food coming out of that kitchen is just bland, bland, bland.
This was my second visit over the past year.  I confess to enjoying it more the first time although I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered.  I came for lunch again, but this time ordered a steak sandwich.  It was dull.  I guess I had it in my mind it would be something like a cheesesteak sandwich, but it was basically a thin slice of steak under-seasoned open faced on bread.  Meh.  Not sure this is worth a repeat visit.
After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price.
I should have learned my lesson last time I was here for brunch when I had a bad experience with both the service and food...however, I thought it was just an off day, so when they advertised for their Doubleback wine dinner I just couldn't resist.  Service was non-existent, the food was not good and the entire event seemed like it had been thrown together at the last minute - very disorganized.  Such a shame the way this place has gone downhill.
I was hungry for a sandwich and it was a lunch rush so I understand that you won't get the highest customer service and they try to crank people through. I got the club which was okay the bread was dry, but I can only give them two stars because when I got to the veggie section of the ordering process the sandwich wizard started just throwing things on it, luckily I noticed it was mine and I had to speak up and he grabbed the things off the sandwich which I didn't want.... always love when they just grab them off. Then the real reason I cannot give them a positive review was the manager told the man in front of me he could not get a cup for water..... and told him he would have to buy a water bottle..... come on now.... how cheap are we getting that someone can't get a glass of water with their average sandwich.
I stay at Caesar's a lot and never went here before, so I tried it out. Big portions. Hella expensive. Mediocre food. Alright service. Not coming back here again, so many other places to go then here. Plus my waiter was kinda judgmental. Must've thought there was no way someone so young could afford all that I ordered. Was happy to prove him wrong. Two stars for the fake nice treatment
Very mediocre. There's barely any service. The grill just go burnt and nobody offers to change them. The meat doesn't seem super fresh but they are OK. There's nothing Korean about it. The taste is ok.
We ordered the spicy fish Sichuan style. We asked for extra spicy but we were disappointed. It wasn't spicy and also bland in taste. We didn't finish it and the dish was about $20. I think there are tons of better options than this to choose from.
Started out comparable to Robertos, but has gotten gradually worse.Super nachos barely have any meat on them!! I'd rather make the drive to find Robertos.
So disappointing. Just beyond.Not worth the time of a detailed review but here are the highlights...Had a reservation. Host/Manager seated a walk in table at the better of two crappy tables that were open and then tried to seat us. I asked if that was all he had he said yes. I then asked if they had something outside...they did. HmmmmmmAfter about 7 mins manic (and I mean MANIC) waiter comes over to say he'll be right with us.Another 5 minutes later takes our drink order. During which he argues with me on if I want that drink. It's a classic, I order it often...ok I'll wait while you ask the bartender. Ok order drink.35 minutes and 2 small plates later we have drinks.Waiter argues with us on food we order.Food was good, but definitely not worth the hype. Not even close. 2.5 hour dinner. We had 1 cocktail.So so disappointed. Will definitely never go back.And I always give a place a second chance. But I won't give this place another dollar.
We just wanted some McDonalds and when we pulled through they were like "It's gonna be a minute" and I just wanted my fries
One word for you: Yikes!!! This is a MILF bar in a mall to begin with. Double strike for me. So if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven. Overpriced mess of a place overall.I've been here three times to really make up my mind and each time I ask for "well" drinks the bartenders end up pouring me Grey Goose or Van Gogh and then when the check comes they pretend that that's what they heard me say. Last time all I had was two double vodka soda "well" drinks and got a bill for 45 bucks cos the bartender poured Chopin. It's a really dumb scam and I've fought it each time. Just be on the lookout for it.
This airport is freakishly scary! The food selection is minimal and lacks "traffic" to provide enough interesting people watching moments. The only redeeming quality about this airport would have to be a cheesy photo op with a mic stand located in Concourse C. I would not even wish for my worst enemy to have a layover at CLE; or worse...get stranded...in Cleveland!
I was excited about this place. It has so much potential but like a lot of places in downtown Cleveland, the administration ruins everything. Sunday wad their first Sunday Funday... there was nobody there and they had nothing from the menu...like they didn't prepare for it at all.Lastly, besides not having anything available to eat and not sure if they had enough ingredients for their drinks during their first Sunday "party"... they published the event as "beach casual look". However, the hosts were all wearing Sathurday night club type dresses (early afternoon on Sunday!!) which was totally ridiculous. They also looked at us weird because we were wearing shorts... eehh... beach casual? They totally failed on planing in so many different ways.If you want to stay upscale you may have to deliver on the simple things first. I hope they get better over time but I see this as another "Tomo Sushi" type situation. Great concept and poor execution.
So I'm a food blogger and I have my own website where people can see all the places I've traveled to and criticize the food. Unfortunately, this place didn't make it on my list .. It's a new place & my boyfriend and I came in thinking it would be really great. There was a woman that seated us but was not at all friendly. We felt as if we were being rushed and there no great customer service at all what so ever. The male servers were kind at least. Ramen was okay. We both ordered the miso ramen. They say it's thick noodles but it seems thin? It isn't as good as jinya, monta or Fukiramen. But this place is new so hopefully it gets better! They just need to work on those few things. At least we have this place a chance.
The food was decent, but prices were stupid expensive. The lunch portions were minimal for $8.50, the 1/2# fajitas were $20. Small sides of guacamole are $2.25. Given the early 90's cheese decor, your money would be well spent elsewhere.
I called early Saturday morning to make an appointment for a gel manicure and a pedi and just a regular manicure for my niece.  They were able to work with the time I asked for and when I went in there was not much of a wait. My pedicure was great and the people that worked there were very nice! But the quality of the work was not the best. I know I am a walk in and not a priority but I pay just the same and feel that I should have walked out with the best nails my hard earned money can pay for.  My nieces manicure had to completely redone and the polish didnt cover the entire nail on each finger. They were nice and redid them.  My nails some are round some are square and my glitter nail has pink under the silver.  I gave 2 stars because they were very nice but the quality work I had done was not worth the money I paid.  I do have pictures but this is my first review and do not know how to post them
My husband and I went here after stopping at the farmers market. We were seated almost immediately by someone from the kitchen and then completely forgotten. I'm not sure if the person who seated us shouldn't have, but  we sat for about twenty minutes thinking that someone would be over soon, but we finally had to flag down a waitress and ask if someone could take our order. Her reply was, "Well, this isn't my table, but I guess I can." We ordered and then waited for probably another 20 minutes. Keep in mind we had ordered nothing that would take this long to cook and the place was not excessively busy. Seems that they had forgotten us again. By the time we finally got our food, my husband and I were very hungry and cranky. The waitress completely forgot to bring me the milk I ordered, but at this point I just wanted to eat and get out of there, so I didn't even say anything. When I was finishing up my meal, she finally remembered my milk and apologized. The food was good, but definitely not worth the wait. The wait staff kept apologizing, but it was too little too late. We will not be going back.
Let me start by saying the food was good. However the place is staffed by young rude people. They got my order wrong and when I said what I really wanted, I was told by the young girl "No you ordered a large ...". No sorry. No we will fix that. Just indicating I was wrong. Not one "welcome", "thank you", "enjoy", smile in the place.Life is too short to give my money to places that can't train the staff that the Customers are important, not an inconvenience in their day.Bye Burrito Boyz...
I have to say, after coming back from Korea I figured that Toronto would be able to get their pitas right. You can only imagine how excited I was to move just down the street from a pita place!Turns out it's not so hot. If I'm there I either get unfriendly service or indifferent service. It's not really the most difficult food service job in the world, so skipping on the annoyed attitude or putting on a smile shouldn't be that difficult.The food itself is fairly bland. My pita was stale but I can forgive that if the meat isn't stale. But nope, during my multiple visits I've been greeted with super stale meat to old meat. It's really disappointing to have slightly cardboard-like meat. The pickled veg and peppers are delicious though!I will admit that I have gone on off-lunch hours. So I can understand why food may not be as fresh due to the hours I go in. But that doesn't excuse the service and I'm not too convinced  that mid-afternoon or evening food should be of that quality.I hate handing out poor reviews. I would love it if this store to try to improve themselves a bit and train their workers a bit better, as I don't think it deserves to go under.
I don't know why people think this place is good. Although the service is great this place does not serve authentic Mexican food. To begin with, the rice is not Mexican. They serve white rice mixed with canned vegetables. The salsa is also not freshly made. The nearest taco shop has better salsa. I ordered  a combination plate which came with a Chile relleno, a veggie taco and a rajas tamal. The veggie taco was the most edible thing on my plate. It cost $18. Maybe I am being harsh because I am Mexican and I know what Mexican food should be like. I also ordered a guacamole appetizer and that was a 3.5 out 5 stars. In all, this place is way over priced for the quality of food they serve. Good luck if you come here.
Disappointed. The fries were dried out. I prefer frozen crinkle fries over these. The burger was very tender and juicy. The texture reminded me of a thicker smash burger. I did not like how red it was throughout. I wish I would have known so I could have ordered it well done. There were a few bites I didn't eat because of how red they were. The bun is too soft and gets soggy from the hamburger juice. Overall I think it's overpriced for what you get.
I was expecting a lot more so that is why I can only give Beijing Noodle No. 9 two stars.... part of me wants to give it three, but I know better and I need to rate this as I would anywhere else.  The sleek white modern bright decor is fabulous... looks great, but after sitting there it was too bright.  Service was awesome.  Food was at best MEH (hence the two).  The one redeeming item was the corn and chicken soup (I think that is what it was).  Also... when you are not busy, please do not seat the screaming kid next to two of the only diners... they did this and it was incredibly frustrating.  I was with my boss so it was not as bad as it could have been had I been on a romantic date with my husband.
So we were sent here by Urgent Care. We opted out of taking the ambulance because you know...thats expensive. Well my roommate and I regret that. We waited 3 hours in the lobby. My roommate had shortness of breath and sever abdominal pain, on the paperwork it says if either one of those is in your symptoms then notify hospital staff for immediate assistance. So of course I let them know but we still waited for 3 hours, if it was super serious, I am sure my roommate would be passed out in the lobby by then. The lady with glasses and long hair, a little on the bigger side, was very rude and showed no care what so ever when I told her that my roommate could not breath. So finally after 3 hours we get called in, they do some basic tests then send us back out to the lobby again. Another hour later we finally got admitted in. The nurse Shaundra is amazing! She was very friendly and helpful along with an EMT guy named Ben Davis. Both of them were amazing but unfortunately we lost them after 40 minutes because of a shift change and we ended up getting really grumpy staff. The doctor during the whole situation was a little off, she kept laughing for no reason when she would explain what was wrong with my roommate. I don't know if that is a medical issue she is going through herself but I felt it was a little unprofessional to laugh while explaining what is wrong with a patient. Anyways my roommate had 1 ultrasound and 2 cts. Seven hours later, waiting in the hospital, they finally gave us some results and said that they don't know what is causing the pain and shortness of breathe but you also have gastritis and a few cysts on your ovaries but thats not what causing your symptoms but here is your medicine for the other stuff. Have a good night. So my roommate was sent home still in severe pain because the hospital could not figure out what was going on. Very helpful. I am only giving two stars for Shaundra and Ben who were amazingly awesome. This hospital is lucky to have them.
Decided to step out from the usual Montana type restaurants and try a more up market place,  tried Falco's with my wife had spaghetti and meatballs which was nice but nothing special she had the white fish with pasta. Food was ok and the food came slow even though only about 4 couples in there but service was good until I had to go ask to pay as server had disappeared talking. Then the bill with tip over 80 bucks.  Half that price  maybe would of let it go but 80?   So won't be repeating.
This location is consistently the slowest location in the southwest area, whether you go inside or use the drive thru.  Save yourself the wasted time & frustration.
Dirty mexican food...THE UP-SIDE:The food is decent and will definitely fill you up.THE DOWN-SIDE:This place is downright unsanitary at times.  I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with "my food."  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.THE SUM-IT-UP:Good food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...UPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, "Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it."She got all huffy like, "Well, I never!"  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)I'll never eat at this sh#thole Chipotle again.  The others aren't so bad, but this location truly - truly - just doesn't give a damn.
Americanized Russian food with no alcohol, atmosphere is bland, and service was only okay
As others have noted, the prices are high for what you get ($15-25) for burgers and $10-20 for glasses of wine.  The atmosphere was nice if you can snag a booth, more cozy than the sports bar further up the concourse.  The burger was a bit overdone, as were the panko chicken tenders.  BBQ sauce is the sauce of choice.  The wines were of acceptable quality, at least if you are going to pay a high price you get something that is OK.
My co-worker and I have seen construction going on in Noodle & Co's tidy corner of market square and were anxious to try it out.I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet "chili" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, "Asian", "Mediterranean", and "American" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.All that said, the prices are probably fair, especially affordable if you go sans meat/tofu although I would really appreciate an extra veggie option.
Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza.
I honestly just don't get it. I went here because I wanted to meet a friend relatively close to Union Station and wanted to eat something good. There are a lot of pricier joints downtown so I opted for Corrado's. It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.I love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. The sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either. I much prefer Porchetta, Club Sandwich, or even my own sandwiches. Maybe the other menu options are better. Who know's, I'd much rather spend my time and money elsewhere.
I was really hoping to enjoy this place.  Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.Came when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.My stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.There is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen. I can cook faster and better than these guys. AND, I am not classically trained.
I went to get a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable. Couldn't find it in the Apple section, waited and waited and waited for the one person working in the Apple section to take a break from trying to sell a woman a laptop so I could ask if they had any cables in stock. Waited for about 20 minutes before giving up and asking another employee for help. He got me what I needed in about 30 seconds. YMMV, but I found that unless you actually approach an employee and ask them for help they are not friendly and not at all willing to help you (unless you're willing to spend $$$ on a new Mac laptop, in that case you get all the time and attention you need...)
Fairly new to the area and was hoping to find my go to for a good cheesesteak sub. Well I'm still looking.  I placed my order for provolone cheese, mayo, and tomato.  I got peppers , onions,  steak um type meat, provolone,  and a glob of mayo on top of it all. FAIL! Too hungry to wait another 50 mins to get the replacement.
Huge portion but nothing special.  We had the galbi chicken June meat combo that many people raved about.  Chicken was too sweet.  June meat is boring.  The galbi, however, was very good.
The concept of this place is good (fresh and organic produce and goods) however the prices at this place are outrageous.Having stepped foot inside a number of times, I always leave empty-handed. Who can afford to shop here???I find this place quite pretentious. Sure I care about what I'm putting into my body, but there are plenty of other (and better) places in town where I can get chemical-free/gluten-free/sugar-free etc etc. goods without having to break the bank.I'm done with this place. We've officially broken up.
The sign says they open at 7am, but apparently they overslept today hahaha. Two stars for sleeping in!
Ate here in June and had the signature item, the pink tacos, which are chicken tacos with the pickled pink onions on top. It was okay, but the rice and beans were mediocre.If the signature item is merely okay and basic accompaniments are mediocre, I would be suspicious of the other items on the menu.
I thought the service was good and it is a very pretty restaurant. But, my good was just okay. I ordered a beef salad and while the flavor was good, the meat was really tough and it was hard to eat. The Tom Kah soup I had was a nice sized portion, but I thought the spice (heat) overwhlemed the flavor.
I really wanted to like this place. The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]Some of the issues I found:1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. 2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in "brown sauce." The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. How could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. 2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. 3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.
Decided to try some Chinese food here. To play it safe I just got an order of chicken fried rice. Well the rice and flavors were good there chicken was kind of on the dry side. We also got an order of the spicy orange chicken. Orange chicken was good but far from spicy.
R.I.P chick. You were decently tasty but wayyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced. I can't say I am surprised by the closing as the last time we went there we were the only people there at 7 pm on a weeknight...and that included the waitstaff...awkward.....
I feel so bad for the actors.  You simply can't hear a word out of their mouths.  This venue is not made to handle a show like this.  They're trying so hard, but I just couldn't help but feel for them.The hardcore fans loved it - and if you're one of them, you will probably like it.They set a good vibe for the tone of the show.  When I asked where the restroom was before the show, the cast member directed me 'around the corner'...when I went around the corner it was right in front of me.  He said 'do you see it?'  I said 'yes, thanks', he said 'F**ker' LOL.  If that exchange offends you - don't go to this show.The splatter zone, the camp....it's all good fun.  But, unless this is a top 5 cult movie for you - give it a miss.
Nice resort. Room internet was way to slow. I'd have to go to lobby to get access to Internet. Food was ok. Chuck the bell caption was rude and short when approached. Both times I'd have to walk behind the counter to get his attention. The hotel grounds are nice but the Service was bad. I can't see myself coming back to this place.
They ran out of beef..... I came here to specifically try the bulgogi kimchi fries...and they ran out of....beef....
Well I have to tell you I am a little disappointed after giving them 2 try's. trip 1- served me uncooked chicken (approx 4 years ago)trip 2- just a couple of days ago... And let me begin by saying I love a great steak house and I gave this one a second try and passed up on trying a couple of others I hadn't yet. Usually I go to the same place but I was in the mood for something different...Anyways... I agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like USDA at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not)Bottom line. Potato and Ambiance okay, meat not great especially for a total ticket of $230 for 2!
It was ok. I mean, it wasn't Bazic or anything. lol (I'm such a Bazic Elitest).Soju was cheap, which is always good. But, I wonder how much soju was, actually, in there because my friends and I bought must've been 7 bottles of soju in an hour half span and I was still standing.3 bottles at Bazic get me blurry.Soju was presented in a Patron bottle which was a nice/cool touch; BUT, the bottle was soooooo sticky. Obviously because it spilled out when being poured in.Whatevs. Meet me at Bazic up the road.
While I can say only excellent things about Yellowtail, a fantastic restaurant also located in the Bellagio, I can't unfortunately say the same for Prime, this time around.I've had excellent experiences at Prime before so I expected nothing different, however this time, this past Wednesday, I couldn't decide what was worse, the service or the food.  Maybe they were both equally bad.  My drink wasn't filled for almost 20 minutes, and I had to ask and then it took another 10 minutes for it to arrive, then I ordered another, and same story...no one asked us how our food was, the waiter was busy doing something else unfortunately and the people at the table next to us was also waiting and waiting.The NY Strip w/Soy looked great, but I actually had to change knives from the first steak knife they gave me, to a different stronger one because the meat was so poorly preapred, it was tough and I barely ate 1/2 of it and then gave up.The sea bass my buddy ordered was also over powered by the sauce it came with, another less than appetizing meal.  On a positive note, Yellowtail, I would highly recommend...ate there twice this trip and both times the service and food, as usual, was flawless.I hope Bellagio fixes these types of issues at Prime, I have had good experiences there in the past, but I don't know if I'll visit it on my next trip.
i'd rather go to amado's!the only thing that's good here is the bean dip, and i'm only saying that so that i have something nice to say.
Eggsmart is located right across the street from my place, so naturally I've called ahead to place take out orders. It's relatively cheap and the food itself has never been an issue. However, on at least two occasions, the order I received was not the exact order I had placed. For instance, one time I specifically requested and according to the bill paid the additional fee for bacon to accompany my chocolate chip pancakes, but to my disappointment, no bacon received.Recently, bf and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast across the street. It was the first time we actually had the dine in experience. Not impressed! We got there shortly after 9 am to beat the morning rush but the place itself was already so noisy. We could barely hear each other across the table. The majority of the noise, in my opinion, stemmed from the staff talking over each other and calling out across the room for each other. Furthermore, as we witnessed, the waitress was rude to several different customers on occasions. No tact. No quality customer service. Lastly, because of the limited seated capacity of the establishment, by the end of our meal, we were sharing our table with a random gentleman. What was left of our meal was eaten in silence as we scurried to make our exit. Awkward.
The bagels are good but first they had me write down my own order and then forgot two bagels out of my order. After taking a $20 uber to go see them and coming back to find missing bagels was a disappointment. I asked that they check it against the list I gave them and they blamed it on me for not calling my order ahead.
So, I Had The Chicken Yakisoba (Chow Mein) I was not impressed at all. Sadly as soon as I took my first bite I knew I wasted my money. Didn't have enough chicken and  the noodles were over cooked the flavor could have been better. Now I'm now saying the place was horrible that's why I gave it two stars not just one. The atmosphere wasn't great either that should have turned me away in the first place but I had a friend that was telling me how good this place was so I gave it a shot. I will not go back
The positive reviews here clearly came from family or friends that work here. I used a groupon (or something similar) for cut and color and firstly could not find the salon in the unlabeled room in the hallway of rented salon rooms. I had to go door to door asking for them, which was embarrassing enough. Then I was told that color would be extra for my longer hair (which make sense). I ended up declining the hair color part for the added $$ reason, and just asked for the haircut man to make it look nice without cutting too much off. In the end he took about an inch off at the ends, no layering, no cutting to creating a style at all. I literally could have done the same thing in 5 minutes with a pair of kitchen scissors. To be fair I could have been a lot more aggressive to get what I wanted, i.e. exclaiming that I would not pay for extra color as it was not written in the details of the coupon, demanding that the man cut my hair into an actual style, etc, but I should not have to. That's not the kind of person I am, and if this is the kind of place that requires you to do that then I will not be back and would not recommend to anyone.
On the plus side, there are a lot of lights on the Strip!   From a distance, it looks glamorous and fun.Up close, it's a different story.Up close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for "dates" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?Walking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   In the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.
Cute looking spot but that's all it is. Very overrated and hyped. Salads are drenched in oil but sandwiches are good. Don't expect too much from the coffee either...or to get it in under 30 min...
Cool spot for a night, as usual downtown is pretty chill and old school. The hotel rooms are dated. They need more inspections to the electrical plugs and etc..other than that you get what you paid for....
Had to use up my 2 free nights for September and when I was checking in I had the most horrible girl at the front desk. I told her I had a toddler and would love a room close to the elevator..did she give me one? NO it was literally the last room down a long ass hallway. It also overlooked the backside of the hotel where they were doing construction at 6am..woke to the sound of beep-beep-beep of trucks doing their thing.Thank god the inlaws are coming in from MIchigan and going to use the free rooms for October cuz I dont think I can handle staying here anymore..even for free.
Had an opportunity to eat at the breakfast buffet on feb 28th, there is not much to say except, It was horrible.. The food was unbelievably bad, and tasteless.. Eggs Benedict should at the least have a sauce that can be identified.. This one was pale yellow, yet there was no taste to it at all, lemon was completely absent.. I have no idea what it was made from, but it certainly was not lemon or eggs.. While most things can be explained for bad food, stupidity is not an excuse.. The section that was serving the fresh bowls of fruits, water melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple sitting in large stainless steel bowls, packed in ice, had the HEAT LAMPS on.?. Actually had to tell them that they were ON.. Needless to say the fruit was hot on top and cold on the bottom.  This was my last trip to the 'green valley ranch' anything..
I think I've been spoiled by eating delicious quesadillas quite frequently because the chicken quesadilla I ate was sub par.  It was greasy and the quality of chicken was not impressive. I gave an extra star because you can choose the fillings and those were fresh.
Ordered sushi for lunch take out. Was expecting good sushi due to the reviews but it was just so-so. And the green onions which were garnish for our Joes Special roll were spoiled and smelled bad. Fish was not chilled so sushi did not taste fresh. Did not care for it.
Sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  The nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  Actually pretty good.  The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.  The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous.
I'm a big lover of dim sum and have been since I was a very young child back when no one even knew what dim sum was.  I've eaten dim sum around the world.  Kwan's food is good but after having gone there a dozen times and repeatedly having the same bad experience in terms of customer service, I'm so turned off.  While there is an abundance of wait staff, it is impossible to get anyone's attention once seated, to even put in your order or ask for anything else.  No one has clearly ever stressed to the staff the importance of being attentive, welcoming and polite, either.  And while their prices are not through the roof, they aren't exactly a bargain either.  $18 for Chinese broccoli with ginger??!!  Given that they price some dishes so ridiculously high, one would think they would bring them pronto so that the diner doesn't have enough time to brood over or process just how expensive the dish actually is.There are other options for high end dim sums, Lai Wah Heen being one and Crown Princess on Bay being another.  The latter is fancier, has a more extensive and exotic menu and is more affordable than Kwan.  More importantly, their staff is phenomenal.  I'd make the trek there rather than to Kwan's.  The extra travel time is less than the amount of time I've waited at Kwan's for impolite service.
Close to home so we wanted to give it a try. Ordered a couple rolls (no avocado), tamago and a beef bento box. They made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. I felt bad but I asked them for no avocado when I ordered because I'm allergic. Also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm. Dined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. It was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. Ah, so weird. There must be something else you could be doing...The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side. The waiters reached across and in between the two of us throughout the meal. Just may be inexperience. There wasn't any consistency in service either. Check took forever to get. There were a total of 6 guests in the whole restaurant. Overall, the service was interesting. I'm no food expert but the food is okay and I left feeling uncomfortable and awkward. Oh, it's probably from the chef watching us eat the whole time.
grape leaves were the tiniest we've ever eaten!  About the size of a cocktail frank, and about as remarkable.  The lemon piece served with them was dried out. The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  Our pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.
Jun's Special - all of the meat was really tasty as well as the sides but I personally don't think it is worth the $14-$15Bibimbap  - ordered the bibimbap without the hot plate, not sure what the difference is but it was $2 more. As for the dish itself, there was no flavor and it just felt greasy. With Bibimbap being a main dish, I expect it to be good, or at least have some flavor. Personally I like the vegetables pickled and they weren't, the plus is that the veggies were fresh. All in all, the meat was good but not as tasty as a wholeI think the total came to around $25 which isn't bad. This satisfied my KBBQ craving but definitely not worth it IMO. Don't see myself going here again
I do not know what all the buzz about this place is... Poor service, mediocre and overpriced food. The sauces were very basic - no nuance of flavor, and actually very blah. We waited 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by waitstaff, and another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Although we were very clear to communicate up front that we had a show to get to, that didn't seem to matter to them. I can recommend other restaurants in Vegas - don't waste your hard earned $$ here.
Super slow! They quoted me a 15 minute ready time and it took almost an hour. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant for them to be that slow. Food was your typical Pizza Hut so pretty good, but what you expect from Pizza Hut.
Yikes, the prices are crazy for what it is and what you get.  If you are going to charge $18-22 for an entrée an all the salads are a la carte, you should have at least linen napkins.  The waitress is the hostess, no salt or pepper on table, and entry is messy.  The food was a tremendous disappointment and with one waitress on a Sunday night, we had to wait for just about everything.  Food was overcooked and just weird.  The fried zucchini and spanokapitos were good, but entrées were tiny and just not tasty.  For six people our bill was $160  plus tip closing in on $200 which included some desserts too.  Everyone felt the same way and although we all live nearby we won't go back.  I can get a better meal at Denny's with better service.  I give them another 6-8 months and they will be closed. My recommendation is to go to Silvioni's or Monte Cello's.
What is it about BWW? I love their wings, but the service SUCKS at very one I've ever been to. This one fits that same mo,d; good food, SLOW service.
Second time in and again I wait for a Ready Now plain ole cheese pizza!   I need to learn to go to another store that may be ready to care for customers!
I haven't been here in a while because eating here was like highway robbery.  Most of my family lives on the West Coast where the frozen yogurt craze started.  There's a system that is exactly the same at each yogurt store and no one differentiates from it.  Because it works.  Customers get their cup, pick their yogurt, scoop on their own toppings and pay per weight.  Usually you can get a decent sized cup with more than enough toppings for about 3-4 bucks.  I don't think I've walked out of Spoon Me spending less than 5 bucks after all was said and done.  Unless I want a small yogurt with no toppings.  Everything is ala carte.  Toppings..extra.  Fresh fruit...even more.   The yogurt tastes pretty good and I know it's not bad for you but with more and more yogurt places opening around here I probably won't take time out to stop.
I made a reservation days in advance for NYE, when we got there we were seated at the back of the restaurant.Our first server who was a tall brunette, she was awesome. Then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. "Is that a allergy or just some preference?" excuse the hell out of me? I worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. You should simply agree and smile. She then gave my boyfriend the same attitude....Our food came, it was pretty good. I was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said "Here is a steak knife" and proceeded to storm off. We watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years. I just really didn't appreciate how we were treated. Probably wont be returning for another meal there which is a shame.
Delightful location with lots of promise, but overall, this place fails to deliver.   Located near UWMadison and the Madison Zoo, ZuZu is ideally situated.   The place has ample outdoor seating and is very kid friendly (sandbox, activities for kids, etc).  Even the menu (PBJ's) and signage ("for everyone's Safety park your strollers outside).  Let's start with service - this was off the moon rush and I counted 6 employees.  2 were mostly staring, one was taking orders, not sure what the other folks were doing, but service was pretty slow.  Food - ordered the Drake (a slice turkey meat sandwich) and the Randall (roast beef).  The sauce of mayo/mustard in the Drake was so overdone it was oozing out the sides and overwhelmed the sandwich.  The Roast Beef was tasty enough but it was the kind of cured meat that happens to 'stay with you' the rest of the day.  All in all, maybe it was just an off day for the staff -- not sure, but not a place to visit twice.
I read several reviews and noticed a pattern, the highest reviews  came from those with a nostalgic history with this valley institution. Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  BUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.I've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  As a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.My last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.The visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.As another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.
I honestly don't understand what the rave is about.The evening started out well enough - we didn't realize we'd need a reservation but was able to sit at one of the high tops near the bar.  The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.We started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.The reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.  The place is kept COLD.  We were near the vents, but still, by the time our food reached our table, they were lukewarm at best.All in all, the service was inconsistent and the food is mediocre at best.  At such high prices, I'm not sure this will get them a revisit from me.
This restaurant is below par to say the least.. the service was below average; the waitstaff was not attentive and the runners had no clue what was being dropped at the table so it caused a lot of confusion.. some of us ordered the same sushi rolls but they were ALL plated differently..  I'm more than willing to spend good $$$ on a nice meal but this place was extremely over priced in every aspect.. the generic cut rolls, hand rolls and 2 piece sushi will cost you about $12 and there will be more rice than fish.. the specialty rolls were about $24 and were nothing "special." I would simply bulldoze this restaurant and put something else in its place..
10 min wait for table.  They got my co-worker's order wrong.  Nice view of the planes taking off and landing.
What is it with the service and quality of food at the restaurants in this area? We again had another negative experience and this time it was at Heart and soul cafe. The food is OK we have eaten there a few times. The major issue I am having is the service the completely did not have there act together. It looked like a combination of issues landing between poor waitress/waiters and short staffing. As we sat for over 15 minutes waiting for someone to come and get our drink order we watched one table go to the bar to get a drink as no one came to there table and we watched another table tell the waitress they were leaving due to the lack of attention/service. when we showed our 5% off check in office to the waitress she did not apply it and we couldn't get her attention to fix it. The hostess was the one who supported most of the tables with there orders and seating costumers. The kitchen also had the food out promptly but it took over an hour merely waiting on the waitress.
Heed the negative reviews.This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food. As I said, pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise I can't see anyone going back for more.
Called after making a reservation online to change the pick up location to Glendale Airport where were flying in - spoke with a two separate people - neither of whom did their job - no one changed their own internal tracking - waited 45 minutes for no reason even AFTER calling. Did not pick up the car timely - so they just kept charging my account until they did.  These folks don't do customer service-  so if you can avoid it - don't give them business.
Une attente de 45 minutes et des œufs bénédictines pas assez cuits et un café qui goûtait l'eau.
A good dive to hang out at. Bartenders suck but not that busy on a Friday night good seating and good live music. Good for groups and friends hang out. Not good date night unless ur up for a dive.
As a foodie, this is not my favorite restaurant in the world. That being said, it has it's place on the Vegas strip.We had a coupon book from Treasure Island and figured, why not save some money on lunch. We are seated at a dingy table in the bar area. There is only one other table with people at it in the whole restaurant. The waitress is extremely inattentive and seems to have zero care for her table. The food, alright, but nothing to write home about.Our last morning we decided to give it one more shot (they have a $6 breakfast special.) As it was a warmer morning, they gave us the opportunity to sit by the pool. The ambiance was MUCH better (though the music didn't need to be QUITE so loud at 9 in the morning.) The waiter this time was extremely attentive and helpful. The food, still mediocre.Bottom line, if you need a semi fast, cheap option in Vegas and don't care much about the quality of your food... go here.
I had a small veggie burrito from burrito boys for the first time. It tasted good but the service and the way the burrito was wrapped was poorly done and sloppy.
Jerry Nowland no longer runs this company.  Please ignore reviews before 2017.
Hmm, I really don't know what the fuss is all about.  We heard it mentioned on a few travel shows as being THE place for bagels in Montreal, but were a little disappointed that they only do bagels, no cream cheese or spreads, no coffee, cash only.  The bagels are stacked up high for volume, and the place is a squeeze to get to the counter when it is busy.  But they are fast, and the bagels are tasty - I just don't think you can compare this place to others that sell the fixings and coffee.  And maybe that's the point here? And if you are a local, you buy in bulk and bring them home?But if you are a tourist and looking for a cafe/bagel experience, pick another place.
I gave this restaurant only two stars.  The food is mediocre and under seasoned. The Yorkshire pudding, although gigantic, need some salt in the batter.  The tea service that was brought to the table was dirty and we asked for another.  The tablecloth was also sticky.  They need to clean a little more. All in all....not the greatest experience we have had.  Dirty restaurant.
For the love of God, DO NOT order any fancy drinks here. The bartender will get really angry with you and act like you've grown two heads. I honestly didn't think an appletini was a high society drink. Clearly I was wrong. Anything made with vodka is kind of vile as they use Kamchatka. You are much better off ordering a beer or sticking with Coke. It's basically a blue collar bar plain and simple.
I went to the restaurant I order the "Rib Dinner" through the drive through. The ribs were over cooked had a burnt taste, and the ribs was very salty. The "Rib Dinner" comes with 1/2 slab of ribs and Texas Toast and choice of 2 sides. I had chosen the coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy. The coleslaw had no flavor, not sweet like coleslaw supposed to taste. However the mash potatoes and gravy was okay.  I ended up throwing the Whole $15 "Rib Dinner" away. This is my opinion and first experience with the restaurant food.
Great location for locals and if you choose to just have a drink and watch a game -it's perfect!  Great TV's and atmosphere for sporting events.  For anything else, dining for instance, it stinks.  The food quality is bad and the servers are hit and miss.  I'm not sure what the goal of having the female servers dressed so provocatively is, as this is a family place.  The girls all seem more concerned with their appearance than being attentive to their tables.  Maybe if I were a dude, it would be different.  Alas I'm not and unfortunately for them, I'm the one who gets to choose where we dine more often than not and I always vote to go elsewhere or stay home.   I hope they improve, I'd like to be able to give them another try.  Get a better chef and dress your servers in appropriate uniforms.  I'm all for fun and sexy, just not tacky.  Sorry.
Tried to give my business to the small town. Lights were equivalent to a tanning booth. LED Lights do come in many different wattages. Tvs were way too high up.  Thought I was in old country buffet.
Staff could of been a little more friendly. Order and pay first than sit buzzer goes off get your food they will not bring it to you even if you are sitting at their counter. Don't get your drink until your food gets done unless you pay separate.  Took way to long to cook the burgers they were just okay not great especially for the price.
UPDATE 7/10/2016:  While the food remains good, something has happened to the service. I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.I tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said "I've never seen these people before." The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.Because I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.......................................................................Ted's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.11/8/09: Found myself at Ted's again today [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--so good. Same quick service too. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!01/07/2014 - Ted's still delivers the goods. Since I live in San Tan Valley now (we formerly borrowed Queen Creek's name) I don't get out there often, though have been there a few times since the last update). Today I ordered the jumbo all beef, fries and onion rings, as always--and as always, it was delicious. Thanks Ted's!
This place was my 'go to' restaurant for two decades, but since the new owners took over I've stayed away. The menu prices have soared and you have to pay extra for every little thing 'a la carte' now. The salads/soups are not included with dinners while quantity and pricing has gone to the dogs. Why must all good thing come to an end?
It seems like every Ross is a cesspool for the mom buying all her kids clothes for the year.Typical Ross shopper. Mother. Father (usually absent) 4-5 children in tow. Shopping cart full of s#!t. Also makes final decisions at the cash register.Come on on dude. I only wanna buy 2 things!There are 2 registers by each end of this store, but that doesn't stop the terrible feeling of being stuck behind this family or other people paying with cash. Seriously? Who does this still?I added a star because if you're in dire need of something (belt or shoes) then this place is for you.I came here to buy dress shoes because you know dress codes are always enforced in Vegas and I forgot mine at home.Instead of driving back home for 5 hours I decided to just buy a pair here.This store is also big as hell. I dare you not to find something here you wanna walk awway with.
Not like my neighborhood Manuels. This place was cold, the service was sparse, and the food was horrible. Stay away.
I'd skip it.You think it will be fast since it is not full service.  It won't be. You think that surely there must be something healthy available.  There won't be.  And you'll have the pleasure of breathing a ton of smoke while you choke down about 2000 calories of (whatever you order).You'd think it might be cheap since the casino wants to keep you there so that they can keep making money on gambling.  It isn't.
It's a production brewery and not much else. In that matter, no tasting room and you can't just visit it out of the blue.They have a tour once a month. It's pretty much walk in and stand in one spot because its a very small spot.The beers aren't anything special and that might be because they constantly change their recipes. Their one-offs tend to be their best bets but consistency in making them again is apparently tough for the brewery. (Hence "one-off")Better bet going to Tenaya Creek or Big Dogs where you can see the Brewery as well as drink there. Banger Brewing downtown is also highly recommended.
This place is conveniently located in the Stratosphere. Cheesy atmosphere and singing waiters and waitresses with decent voices, not the place to go if you're easily cheesed out. Food was only decent, IHOP quality, which isn't great quality. I got the California omelette, which was mostly good, except the cheese was pathetically thrown on top, barely melted. The hash browns were fairly crunchy, and the toast was the typical crappy bread soggy with cold butter they give you in breakfast joints.I tasted my friend's french toast which had real blueberries, and it was pretty good.
Rocky River location. Out of four different entrees ordered at our table only 1 grilled salmon was ok. A prime rib, filet and the beef tips were poor, margarine not butter.  Dressing tasted bottled. For the price I expected a better dinner.  Longhorn or Outback, blow this place away at a cheaper price.  For the same money you can go to Chez Francois in Vermilion and actually get what you are paying for.  Will not be back.
Dirty, dark, and greasy. Parking is ridiculous and the decor is completely outdated, causing the experience to be below average. The severs were really sweet and were on top of it, but the food was sub par and overpriced.
Well, I'm seriously underwhelmed.It's not that the wings were bad -- it's just that the hype of "the best in the city" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  "our medium is VERY HOT", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their "Hot" was, I would have instead ordered "Superhot" or "Death".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   I've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their "hot"... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  I'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I've also experienced hotter.*  I am surely wrong, but I'd swear their "hot" sauce is Frank's Extra Hot mixed with butter.  It was that generic.
We had a coupon for $20 each ticket for this show, and I think it was still too much.We saw this show on a whim, not really knowing what to expect. But it seems pretty straightforward, right? Zombies. Burlesque. Cool.Out of the 75 minute show, I think we got about 15 minutes of actual burlesque. The rest of the show was the unfunny host talking... and talking... and making crappy jokes... and let me tell you, I am ALL about offensive jokes, but these ones were just tasteless and fell completely flat. I just wanted the host to shut up. They REALLY did not make it clear anywhere that this show is more of a musical and an ATTEMPT at a comedy. Even the burlesque we got was a little disappointing, because the girls were hardly made up as zombies, if at all! I didn't expect full body paint or anything (despite the banner for the show), but most of the girls just had some white paint on their faces and nowhere else on them, no blood, and one girl had NO zombie makeup at all!The stage is TINY, and all of the seats are on one level. Unless you paid extra for bench seats, you're screwed. At least we got free jello shots... good thing they were strong, because it was about a teaspoon of jello.
Blah... The service was poor the food was average and the place reeks of bleach water... I won't come back.
Round 2 - Restaurant Week again!This time around I was quite disappointed.  My group ordered pretty much everything on the Restaurant Week menu.  I went with the Seared Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and Peanut Butter Bar.  Overall, everything was well cooked, however over....over salty!  The texture was just fine, but in the end too much salt.  I usually drink a lot of water when I eat, but tonight they should have left the pitcher.  My group in general drank a lot of water!  I would talk more about the food, in the end all I can remember was --- dang that was salty!  Sorry gang I don't know if I can go another round for this place. Ding, ding, ding -- Enjoy!
This place has subpar food and exorbitant prices (for what it is) which is never a good combo. The first time I got the tomato and egg noodles, and those were pretty tasteless. ..not to mention they came in a tiny bowl and I was hungry an hour later.  The second time,  I got the chicken chow mein, which although greasy,  was decent,  after I added a good amount of salt and two packets of hoisin sauce. Bottom line- save your $12-$18 and get a good lunch somewhere else.
Not the best bagel place and they surely don't have everything.   Had two bland bagel sandwiches and they were over priced.   I don't mind paying to get something good but this place isn't it.  Service was nice but didn't know what they were doing and was extremely slow.
My order got here earlier than expected but the toppings, cheese and sauce is all over the box. Now the crust is soggy. I hate being that person but now I have to call for a new pizza.
We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality.
Alright, we are not hard to please. The service was way below average. Little things like forgetting water a couple of times, unfriendly interactions, etc. Had a hair in my tomato and burrata salad. Not a big deal just figured they would give me a new, hairless one... Nope the guy pondered at the table for a couple seconds debating if the hair was there or not. After deciding he took the salad back to the kitchen and came back with... An apology? Not a new one?? He asked if I wanted a different salad but if not a complementary dessert would be provided. Nice gesture.... Yeah except I already asked for dessert for my boyfriends birthday with a candle and writing on the plate when I made the reservation...that was forgotten too... The two stars are for the bone-in ribeye and the onion soup. Really bummed we spent a pretty penny and it left more to be desired. Took a doggy bag home for the ribeye and the only thing left in the box was the bone? Not coming back.
Visited Compadres for the first time yesterday with a friend who was in from out of town -- we both love Mexican food and the Yelp reviews were good so thought we'd give it a try. We arrived around 12:30, and the place was not super packed but obviously busy. The decor was sparse but nice and fairly modern. We were greeted twice promptly, and told we'd be seated momentarily, which we were. Free chips and salsa were delivered -- my companion noted that the chips seemed like Doritos without any of the cheese or Cool Ranch flavoring on them, as they were perfect triangles and there was nothing special about them. The two "salsas" that came with the chips were flavorful but super watery, with no chunks of veggies or even any thickness to them -- when you dipped your chip, liquid just ran off and nothing stuck. Blah. Our server (not sure of his name -- on the receipt, it only said "Server") had the personality of a wall: not friendly, barely smiled, and had no recommendations whatsoever. We each ordered a margarita, and were asked if we wanted a small ($6.50) or large ($9.00). When we asked about the size difference, he couldn't explain it with either words (ounces) OR his hands (???) so we decided to just try the small size. VERY disappointing -- the glass was FULL of ice cubes, and I literally think I took about five medium-sized sips before it was gone. Also, it tasted mostly like water, with very little lime flavor and clearly less alcohol. For $6.50 it was a MAJOR ripoff. On to the food. Between the two of us, we ordered the tableside guacamole, one plate of three tacos, and one plate of a tostada and a taco. The tableside guacamole was made by a VERY sweet and friendly woman (maybe one of the owners?) who chatted with us through the making of it -- her bright personality was pretty much the only redeeming part of the whole meal. The guac was yummy, and we loved that it was customizable (you got to choose which of about six extra ingredients were mixed in), but it was made with only a single avocado and a few mix-ins and not worth the $8.49 price tag -- we were not even offered any extra chips beyond those already served with our "salsas." When the tacos and tostada were delivered, I was shocked: my friend's tostada was a normal size and looked tasty, but the tacos were TINY, maybe 4" across (at least 2-3" less than a "normal" corn tortilla). The filling was decent (I ordered one steak, one campechanos, and one pastor), but nothing to write home about. Our server checked in with us a few times during the meal, but made it seem like it was an inconvenience for him, plus never took any of our empties off the table or asked me if I wanted a second margarita (perhaps he couldn't see that it was empty due to ALL THE ICE STILL IN THE GLASS). He gave us our check before we were even done eating, and rushed us out at the end of our meal (even though the place was nearly empty by then) which was quite disappointing. I can't recommend this place, and I won't be back.
I've been a long time customer here every time I'm in Las Vegas. Unhappy they started charged me delivery fee without notice and did not give me my fish sauce and jalapeños as requested upon delivery. That could really ruin a foodie's meal. Wish I looked thru the order BEFORE I tipped. Very unhappy.
I've been here before and the food was good, overpriced but good. Today, however, I sat down for breakfast that I was really looking forward to but was left completely unsatisfied. I ordered an omelette and it was bland. No salt or seasoning, bad texture, the side salad was very sad. The only redeeming component was the coffee. The service was poor as well. The "server" seemed irritated the whole time. I will not be returning.
I was thinking this would be quicker than going to my normal one on Northern.  It may be a bit closer but getting back out of the parking lot on to Camelback West bound takes forever.  That's not the reason for the loss of a star.  I ordered one of my favorite burgers, a bacon guacamole six dollar burger.  I got it to go with a side salad and a small drink ($7.89 as a combo).  I should have known something wasn't quite right when my order was up faster than I could fill my drink at the fountain.  The meat was very well done and not very hot.  A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.The bright spot in this was the staff.  I was greeted before I could get to the counter by everyone except the cook.  And on my way out I was thanked for coming in by the manager and two other staff.Fast food is nice but if by getting really fast the quality goes away you haven't gained anything.  I may give them another chance but not much further away is another location that has always gotten it right.
I have been going to McDonalds a lot lately since I have been constantly on the road, and it's cheap. Usually McDonalds is pretty good about how neat the food is presented, and the other night I decided to swing by here on my way home real quick. I ordered a mcdouble, hot n spicy, and fries. When I got home, the fries were cold (it was only a 5 minute drive home), and the mcdouble and hot n spicy were the messiest sandwiches I have ever had. Granted, it all still tasted good, it's $3, you can't really expect too much I guess. It's just that other McDonalds have been very good lately so this caught me off guard.
Their food is great. The problem is they cheat with their lobsters. When you order two lobster special, the lobsters only have one hand. The dish came with two hands instead of four. Why??? I asked manager and she said sometimes lobster came with one hand. Ok, get it. I have seen some lobsters in the past. But both lobsters? I asked another waiter and he told me all the special lobsters have only one hand. So that's how SPECIAL their lobsters are here!
I wish I knew what everybody likes about this place.  Second time was as bad as the first time.  But it will likely be my last time.  The food is mediocre and the service is way below par.  I waited a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to tell me she would be right back to take my order.  5 minutes later she came by.  Coffee cup was filthy.  The overall experience was just lousy.
I can only speak for their brunch menu. I'll say that it was incredibly reasonably priced, and it sounded exciting. After much debate I decided on a traditional eggs Benedict, which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes. I had high hopes, and I was unfortunately disappointed. The eggs were over cooked, so it was more of boiled then poached egg. They were quite sparing with the under seasoned hollandaise sauce. The grits were a little on the watery side for my taste. I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't after I tried the brunch. If it was possible to give 2&1/2 stars I would, because the food wasn't terrible, but it was bland. The service was pretty decent.
The last couple times I have been here, the food has gone up in price but the service and taste has declined some.  They still have a great cheeseburger and volcano nachos.  The other appetizers we had that we used to like just haven't tasted as good in recent trips.  The quesadillas had a seasoning on top that wasn't very good and the chicken was dry. The boneless chicken bites didn't have much breading.  The atmosphere is still fun, but it's a costly experience.
We really wanted this to be a good Thai place here in Fountain Hills so that we didn't have to go to Scottsdale every time. (this is a staple for us every week).  Wasn't looking for great...just decent. Unfortunately, our first experience was disappointing as we ordered two classic dishes: Pad Thai and Spicy Fried Rice ....Pad Thai is a dish that should be consistent in flavor, regardless of where you order it..this dish had a flavor that was not consistent at all with the dish and was quite bland (was ordered at a medium spice). On the contrary, the Spicy Fried Rice was over powered with flavor, but it was unfortunately too much sodium and soy sauce...and pretty much inedible.  Based on the other reviews, it may be worth trying again, but quite frankly, with so many other strong and consistent Thai restaurants within a 10 mile radius, it's likely we'll make the trek down the hill for the sure thing.
The parking is easy and plenty of room But the place is run by ASSHOLES We made reservations and when we arrived we where 30 min early. The park only had a hand full of spots occupied, yet they made us park on the back of lot and wait until 2 o'clock. Then there were 7 other people at also had to wait so now at 2 there was a line that took 1 hr to check in. Also the park is out back of the hotel but they don't even offer a shuttle ,so at night you have to walk back through a dark parking garage in not the best part of town...
Ok for $5 - 6  but not good pizza, no  flavor,  good for young children or anyone else who likes bland pizza!  If they want to charge extra for thin crust they should put it in writing! I would rather give my $5.00 to Little Cesar's!
Growing up, I used to go here every Sunday, however stopped for 5 years and I finally made back couple of weeks ago. So, what's my thought?I'm truly disappointed. Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not. I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum. I'm definitely will not be plan on going back for any reason. I think I'll stick with my random trips to Atlanta and get dim sum there.
I have to be very honest this place was disappointing. I've been to both the other two locations plenty of times and this one is just not up to standard. Food wise, the sushi and the deep fried brie cheese was good. However, everything else was not good. The worst was the raw shrimp because it wasn't fresh. It looked fresh but it wasn't. It was mushy! We ordered the calamari? It was also not good. It's suppose to be deep fried but it was soggy. We asked for them to take it back and they said they can only make a new one because they can't take it off the bill. The service also wasn't as great either.Just go to the other two locations!
Discount Tires does some things very well, sell tires, get cars in and out very quickly and professionally. If there is a problem with the tires that isn't typical, their customer service skills and professionalism weren't apparent to me... I purchased a set of wheels and tires for my truck in July of 2011, have had a constant vibration at highway speeds since these were installed (until this past Wednesday, new tires from Firestone, they match prices too, go figure). Returning week after week (I work during the week, would go here on Saturdays) didn't solve it, they'd re-balance, tell me they were going to torque the rims with the vehicle up in the air, tell me they would do a road force balancing, etc. then blame the truck!I have lifetime alignments on the truck, every 5k there is an oil change, alignment adjustment and rotate and balancing. Front end has been checked by Nissan, Firestone and yours truly.  I don't think things have changed that much in the industry from 15 years ago where I would call the manufacturer of the tire and work out a pro-ration and exchange for a different type of tire (customer pays for tread used) when a tire just doesn't work on a vehicle or someone isn't satisfied with the tires. I was at the point where I was ready to purchase 2 new to replace the worn and talk to Yokohama about pro-rating the other 2. Almost 3 years of "trying", we're done. Straw the broke the camel's back though was their selective measurement of the tire tread. 4 months ago, I was measured at 5/32nds (new is 10-12 and legally bald is 2-3). 2 months later I bring her to Discount to see how much I'll get for the mileage warranty and was told the tires are at 6/32nds.... no way they can do a mileage warranty. They wouldn't measure the center that was showing wear bars. I leave... 2 weeks later, have the truck at Firestone for her alignment and oil change, they measure the rear tires at 4/32nds and find a nail in a sidewall of one of them. OK, 4/32nds at FS, 6/32nds at DT, let's go use my replacement certificate. Of course, when measuring for a road hazard replacement, they only measure the center which is at 2/32nds.  NOW he wants to talk mileage warranty?!??!?!  Now I know why that lady threw her tire of the store in their commercials =). Ever not satisfied, just bring it back...? I tried, then I spent my hard earned money elsewhere.
This car wash has been around for a while.  It seems like it is slowly downsizing.  Gone is the impulse shopping area.  The car wash service itself seems to be slipping as well.  Now you can get a quick, economy, exterior only wash and stay in the car while it happens. The complete wash is not as elaborate as it had been, and is not as thorough as other washes in the area.  Convenient location to the area is what it has going for it.
Bad: the guy that runs this place will only treat you with respect if he deems you worthy.  Being close to my house, I used to stop in to pick up gear quick or get a repair but the owner was always rude.  Maybe because I was wearing a polo shirt or showered or something.  I don't know.  Good: free air pump in back on my way to work
Service was slow. Chili's food is bland.
Still hosting our Notre Dame watch parties. Love the venue, also good food, but the service continues to be an issue. Last night was awful! Server disappears forever, can't get drinks .... got the wrong checks .... some servers are so GOOD while others are absent. Such a shame, and so frustrating. I got up 4 times and went looking for our server for a drink, and then to order dinner, and again to get the wrong check, and again to get the right check. Come on guys! You can do better than this.
I came out to Vegas for my friends bachelorette party and stayed here and oh my  This hotel is the worse. It smells the toilet over flowed , the staff is a little rude. We had to wait 3 hours for check in when they promised us a certain time talking about they short staff. The water heater was leaking and it ruined my clothes shoes and bag. The breakfast buffet was not so good. The eggs were powdered. The French toast was hard as ever. For the cost I could have went somewhere else. The upside to it the endless mimosas was very good. That's the only reason why I gave it a two star. If this and motel 6 was the last available room in Vegas I would stay at motel 6
It wasn't a good dining experience.  Food was cold, they didn't check on us, then when I sent the food back both servers scolded me for not dealing with it quicker. Sadly both servers (trainer and trainee) didn't check back with us for over 20 minutes (side work).  They fixed it, after both schooling me, then got us out of there as quickly as possible.  I wanted dessert, wasn't offered. Check came.  Poor showing.  I'll skip this place next time I want Mexican.
I so badly wish I could like this place but I just can't. The menu is so bland and their margaritas taste very watered down. It's within walking distance to my house so we've tried it several times, hoping for better every time and we're let down. Please update your menu!!!
Honestly this place was not that good. They had lots of flavors but many tasted way fake. The pistachio was just awful! Like a box of Jello pudding! The texture of the gelato was off for me, it was almost too creamy, like eating marshmallow fluff or something. Reminded me of Cold Stone's crappy powdered mix.Go elsewhere -_-
Always understaffed. Tables are wobbly. Long waits for refills. Popular place obviously but they need to hire accordingly.
Went for the first time...ordered take-out. I ordered a crab burger with a side of fries (costs $1 more). I ate 1/2 of my sandwich, many because I didn't want to waste my money. The crab sandwich was oily, full of fillers - nauseating. As for the fries, not sure if my order was an afterthought. I received halves and crunchy tips, and the amount provided appeared to be the size of a kids fry at the local fast food joins. Not worth my money.
I ordered a Hainanese Chicken Soup Rice Noodle.  Why was the Hainanese chicken slightly orange in color?  The green onion sauce that came with it tasted bland.  The rice noodle in soup was okay.  My BF ordered a 3-meat Dry Vermicelli.  The meat looked a little charred/burnt, but he said it tasted okay.  They forgot my Durian drink order; I had to remind them.  It tasted refreshing, rich and tasty.The service level was subpar.  The waitress left us alone with the menu for so long that we thought we would walk out of the door, and she would not notice.  She never had a smile throughout our stay .. to anyone.  It was as if she was having a bad day or didn't want to be there.
I was really really expecting more from all the reviews.  I made it there, dining solo since I was out of town, around 815p and there was NOBODY IN THE PLACE at this time (Tues nite).  I asked if they were still open and realized the woman running the place doesn't really speak English.So I made it through the menu but then asked for suggestion and she suggested the fried noodle with beef, chicken and shrimp and the fried spring roll.It was out and delivered together, which I found strange.  The spring roll was nasty.  Possibly slightly over fried and a dark brown.  I ate just one of the two.  The pan-fried noodle was decent, not anything I'd write home about.  Not much meat, plenty of vegetables and not much flavor to inspire me to eat more.  So if that was her suggestion since I told her I might only be able to make it once to eat there, I'm a bit disappointed.Good value, but not really great food.  I have enjoyed better in my travels.
The massage was terrible. She literally just rubbed my legs and hands more gently then I put lotion on my own body. I asked for buffing on my nails and got home and realized that only half of my nail is shiny, the whole nail wasn't buffed. On top of that the cuticle wasn't pushed back and they could have been cleaned up more. It's my least favorite manicure I've ever received. I gave 2 stars because she did fantastic on my toenail design and they got me in quick. I won't be going back though. I would not recommend anyone to here if they like the massage potion of the experience.
Unfortunately, for all the food is pretty good, the service is terrible. We've given this a good couple tries now and don't think we will be coming back. Our food order is incorrect more often than not, they advertise some food that I have yet to see available, and despite closing in the middle of the day to clean and restock ... they seem to use an awful lot of pre-packaged vegetables, can't quite keep things in stock, and don't appear to have the time to train employees on ingredients to answer questions when asked or, especially after our last experience just tonight, on customer service either. A lot of people seem to love it here, and regretfully ... I cannot figure out why.
I used to like the pizza from here. Last time I ordered it was still doughy and I had to cook longer. Today it was ice cold. Not even lukewarm. My kid was screaming for pizza so I didn't send it back. But, I won't ever order from here again. $31 plus tip for a cold pizza and cold soup. There was a piece of "garlic bred". It was half a sub roll uncooked with some garlic butter on it. Yum. Should have had a can of Progresso and a frozen pizza and saved $25. Wait, I could have saved $35. I tipped $10. I figure a poor kid driving his own car deserves a decent tip. I called to let them know and she said sorry we can replace the pizza. My kid ate the cold thing anyway. And who wants to wait another hour for the replacement? Blah. Next time I'll drive my lazy self over to Bonnanos and pick up a pizza myself.
This place is not keen on customer service. When you walk in, it has the feel that the only people in there are the people that come in everyday. Everything is pretty standard as it relates to a sports-bar. Food was not bad not nothing special either. The service was slow, didn't know if they had a server for my area or even if they had areas. I have to walk up to the bar to ask for the check after waiting and my plate and beer were cleaned up. I was only asked for a drink once with no refills on the water.
Went here today for my yearly mammo.  There were 2 girls at the front desk, one was helping a lady and there were 3 of us in line, I was first in the line. The other girl was busy on her computer, did not look up and acknowledge me, so after standing there for 5 minutes I asked her was she doing check in also---she raised her hand and said I'll be with you soon.  kind of rudely.  no smile.  then when she was finished with whatever she was doing----she looked at me and said "yes?".   Her name was Stephanie Z.     She needs to learn how to greet people.  I have encountered this rudeness at the front desk at this facility every time I go.   Think I will have to find a new facilitiy.  The mammo girl in the back was wonderful.  Its always that front desk.  No smile, no personality, no facial expressions.  Come on if you're dealing with the public you need to be able to greet folks!!!
I am giving this 2 stars, because I have to give it something. I am updating my previous review regarding the horrid treatment I received from the clueless hostess when I attempted to have dinner there last weekend. I did receive an e-mail from the manager asking me to call. I called him and he apologized profusely and asked for a chance to make things right. I plan on taking him up on his offer, because I really want to try this place out.
Well first the rooms are great and can't go wrong with the view on either side. I was a bit worried about the service aspect of this place based on a lot of below posts and they turned out to be true.Housekeeping is a complete disaster was there for 5 nights in a 1 bedroom suite and we only got fresh towels once. Called down numerous times the first 2 days and then we just went to the pool and stole some towels from there.The projector TV didn't work called down numerous times about that....no one ever came up.Ordered room service for breakfast one mourning after 90 minutes we called down again and they didn't have our order.Long story short....Rooms greatView greatLocation greatService absolutely terrible.
Vivoli is one of these places that doesn't really stand out either way - but this is a problem on a street like College where you are competing with some solid restaurants. Service was particularly slow on the Saturday night I went there on a date. We ordered 2 beers and 2 dishes and we were there for almost 2 hours. The very few times a server came by it was a different person. We weren't in a particular rush so we didn't mind too much, but I can see how that would be problematic. I've eaten at Vivoli's many times over the years and have always felt ok about it, never super overwhelmed with enthusiasm.
Close to home, but not my taste buds. Food was a little bland. Service was weird. The guy started cleaning the very dirty floor while I was eating my food, and kept apologizing. The place was niceish, but you are better off checking another spot out.
I came here on 9/22  for the Oddball Comedy Festival.  My friend and I felt duped!  Our tickets said 5:00pm. So we thought that was the start time of the show.  I'm not sure if it's Tickmasters fault or Ak-Chin Pavilion, but boy were we mislead. The show didn't start until 7:00pm.  So for two hours we had to kill time with medicore-at-best food with ridiculously expensive drinks( $4.50 for water and $13 for 20oz beer). Thankfully they didn't charge for parking, but I would rather pay for parking and eat at a restaurant with better food than be forced to buy food/drink at the Ak-Chin Pavilion.The sound was decent.  My friend and I sat fairly close in hard plastic chairs. With the show starting at 7 and not ending until 11, the chairs were definitely not comfortable by the end of the night.  Also, like another reviewer stated the huge overhead fans were nice at the beginning of the show, but as the evening progressed and the wind picked up I became very cold in my seat.I don't plan on returning to a venue at the Ak-Chin Pavilion
I always eat there and i like their food and the ice tea is amazing , but today I ordered the Thai dynamite (small) to go and it was dry, barely any vegetables and the meat looked and tasted funny like it was cooked the day before !! I threw it away. I am disappointed this time
Spent 600 dollars to have a complete show room detailing and a small scratch on the rear fender buffed out. They kept my car for two days not one as promised and was very disappointed when I finally got it back. Many excuses for why the scratch wasn't removed ( Audi paints systems are different apparently) and the inside detailing was a joke. Waste of money and more importantly time. Don't go here for scratch removal the website is deceptive. Took it back so they could address the issues and they didn't fix anything. Lots of silly excuses for why they couldn't do what they advertise.
No wonder great clips is taking their business. They just can't get it right. super cuts has a long ways to go in hiring quality stylists if they want to keep up. I have come out twice feeling something is off and I only come here when the Great clips line is too longThe hair stylists are always not always smiling, although the manager is friendly.
I used to love T.I.S. bookstore, but lately I am so far from a fan. I'm now an off campus grad student and I ordered a textbook for class in plenty of time which they decided to not ship because they assumed I would want to pick it up...umm hello check the adress! So I got the book super late and was unable to be prepared for class which, if you know me, you know that that really bothers me, I'm sort of anal. Also it took over 4 weeks to get the course packets all copied and sorted out, super ugh.
I really enjoy the food, can't say the same about their service. I waited an hour and 20 minutes for two pizzas and when they finally arrived they were incredibly cold! Not a happy customer.
Worst bleu cheese ever, ranch was runny and wings were fatty and shame on me for trying crimson citrus sauce, horrible limited time option.   Loud inside, still to cold for outside dining.   To be known as a wing spot, they messed up.  Server was friendly and attentive, food was awful.  Do you have to ask for celery?
Walked in and knew exactly which car we wanted. Did a very short test drive and we agreed on the internet advertised price. The next morning I was looking at the paper work and noticed the base price had gone up over $1600. I called to ask about it and the guy asked me if I was looking at the total after taxes etc.  Ok. I don't know how stupid he thought I was but of course not!  I was looking at the base starting price!  After going in to the dealership to pursue this it was pointed out that the advertised price does not include mandatory dealer add on charges, such as window tinting (it was a used car and already on), nitrogen tires and other things that added up to over $1600. I guess it was on something I signed while getting to the desired monthly payment, but why wasn't it clearly pointed out?  And why dont I have any documentation or itemization of it in my loads of paperwork?  If I had in fact purchased these things I should have some sort of receipt for them. I think it's a horrible way to do business. We had verbally agreed on the advertised price and those add ons were glossed over and snuck in on top of that price. I have bought many used cars throughout my life and I have never ever run into this.  I will never again buy a car from a dealership who has mandatory dealer add ons.  If I see a price online I should not end up paying any more unless it is for optional items that are my choice.  Why would you even want to do business this way?  You've got a great line of quality cars. People will buy them. By looking at this site this same issue has made a lot of people really mad. You want people to feel like the got a great deal, not that they've been had. I gave two stars because most of the people there were actually pretty nice, but I still feel like that was a pretty slick move.
Here are the main points for those speed readers out here:1. This is a nail school in a not so great part of town;2. Because it is a school, the quality and consistency of the services is unreliable;3. Don't buy the Groupon. Call the salon first, tell them you would like an appointment, and when they ask about Groupon, tell them you were going to buy one. This will ensure you get an appointment right away, as they can only do so many Groupons per day, and they will honor the Groupon price regardless;4. The manicurists/students are all incredibly sweet and friendly;5. This is a no frills, no massage chair salon (which I prefer as those massage chairs are filled with nasty, gross tubes filled with other peoples nail gunk that can never be cleaned out, ew).6. Make sure you have time to burn, my mani/pedi took over two hours!I decided to visit this salon because Groupon sent me an email advertising their Groupon. I was interested in the gel manicure and spa pedicure for $25, as it sounded like a very good deal. I called the salon before purchasing the Groupon to check their availability. The asked right away if I was calling with a Groupon, and whether or not I had purchased one yet. I indicated that I had not, and they said that was excellent, as they can only take so many Groupon customers per day, but that they would offer the Groupon price anyways if I just came in.This salon is located in a not so fabulous part of town, but I would hardly classify it as ghetto. If this side of town is ghetto to you, you clearly have never been to a real ghetto before. The customer service that I experienced here was on par with any other salon. They were friendly when they greeted me, offered coffee or water, and were all smiles. The women who did my manicure and pedicure were both incredibly sweet, and their customer service was phenomenal. However, this IS A SCHOOL. As such, the quality and consistency of the services are not reliable. I had to wash and scrub my own nails, and my manicure left much to be desired. The gel is inconsistent, wrinkled, does not cover my whole nail, and the tips were left exposed. It is simply awful. I was very disappointed with my manicure. My pedicure, however, turned out okay with minimal polish on the skin. So it's really just a fluke whether or not your service will be good I suppose.Since this is a school, the students work very slowly as they learn, so make sure you have time to burn. The whole mani/pedi experience lasted over two hours, and I had two women working on me at the same time. I decided to try this Groupon because of the neat pics of nail art other Yelpers had posted, but that was a mistake. Do not come here looking for anything other than solid color gel manicures, this is not the place. Overall, even though this place is a good deal, remember what your parents always said, "if the deal is too good to be true, it probably is." The stars I gave are for the students who, as I said, are incredibly sweet and well intentioned, but that a manicurist does not make. I would not recommend this salon, nor will I be returning.
Ok.....service is crazy slow even @ 2:30 they had two waiters for the entire place....One of the rolls we got tasted like it was canned tuna. House salad was good though....
Amazing food, shitty host service. There were at least four tables open, but no one was being seated. Talk about losing the opportunity to up sell and increase profits. Just because a table gets sat doesn't mean you should leave the other 4 tables empty.
OK maybe I was overly optimistic about the hype of this place, but it wasn't that great.  There was a block long line outside on a Sunday morning to get a table for breakfast.  They were definitely efficient and had great service.  A lot of the breakfast menu items looked like they belonged on a dessert or ice cream parlor menu, rather than a diner. I had huevos rancheros.  The crumbled chorizo was salty enough to choke a horse and there was a lot of it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Another person with us had the breakfast burrito, which he said was overly filled with mismatched odds and ends.  He took the half he couldn't eat there and finished it later.  Our other companion had something else in a burrito and took half of that home also. In my opinion Deluca's needs to focus more on quality and less on quantity.  Maybe the pancakes and waffles are better, but we didn't have them.
cold unsalted edamame- blehincessant wait staff who wouldnt layy off us while we perused the menu.uncomfy seatingloud.. maybe i meant to say boisterous. I'd never go again, we fought to walk out the entire time.
I have been to this restaurant at least once every time I visited Montreal in the last five years. But I have never been impressed by the service here. The food is average at best given the price. The only reason tourists like me would still go there is because its location. It's close to my hotel. But if I ventured a bit east to the plateau,  I would have had a much better experience, whether or not the waiter/waitress spoke fluent English. Montreal is full of culinary adventures, W&G really needs to step up quite a bit to make it.
the service here was terrible and they didnt prepare my salad like i asked. my friends and i waited thirty minutes to get our order taken and it was an all around sub par experience. the food and atmosphere were good, but the service wasn't good at all. the woman who sat us down forgot about us and i honestly wouldnt go here again
Waiter was over the top cheesy.  Talked too much.  A bit obnoxious.No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch.So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions.
Food was great!! So odd there was a young lady taking pictures of all the families in the restaurant and totally disregard our family. However we were the black family in the entire restaurant and thee only family she didn't snap a picture of.
I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try. Variety was lacking and the old fashioned donut I tried tasted like it was left out overnight. Not fresh whatsoever. Two star experience for sure !
It's the name sake location, but with a little too much old-school Vegas and lack of consistency and service for the price point in the modern day Yelp life.'Sure I've had amazing prime rib, service, and experience at a steakhouse like Lawry's, HoPR, etc, but it just seems like the quality isn't there anymore that made this chain and location famous to begin with.From the acclaimed spinning salad to the amazing creamed spinach and corn, it was all just mediocre here and for the price point I was sadly very disappointed considering the options on the strip.If you want to avoid that and have a car though, this might be a place to check out and hope for the best. The large portions of prime rib will always help somehow.
I wanted to like this place.  It's really close to where I live and I love Mediterranean food.  I held off on doing a review until I had tried it out multiple times.  However, after trying many items on their menu, Parsley just doesn't deliver. The ingredients don't seem fresh, the food is bland, and the overall quality is mediocre at best and sub-par at worst.  For example, every time I had their baklava it was stale.  The employees are nice and attentive.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large, but it was definitely a case of quantity over quality.  Maybe my standards for Mediterranean food are too high, but I don't think I'll be going back.
Really really Americanized Chinese food. The portions are really large though, you can definitely share with someone. I was really surprised at the quality and taste for a restaurant at Cesar's. I would think that there are so many Asians at Las Vegas now that they would go for a more authentic taste. The decor is also really trippy and confused me whenever I looked around. It was too detailed to the point of looking really tacky.
I have been here a couple of times. The massage was run of the mill. The therapist didn't really ask me many questions about my problem areas, and then despite me requesting arms, he did not massage my triceps or deltoids (?!). Also, he rushed into the clinic 10 minutes late. He gave me my full time, though. No self-care prescribed.A BIG turn off for me was the POS machine prompting for a tip. Really?? This is a multi disciplinary clinic, and you're *requesting* tips?  This seems highly unprofessional for regulated health care professionals.
I live in the area, so I was excited when this place opened up last year.  Since then I've been here twice.  Once I ordered a burger with duck fat fries,  and once I had a the rabbit burger.  I had high hopes for the burger with duck fat fries.. but they were just okay. I didn't care so much for the rabbit burger, but I don't hold that against wild burger I was just trying something new. Both times I felt a little gouged on the price. On their website they have the details of their daily deals, most centering on having a pint with dinner. But i find it irritating that there are no prices for their regular menu.Give it a try if you want to try eating an exotic animal in burger form. I won't be coming back.
I'm in zero degrees right now AC is broken, how hard is it to call an HVAC-R company and have them come fix it so your customers are not suffering? Got the Matchata and it wasn't good. The coffee matcha was okay but experience was ruined by broken AC!!!
Pretty disappointing. I met a girlfriend here at 11:45 hoping to grab an early lunch. By 12:25 our orders - a salad and the fish, both off the specials menu - still hadn't arrived. No server came back to refill our waters, either. Ultimately, after 45 minutes of waiting, we suspected our orders had been missed. She finally came back and explained that the kitchen was backed up with two large groups and that's why we were still waiting. Since we had meetings at 1pm to get to, we asked to have the lunches wrapped up. Cue the broken debit machine - another 10 minute wait to be able to pay for a lunch. I'm finally having my salad, which is good, but I feel like we really earned it. I doubt that we will go back.
It's okay. I don't see what the race is all about. What pissed me off is I ordered tartar sauce and when I got home, it was nowhere to be found. One and done. Not going back.
I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this place, but the truth is that good sushi isn't exactly scarce here, so you'll need a few other points of pride if you want to do well.  We've been twice.  The first time was right after they opened.  We approached the hostess stand to the right (if you're standing in front of the restaurant) and the girl snarled, "You need to put your names in over there," pointing to the other hostess stand to the left (basically just a counter where menus were spread out).  Okay.  Our visit that time was unremarkable - nice waiter, good food, really dead for a place that just opened.It was the second visit this weekend that solidified my opinion.  Wouldn't ya know, we approached the "correct" counter this time and stood there waiting.  And waiting.  And... waiting.  A hostess approached... no, she diverted to the right-hand stand and began counting out her drawer.  After a couple minutes I cleared my throat, she looked up and said, "Um, are you dining in?"  I said, "Yes, we were hoping to, but we've been standing here for almost ten minutes."  Not even the grace for a perfunctory apology, she grabbed two menus and stalked into the restaurant.  I assumed we were meant to follow her, so we did.  Big mistake!We ordered two apps (garlic edamame and eggplant fries, both good) and three rolls (two of which were very good).  I don't know what to say about the third roll, a baked roll, because it never came.  We waited and waited... our waitress disappeared.  She finally showed up and we asked for the check, which of course, included the missing roll.  We explained that we didn't receive it and asked her to take it off the check.  She was embarrassed, very nice, about it, but explained that "the first one got burned and they are trying to make you another one."  Really, 30 minutes after our food came out?  And no one was going to tell us unless we asked?  There were literally three other occupied tables in the restaurant.  The bartender was eating a pretzel.  It's not like it was too busy to handle the Saga of the Burned Roll.Needless to say we will not be back.
Went there on Saturday night.  They weren't exceptionally busy, there was no wait and tables available, but they did have a decent crowd.  The service was VERY slow.  Once we were seated, it took over 8 minutes for the waitress to even say hi, and take our drink order.  We weren't in a hurry so that by itself wasn't an issue, but the slow, inattentive service continued.  We ordered the bbq plate and the half chicken plate.  The bbq and chicken were both good.   Neither was the best I've had, but both good.  The sides on the other hand were a whole lot of meh.  Between the service and sides, you can do better at other BBQ places in the area.
Just OK. Had two rooms. Both were marginally acceptable and needed better cleaning. The whole hotel needs updating.
Came here for breakfast.... BIG MISTAKE... I got the breakfast sandwich... How can u mess that up????Well they did.. If u want to pay 6 dollars for a bagel sandwich that tastes like crap... Come to the commissary.Rather have gone to mcdonalds or bk..... Sorry commissary... U FAIL!!!!!
I have a mixed feeling about this place... but ultimately decided to give this place 1 star. And here is the reason why... We recently moved to Mountain's Edge and were in search of a new groomer for our 2 dogs (Dachshund terrier and Poodle mix). We saw the reviews for this place were good so decided to give it a try. They called us back in the expected time frame (about 5 hours). The dogs seemed fine and groomed. They did miss a couple of areas for our Dachshund (they missed his left ear and chest), but we didn't have any major complaints so we decided to take them again a few months later. The next time we went, it was my sister who paid and picked-up the dogs. When she was paying the tip for the groomer, the check-out girl saw the amount of tip and gave my sister a nasty look and asked if that was all the tip she was giving the groomer. My sister thought $30 for 2 small dogs for a simple hair and nail trims were enough (I have to mention that they are both well behaved dogs, and we have never had any complaints or problems with groomers, vets or people) And even if the tip wasn't enough, the girl should have not given her a dirty look and judged her. Ever since then, my sister refuses to take our dogs and her own dog to Barking Dogs. Not only because she was personally offended, but because she was afraid that they were going to mistreat our dogs for what they considered a "not enough" tip. The total for the 2 dogs was $90. We tipped more than 30%. We are now driving all the way back to our original groomer, Petiquette, where the owners and staff are friendly and they don't judge you for how much you tip, and where our dogs are well groomed and taken care of.
We went around 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  We waited over 5 minutes to be seated, and the restaurant was not busy. Honestly, the food and drinks were decent but the service was so bad that I can't give it more than 2 stars. I guess they were understaffed but I don't think that's an excuse.
Went here for brunch with my friend on a Sunday. We got the bottomless mimosas which we definitely got our money's worth. However, the mimosas were very watered down and they were warm. The food was decent, but definitely not the best. I would probably not come back here. The only really good part was the service.
Very basic hotel. Just needed it to sleep and have close proximity to the ROM area. I woke up to a bedbug crawling on my bed that I killed and there was blood everywhere! I looked around and found 1 more, took it down to the manager and they compensated well. But now I have nightmares I have bedbugs now.
The server Alex was awesome... The reason for the bad review is because of the food... it was disgusting... I would never eat here again. I would train the kitchen staff how to cook better. I had to send the fish back because it smelled and tasted expired. It had a bad smell and when I tried it i had to spit it into a napkin because I could not swallow it. I asked for a chicken sandwich instead which was dry and tasteless... I will never come back here due to the food...
The food was pretty good! Went there for dinner on a weekday and they were not busy at all. All attentive hostess and the food came out fast.The bad news is that it gave my bf diarrhea after eating it. It was the only thing he had the whole day and he woke up at midnight with a bad case of diarrhea... So if you go there, go at your own risk....
I give this place 2 stars because it was incredibly average. I loved the ambiance, the attentiveness from the staff, the cleanliness. All those things were great. But when it comes down to it, I just want a good wax. The gal who did mine was super friendly, very nice. But again, I just want it done right. She had missed a few hairs, so I had to go home and shave. I also got a brow waxing and the shape is exactly what I came in with. I even advised the front desk when I set the appt, that it was important I have someone who can shape brows. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying it wasn't a great wax. Everything else was awesome.
The atmosphere of local is very fun, which is why it gets more than one star.  This is especially true in the summer when the windows are open.  It makes for a great day drinking spot.  The drinks are also pretty good.Now to the bad.  The food is average.  I have never heard anyone I went there with be impressed with their meal.  I got a burger on my last trip there.  Ordered it medium rare and it came out dry and well done.  My wife's breakfast sandwich was soggy and lacked flavor.  It's the little things like this that are annoying about a place that has potential to be great, but just misses the spot.  The service is always slow and mistakes are made often.
Well, after being a loyal patron since moving to Mesa, AZ in 1991, it's sad that Matta's and me will be apartin' ways. I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. A few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. Today, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of. Matta's, it's been a nice run with you but I won't be coming back.
My friend was having a frozen yogurt craving and took us to Yogurtland.  I'm not a huge fan... but this place was your average run of the mill, self-serve, tons of yucky toppings sort  of place.  My friend likes it though, hehe... and her craving was satiated - so that's all that matters right?
Underwhelming at best. Was stoked to try this place out, as it came highly recommended. We showed up early and were seated right away (yay!). Our server was nice and explained the menu and made some recommendations. The cucumber mule, which they have on tap, was entirely too sweet and I ended up trading it in for a glass of prosecco. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special. I would have tried more things, but was too disappointed to spend any more money for such mediocre small plates. Great concept, lovely space (although there is zero street signage and it's up a flight of stairs), but I was not impressed at all. Will not return.
Service is so slowNot the first time here neitherThey priorities the pickup ordersThey clean n busy doing other things instead of helping the line movesA back wall can wait to be wiped if the line is to the door and people r so frustrated because your too slow!Seriously!!!!As soon as she stopped n came to help the line was moving.Made me late to everything, I would avoid this particular location :/Nothing wrong besides super slow
We went on a Saturday and it was busy with a line out of the door, which was expected. They had the door open to the store inside was extremely hot and uncomfortable. The staff was very busy and has an efficient system for taking care of customers. The reason I wasn't thrilled with my experience was I felt like they were a bit distracted when I actually ordered. I felt like I was just a number and they just weren't very helpful or friendly. The ice cream sandwich ultimately fell apart because the cookie was too hard to bite into and the ice cream was melting all over the place. I ended up eating it all separately which took away from the whole idea of being an ice cream sandwich... I might go back and give them another try once they work out the kinks.
really spacious room cheaper price bc it is off the strip. but really disappointed at its cleanliness. found used shower cap in a cabin and dirty stain on the bed sheet. black stain on the side of the door. made me wonder did they really clean the room or not.  the decoration seem modern and nice but when i paid a closer look at the pillow, they seem really old and never get replaced. dont think i would come back again..
Had to send the steak back 3 times- unacceptable-medium rare should not be a difficult task for an establishment that considers itself a steak house-  all the sides were great (all i got to eat since they never prepared the steak appropriately) especially the little frieshere is the steak experienceask for medium rarereceive blood flowing rawsend backreceive charred on the outside no flowing blood but still clearly rawsend backreceive new steak- i tell the waiter to stay and watch, even before cutting i can tell that this steak (which is again charred on the outside) will again be rawno steak for me this nightmanager makes cursory attempt at apology, takes steak off, gee big thank you there considering i didn't eat it, nothing else was comped, i figure since my wife pretty much ate alone that they would have made up a little more-  dont think i ever paid over $200 for a meal i didnt get to eat before, and i dont intend on doing it againeat any where else in the hotel and you are sure to enjoy yourself,  would be really hard for me to consider giving this place another shot with all the other options in Vegas
2.5 starMy experience with Arepa is limited...  aside from having the Venezuelan style  Arepa at Arepa Cafe http://www.yelp.ca/biz/arepa-cafe-toronto#hrid:Pxplj67nbkQA-VCbm8_93w/src:self which I thoroughly enjoyed. When my Yelp Friend suggested Arepiando, I am IN!Prices wise, Arepiando's Arepa is almost half of what Arepa Cafe is charging... but the location of course matters a lot!! Arepiando is located in a Latin American area up in North York, while Arepa Cafe is down in Queen St West. The set up of Arepiando is more like a takeout place where you can watch the cook/cashier/owner preparing your arepa through the glass window.Arepiando might serves really authentic Colombia Arepa, but I didn't enjoy the white corn arepa as much, I found that it was just too crunchy and chewy.  Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!My Yelp Friend decided on: Arepa con Chicharron ($5) - Fried Pork Skin with Cheese- So chewy... so dried... I am glad I still have all my teeth if not I won't be able to eat the pork... but I might have problem digesting it though- taste wise, it was pretty bland, the hot sauce on the side was pretty weak, I tried to dip it in the dressing.....Arepa Ranchera ($4) - Eggs with Chorizo and Cheese- definitely a breakfast sandwich.. the scrambled eggs were really fluffy but unfortunately the sausages were on the dry sideLulo Juice Cocktail ($1.50) and Strawberry Soda ($1.50)- My first experience with Lulo was good which has a citrus flavour- My friend's Strawberry Soda tasted just like cough syrup!! But he like cough syrup!The lady was so nice, even gave us a chicken empanada to try... but the empanada was meh too... bland and dry...I really want to like Arepiando........ Maybe it is just me??
We dined here on 06/05/14.Was super excited to celebrate my husband's birthday at this restaurant. The waiter was extremely pushy regarding the drinks and I felt as though he was constantly rushing us through ordering and our meal.Appetizers were blue corn pancake with duck & blue corn lobster tacos. Both were OK. The duck was covered in a lot of sauce for my personal taste buds and was a touch boring. The taco was OK but very underwhelmed.I ordered the filet medium and husband ordered the NY strip medium. It was explained to us that medium was PINK. My steak was medium rare. I told the waiter and he said that was what he told me. OK waiter person, whatever you say. I just wasn't in the mood to fight with him.The sides were very good. The horseradish twice baked potato and the corn cojita.Was disappointed in the dessert after just one bite.Credit Card was authorized for the total of the bill $194.00.After tip the total was $244.00 and that was also authorized on the credit card.The $244.00 was charged on 06/09/14.The authorization for $194.00 is still on my credit card as of 06/11/14.Grrr...
*2.5*Since my review from January, I have been going to Iam Yoga on a regular basis. I am sad to report, however, that they have gone downhill by A LOT. The change rooms, which were the highlight of many people's experiences, are now  a nightmare. The showers no longer have the shampoo, conditioner and body wash that they once boasted, and the drain is constantly clogged. The shower heads have been broken on several occasions as well.I have also discovered that the after-work classes (5pm, 6:30pm and 8pm) get extremely packed and smelly. Luckily, I've been able to avoid those. The lobby area, the practice room and the staff have remained alright, but the bathrooms really turn me off from continuing here now.
I don't know if anyone else has noticed that these cigs are less and less satisfying than they used to be when this place first opened.  ???  Myself and a few people I know have been getting ryo cigs at these stores for a few years now....and the tobacco has progressively been getting worse and worse.  Meaning....the low level of nicotine in the tobacco is not satisfying at all!  I can smoke 3 cigs in a row....and barely feel like I got any nicotine.  And the shit inside the tobacco burns like a god damn forest fire!  It smells like wood or plastic or I don't know what.  They smoke like crazy!  And they burn a lot faster too!  I can tell you that the Kentucky Tobacco they bought back when these places opened....is NOT the same as the shitty tobacco they get today...but still call it the "same Kentucky Tobacco".  And try to explain this to someone that works at these places who doesn't even smoke....is like talking to the wall.  I know the owners have got to know that this tobacco really sucks now.  But I guess they figure...you get what you get.  Clearly they are getting much cheaper tobacco than in the past.  It's almost like it's 30% normal tobacco and 70% who the hell knows?  But what I do know is....it's a fraction of the nicotine that was in the original Kentucky Tobacco they used to get and now it sets off the damn smoke detectors in my house from them burning like a camp fire!  Good things never last.
Food is delicious but I can't leave a positive review hereOverpriced and under filling
So went there with high hopes based upon reviews. Was really disappointed. The place itself was really nice with the decor and atmosphere. The first server that saw us came and sat us, then two other servers came and asked if we had been helped. That may seem like good customer service, but the way that they acted it was as if there was no server rotation. Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work. As we were leaving two purple came in to eat at 1 pm and the same server we had said they closed in five minutes even though anything I saw said 2 pm.Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up. The lemon poppyseed pancakes did not have any lemon flavor to them, I ordered a burger and it was bland and overcooked. The fries had no salt on them what so ever. Would not eat here again.
I have given this place a try quite a few times during the past few years. I was just here as last resort because the other places in the area were closed on Sundays. It's not that I expect friendly service from the person working at the counter but when your place is named "Aloha" Kitchen, you'd think someone can crack a smile and say hi when they take your order.  It's just not one time, it's consistently like this, no greeting at all!   The food is alright, I do give credit that they plate the food attractively, but they rely too much on drowning their meats in sauce for flavor instead of seasoning and marinating it.  The slices of beef that did have no sauce were a little dry & tasteless.  The manapua I ordered was a store bought brand and the dough was a bit tough. (like they left it cooking in the microwave a little too long) . That's probably why you get your food real quick!! It's already been prepared all they do is reheat it!  There are at least 3 other places that serve up better Hawaiian & Filipino food in the area so aloha, Aloha Kitchen.
My coffee was pretty good.  The store is dirty. Travis is rude and walks away while you are speaking to him. He throws your straw on the counter next to your drink. I will not be returning to this location.
Love it for the escape room but service and manners are just not up to par at all ! Yes it's a casual area to hang out but aren't we running a business here ? Couldn't even get a proper receipt for 125 dollar bill ! Manager was rude and impolite , other employees are all over the place completely unorganized . We waited 30min just to have someone get us into the escape room when they told us it's empty and ready ! I don't get that logic , don't tell us we can go in anytime and make us wait ! In another side note we brought out a little snack from "outside" after ordering drinks here and not knowing we were told to get out if we continued eating outside food ; we just ordered lattes and coffee and you tell us to get out for bringing in outside food ?? Is someone having a bad day ? We just spent over 150 dollars and you tell confused customers that we need to get out for brining I'm a little snack. Yes I understand there are policies in place but THERE IS A WAY TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES IN PROFESSIONAL MANNER . (P.s coffees are overpriced and tasteless , lattes are good ) Wish there some form of professional business training here , cool place otherwise .
I am reviewing Asian King based on their Lunch Specials.Not too many choice in the area for decent Cantonese food... so you might be stuck with Asian King if you have that urge.Decent price for lunch $4.99 for a soup noodle of some sort, and the portion is huge.My Beef Brisket with Wonton Noodle Soup ($4.99) was really flavourable...by tons of MSG. I was thirsty for the whole day after that. On the other hand, my Hot Yoga Date Thai vegetarian Fried Rice ($6.50) with soup and Spring Rolls was really blend tasting.Services here is cold and efficient...... I don't know if I would be back to Asian King  for more MSG experience!
This Jack in the Box is sub par even for JitB's.  The line is usually slow and the placement in the parking lot makes it accessible only if you're traveling East on Bell; otherwise it's a lot of parking lot to work through to get to it.  You gotta really want JitB.
Stopped in for breakfast and ordered a waffle with I'm  candied bacon. Yum! My husband ordered a two egg breakfast. The service was awesome, but the food was just okay. I had to return the waffle to be cooked longer, but it had good flavor.  One piece of bacon was rubbery, the second too crisp (microwaved?) and the potatoes were hard and crunchy. Don't know if we will come back, but I'm sure they will improve with time.
I was really looking forward to this meal. I'll keep it short. Me and my wife got the Sixteen Course Degustation Menu $395/Person.Some of the dishes had olive oil drizzled on top which was not pleasant because we started out with La Cerise and La Coriandre which both tasted like olive oil. Don't get me wrong their olive oil was really good. I'm not there to taste whats behind the olive oil flavor. The scallop dish I had way better else where. It wasn't seared right, a very light sear. I didn't get this dish Le Caviar. Just so simple. Besides the green asparagus was the best steam asparagus I had. But it's just asparagus with caviar on top. Well this was the best dish of the night Les Crustacés. Reallly gooood. The bread and butter was really good. Everything else was just so so.Presentation was really nice and pretty but in the end food must taste just as good. Which was not.I thought this would be the best meal of my life. I was wrong. I had better at no star restaurant.
I'm just in the area for the day... Showing some houses to some buyer clients and needed a place to stop for lunch between appointments. I ate too much. This Brother's is not as good as a similar place on Peoria... But it was decent. I would eat here again if driving by and in the mood for pizza. My Pepsi tasted fine. The girl who took my order was happy & pleasant. I got my soda topped off before I left and I got two sides of ranch at no charge... The only thing I was out off by was that I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the ranch because they were both half full which is why I needed two. If I had paid for them, I would have said something. I'm full, happy and ready for a nap... Oh! Need to show houses... I ordered the two slices of cheese and a Pepsi and my total was $4.38Um I went to the bathroom before leaving,.. The door didn't lock and toilet sprayed water (yes toilet water) at me and did not flush properly... Hopefully they get that fixed!
I live in the area so I've been to this bar a few times. I like the atmosphere, but the people who work there are a bit rude. The last time I went, they added tip to my single drink order and failed to mention that they had done so after I left them cash tip at the bar - same guy who ran my card/put in the order took the cash. I didn't feel the service  merited a $3 tip for a $7 drink. Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time I've had trouble with the service here.
I've tried so many things on the Sol menu and I still can't find anything that makes me come back for more. All of the margaritas I've had here had tasted like straight salt. Their quesadilla was bland but I'd prefer to eat it anywhere else and their chicken sandwich and fries are pretty forgettable. The service is okay.
2 starsThe pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  Who knew what he was saying about us?   He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  REALLY?The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  I'll leave it at that.  So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.If you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.We won't be returning.
The messages were great. Professionalism was just not good at all. The lady messaging my boyfriend phone rang 5 times during our session in messaging. Not to mention that his lady came in first and mine came in 5-10 minutes after. Cutting me short on time, as we "finished" both on time. As I was changing heading into the foot message area I was being hurried to put my clothes on to move rooms. Her exact words were "hurry please" as she's moving me out the room and I am still zipping my pants up. Also, in the middle of our messaging session, keep in mind we have paid already, they begin to upsale the hot stones to us. My boyfriend ended up getting them anyway as they didn't ask me. But honestly in my opinion I have already paid what messages we were having there was no need to upsale anything more. If you are coming here for the experience I totally do not recommend it.
I brought my kids to Vegas to experience the lights and glitter and during that time, take them to see some shows that wouldn't break my budget.  So, I purchased the tickets from Groupon and thought my kids would enjoy a magic show.  It was my daughter's 9th birthday and she was really excited to see a magician.  I have to agree that this was not the greatest show and quite disappointed on paying $100 for a family of 4.  You can see certain tricks being done, and personally, my husband, older daughter and myself were just bored.  I gave it 2 stars because my youngest enjoyed it a bit. It wasn't a mind blowing experience for her but rather, eh, it was ok.  The room was extremely small and the way the chairs were positioned were not the greatest.  If you're not sitting in the front center or even on the front row of the site aisle (where GA admission would sit), it's not a great view.Overall, I would suggest a different show or save your money.
Had dinner with my gf couple nights ago. The place itself looks very nice and elegant. However my gf's steak came out medium well when asked for a medium rare/rare. We were one of two couples eating at the time In the entire restaurant, I don't see how the steak could come out over. I had the rabbit pasta dish. Although good, it was not good enough for the price and quantity given.  I asked the waiter about the size of the dish because I was very hungry. He definitely exaggerated the size by at least double. I was given an appetizer amount of food that I finished in less than 10 bites. Once our bill came I noticed we were also charged for a glass of wine that we did not order. We had no wine at all that night.I would give them some time to get settled before going back for a second time.
PhoPros: piping hot, tender meat, hot jalapenosCons: bland broth, small portion of bean sproutsServiceWell, I was the only one there and it was fast and attentive.
I was disappointed in the way this practice handled the departure of our vet, Dr. Kolmstetter.  We were never alerted that she was changing practices, so when I found out, I was pretty upset. It's challenging to find a vet that specialized in exotics, so if there had been an emergency with our rabbit, Lulu, we'd have been screwed with no confidence in where to take her in North Vegas or if the vet would have experience with exotics. When I called to make an appointment is when I found out that Dr. K had left the practice. The staff on the phone when I called was very "oh well" about it. Despite their assertion that they could "maybe do a nail trim", I had no intention of bringing Lulu back there.I think you should notify your patients that their doctor is leaving your practice. It's your practice, so ultimately, they're YOUR patients.  If there had been an emergency, I'd have been in an even more stressful situation. That was disappointing.
Wow.  I've got to update my review.  We went to Mimi's Cafe for breakfast for the first time in quite some time.  So many things have changed, and I'm not just talking about the revised, blander menu.  We went on Memorial Day, a Monday, at around 9:30 a.m.  It wasn't very busy yet, so we were seated right away (by our server, in fact; I guess there was no host on duty yet).  There were tables scattered here and there with people, but nothing significant.  Our server was great.  He was very friendly and attentive...at least until it was time for the check and he was overwhelmed with the now-crowd of diners.  It looks like the kitchen and management are where the problems lie.  For breakfast, it took wayyyyyy too long for us to get our food (between 30-45 minutes), especially when the restaurant was not yet crowded.  We never once saw a manager; nobody when we walked in or out or walking the dining room to apologize for/correct the food delays.  And, sadly, the food was just average.  Gone are the days when a Mimi's breakfast stood out from the crowd.  My ham and cheese omelet was nothing special and looked sloppily assembled.  We could/should have just gone to IHOP for better, quicker food.  On a related note, it seems the Mimi's Cafes I used to go to in Orlando have closed due to poor service and a decline in food quality.  It looks like Charlotte's is not far behind.  We won't be back.p.s. The free wi-fi never worked for me either, which I wouldn't have noticed except we waited forever for our food.
I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past and they were all amazing.This location has some issues.THE PORTION SIZES ARE SO SMALL! I got stuffed mushrooms and they are usually about the size of quarters or larger. These were the size of dimes and burned. I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame.Great manager, but I won't return. I'll stick with the Chandler Mall.
Props for the free trip from Downtown to the Steelers game. Its a really good value for out of towners as the ride shares surge price.  There is absolutely no way the trains leaving the game are safe. Way too many people, no room to stand or hardly breathe. I get it there are like 20,000 people trying to get on the trains within 20 minutes of each other. So uncomfortable and has to be so over capacity.
Slow service and an overwhelmed kitchen. We cancelled 1/2 our order after waiting for an hour. They did deliver a pad Thai. Which was over seasoned and a congealed mass of rice noodles.
Way overpriced for okay food. Sorry, I was hoping it would be a new favorite spot but I'm going to have to pass on this one.
Came here for a friend's b day dinner. Currently writing this review as I wait for my server to pick up the payment for my check... it that's any hint as to how bad the service was, considering I have time to write it.  The food was DECENT, at that. The vibe and environment is beautiful. But NOT worth the prices at all. And not to mention, our service was incredibly SLOW, when our server was NOT busy. It's a Tuesday night. We had to ask for things several times before receiving. The whole table was almost finished eating before the birthday guy's food came out because our server never came back to check on us to know it was missing. We were here for TWO hours. 1 person ordered a drink, the rest of us has water, no appetizers or desert and this still took this long. It sucks when you pay a large amount for crappy service and sub par food..... Don't waste your time!
If this past visit 1/29 was my first time - this might have gotten less stars. I hate hate hate giving bad reviews and I always try to seek out the things I like rather than the things I don't like - but I had a real "boner kill" experience this past time. I have gone here a few times in the past and had no problems and felt like everything was so quality. Today my boyfriend and I go after a long day and I order my fave - barn burner (add avocado) with zucchini and an extra little cup of ranch. We get our food, no avocado or extra ranch. Oh well, not a big deal! I check my receipt to triple check I paid for it - there it is! 1 x avocado $0.99! I go up to the front thinking it would be no big deal. I tell the sweet waitress, Erica, that I didn't get any avocado and ask if I can have some in a condiment cup. She says yes, asks the guy that's closest to her in the kitchen. He accuses me of lying, berates Erica and tells her he knows he put it on my burger. This dude must have issues - why the heck is he making a scene, saying I'm lying and being rude to his coworker? I am so caught off guard by this. I look at Erica and tell her I'll show her my burger and my receipt. I do. She apologize and grabs me my dang avocado. Bottom line: waitress was so nice, food is good, cook guy is weird and I don't want to go to this location again. Food is 5/5 quality but cook guy 0/5
Not a typical Hilton Property. Let's start with checkin, went to the counter that had Hilton Honors sign and rug only to be ignored by Tia. Then she said rudely I'm not even signed in but yet she proceeded to ignore us for 5 minutes. The proper thing to do would have been acknowledge us and say someone will be with you in a moment. The only clerk working proceeded to help someone who came in after us. Then the "managers reception" was poorly stocked and was crackers, fruit and popcorn. Very disappointed will be letting Hilton Honors know. As a Silver member this is not typical of their properties usually.
I had high hopes for Reyna. My family and I have been to the Hatch chili pepper festival for the past 2 years and really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Although the food was good at Reyna the customer service left a lot to be desired. We got a table quickly but waited more than 20 minutes for anyone to even take our drink order. Then my husband got the wrong dish. It was really a bummer. I will try it again and I do hope they get the service thing figured out
J'adore tous les types de thé et je me suis laissée tentée par les dégustations offertes en magasin. Il est vrai que tous les thés dégustés sont sucrés, ce qui est dommage, sauf un thé vert très rare et dispendieux. Le vendeur était très insistant et voulait  vraiment vendre, mais comme il m'avait fait le tour du magasin et bien expliqué ses produits, j'ai finalement acheté un mélange sans caféine Rêve Tranquille. Tous les prix sont affichés et pour une quantité de 50 g.  Le mien m'a coûté un peu plus de 5,00$.J'avoue que cela revient cher, et je n'achèterai pas tous mes thés ici, mais pour se gâter à l'occasion ou pour faire un cadeau, c'est très bien. Et ce mélange de tisane est très bon et relaxant avant d'aller me coucher!
The car was fine. The service was fine. My complaint is I got a confirmation email telling me the car was waiting for me.  So, naturally, I assumed that meant I could go out to the garage and they'd have the car ready to go... (I'm Platinum w them btw.)  I got out to the garage and was informed I had to drag my stuff back into the terminal and wait through a line 10 people deep.  Ugh!  My suggestion Enterprise (as if they're really listening to this feedback) is to change the email reminder to explicitly tell people they have to stop at the counter first.
It's a NICE center bar, but it's still just a center bar.  My friends and I have been here quite a few times, and it's great that there's no cover for a spot that seems very loungy, but the drinks are ridiculously overpriced.  I paid $12 for a Crown Royal & coke, which is more than I paid for the same cocktail at one of Mandalay Bay's clubs.  Pass.
Stopped by the Checkers on Las Vegas Boulevard for the one day only sale of their All-American Cheeseburger for $.69 regular priced $1.19. Might have been the worst hamburger I ever had.
Beautiful grounds. Friendly staff. Average beds. Uncomfortable bedding and FLAT pillows resulting in terrible sleep. I expect more from such an expensive and beautiful hotel. Seems no thought was put in to offering pillow options for different sleepers. Won't come back.
Every now and again we have a craving for Church's chicken however your craving is only as good as the last meal that you got there.  Some of the chicken pieces that we got you could tell the chicken came from an old chicken.  Seriously! You know when you get a young fresh chicken as opposed to a chicken that was up in age.  Also the fries were over crispy bordering on burnt. So no more cravings for Church's chicken. Craving has been satisfied.
Bridlewood Mall is just another one of those neighbourhood malls from around the 70s. It's a little dingy and dated, but it also has a few good points. Jennifer K.'s review touched upon most of them, but she left out one crucial point: THE BURGER PALACE. It can be found upstairs right outside Price Chopper. This place is a total gem, and if I recall what I've heard correctly, it's been in this mall from the start. People, if you somehow find yourself in this mall, go there. They serve the greatest onion rings you will ever taste.Overall, if you're just looking for the basics and have no interest in clothes, you may enjoy Bridlewood Mall... but if you're looking for excitement, this is not the place.
Faux-exposed brick?  Fuck you, Brocach.  Small menu but the food's pretty decent.update: I can't get an appertizer at 4 PM?  As the kids say "omgwtf?!"
This place is hit or miss depending on who's working, and tonight was a miss.  Pizza Nova is by far the best chain pizza store, and they're usually pretty consistent, but this place is the worst one I've ever frequented.  The pizza tonight tasted almost like nothing.  Not sure why the couple who own the place refuse to put more than an ounce of sauce on the pizza, but that's what you basically get from them.  You dont even taste the sauce, that's how little they put.  The lack of sauce throws off the whole balance of what a pizza is, so all you taste is dough, cheese, and toppings.  It's more like a sandwich with no condiments than a pizza.  We didn't even bother finishing the whole thing, which is unheard of in our household, that's how bland it was.  If there was a better option in the area I wouldn't bother with this place, sadly there isn't.
This is the slowest Starbucks that I've been to, drive thru and going inside . Service wasn't that great either.  The batista was too busy making another employees drinks while I waited 10 minutes for mine, and it wasn't even busy
My favorite Mexican sushi spot (mocorito) was closed so I figured this would be just as good. All Mexican sushi is the same right? Wrong. Although this sushi appeared identical to my favorite spot, it was completely lacking flavor. For that reason alone, I don't think I will return. It was really that flavorless and a waste of $30. No issues with customer service the food just sucked.
Went back after four years of boycotting due to hair in lemonade. Skipped the drink and got a sandwich to go w  fries. Tipped 20 percent for takeout order. Get back to office- they didn't give me my sauce or ketchup for fries. So check your meal before you leave the joint.
Service was good. Pho broth was bland. Price is above average compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. They have a special vegetarian section on the menu. This joint is a one and done for me.
I love Indian cuisine and have tried a few in the area but this was my first time here. . I ordered at 745 and was told the wait for my carry out order would be 35 minutes.  When I arrived, I was told I was "early" when in fact It was 5 minutes early.  I then waited an additional 20 minutes.  I ordered the Chicken Makani amd the Palek Paneer.  The chicken was all gristle and had bones and skin and there were literally 5 small pieces of chicken in it which was of very Poor quailty compared to others I've had  The sauce had a good flavor though.  The Palek Paneer lacked flavor and was also lacking Paneer, which for $13.00 should've been more of it!  I will not be going back to Tadka.
Went here during the Monday $15/dozen special. Oysters were good however each oyster had tiny shell fragments inside. Whoever shucked the oysters probably rushed them since we only waited a few minutes to receive an order of two dozen oysters.I would have given this place four stars, but after eating each oyster my friend and I spent a few seconds picking pieces of shells out of our mouths.
Visited this spot with a hungry stomach & a friend who wanted eggs. When walking in we didn't know if we seated ourselves or waited to sit down. The register is by the door & that specific space was a little cramped because so many people were coming into buy bread. The rest of the place is sort of small but lots of tables to sit at. When sitting down I quickly looked at yelp & wish I had taken the time out to actually read the reviews & know I should have tried the custard. However, the only thing I saw was that customer service was not too great so I was curious to see how our visit was going to be. Staff were so so. Not super friendly but friendly to their regulars. We ordered our beverages, me an apple juice & my friend a coffee & it honestly took a while to get to our table. We both got the omelet with Portuguese sausage & I added mushrooms to mine. The plate came with 4 huge slices of bread which was good & the omelet wasn't something I favored. The omelet was basic, I just overall wasn't impressed. I wish I had taken the time to read reviews & try their custard as people recommend & maybe then I would have had a different experience.
I just met the dentist for a few minutes, so honestly cannot review her.  I'm actually writing this review in regards to the X-Ray Tech. Going to the dentist is tough for me, because of the pain, but I should not of experienced pain for 2 days after the Tech, Dakota, (or close to that name) did the X-Ray,  At one time she jammed the plastic material down on the bone of the inner part of my mouth,  totally brought tears to my eyes. Could not believe how my mouth hurt for days after.  Have not returned.  To bad the dentist has to suffer because of her techs.
I live in the neighbourhood, so I also wanted to like the place.  The first time I dropped in was for a take-away Nespresso/ espresso coffee, which was quite good.  The second time I came by for a take-away salad, which was ok.  To my taste, most of the salads feature poorly combined ingredients, as if disregarding taste, someone randomly selected trendy ingredients like caramelized pecans to throw in with what-have-you.I considered exploring other things on the menu during their half-price evening specials, but discovered that it was only dine-in.  The ambiance doesn't really appeal to me, especially if it gets busy, so I didn't bother.Then, a breakfast special sign appeared in the window:  bottomless coffee, eggs, toast for $5.99.  No bacon or sausage.  Not the best of deals, but still convenient and good.  And mornings were not too crowded, before the high school students descend.  I found the breakfast to be a good start to the day, and the endless coffee was good and strong and dark-roast.  Even the music was ok.  For the price, I was willing to disregard the atmosphere with the big-screen tv and the smell of Pine-Sol permeating the place and interfering with my tastebuds.Regular breakfasts are just ok. I tried an omelette once which was overcooked.  I had the Huevos Rancheros another time and quite enjoyed that.  I don't quite know how it is possible, but much of the food doesn't have flavour.And then, they installed the sliding windows-- which is great-- but they removed the tables at the front windows and replaced them with sofa chairs and wee drink tables: I don't get it.  The breakfast special is gone.  The coffee has now become medium roast acidic diner stuff. The music is now AM radio.  I asked for extra salsa with my meal and was charged for it.I won't be back.  The things that I was enjoying have disappeared, and the sum of what is left is not worth the experience to me.  The place seems uncertain as to what it wants to be and to whom.
Our insurance company had Hertz pick us up at car repair shop which was close and nice! The car they gave me was dirty inside and out! I washed and vacuumed it myself and covered the seats with a blanket because of the smell and stains.
One of my favorite places to shop , always very friendly However sales person in designer shoes made us feel like 2nd rate citizens Purchased a pair of Prada sneakers for my daughter Thought maybe it was just me that thought sales person treated us like  we did not belong there Asked my daughter and  she felt exactly the same It is my first time shopping there where someone made me feel very uncomfortable We were not just window shopping We came in for the Prada sneakers Anyway we were very excited walking in there Not so much when we left She might have had a bad day Still no excuse to act "snotty"
I ordered a lap top battery from the site and you got a 10% discount to pick up in store. Then I get a call. They don't have the battery and need to look for it. Then I get a call the battery is nowhere in the universe for some reason and they offered my money back. My question is WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU OFFER IT ON THE SITE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BATTERY? What a waste of time.
Trying to be an indie hole-in-the-wall, but it's really just another run-of-the-mill corporation style coffee shop. Instead of this lackluster establishment, go around the building to Souper Market: delicious, simple, and understated.
They had my husband waiting over FOUR HOURS to fix a cracked screen. Turns out the took so long because they FORGOT!!! They didn't even give a discount or anything for their mistake!!
Stars are because of the product. Lack of stars is for the customer service. When we walked in noone greeted us. I could see a lady (redhead) watching us through the door yawning then eventually came out front. She came out with an attitude like we interrupted their fun in the back. And I just found a hair in my bowl and just asked for our money back. Anyways back to the female employee. No customer service and was rude. When our bowls were done...she just said "here you guys are" and left our bowls on the counter not telling us which one was which. We had 3 bowls total in our group. If you dont like your job im sure there are other people who need a job and will make customers experience more pleasant. The other girl (blonde) was great as well as the assistant manager. This was our 2nd visit to this location and unfortunately our last. Just expected more especially from this location due to the type of clientele.
Came here after soaking up the sun in the Aria where we were staying in las vegas.  We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.So for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.

Like most other reviewers have said. This place for their featured Bon Bon drinks are definitely overpriced $12.99. I got the strawberry Bon Bon...Bottom is strawberry slush (made with syrup and ice), fresh strawberries and whip cream. Would I come back again? Maybe not.
Most disappointing meal of my week-long trip to Vegas!  Wish I hadn't gone.  Actual food quality was 4 stars, but minus 2 stars for being CRAZY over-priced for the quality ($85-$90 per person without alcohol).  I felt pretty ripped off spending such money for food that is barely better than mall pan-asian food.  Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle "soup" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.  Admittedly, those were the low-points -- much of the food was decent enough -- but I felt ripped off after paying over $400 bucks for my family of five.
Well all i can say is their Gyros are sub par and their rice pilaf is bland and bleh.  The gyro is Kronos brand, didnt mean anything to me until today, but future places i will ask.  The meat did not look fresh cut... rounded edges.  I dont see what people like about this place.  Have they never left town and visited a good greek place?  Find another is my advice.  Granted all i tried was the gyro but it was bad enough to not return.  My wife said the tziki sauce was also deploreable.  Advice... go elsewhere.
Paid $20 each to see Ron Pope last night.  Went early to get some food.  Heard good things about it.   Got table.  No one came to help us so we went to the bar and got our own beers.   Finally waitress came over and we ordered some tacos.   I ordered another beer.  After 20 minutes no beer,,,,so I went to the bar and got another.  After 30 minutes we asked about the food, she said kitchen was busy.  After 40 minutes and seeing 30 people eat that had gotten there after us, we asked her what was up.  She finally went to the kitchen and came back and said oops something happened.   She promised the tacos in 5 minutes.   20 minutes later, a full hour after we ordered the tacos, we split.   Never even saw the concert.   Cool place.   Liked the trivia and vibe but service was Ridic.
We attend events here frequently and usually  always  have a great experience.  Today we ordered their boneless  wings, large order $16.99...very disappointed  as we got about 20 small nuggets (size of a quarter)and 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery  sticks. Not worthy of  the price Thank goodness we had a great server/bartender Wilfred who made it a memorable girls lunch experience with his great customer  service and understanding,  even with  our complaints he kept his big smile and extra celery and carrot sticks. Jessica and Nora
Service is not consistent. First time we went, service was acceptable and food was great. Second time was 7:30pm on a Thursday. We walked in and it took a full 2 minutes for the hostess to finish her conversation of gossip with a waitress before even acknowledging us. Then proceeds to tell my husband and I the wait is 35 minutes.   That kind of wait at 7:30 on a Thursday tells me they are not efficient. Not sure if I will return
I thought the lunch was $17.99 but during the weekend it is all day dinner price for $24.99 per person.  The only difference between dinner and buffet is that you get only one order of short ribs and one or two other item.  That is a rip.  This is not a self serve buffet, where you get you own meat.  You have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you. The problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another.  The items they have are very limited.The reason why I gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat .  Also I am Asian.  Just like most Asians, I eat a lot of rice, especially with all you can eat meat buffet. I don't know of any Asian culture where you get more meat than rice. After I requested a second bowl of rice the waitress actually warned me that she will have to charge me for an extra bowl.  What the What. And this is a SMALL bowl of rice. it is less than 8 ounces. How can you eat hot and spicy foods with out rice.  This might be worth it for $12.99 but not for $17.99 or $24.99. It is not worth it. I hate going to a restaurant and feeling ripped off and I felt ripped off here.
To the young lady working last night with no name tag on, speak up, speak clearly, do not walk away from a sick, tired costumer. If you were having a bad night, ok, but your behavior was unacceptable.The first girl was nice, still messed my insurance up, but it was fixed eventually by the girl previously mentioned, (good try at redeeming yourself.)Pharmacist - thanks for pointing out I was right about being allergic to the meds the urgent care prescribed. Good call.
Sad news for Bagel lovers. This place has closed.  They are converting to a healthy shake joint. I will always remember the discount bagel rack. Farewell.
I have very mixed feelings about this place. The staff can be rude- sometimes youre stuck standing around not knowing who to talk to while the staff chats with their friends - which you cant tell apart. Sometimes, youre greeted by someone right away.Their staff turn around here is..alarming. I've never had the same piercer twice. When I ask about ____ who did mine (or a friends ) last time, they will say they no longer work there - this has happened with 3 or 4 different piercers, all within a year.I got my vertical labret pierced here a year ago, and it was wonderful. The girl who did it was sweet,and spent a solid 20 minutes making sure it was at a proper angle - asking me to make different facial expressions to see how it would sit. My navel was a whole other experience. The girl (Ash i believe?) was rushing us, and not very nice. she marked it and didnt give me a chance to check it out in the mirror - which ended up being VERY crooked. She also pierced it too deep(length wise), and the jewelry she put in was subsequently too short and has made healing extremely difficult. I had to go through the (painful) experience of getting it changed at another shop. She also was quite offensive when I asked why she wasnt using clamps. She said "GOOD piercers dont need clamps, and a GOOD piercer knows theyre dangerous." Like she was insulted i had asked. Sorry, but all of my other piercings at this shop had clamps used so I was confused? Overall very hit and miss. I have a perfect vertical labret from them, and a crooked too-tight navel.
Pad thai, tahini, parsnip, olive, mustard, vinegar, everything bagels - the list goes onnnnn.  Some fun and some strange ingredient combinations, the gelato flavours here are constantly changing.  Personally I think some of the sweet and savoury combos are a little too weird for me and I didn't enjoy my scoop which was keffir lime, buffalo yogurt and honey. I also taste tested a saffron, red peppercorn and ginger flavour.  Really weird :(  Not for everyone, but major points for originality.
I've  been coming here for close to 15 years... every time it gets worse. Food that used to be awesome, has gown seriously downhill and so has the service. We wont be back.
I'm not sure what to make of the previous review as this Panera looks exactly like every other.  However, what sets this one apart is the poor service.  The 'kids' working here are not trained sufficiently and spend more time socializing with co-workers and same-age customers than they spend serving the other customers, cleaning  or stocking.Most recently we ordered a dozen bagels sliced, and we received 11 with just barely the tops cut.  The young man waiting on us apparently didn't  know how to use the slicer, and instead of asking someone for assistance, he sent us home with these bagels that are a mess and don't fit in the toaster, because we have one extra fat half, and the other wafer thin with just the topping.This isn't the first time we've experienced issues like this at this Panera.  It seems the whole staff could use additional training.  Also, this store is generally not cleaned as well as others we've visited.
very good coffee, but breakfasts are horrible there, avoid the huevos rancheros the refritos were dried out on the stale tortilla and eggs were cold by the time they served them.  I still pop in for coffee and a cookie from time to time, just won't do hot food there bleh!
This place could be great! But rushed execution and somewhat not very fresh ingredients basically render it into one of the countless fast food locations where food is just "ok". Souvlaki tastes like it was cooked a couple days ago and just reheated today - chewy and almost no flavour. Veggies are stale.
Well disappointed with the selection at the buffet, I knew we should have gone to the cafe instead. Waited on a refill on my soda and didn't see the waitress in awhile. Just as we were about to leave she shows up with a fresh Pepsi . I'm never coming back here
too expensive for shit food , five guys is way better even McDonald's is better than what I just had . didn't even come with fries and paid 16$ bucks for a burger and a small ass shake . never coming back .
This was my first Artia's experience.  Very under-welhelming. Being a vegetarian, thisplace was not vegetarian friendly.  The Tomato Vodka penne was like...meh.  It had only a few sprigs of spinach and the tomato sauce was too sweet.  It tasted like it cameout of a jar (it probably did).  It would be helpful to list vegetarian selections on the menu so I wouldn't have to ask the server.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back to Atria's...since there are all the same.
So lets begin with the fact that this review is due to the performance of a single employee at this location who ruined the entire experience. a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out "no!!!'" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said "what?" thats what you ordered." I looked at her and said, "no, he said guacamole." and the dialogue continued...chipotle girl- "do you want me to take it off?"fiance -"yes please that would be great"CG- "there its off" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)fiance - "can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?"instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.CG - "its fine the way it is"Last time i check its not your call as to if its "fine" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say "oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy"the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism. I know it seems silly but I was really upset by it.
This place could use some substantial improvement.The first time I tried to go was over a year ago.  The waiter in front told me to go in the back...and the waiter in the back told me to go to the front.  It is very insulting when you're a single diner and you see through how much they don't want you there, so I left.I gave this place a second chance today.  The seating was not very good.  I had the misfortune of seeing the waitress clean the Korean BBQ grill with me there and that was not an appetizing sight.  The seating area was also quite pathetic.  Because this place is linked with its next-door neighbour, the Chinese restaurant Made in China (they share staff, so they are probably owned by the same people), Korean Grill House's front seating area is tiny, cramped, and looks very unattractive, which detracts from the dining experience.I ordered one of the lunch combinations, lamb chops with BBQ chicken, pork and beef.  The order took a little while to get there, but it was acceptable.  The food was a wildly erratic bunch.  The rice was great (fat grains, like in sushi), and the pork chops and chicken chunks were both seasoned perfectly.  The beef was half a step below, but still pretty good.  The problem was with the centerpiece of the dish.  The lamb didn't smell the greatest, and as anybody who's cooked lamb can tell you, there's skill in getting rid of the specific smell of the meat.  And Korean Grill House failed.  The lamb wasn't tender (which is surprising -- lamb is usually tender by nature), and the worst part is that it's very, very greasy.  This evening, a good seven or eight hours after eating the meal, I'm still tasting some residue stale lamb grease in my throat, and that's not a good thing.I'd say, go to Made in China instead.  Cheaper food, faster service, better surroundings.
Average. Fresh but lacks flavor in a major way. Ribeye was 32$ and it wasn't worth it. Won't be back unfortunately.
We decided on short notice to try the new Ditka's. We went with friends on a Saturday shortly after it opened. It was disappointing. The building was updated from the Atria's that was there before, but only superficially. It was still the high ceiling, open room, not the dark wood, intimate setting you expect and pay for at an upscale steak place. The food was okay, but not consistent with the high prices. We had crab cake appetizers and seafood pasta as entres. We ordered a 'shareable' spicy hash browns side which was decent but far too small to be shareable.There was no bread offered or served. The server was never around, hurried, ran by throwing our drinks when passing by; overall pretty rough around the edges. The wine list was very limited and poorly designed. The only thing consistent with an upscale steak house was the prices. Some of the problems are fixable, some not. Too bad - we could use a good steak house out here.
Took entirely too long bring drinks, serve food, bring check.  No water refills, salad was too big and entree was too small.  This was for lunch and the place seemed to be severely understaffed. There was even a guy who sat down, and lost his patience and left after waiting for the waitress to stop by.Food was okay though.
They are fairly quick, so thats always a plus for lunch. Their sandwich is pretty standard and theres nothing really special about it. The bread is pretty soft. They don't cut the sandwich either which is kinda weird. It's just one long sub.
A friend decided to try Heist for a brunch get together. I was not familiar with their brunch set up and imagined a typical brunch menu. We were told we could eat at the buffet and order one entrée from their brunch menu. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Yelp that I even knew they had an omelet and waffle station... Our waitress seemed to have a slight attitude ... she didn't notify us, well at least my section of the table (there were around 12 of us )  of additional stations. When our table asked for clarification of entrees  on the menu she had even more of an attitude. I can't find the brunch menu online so I will do my best to describe my entree. It was a layer of French fires, a short rib, egg and then white bbq sauce layered in a bowl. It wasn't clear that this would all come in one bowl and essentially mixed together so when I read the description of the fried egg I asked to have it scrambled. The waitress then told me she can't guarantee that they can scrambled it ... to which I asked her if she could go ask .. instead of telling me she can't guarantee it. My friends ordered Mimosa's and felt as if they weren't coming frequently enough for the price. Another friend ordered an entrée without pork and then even asked the server when he dropped it off if it had pork twice and he said no ... the dish had pork in it. Another friend waited almost 30 mins to receive her food. That was her last straw with the service we received so we asked to speak to manager. Everybody in our party which included around 12 people received half off our bill. Now granted we were a large party and some people came in almost 30 mins after our original start time , I think that the service could have been better.I'm glad that the manager rectified the situation , but I don't know if I would go back from brunch. On a positive note the buffet was pretty good but it would have been nice to know that I could have gotten an omelet and waffle. I would like to try their lunch menu that looks way more appetizing than what I had for brunch.
Located inside the Dundas Square AMC building 3rd floor food court.  There were escalators going up the stairs, but we couldn't find the down escalator so we took the elevator down.The food is cheap, but so is the taste.  I got a Combo #1 (one meat + one vegetable) for $7.  The quantity is generous.  I got steamed rice with the pepper pot steak.  The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled "Carribean" on their receipt on purpose when it's supposed to be 2 b's instead of 2 r's.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.  They had jerk chicken and assorted other meat dishes.  I also tried the fried plantain, which was sweet but could be softer.  The food court wasn't too busy and there were plenty of seating.
This place had us pretty impatient the whole time! I shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! It then took a half an hour to split the bill. To be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.
A crepe place with savoury as well as sweet options. The service was a little brusque. The savoury creeps are not worth the visit. Spinach and egg very overcooked on both fronts. Overdone spinach and solid and meagre egg. When the waiter took the leftovers away and asked about it, we expressed to him our poor opinion about it and he walked off without responding.
The food is good but definitively overpriced. If you compare with a place such as smoke, the tako are about 50% more expensive for the same quality (in my opinion). The place itself is very noisy and this is almost impossible to really discuss. The service pressures you to order, which is very inconvenient when you want to take your time. Finally, the drinks prices are ok but the size of some is totally ridiculous ...So, yep, the food is good but when going there, I was feeling I am paying the price for the hype, not for the food ...
Food was good ... Service was inattentive and slow.  We were a party of 10 ... Lack of attention from the servers got way more air time in the conversation than it should have.
Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  Why a twenty minute range for pickup?  I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.  Hilarious!
I've been very pleased with my experience at this store. I haven't had a bad sharpening here, and the goalie guru (Kevin?*) has been fantastic. I went in once to try on leg pads, and even though I told him that I absolutely wasn't going to be buying anything that day, he spent a good 30 minutes with me. Other employees have also been very helpful with one exception.The exception: on two separate occasions the same employee has given me inaccurate information. Both times I was looking at some dirt cheap entry level catching gloves. Both times this guy has come up and told me that it's an incredible deal on top of the line gear. Now if you know anything about goalie gear, you know that there's a HUGE difference between a $150 entry level glove on a clearance rack and a $450 top of the line glove. I don't know if he was intentionally BSing or just clueless. I'd be really angry if I bought a piece of crap thinking it was a steal because a salesman lied or made things up.(*Edit: His name is Justin, and he's incredibly helpful! Sorry, Justin.)______________________________________________________________________________Edit: I'm knocking off two stars. I had two experiences at this store in the last few months that I was living in Madison that really soured me on the place. 1) I had them install a new pair of cowlings on my skates and they did a lousy job. There were two issues: 1) One of the cowlings was clearly pinched too tight. When I pointed this out, they referred to the fact that it was under warranty instead of trying to make it right. 2) A rivet in the other skate wasn't installed correctly. It sticks up a good quarter of an inch. This was a really, really obvious problem, and I'm deeply annoyed that they didn't get it right.2) I purchased a very pricy pair of knee guards. One of them burst a seam just a few months after I bought it, but fortunately it was under warranty from the company. I brought this to their attention and waited for a replacement. And waited. And waited. Months went by and nothing was happening. The manager assured me that they would get me a replacement as soon as possible. I assumed that the manufacturer was completely out of stock and that they were making their best efforts to secure the replacement. They weren't. I ended up moving to Pennsylvania and going into another Hockey Giant where I saw those exact same knee guards on display. Ultimately, the Madison store was able to transfer my credit, so I finally got the replacements that I'd waited so long for. It really pissed me off, though, that these knee guards existed in their system and that they didn't figure out a way to get me some in a timely manner.
Its a store with lots of variety. But for a 2nd hand shop, I found it ridiculously overpriced. A 3T snowsuit for $35-50! I got 3 sets of 2nd hand snow suits for only $15 each on kijiji and 1 set included some really good snow boots. If you want an actual store to buy from instead of kijiji, Prices are better at Goodwill, salvation army or value village.
Hate to say that I was not really impressed.  On the outside of the restaurant is a big sign that says "FUSION FOOD".  The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  I would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I'm still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  Heard the chef/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.I would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.  Consider share plates or chopstick holders as well so your customers have a place to put them rather than directly on the table.
I want to like this place. But the service is just too bad. Wish they take a little bit more pride in the place because it's just right down the street from my house on main street. The food is hit or miss. The salmon salad I got was a huge mess! Salmon tasted old, over seasoned, super thin, just iceberg lettuce and standard grocery store dressing. Avocado was fresh and yummy though. It was nice to have chips and salsa included. The salsa was great, but overall this place is not worth the risk with Nunthaporn across the street and the great Republica Empanada just down the street on Hibbert and first Avenue.
Not going to lie, it's gotten ratchet. The exam bed wasn't prepared, I'm not sure I even trusted that they wiped it down before we were showed to the room. Outdated looking vital equipment.  There was a sticky spot on the floor that kept bothering me. Just didn't seem to clean. There are discolored water spots on the ceiling right in the waiting room. The doctor completely brushed off my concerns or had any advice or referral for me. Like he was on auto pilot just going through the motions. Ive been taking my son to Pioneer since he was born. He's almost 6 and I think it's time to move on and find better or at least more informative care
Stopped in for a quick snack. Ordered a grilled cheese sammy with tomato on whole wheat. The sammy was pressed very flat and I normally expect the cheese to be traditionally warm and gooey. Far from it. It hit the spot though as I was quite hungry for a snack.
I don't know what people are talking about. Being from NJ I can tell you this is NOT good NY style pizza. It's the kind of pizza you get in NY and then never return to that place again. I tried the regular and the white pizza. The white pie had no flavor, no garlic no salt, nothing. The regular pie had hardly any sauce, and the crust was hard as a rock. I hope there are better places for "NY style" pizza in the area.  We left hungry. They also messed up our order so it took about twenty minutes to get four slices of pizza warmed up.Also they weren't wearing gloves or anything. Maybe I'm a stickler but I don't like people touching my food with their hands and then touching everything else in the kitchen. Gross.
I tried this place for the last time. Ive been here several times and everytime its never the same price and the people dont know the price they always have to call someone (the owner i assume) and clarify what price was agreed upon. When the guy asked do u want oil and hot stone he never said it would be $10 extra. Umm for you to rub a hot stone and oil on my back for an extra 3 1/2 minutes , im good thanks SKIP. Such a rip off. Dont go just because its convenient.
The 2 ladies working here were very nice. The soup I ordered was very good. I ordered a sandwich to go and was surprised to see it was wrapped in plastic wrap. Sandwiches wrapped in plastic makes rolls rubbery as well as making the sandwich soggy when the sandwich has mayo, mustard, tomatoes etc. anything with liquid (if not eaten right away). I hope they change this to a paper wrap because the ham was good but by the time I got to eat my sandwich it was rubbery and soggy.
Wanted to try out a new nail place, and wish I wouldn't have. The only reason for 2 stars is because of the polish colors, so many to chose from. I got a gel manicure. If you can even conifer me having a manicure. I wasn't asked if I wanted my nails cut or filed, wasn't asked what shape. I got a quick file down. I came home and filed where they were I ever and where the polish was on the sides of my nails. Again, the only male in there who dis my nails.I will not be back.
Dr. BeeCroft is great, but unfortunately you will never know what your charged until the bills start rolling in. Every time I go, I'm told what is and isn't covered and then get bills with mysterious charges that they can never explain. Oh, this was put in a wrong day, oh well I guess it wasn't covered like we thought. Serious!? As much as I like Dr B, I will be finding a dr with more competent staff.
Really bad first time experience here.  The prices are great, until you realize the cashier did not apply the sale price on nearly every item.  Paid 10 for lasagna that was priced at 5, 4 for potatoes that was priced at 2, and 7 for guac that was priced at 3.  Had to wait 20 mins at customer service just to get 7 dollars back.  Pretty sure we overpaid for a bunch of other items too just didn't have time to check everything in the car.  Not sure if the cashier was sleeping on the job and just didn't see the sale tag or its common practice for this grocery chain to overcharge customer's. Bad bad bad.
Just left here. Came to pick up an online order with my work colleague.  Servers were friendly but did not have good organization. You could tell it was very chaotic. The pick up time was for 12:15 pm, but food wasn't ready, so they asked us to sit at the bar.  We were offered water, but got it at the end of waiting...  Then a tall server with nose rings came with our orders to go in two bags. He READ the order out from the receipt correctly and handed them to us.  I checked my bag once I walked out and of course food was missing from the order! Wow, after reading it??? He's like oh sorry! That's what happens when you don't do things yourself.." Then when he brought the rest of my order, the truffle fries were cold and hard.  Food taste wasn't bad (the burger), but food should be served hot especially if the order was already incorrect.Wont be back!  Yikes, what a surprise.
Ouch. What happened between opening weekend and Labor Day weekend?  We had a great time on opening weekend, so much so we bought season passes. This weekend was TERRIBLE!  Sure there were more people, but the staff was rude. I actually got yelled at by an 18 year old life guard (as a 40 year old father) for standing too close to a railing. Meanwhile, no one gave a crap about the fact some teenagers stole my kids' $6.50 rented rafts from their hands in the wave pool. Later when we went to complain and get new rafts, the line was so long we just gave up and went home. I ate a reasonably priced $7.99 cheeseburger meal with fries and a medium Pepsi, but the meat was so terrible I couldn't finish it. It was insult to injury as they only had four of the eight order windows open, so it took forever to order, even though they had staff inside standing around doing nothing. Maybe it's just normal kinks they have to work out each year with new staff, but I'm pretty pissed about buying season passes now. Pick it up Big Surf, management 100% to blame today!
I came here with a coupon that I got from work that basically gave me 25 dollars off, that alone may have saved them a star.  The place was touristy and expensive.  I don't mind paying high dollar for food, but it better be good.  I ordered a three item combo for 18.00!  There was about 2 tablespoons of beans and rice (tasted like box rice) and they were both gross.  My chicken enchilada possibly was the worse I ever had.  The chicken seemed to be a grilled breast that they rolled into a tortilla and put canned sauce on it. Huge chunks of dry chicken does not make for tasty Mexican food.  The taco was ok but greasy and the taquitos was drenched in crema.  I am so glad that I had a coupon because if I paid 52 dollars for that pig slop I would have been pissed.
A few of their classes are good. Run down equipment and the weights in the fitness room are falling apart. What really set me over the edge was them cancelling their body pump. Les Mills classes cost gyms money to keep certified and I'm concerned the gym is facing money problems. I'm all for small businesses and all but I had to be done.
This used to be my favorite place to get prime rib. We always shared it with others as the place locals go and you have to get over the run down look outside because when you go to the coffee shop you are going to get a good meal. Today they made a liar out of me. I started with their clam chowder that had so much grease in it I couldn't finish it. Then the prime rib was tough and so was the steak my husband got. And if that wasn't bad enough, apparently you have to be a regular customer to get good and friendly service. Our waitress stopped by the tables next to us multiple times and their drinks always stayed filled. My husband's soda was filled once, but my water glass stayed empty for at least 10 minutes before I finally flagged someone down to fill it. He also brought us a box for our leftover food. We had to flag down our waitress and ask for our check. We had discussed dessert, but gave up the thought when we realized it wasn't even going to be offered. Once we asked for the check, she quickly gave it to us and wished us a good day. When we approached the register, one cashier was counting her till and the other said she would help us and asked for our check. She quickly processed our check and wished us a good day barely looking up from the register and never looking at our faces. When she handed the receipt to us with one hand, she was taking the check from the next customers with the other hand. It was clear that good food and good service are no longer a priority. I guess it is time to find a new and better place for the locals.
Sip offers a choice if you are with a group and Connor decide if you want coffee or beer. As the name implies, you can get both here!The coffee for my taste, was ok, just not to my tastes. The beer choices looked decent enough to satisfy most.They have a limited food menu, but I did not try any.There are tables both inside and out, where you can get some work done. However, My one suggestion with Sip and most other coffee houses, is the lack of outlets. I realize adding outlets can be expensive, so run some cords!
There is a nice selection of original items for babies, plenty of maternity wear and nursing bras- though very pricey.The snacks such as banana bread and carrot bread were fine but nothing special. The ingredients are not written on the packaging -  so not great for those with allergies. The play areas for babies and toddlers looked as though they had not been cleaned in a while which was probably the biggest turn off. Overall it seems as though there is potential but it is not a place I would return to anytime soon, nor would I recommend it just yet.
Don't stay here if you plan on having diarrhea!!!!  It took the toilet eight flushes to get everything down.  Meanwhile, the shower didn't have any hot water.  We called to have it fixed and they said they would fix it but they didn't.  After our 2nd call they said they'd take one night of hotel fees off our bill.  The beds were comfortable, the couple I was staying with said they could hear our neighbors through the wall but I didn't.  The hotel is cute, the Flamingo garden is awesome.  The buffet was the worst I've had in Vegas (compared to Luxor and Excaliber.)  I wouldn't stay here again.
This tropical smoothie definitely needs some work. The store is completely deserted, including the employees! I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone came out from the back. The employee that did take my order definitely did not want to be here. Even though the store is completely empty my smoothie also took a while to finally come out, along with 3 hidden employees I might add. What they are working on besides hiding out in the back is beyond me. The smoothie... leaves little to be desired. The smoothie is very watery and doesn't taste fruity at all. Honestly tastes like I'm drinking crushed ice. Please take this opportunity to train your employees or the place might stay this empty indefinitely. 2 stars for having ice cold a/c in this blazing heat.
If you plan to have lots of errands in a day... Do not try to go to DMV. (Specifically here by Sahara.) the long wait is absurd. I guess bcos it's one of the busiest dmv here in Vegas? Idk. But the volume of people waiting in line is just huge. Though they have a big area for seats, it's just not enough to accommodate all most all people coming in. It's like 1:10 coming in. Customer service is a little low for a fact some of the staffs will really just yell out of the blue like can you guys just use an intercom or something? But over all there all helping these tons of people.  Hoping for a better and bigger DMV Sahara.
So much MSG, oil, and salt! We felt so gross afterwards that we immediately went to Smith's to stock up on fruits/veggies for a raw food/juicing diet. True story.We ordered:1) Duck Fried Rice--It was so salty! I felt like they poured in a cup of soy sauce and spoonfuls of msg into that dish. Don't get me wrong, our tastebuds were overjoyed from all the flavor. But is all that flavoring really necessary? I guess that's how some people like their food cooked though; it's just not for us. I think it would've been perfect had they just cut back on all the oil and soy sauce and even left out the msg.2) Vegetable Stir-fry--Half of our stir-fry dish was made up with rice. They gave us the tiniest portion of vegetables. Like the fried rice, I felt like the stir-fry was just cooked in a ton of hoisin sauce/msg/soy sauce/salt.3) Thai Iced Coffee--Too sweet! I think they added sugar on top of the condensed milk because that was the sweetest iced coffee I have ever had.Service was decent. Even though we came at a busy hour, the waitresses were still attentive to us and quick with our orders.Our total meal came out to be $22 including tax/tip.
Frequent slow/inaccurate orders.  This is not one of the better valley locations.  Metro center is the one to beat.  On my two of my three visits here, its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order.  One of those two visits they did it incorrectly, and I had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake.  Another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar.  It ran like it was vinagerette.  I've mentioned the services issues to their manager.  First time they only apologized, never gave me reason to come back.  After three tries with this location, I'll stick with Metro center.
Drinks okay.Service? *blows raspberry*How is it that table service is better service here & I'm sitting at the bar right in front of you, BLATANTLY done with my food/drink & I can't get my bill in a timely fashion?!I don't understand.Must be a thing...I'll keep it at that.
this place just looks super cute. has that old town feel but not really worth going to unless you are grabbing some desert to go.came here for lunch a few months ago..not impressed with the food. with so many places to go around old town, i would say skip the food. nothing special.the service is also very ehhhit's more of a to-go dessert place if you are craving a sundae!  they have a decent selection of ice cream but it's very rich and a pint of ben and jerrys or haagen daaz will probably satisfy your craving (for cheaper too)
This Fionn was very odd. The service was ok, the food wasn't great. Had a huge group of friends here and then all of a sudden at 9pm, you see a lot of security start to appear and the place turns into a night club! It was very odd when we were all just trying to have a conversation here... did not expect that.
Oh Flamingo, you old bird. All you need is a good (bird) bath to clean your skanky carpets in the common areas, and fluff your feathers-- I mean, freshen up your rooms. I actually like the atmosphere in the Casino and shopping areas... folks are pretty friendly and there's a good vibe. But you need to be eating some new birdseed... and by that I mean, freshen up every part of your business (especially lobby/casino decor, room quality, maintenance/upkeep, and food service).You have have good lineage. And your recently-refurbished guest rooms are a step in the right direction (though, while I'm not crazy about the Peptol-Bismol-pink bathroom walls, the electric drapes are a nice feather in your plume). It just seems like you're at 55% right now when, if you just got flapping, you could be at 100%. Or even 110%-- shoot for the skies!Dear Flamingo, please don't lay an egg! Leave the comfort of your nest and soar like you are meant to (or at least balance on one leg like you are meant to), sweet Flamingo!
This is a typical HK diner so I didn't walk in with much expectation. Ordered: Laksa with shrimp and chicken: I didn't personally eat it but it seemed very watery. Also, theres 2 different types of noodles in the dish. I haven't seen that before so don't know if thats the "correct" Laska or not (I don't think it is though).Ox tail with rice: Very SALTY and very FATTY.  There was a whole layer of fat with little meat in each piece. I've definitely had better ox tail before. All combos came with a drink, specialty drinks were a minimum of 0.50 extra depending on which drink you order. I ordered Ribena soda with lemon and it was okay. But recommend you to ask for less ice as the ice made it very difficult to poke the lemon. Drink was eh. Nothing special and not worth the extra 1.75.Overall: I don't think I will be coming back. I would rather eat at Phoenix than here.
This is an ok gym. I have been going on and off for 4 years. The gym has a lot to offer but I have been getting more and more dissapointed. For one they are not the cleanest. The other thing that really bothers me is they have two out dated stand up tanning beds... One has been broken for MONTHS! That is crazy to me with EOS being a big chain. I went into bed 1 today the only bed that was open and 8 yes 8 bulbs were burned out. I feel like they can afford too and should update their beds... I was also upset with childcare because they promised they would send my daughters vacs record to Aliante when the manager came in at 2. I'm glad I decided to call because they didn't send over her shot record because I didn't sign a release form! They didn't even tell me I needed too. I am honestly thinking about switching gyms.
Ugh, I get frustrated just to think about Sahra.  I didn't receive the service I purchased, and I really couldn't do much about it because like all other guests I had been asked to "pre-tip."  That's right, they tack an automatic 20% gratuity onto your services when you check in and if you didn't like something you'll never get the chance to mention it to them because it's out the door with you after you're done.  That all being said, the amenities were quite nice and I wouldn't mind spending a couple of hours there, but I wouldn't get a service again.  I left feeling a bit tricked.
Congratulations Bar Louie! Another 2* Review. Apparently, that's what you're aiming for. I went in tonight after I got off of work for a beer and some food, primarily because my brother had mentioned he thought the place looked cool about a week ago. Do not get it twisted; this place may appear busy on Wednesdays and any other day from 4-7 for one reason only, their happy hour prices are nice. Their bar staff on the other hand can make Stephen Hawking seem like he has a bubbling personality. I'm a young single guy that eats out alone quite a bit because my work hours leave me eating past a normal dinner hour. I also worked industry for 6 years, so I know a bartender who's destined to work back of the house when I see one. My bar"tender" Crystal had zero personality, ZERO. I counted 5 singles and two deuces at the bar-top and she didn't engage one person in any conversation. Just pacing, making drinks, and complaining to coworkers. Was a Wednesday night around 7:45 a little too much for you to handle (nine people, that's almost double digits...)? Need a second bartender up there? Or maybe just some Midol? Didn't receive a "hello" when I sat down, a smile with service, or a "thank you" when I was leaving. But, I did leave 20% because I know the industry and I almost felt sorry for her poor attitude. The bottom of their receipt says "Thank you for your business. We hope to see you again soon." Maybe they should tell their FOH employees to try to make people feel like they actually mean it. Food: MehAtmosphere: DecentStaff: Unimpressive
The food here is pretty tasty, but the last few times I have ordered wings and fries, they were quite crappy due to the oil being very old. Please change out your oil when it gets nasty, it makes tasty junk food, just taste like junk.
Update (that was fast) Spoke to the manager. He was very nice and apologetic and took care of biz as best he could. Hopefully, this doesn't happen again. I'll delete the below once the fod redeems itself I had to find my Yelp PW to make this review. I ordered nachos & requested CHIPS ON SIDE due to time and soggy factors. Picked up, no chips on side. Ok, I'm starving but Idw to be totally disappointed so I go back in, the bartender rudely asked if I "actually asked for chips on the side." Duh, check YOUR system. She passes it off to a server & doesn't talk to me again until 10 min later when my new order comes out. Her attitude was trash & Idk if they took it personal that MY food was wrong or what, but they put EVERYTHING in separate containers and left out my beans-the reason I wanted nachos itfp! Seriously?! It's not the 1st time and it sucks that Idw go back because 1900 used to be my spot! But seriously, SIX separate cups!? Y'all were being smart @$$#$ because nobody said separate everything and I was overly polite to them as if I'D messed up my own order or smtg.Do better.
I read some of the reviewsin groupon and a lot of people gave this restaurant 4 stars so I wad expecting really good food and service. The service was bad, the server saw we had a groupon and just asked how would we like our steaks and what kind of wine we wanted, we asked her questions about wine and she said "idk, I don't drink wine" . We asked for water and had to wait 20 min for it, and she never came back to refill it. Portions were very small the steak was very dry and rubbery. We also ordered guacamole and chips, the guacamole had no flavor at all we had to put some salt and pepper to make it a little better. The cheescake was very good, this was the only thing we like really like.
So, I almost never write bad reviews.  I review places that I like and want to promote.  But I was disappointed in the quality of the food here and I went for one specific reason. Let me be clear up front that I didn't get the bbq, or any meat.  So my review is based on extremely limited data... I went because I wanted mashed potatoes.  I ordered mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and texas toast.  The mashed potatoes were not real potatoes, they were powdered potatoes :-(  So disappointing.  And the mac and cheese was ok at first bite, but was incredibly salty.  The toast was bread with oil on it.  I will also clarify that I went through the drive through and the service was good and it was quick.
This place is just average. Nothing special. The menu is limited to just a few items but there are a lot of drinks on the menu. Food was ok. Burger was decent but small for the price and fish was $22 worth of breading with a tiny hint of halibut. It did come with a lot of coleslaw though which was just average. Drinks are about average price but there are other places in the vicinity that are a few bucks cheaper. Lunch for two with a beer each will run you about $65 so you're better off going someone else if you are hungry.
It's empty but a lot of people visited for a big screen of 2028 fifa World Cup so I can't say it's empty their food was ok.
Being raised in the western world, a cup of java is essential in the morning especially good with a cream cheese bagel or a donut or a timbit or a danish or.... ANYHOW, most will agree that NOTHING  beats the smell of fresh coffee in the morning. Or tea. Steeped tea in particular, is tried and true morning picker upper. i will confess that I am a Timmies fanatic and hold it dear to my heart, and it pains me to write such a review about one that was so dear; but I am so VEXED and I need to vent. I am giving this location a 2 star cuz i have nostalgia but really it's a ONE.This particular location has been dear to be for as long as I can remember- it's been my go-to place on any day or night for a lil bit of java fix, whether it be during cramp time for exams or just to catch up with a buddy over a warm cup(s) of whatever; it was open 24 hrs for the longest time which made it the perfect spot.Then it wasn't 24hrs anymore except on Fridays and Saturdays which bites but still good. I have always enjoyed the quick service here even when the line went out the doors and had no problems returning to THIS location even though there are many within walking distance, until recently.So Currently I am working two jobs; one in day and one in night because I am insane. This makes good cup(s) of java essential to my being awake; I can't imagine how much more I spend at Timmies these days.Anywho.Since I have started my night gig(4 months ago), I can't seem to get no satisfaction from this place. The coffee is ALWAYS burnt - I thought maybe it was because I came near closing time that it may be the case. But no, any time after 5pm I have been here, the coffee is BURNT. So I switched to steeped tea; and the friggin TEA is burnt! How do you burn tea? Well it is brewed the way and stored same way coffees are so if it sits for a long time on the burner it burns. Why am I paying for burnt anything? Because the service was good. But the service of the night crew completely shat itself recently- I have never met such rude set of people who not only ignore your existence in the store ,rudely repeat after you, talk in another tongue in front of you(which I find rude) and openly roll their eyes at you. However, beggers can't be choosers and I continued to drink burnt crap because all other Timmies in the area closes before 11pm - until recently. Recently I discovered that this particular set of people -do not practice what we know to be a Timmies practice? you know, writing the time when the pot was brewed and dumping it after a certain time- they ran a national campaign for that not too long ago- yeah, they don't do that here during the night shift.If they are ignoring one of the most fundamental things that makes Timmies what it is , I dare ask what else they're not doing so I am taking my tiny broken wallet else where.That is all. I am done ranting.
I just spoke with the manager (JP) and he was VERY nice about the whole situation, so I will give Mesa Grill another shot next time I'm in Vegas.
You can practically smell the Abercrombie and Fitch cologne and hear the sound of collars popping as you enter this place. Douche central.Food was decent, but it took 15 minutes for them to make 3 sliders to go. They advertise these fancy dipping sauces but they were out of everything except ketchup -- how exotic. Prices are also outrageous -- $14 for 3 tiny sliders and a small fry.I will definitely not go back.
1.  Front desk was rude2.  Restaurant service was very good3.  Spa was awful4.  Location - too far from the stripI expect more from the Trump International Hotel.
Not really impressed, show had it's entertaining moments but I guess you have to have a bit of alcohol in your system to enjoy it in it's entirety .
The attendant stopped preparing our order for a customer that just walked in. Not impressed with the donuts and the boba. It tasted like chalk.
This McDonald's is sub par.... Their was only a couple people working the seating area was not clean it is a really old McDonald's could definitely use a face lift.. Fries were soggy yuck!!!
Place was new/clean.  Sushi NOT good.  Your ingredient choices are very limited and low quality, the rice gets kind of hard because it sits around in pre-prepped sheets.  There is no artistry (or Asians), as they use a machine to make your sushi, which I'm skeptical about based on principal, but also because it's on the counter all day at room temp cutting raw fish.  No music and empty, so kind of eerie while eating, and more of a subway feel than asian.  People are commenting on how they get to customize the sushi here... but you can do that at any sushi place.  Anyway, for me.. High prices for low quality sushi = not worth going back.
Ordered drunken noodles and the Thai Dumplings. Dumplings were tasty with nice garlic & spice, but $8 for 4 tiny dumplings was a bit much. The drunken noodles had some kick, but the abundance of baby corn, celery, & carrots was a BIG disappointment. How about some peppers? Underwhelmed and overpriced
It seems to be aiming for both the customers of Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, but it ends up pleasing neither. The selection is not terribly wide. Given its proximity to PenMac, its tiny cheese section felt embarrassingly pathetic. Its price doesn't seem to be competitve either.  Data point from Feb. 2009: its half gallon organic milk was actually $1 more than the same product at Whole Foods. The store still seems to be setting up -- spacious to the point of feeling desolate.
Way too salty. Seriously, even the bread was too salty. The scallop dish was creative but the salt levels ruined it. Super expensive given the very small portions and few ingredients.The service was slow and unattentive. Saw our waitress only twice. The hostess texted that our table was ready but had no idea what table it was and kept us waiting at the counter another 10 minutes to figure it out. The drinks were good. I liked the pink drink.
Disappointing. Soggy halibut that didn't taste fresh and had a rubbery texture. Fries were good. Tartar sauce was decent. Coleslaw was ok nothing to write home about. Two stars only because of the fish and price. You can get better fish and chips in town for less.
I used to be a regular here. The staff are organized and the mechanics do good work, so I'm disappointed to say that I got taken for a ride.Long story short, due to ownership changes, I took the same car in for an inspection to get a safety certificate twice within a few months. Safety certs are a bit ridiculous because you're basically handing the shop a blank cheque -- no cert, no vehicle permit. For unscrupulous shops, the money isn't in the $100 cert, it's in 'finding' urgent items to repair.Conveniently, both times, they found $800 of different repairs that were needed. I'm not sure they were aware that they had very recently looked at the exact same car. I know enough about cars to know that some was legit and would have been due within a few months anyways, but some was definitely not. Prime example: They told me the driver's seat bracket was badly rusted, causing it to have loosened and wobble against to the frame. I pulled out the flashlight and didn't see rust, but it did wobble, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. So a replacement seat was installed and I got my cert. Sure enough, it still wobbles. Zero difference, except that it I was $500 poorer, and apparently this invisible rust is gone. Such an insult.This place is fine for a tire change, but if you're looking for a shop you can trust, I'm sorry to say that you'll need to keep looking.
the ice cream is great but the owner is very rude. everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say. the ice cream gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars!
The staff here is very friendly but my main complaint is this place is always packed and busy! There's people standing everywhere and it takes about 2hrs with an appointment to see a doctor. They mix the walk ins with ppl with apmt so what's the point of making an appointment when you are not first priority ? Please get it together here. You should seperate the walkins and give people with appointments the attention they deserve without these outrageous wait times. The worst part is after I waited 2hrs I saw a tech not even a dr! WTF
We went to Tryst on a Sunday during lunch for a family member's bday. The menu seemed promising. I decided on the seared ahi tuna salad for myself and spring rolls to share. I didn't think to ask if anything I ordered was going to be hot. I assumed the spring rolls would be hot because I've never experienced raw spring rolls before and any time I've ever ordered a salad with some fish in it- the fish has always come out hot. This was not the case. Which is not a big deal but cold seared ahi tuna is not good. The seared part of the title is misleading. When something has the word seared, I expect it to be HOT... but that's just me. The spring rolls were tasty -I just did not expect them to be cold/raw. Nothing to write home about but it wasn't terrible. And my fiancé found a hair in his salad and I lost my appetite.
ProsThe Flamingo in Las Vegas is in a convenient location on the strip a stone's throw from some of the major casinos and resorts. The staff is extremely professional and amicable. We dealt with Brian at the front desk and Jeanette in guest services both of whom were friendly.ConsDespite it's nice location, the room itself was rather gross. To start, the rates online were different than those that we paid. We wanted to pay in cash so we figured we would be better off making the reservation in person. After watching 3 desk agents get up and never come back there was a crowd full of people with only 2 staff members present. After finally making it to the front after 35 or 40 minutes the rates that we ended up paying were not those online but we were both so tired it wasn't even worth bringing up. Five minutes after putting our bags down we realized we made a mistake booking the hotel and wish we had only paid for one night upfront instead of two. There were black stains on the white shower curtain, hairs on the ceiling, mildew in the shower, no fan in the bathroom, no towel hooks in the wall and nicks on the wall. I was looking forward to taking a bath upon arrival but as soon as I saw the tub I knew I would wait until I went back home. Some of the appliances in the room were unplugged forcing us to move the furniture to plug it in ourselves. The sheets were coming off the bed and continued to do so for the rest of our stay. In terms of the WiFi, it was decent but on the slow end and only allowed for 2 devices to be connected at once. The room did not come with a refrigerator or microwave and if we wanted a fridge it was an additional $15 per night not including taxes. There was a constant and unpleasant odor that permeated throughout our room for the 2 nights we stayed. The walls are rather thin so when the people staying to the left of us were in their room we could actually hear the conversation clearly...from our bed...across the room. To top it off the air conditioner was extremely loud and rather irritating. The pools were alright. The pool for those over 21 looked fun but busy while the beach club pool was extremely overcrowded. We left before we even sat down after considering paying the $200 for a cabana just so we would not have to sit an inch away from strangers on either side of us. In addition you weren't allowed to bring water and bags are searched. If water is found they will make you throw it away or the security will not allow you in. Despite the friendliness of the staff and it's location I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Overall it was a rather gross experience. Honestly if I could have I would have gone back downstairs and immediately after check in and asked for a refund but we couldn't do so without a cancellation fee so we decided to stick it out. I wish we had though. The two nights before, we stayed in Tuscany Casino just off the strip and both of us wish we hadn't left. Even though it was 10 mins farther by walking we were better off with a more low key pool, and a room 3 times the size for a better price. Don't make the same mistake we did. Either pay more for a better hotel or stay at Tuscany if you don't mind walking farther.
Bad location right on main road with cars buzzing by. Poor on street parking. Subpar beers. Had about 5 IPA's. No variety. Food was poor. Chicken sandich with avocado was terrible. I was looking forward to some creamy avocado, but bit down into som w thing very hard, harder than raw carrots. It was the avocado s. The cook should know his produce and never sent that out. Customer service is poor.
So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies...OK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then....I. Entered. The. Theatre.Gulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty. Just seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street. I may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!
Basic Mexican fare, the prices are way to high for what you get, especially the margaritas (whose prices do not appear on the drink menu - red flag). I ordered the OG Margarita, it was  over-priced, too sweet orange juice that may have been in the vicinity of tequilla. The shredded beef taco left much to be desired - mostly lettuce, hardly any shredded beef. The carne asada burrito is HUGE, the tortilla is delicious but the carne asada was slighly sweet, and strange tasting, not spicy or brightly flavored at all (which to me are signs of quality carne asada). I had about 4 bites and didn't finish it. The waitress (who was very friendly) offered a to-go box but I couldn't bring myself to tell her I didn't want to take the rest of the burrito because it tasted awful. Would I go back - no.
I wanted to like this place but it just had too much going against it. I'm not sure if it's a chain but we tried another place with the same name but that was either closed for the day or forever, we couldn't tell. We found this one a little bit of a drive away and figured we'd try it out. It's supposed to have "the best ribs in the state", but I'll never know as after ordering them, we were told they were out of ribs. We had the pork shoulder which was OK but I was looking forward to ribs. We're not from the area so decided to eat in, lucky for us we were one of the first there for dinner as they only have 1 table. Drinks were "you can buy them from the machine there or cross the street to the convenience store and pick something up". There are too many other better BBQ places around to bother going back, maybe it's good if you live nearby and can do takeout?
My wife and I went here tonight.  Cute little restaurant.  Server was ok, older lady that wasn't very personable.  Maybe it just wasn't her night.  I had sirloin steak for 16 bucks.  It was in this puddle of sauce and mushrooms that was very strong and salty tasting.  I wouldn't have it again.  My wife got the chicken ala Granny.  It was a different kind of dish, but she really liked it, she also got a side of the house pasta.  The marinara sauce was the best.  I wish I would have done something more Italian after I had a bite of that!  Oh well. For the two dishes and just water we spend 40 bucks.  Since it was that much I wouldn't go back again.
Not the best place to eat but they do make pretty good green beans! Do be careful as well because their food gives you the runs!
Location is great, very close and convenient for me, but the prices are too high compared to other stores and the product doesn't seem so fresh. We purchased watermelon 2 times, a medium size one, not organic or even close to it. Both times we cut the watermelon and it was the worst watermelons ever bought. Price almost $4 for 1 watermelon . Another time I was in there the gallon milk I buy from Sprouts is about $6.50, I bought from here $8.50 . I guess for a quick run its ok but I will not be buying my weekly groceries from here. I wish they brought a Sprouts market here instead. The best store ever!!!!!!
Don't really care what Gados from the radio says, I could have done it better myself.  Painted the rest of the house myself but had a baby on the way so I thought I would go with the AZ Painting Company to save some time on the remainder.  I had used them before to paint my garage door, front door and fix a crack in the garage ceiling.  They came out and gave me a quote on the living room and nursery, even said they would fix the garage ceiling from the last time they did it because it looked so bad.  $850, roughly 700 sq. ft.  They told me it would take one day and they would have 2 crews.  Guy showed up the first day by himself and 3.5 hours late without any idea of the job he was supposed to do and with an attitude.  Obviously, he could not do it all.  He painted just the nursery that day and was here until 8 pm.  Next time I scheduled them for 9:30 am and stressed I don't get home from work until then. The contractors came out 3 hours early and had to wait on me to get home from work (I work midnights).  These guys had no idea they even had to paint the living room and just thought they were painting the garage.  They didn't bring the right equip to retexture the garage, because once again they had no idea they were doing it, and had to go buy a hopper. They had to come back a third time to finish the inside.  Well upon inspection of the living room I noticed all kinds of light spots where they didn't cover the wall right and they didn't even remove the outlet covers or vent covers, just did a horrible job cutting in around them.  A Real rush job.  Called the company and the guy came out again to fix the light spots.  He did not fix them correctly.  Now I have a front living room where if you look at it from a 45 degree it looks like a novice first attempt at painting by a beginner and a garage ceiling that doesn't look much better than before.  They knocked $250 off the price but I believe in opportunity cost, the foregone cost of my time.  Even boarded my dog an extra day and took a couple hours vacation from work.  Taking 4 days to get it done wrong instead of the quoted one to do it right isn't even what bothers me the most, it's the complete lack of communication, scheduling and knowledge of what they were supposed to be doing!  I will be repainting the front living room myself and looking elsewhere if I need further "professional painting".
So, once upon a time I fancied myself a rocker. I had the requisite black hair in jr high school, the ripped t-shirts, etc. I outgrew the phase like most people do, grew out my hair , started easing up on the teen angst. But deep inside I believed that I could still hold my own, so that if I walked into a punk show I could still rock out with the best of them. Thanks to the Distillery, I now know that is a lie. I am not even close to hardcore, and I never ever was. I'm at peace with this.We were heading somewhere completely different but walked by when someone suggested we go in. For some reason I did, and  due to a mis-communication half of us had paid to get in while half refused to go in and left. Those that wouldn't actually ARE more hard core, and that speaks to how the rest of the night went. The people were fairly rude, jostling everybody and giving the outsiders dirty looks. Definitely a hard crowd. Everyone looked like they'd stepped off the cover of a Rancid album. Lots of scowls. They had a tiny circle pit, as everyone was too busy affecting coolness to join in. The band was awful and the cover overpriced considering. We finished our beers and left to rejoin with the smarter group. Yep, not hardcore at all! Phew, close call!
I had over $2000 worth of work done on my car here 2 years ago.  Tint job, and car audio installation were the two major things I had worked on at this shop.  I have an older car with the dot matrix at the top of the back window for the defroster.  I don't know much about tinting, so I didn't know that it would like shit when trying to tint over the dot matrix.  I go to pickup my car that night, and was told by the owner - "Don't worry it just has to set, and then it won't show any more."  I ask how long, and am told about a week.  A week goes by and it looks exactly the same.  I bring it back, and the story changes.  "Oh, it's the dot matrix at the top..it can't be helped, that's just the way it turns out.  I'll have my installer use a heat gun, press it out and see if we can get it to look better."  It actually looks much worse after all is said and done.  I have no complaints about the tinting on the other windows....except.   When I originally went to pickup my car after the initial installation the owner was working on another car where the owner blamed him for the window getting jammed up and coming off track after getting his tint done.   Ironically my passenger side window went off track a week or so after getting work done here, and it scratched up my newly installed tint.  The owner said it wasn't his fault, and they would not replace the tint.  Now to the car audio installation.  The installation looks clean.  I have had no problems with the way it looks.   However I was sold on having the steering wheel controller installed.  (controls the volume and FF/RW tracks on the steering wheel).  He was unable to get it to work, and instead of offering a refund (89.99) I was told it was my problem, and I had to go to the dealership to fix the steering wheel control?  So I'm out 89.99!  The original subwoofer that was installed, blew out after a year.  It has a year warranty, so I was able to get a replacement subwoofer at no charge - BUT he charged me $35 to cover the shipping cost of the subwoofer to his shop.  I ended up paying it...hoping that would be the last of it.  NOPE, 11 months later, the subwoofer blows again...I call the shop this morning, and leave a message to have the owner call me.  No call as of yet, and I probably won't expect to get one.  I've also emailed about some other issues in the past, and never got a response.  Mind you - I did get a response when it was about buying new products, but got very minimal feedback when having to have a problem addressed. Needless to say - I'm done with this shop.  I'll take my hard earned money, and business elsewhere.  Besides - I don't want to pay another $35 for another subwoofer to get shipped.  That would be $70, and it will probably blow again, in another year - at which point I would be paying the cost for a new subwoofer anyway, and wasting more time, for a business that obviously doesn't care to retain their clients.
My sons and I used to come here all the time. Pretty good selection of games to play. Within the past year or so, there has been a severe lack of game maintenance taking place. Several of the multiplayer games consistently have broken down units. Mario Kart (our favorite) has been broken for almost a year, yet Gameworks has no problem letting people attempt to play the game - One of the steering wheels is almost non-responsive, and it makes the game completely unplayable. The other unit next to it has a seat that is stuck in a forward position. I went to talk to someone about this, and her answer was "it cost money to fix these games". Well, no sh*t. I think we're done with Gameworks. Unfortunately, I just purchased a Groupon recently that I haven't even used. It will probably go to waste. Dave & Buster's is close by, and has Mario Kart. Dave & Buster's doesn't have a couple of the other games that game works has, but I can't remember the last time the other games had both player options working and available at Gameworks anyway.
Sheesh. What is it with people here? It's a [bleep] hot dog. Just a hot dog. Yet, time and time again, there's a line wrapped around the building five times over. I don't care if the best [bleep] hot dog in all of North [bleep] America: I get claustrophobic any time I'm in there. Isn't it time Ted stepped up to the 21st Century? It's like the place is run with all the professionalism of a kid's lemonade stand. Yeah, I get that everything's grilled to order, but if you're that hard up to be waiting for literally fifteen to twenty minutes for some footlong and relish, there's something seriously wrong with you. A previous Yelper wrote that "sometimes it's crowded"? SOMETIMES? Gee... ya think?
I am super disappointed with Loving Hut these days. Oh, when the shine comes off the newness... Actually, I think there's been a change of ownership. This place has been consistently really good for the past few years and then, Bam! One day I walk in and yup, something's wrong, no warm, strong aroma of blended spices. I pick up the menu and it's abbreviated, turned into an acronym of its former self. Worst yet, what's still left on offer has lost its flavour. Once again, food assembly, speed and the bottom line has become the goal. Less for more, sorry Loving Hut, I'm breaking up with you.
Called for reservation with my groupon. Was told to call back lady was not in. But had plenty of rooms. I called back 30 minutes later and they have nothing now. Even spoke to mgr. it wasn't they were sold out. They just minimize how many rooms get groupon. We are locals to Arizona and did not find this service good.
We were pressed to find a reservation for 6 people at 7 pm on a Saturday, but Tonic was able to accommodate us. Our service was very good. However, the food was generic. The decor is seriously outdated. The paint on the walls was chipped. It's a shame that a restaurant at such a prime location with challenging competition puts up such a bad show.
I really enjoy Thai food and after two weird carry out orders from here I'm calling it quits on malees. I really like Thai noodles and have gotten drunken noodles many places, but malees is the only one that uses overcooked, gummy, skinny egg noodles with hardly any sauce and raw chopped tomatoes (and no other vegetables, unless you count limp bean sprouts). I will suck it up and deal with the bad service at the place around the corner before coming back.
Why fly Economy, when you can get that same food at Ikea? This is my first experience eating at Ikea Food Court. Ikea has been open for over a month now & the lines at The Food Court are still massive. The portion sizes are perfect for small people or people dieting.... but at least they are reasonably priced. I had the Swedish Meatball plate & the hot Salmon plate, they were out of mashed potatoes for the Meatball plate so I substituted French Fries. First, the good: the French Fries were perfect- well cooked, hot & not skinny, also my customer interaction with everyone at Ikea, has been great- very friendly, super informative. Now for the bad: EVERYTHING else was over-cooked. These were well thought out plates, that should have been great..... just not well planned for a busy Cafeteria venue. They need to cook in smaller batches, watch sitting times in their storage ovens & taste & throw out old, over-cooked items &/or under-cook their food from the start, knowing that they will continue to cook in their storage ovens. One last thing, their 75 cent coffee, is the 2nd worst coffee that I have drank in Vegas...... but it was free with my Ikea Family Card.This was my first dining experience at Ikea & even though it wasn't great, I plan on eating there every time, that I shop at Ikea, until I have tried their whole menu. I like to try different cuisines....... & Meatballs with Lingonberry Jam, is very different for me. I hope with reviews like mine or maybe more experience cooking with their equipment, that Ikea will put out better hot food, in the future. I will let you know. I have high hopes, because everything else at Ikea is just so very clever.
This place is not the best. I would travel to chaparral dog park in Scottsdale 30 minutes away before going there ever again.
$240.00 New Patient FEE$122.00 "Surgery"$65.00 Binocular microscopy-------------------------------------$427.00 TOTALThis is what my bill looked like after going in to have some earwax removed.  EARWAX!  If you want to be rushed through your visit and then overcharged, this is the place for you.  Had they mentioned there would be a $240.00 new patient fee, I would have turned on my heel and walked out of there.  When I called and asked for the undisclosed fee to be reduced or removed, they refused.  Not sure how they get away with this.
Young hotties all around and a racket loud enough to burst your ear drums. If you're into that, then this is the place for you! Thumpa-thumpa-thumpa.$7 cover at midnight on a Saturday. I can't tell you how much the drinks are, because I didn't have any. I ended up here following a friend.
The menu was so hard to decipher and the burger I had didn't have any taste at all. Really disappointing. Service was good but the food didn't seem worth the price. Really don't understand why so much fuzz about this place.
I have been to Destihl a handful of times, and every time I am disappointed. The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's.
It's been a little over 25 years since I have been to a Rally's. Last time was when I was stationed in Florida and I was pregnant with my daughter, Rally's was my favorite place to go. A Rally burger with extra pickles and Vanilla shake is what I always craved. So when I saw one here in Tempe I was excited and decided to come and get a classic. The service was fine, however shake machine was down, no worries, but the Rally burger was awful. It was cold and could not find the meat. Of course I went through drive through, my office is three blocks away. The burger was worse than a McDonalds burger. I was very saddened at my experience today with Rally's as it was one of my most favorite places back in the day. The fries were good as I remember and I settled for a smoothie because again the shake machine was down. The Mango Smoothie was pretty tasty. I give 2 stars because the Rally burger was absolutely awful. Maybe I will visit again at a different time and try again for a burger but, if I am met with another cold, unmelted cheese because so cold burger and hardly any meat, I will have to bid farewell to a place that used to be rated better than the average McDonalds. I hope Rally's looks at their review and improves their burgers to the quality I know they can be.
If you're looking for diner food, that's diner quality, then this is the place. It's everything you would find at a typical diner. The staff is very friendly and kind. One of the guys sat down right in the booth to take an order from the table next to us. Our waitress was friendly, prompt and attentive. The ambiance was that of a typical dinner --I thought the place was cute, both inside and out.The food is edible, but nothing beyond that. The food is diner food, and frankly, not even good diner food. I had an omelette and my son had pancakes and bacon. The bacon was so brittle that it just crumbled. My son thinks ALL bacon is good, no matter how its cooked, and he wouldn't touch it after one bite. The hash browns that came with my omelette were partially burnt. The omelette was OK, but nothing special. That being said, my dad LOVES this place and thinks it's the only place worth eating breakfast in town. Different strokes!
When I first started working down in the Cultural District 4 years ago, this was always our pre-theater stop for dinner. I absolutely LOVED the pasta vodka. They also had this delicious flavored butter. Every time you came in they had a different flavored butter with bread. Pre-dinner bread isn't usually exciting, but they made it so! Fast forward a couple years later....I hadn't been there in about a year or so. I think the issue is maybe they changed owners or head chef perhaps? Either way, the food is very average, if not Olive Garden-y. I had the Veal Parmesan. I know veal i usually sliced thin, but I felt as if it was nonexistent inside the coated fried bead crumbs. The sauce was nowhere near what you expect it to be. I usually imagine a Grandma in the back lovingly making the sauce. Here I could see them pouring out the Ragu containing and heating it up. How do I comment on the service when our waitress checked on us FIVE MILLION times!? I mean, that's nice....but when she's in your face while you're chewing, in your face making really lame jokes and in your face as she's having a smokers coughing fit. it's really hard to say we had excellent service. It was pretty much taking it to the other extreme of smothering service! The only thing they have going for them are their meatballs.  The meatballs are exaclty what I like, very moist and lots of flavor.  I can't help but think this sounds dirty, I swear the meatballs are good!  They just need to not be paired with Ragu sauce!!
I just cancelled my membership because they refused to change a channel on one of their 20 TVS to NBC for one hour. I really enjoyed working out on my lunch, but its back to getting up early and working out at home. Plus, they need better air circulation in that place. In the later hours, it gets really stinky!
The two star here is all for food. Me and my husband went for dinner last night. Not our first time. We go there often for some good prime rib, classy service and quite time. However, we had a horrible experience this time. Real BAD SERVICE!! Our server was Adam. He introduced himself as Adam, although his name tag had Amir written on it. He was completely untrained or new or just didn't want to be there. We could tell because we've been there so many times before. It was just all wrong from start to finish. He didn't know his beers. Forgot to bring his spatulas for the spinning salad bowl. It was actually funny,, he spun the bowl, realized he had forgotten his equipments and excused himself to get them leaving the bowl spinning. Funny. We figured, it happens, no big deal. But it started getting to me when he didn't even bother to check up on us. Not once. We had to get someone else to get us some more ojus ( beef broth). Now, my husband and I both being from the hospitality industry, we understand sometimes it's just tough to get to the table when you're slammed and busy. THIS DUDE HAD ONE TABLE HE WAS WAITING ON. US! It was a slow tuesday night for heaven's sake. He walked pass us like at least 3 times yet never once check up if everything was okay and if we needed something. He totally didn't mention anything about the horseradish sauces which we noticed sitting in the corner after we had stopped eating. I wish he had  as I absolutely would have loved some.  He finally showed up after we were done and had stopped eating. He offered dessert, we said no. And then he just started clearing my plate. HELLO? WE GOT BIG CHUNKS OF PRIME RIB LEFT ON OUR PLATE? MAYBE WE WANT TO BRING IT HOME? I had to stop him and ask him to wrap them go. Like I said,, worst service ever. It seemed like he just didn't want to be there or he was new and nervous! I don't know! But it was bad!! Definitely not Lawry's standard. And it was our anniversary !!! I wanted to talk to the manager just so they know what's going on but We didn't want to ruin his night. He had already ruined ours!!! But then again i figured Lawry's need to know this so i decided to yelp. THANK GOD THE FOOD WAS AMAZING AS ALWAYS!!!
Small and unbalanced fields, ridiculously long wait to rent guns and get balls.  Staff is not honest about how long it will take to get on the field.
Burgers are decent but too small and overpriced for what they are. Moo and Brew has better burgers and better value.
We decided to try Vince Neils, not only because we're 80s hair band freaks, but also because there as a great Groupon and it sounded like fun.  The restaurant is in Circus Circus and I wasn't thrilled with that casino.  However, the restaurant itself was generally inviting.  The food was average, the staff response was slow.  It was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The most fun part of the experience was that it was the World Finals of Karaoke.  That was fun and very entertaining.  I was overall happy we tried it because I love new things, but I have had better service, food and experience in Vegas.
If I could do 2 1/2 stars I would-because the people were very friendly and the salad was amazing. But for the money, that's about it. I went about 3:30pm, and I know that's an "in-between" time, but there was only 1 other table seated, they had eaten already (if they did) and was still there when I left.I saw the sign, and since I enjoy Pappadeaux, but it's so far- I was game.You walk up and order, I was looking for creole or cajun food, then asked re: Shrimp Ettoufee-which is a tricky dish I guess, but a good test run.He said oh yes! So I ordered it. It came with a super delicious salad and rice. I just had water, and it was very good and cold and served in a canning jar-nice portion. Ok...so far so good. The salad was soooo good-it was very fresh, diverse and delicious! I had the Creole ranch dressing-which I liked a lot. PLUS!Then after a bit of a wait the Ettoufee arrived. It looked a bit different, but there was a lot of the brown gravy (it was clear though-kinda weird). The shrimp were pretty small, maybe a "small-medium" size, which were really one bite each. There were enough not to feel cheated, not enough to feel you could have a shrimp with every bite (I cut them in half to try).The shrimp were not overcooked-a plus. But the gravy? It was...BLAND! If there was ANY spice in it at all...well, there couldn't have been! I did not order it bland, nor did he ask. I have had it several times in different states, and I have had worse and I have had much better too. It was like eating...shrimp in brown gravy. Period. Cajun? NO WAY.Hmmm..The bread was pretty good though. The rice was nicely done. BUT THE ETTOUFFEE!  UGH.At  $16.00 (+ tip in jar) for lunch, I can not justify this.  Maybe that's why it's basically vacant when it opened back in December-I looked. Too bad-we NEED some cuisine cultural diversity in this city! This AIN'T it...
I was excited to eat here, due to all the hype of the restaurant.  As I had Saturday brunch here, reservations were no problem.  The food is tasty. I admit.  I had the salmon quesadillas, with salmon roe for appetizers and scrambled eggs with jalapenos and ham.  My only complaint was that they couldn't make my eggs with all egg whites or egg substitute, as the waiter said that the chef would not do it. I would assume that they would try to accommodate with my request, but they didn't. I guess customer satisfaction is not a top priority here.
cute store basically no help. more expensive then forever 21 but same kinda clothes. kinda reminds me of pattys closet. check it out if ur in the area. but there are better boutiques in vegas.
They are focused on the wrong thing. This was the most rushed haircut I have ever had. Quality was very poor. Haircut and shave in about 20 minutes. Yeah you can guess how it looks. The shop was filthy, hair everywhere. Not just because they were busy but because the didn't clean. There was hair in places that was clearly there for months. Gross!! They need to focus on being clean and giving good service and worry less about how long the wait is or how many jobs they can do in a day. Slow down and hire more people!!2 stars because they were really nice guys. Otherwise it would be negative 2 if available.
The gal who took our order never looked at us and seemed disinterested (at best) in taking our order. I was less than impressed with the customer service!Following the completion of a poor customer survey, I had three contacts about my concerns (two from their corporate offices and one from the location manager). All were very responsive and apologized for the substandard service. I certainly appreciate the commitment to making things right. After a quality response like that, I am willing to give them one more shot at earning my business back.
The place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy. The waitress was nice, but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary. The food was overpriced for the quality that you received. I LOVE indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
3 years ago i gave Zinburger a great review. Today we stopped in after not visiting for quite awhile. I immediately noticed the burgers appeared smaller. We both ordered burgers medium done.  My husband's Asian burger was medium well. Mine was well done,  meat grown all v the way through and crispy outside.  I ate too the middle hoping i would find a nice pink  center.  I had no such luck.  I hate well done beef. I let the server know of our over cooked meals.  She advised the cooks and removed an appetizer less than half the cost of the over cooked burger.  A customer at another table presented her well done burger also that was supposed to be medium. The server said there had been no changes in management or cook staff.  Our server was pleasant,  but appeared rushed.  The burger was Absolutely NOT a $16 burger.  If you want appetizers and beer during Happy Hour,  Enjoy yourself. If you're looking for a delicious,  juicy burger,  try In N Out.
I stopped for dinner with my daughter. When we were seated it was over ten minutes before I had to ask a manager to send a server over. Many of the servers were standing in the kitchen and saw us sit down but no one came over. After our food came out, after a pretty long wait time, the server did not come back to check on us for a while and it took forever to finally get the check and leave. I have been there before and the food is alright but the service killed it for me. I wont be going back there anytime soon.
Start off by saying I gave 2 stars because there were some good things, so I'll start with the positives:As a former bartender I enjoy showing support & dine at the bar when I go out. When we walked in, it was pretty dead, but because the menu had a lot to offer, and the hostess was sweet, we decided to take a seat at the bar. There were 3 Female bartenders & 2 Male bartenders. A bartender greeted us right away, she had long black hair & made a very good White Russian, which surprisingly so many people mess up, so we were excited for our meals. We ordered Buffalo Chix Dip, and a Mac & Cheese Flatbread, which came out in under 10 minutes. I really do hate leaving bad reviews, but I really had too....The female bartenders were super friendly and gorgeous, but acted extremely inappropriate and immature. It was about 7pm, and dead..... and the bartenders were the loudest there, "twerking" on each other, as there are couples trying to enjoy their meals.... Awkward- girl come on you're gorgeous have some class. Not to mention, as they were having fun doing that... we were patiently waiting to order some food, which is when a male bartender took our order as he saw us waiting.I finished my White Russian before my meal even came, and the food was out in about 6 minutes after we ordered it in, but tasted rushed and awful....The Buffalo Dip tasted like complete ONIONS. It was super super chunky and the cheese was not melted all the way..The Mac & Cheese Flatbread looked amazing, but i picked up a slice to a soggy thin piece of dough, but the bottom was burnt.... This had been our second meal all day, so we ate it. During the entire time of my meal, I was not offered a second drink. The girls were on the other side of the bar where it was empty, taking selfies, and twerking. FINALLY!!! The red hair chick who is extremely gorgeous by the way finally comes and leans against the bar, as I went to make eye contact with her and ask for another drink, she lets bout 3 huge BURPS! (BELCHES). I was mid meal, and disgusted... Really girl c'mon have some class people are eating... so I didn't even bother asking.Meal is over, and then a blonde female bartender asks if I want another drink AFTER our meal is finished and plates are stacked... We politely decline, and she walks away seeing cleared dirty plates. The male bartender comes over, and we ask for our check, he runs our cards, comes back for us to sign. As he was cleaning our place, he did not bother to ask how our meals were, which I would have politelty told him my review personally instead of writing a bad one online. Even worse, as we get up from the chair never said a word. AWFUL SERVICE, and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Its sad you're located right in the EpiCentre, and run such a poor establishment like that. Hope to hear of improvement to get me to try it again.
I don't know why people would even go back. I am sorry but the chicken is so small and the breading is so large :( it's truly a healthy person's nightmare. I feel bad giving a bad review the place was clean, well lit, and the food was hot and the service was great. It's just the food, is so bad for you. I can't ever go there again, thanks.
Arrived around 10ish on a Friday night after a show and we were enticed in by the lovely gas lamps, the hot music and the delicious aromas. We were seated outside per our request and waited over 15 minutes for our server to show up-although her bus boy brought us water. When she finally showed up, we ordered our food and drinks right then, so we would not be left alone for another fifteen minutes. I had the gaslight chicken sandwich which was super dry-I wanted to ask for a side of italian dressing to dunk it in but our server proved that her inattention was more of a habit than a fluke. Also wanted salt and pepper, never saw that either.  Hubby had the   'famous" bleu cheese  burger (four kinds of meat! whatever) and it was very tasty, as were the homemade chips. Sit on the patio and enjoy the very hipster, beautiful and drunk patrons-drunk being the keyword here. Also creepy taxi drivers that also appeared intoxicated hanging around the front door. We will try it again, but earlier in the evening and I will avoid having Jaqueline as a (non) server.
Generally good food, but expensive for what you get as the portion sizes are fairly small. A few hours after lunch I was really hungry again. Three of us had lunch specials and two small bowls of tom yum soup and we spent $75. Charging us $7.50 for a pot of jasmine tea which most places give for free was not cool. Parking in the strip mall is difficult as there are quite a few food establishments in a row. Given the premium prices that they charge for just an okay experience I don't think I will be returning any time soon.
Food was pretty good, as usual. I ordered the hard shell tacos and 1 taco was lopsided and everything fell out, the shell should never have been used.Other than that, the ambiance was irritating. Obviously catering to the teenage crowd, since the blaring music made it impossible to have a conversation. Apparently there was not a manager (or adult manager) on site. I won't be back.
I really wanted to like this place because unicorns are awesome, but it was really grungy and awful. I ordered a beer on tap and it tasted like skunk water. The live band was ok, but the venue was dirty and disappointing.
I usually love this place. It's been a great little spot of good dessert after a meal up in old town. But after doing much research and reading the other reviews, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The fact that multiple people have said they have encountered cockroaches at this establishment, no way Jose for me.
Hot dog was "okay". Kind of place you try out once if you pass by it on Queen Street downtown but it's not going to be a repeat for me. Many street vendors offer a delicious dog for 4$ anytime you want one.
I came here with my friend when we were visiting Pittsburgh. We were lucky enough to come here on the free Sunday they had it open instead on an admission day where you have to apparently pay $20 per person. This would have so not been worth it. I was extremely disappointed after all the talk I heard about it with friends. It was something I found a bit weird. I can appreciate modern art, but I couldn't board this train. If you are into weird art, this is the place to be.
Went for the first time today. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and an order of the tempura green beans. The burgers where ok at best. Meat was good but the buns where so burnt and smashed down, making them super hard. Half way through the burger we both got tired of eating it and tossed the buns in the garbage. Tried letting management know about my experience but no one ever picks up. Shakes and green beans where good. I'll try them again sometime but so far I'm not impressed at all.
I can only assume the lunch chef is not quite up to par with the dinner chef because wholly salt lick was it salty. I spent most of the time I was eating deciding if my sandwich was supposed to be hot or cold as it was room temperature. I can say I do believe it wasn't cooked right based on how ill I felt the rest of the day. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was a cool place and our waitress was awesome!
Ehhhhh I think Joe's has gone downhill in the last few years. I don't think I have had a great experience at a Joe's in a long while and by a while I mean at least 3 years maybe even longer and it used to be great. Well first off the food was not fresh or hot like it should be. They have a great selection but it just isn't good food at all. I think you can get fresher fish at a Long John silvers. The steam pots ate good, I have had better though! Prices are high considering the quality. The drinks tasted watered down and are way over priced. Service was OK had to wait at times for way to long. They were polite but just not attentive. Won't be back unless I hear they make some changes!
Went for the first time at Momo Sushi and I am not impressed and happy with their customer  service. For a Sushi lover, I have eaten and visited a lot of Sushi establishments in different states and here at home. The food is good but the service lacked. When we arrived the reception from the staff was very strained. It's as if sating "hello" or "welcome" was too much work for them. We were sat by the server and each of us were given menus. Since it was our first time, we were reading, very carefully the menu so we can make good decisions in what to eat. Server came to take our orders more than once. I told her we needed more time but she kept coming back really fast without allowing us to have time to decide. We felt rushed. After we ordered and our food delivered, you'd think that they will come back to check up on us and see if we needed our glasses re-filled with our beverages. No one did that. I was parched and I had to get someone's attention to get my glass of water refilled. Could it be that I only had water and not Soda or an alcoholic beverage? Whatever the reason, I feel that I shouldn't have to flag someone that many times to get my glass of beverage refilled. The food was good but I've eaten better in other establishments that are cheaper who also gave us better service than they. The place is simply not friendly and welcoming. To return to this place will not happen again. Not a  recommendation to anyone. I give them two thumbs down.
I'm from LA with local friends and was told this place is amazing. This place had delicious food, but the service was awful. They were all rude. Service is everything to me.
I was really looking forward to bringing the family here today because kids eat free on Sundays.. But was kind of disappointed. We had two Aj burgers (one with jalapenos & bacon and the other with just bacon) a order of cheese curds, fried onion strings a beer and a soda.. Our total came to $30. Good thing the 3 kids meals were free or it would have easily topped $50 bucks. The burger was good but kind of small. The cheese curds were good but the portion size was ridiculous. For $4+ we should of got more then 7 cheese curds, Honestly, and $5 for a blue moon is crazy expensive. The chipolte ranch was the bomb tho, super spicey and good. I probably wouldn't go back unless it was some type of special occasion.
When I hear the name Manhattan Deli, visions of real east coast deli come dancing through my head...but alas I was mistaken.The food is not bad, nor can I go out on a limb and say it is good. It is average, and far below most NYC area delis.I have eaten here more then once with the hope, that by some freak of nature the Deli fairy visited and improved the food. One can dream can't one? But, sigh,  unlike my optimistic dreams, I was left with only the dream. The dreams and the memories of real rye bread,  real corned beef and real NYC mustard. I dreamed for the Deli fairy doing its work, but the dream, just like those of my youth, it was just like the Tooth fairy, instead of a real good sandwich all i found was a lousy quarter under my pillow(actually it was dried up corned beef, on the floor under my table).Why I didn't rate the restaurant a little higher, is for as the food is average, the service is usually far below.
My husband and I usually love this place. The last time we went a few weeks ago on a Friday night the BBQ was undercooked and the waitresses seemed to be more interested in gossiping than doing their job. Hopefully next time we go it will be a better experience. It might be awhile.
I go to Vegas 2-3 times a year, and never thought any Taxi driver would purposely take a MUCH longer route. The fare was over double when I went to the same place the night before. And NO, it wasn't because of traffic. Vehicle # 5114.
Not sure how I feel about this store.  Not the cleanest.  The dressing area was musty, and warm.   A lot of the clothing styles were nothing I would ever wear but my 16 year old grand daughter found quite a few things.  As I looked in more departments I was surprised to see so many interesting items.  Prices were sure good.  I walked away with just 1 blouse but would consider giving this store another try.
Wow I'm sure this place is MUUUUUUCH better, but I went here after we spent the day over at the Chambly beer fest, we just wanted to have a beer and a bite to eat after drinking beer all day long : )Food:To make a long story short, the nachos which were pretty $$$ was nothing more than multi coloured nacho chips with cold toppings that came out of a jar.  The beer on tap was not even cold.   I realize the pub was probably involved with the beer fest that was going on, but Wow... I was not impressed.I'm sure this was a fluke and would be willing to try them again, but first impressions don't leave expectations particularly high.
Probably the dingiest US Bank I've ever been in. There's a security guard outfront, which lets you know right away you are not safe. The staff is rude, and has dirty looks stuck on their faces. Odd how they can afford a security guard, but they can't afford a public bathroom for the customers that keep them in business..?? Being a businesswoman, the place honestly offends me as a whole. I will never be back again.
I agree with what Charles G. said. It's Friday, we've been here since Monday. ...pack a lunch.
What's left to say that hasn't already been said?  I'll try. The setup really is so awkward. It's like they didn't want to do counter service but had no real interest in full service either- so they just muddled the two to all oblivion. Two employees (tried to) explain the process and we were still left confused and honestly a little frustrated before we even sat down. Order at the counter in the back middle of the place, walk backwards get your own drink and condiments, try hard to remember the table number you were told 8 minutes ago, sit down and wait. You're then repeatedly told that you're now receiving "full service" when you just did everything the same as if you were at let's say a Chipotle. I've served for 12 years and id still never leave 20%. I FRIGGIN DID EVERYTHING. The food was decent but for $30 I'll go to Smashburger and have a feast, not two (smallish, super dry, and overcooked) burgers and one side of fries with a forced gratuity.
What is up with the seats in the terminal?  Hard and permanently reclined at the worst possible angle for your back.  Probably made in the '60s.
I don't understand how a hotel with such a name can be so bad??.. So many people talk about The W like Drake for an example "I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby" but this W isn't the same like the rest. The others are bigger and the rooms here just feel cheap. You're paying this high price for a room that's not even the size of a regular bedroom at home. They have LG TV's from like 2007. In this Scottsdale area you shouldn't have anything so cheap especially if your rooms are so expensive for no reason. They give a speaker that connects to IPhone 4's... Like? What? I stayed here randomly and didn't have a tooth brush guess what? They didn't have one either? With this W being in Old Town places with bars and clubs you'd expect them to have these things because a lot people get a room randomly and don't drive home so you should have these things for them. Also there are no balconies just a window that opens again doesn't make any sense. For the price I would say no. If you compared to a motel 6 I would say the motel 6 has probably all the same things this place has. Save your money and find a different hotel. The only reason this place gets two stars was the staff members downstairs called me boss at 5am when I was coming in drunk.
When food is just ok, at least you should play the local games on the TV. UNC on one TV in corner while WVU on big screen because staff wants to watch. Pathetic.
I originally got my pink and white  acrylics there and loved them. I went back to get a fill and my fingers are in pain and look horribly thick. I told the lady ( the fill was done by a  different elder lady from my first initial visit) and now they are uneven thick more in one side than the other and the clear coat has bubbles. They just lost a good tipping customer. Never again!
This is a tough one to score, we wanted to like it, but must lean toward "just below average" for the whole experience.We drove out from old town Scottsdale on Sat night, not wanting to deal with the huge 7PM crowds there.  At first it looks to be sort of a divey spot, on a gritty looking stretch of Bell.  The place was about 1/2 full.  The waitress and bartender were friendly.  We were still optomistic.We ordered the famous pulled pork.  Wife got the sandwich with $1 side salad.  I got the plate.  Salad was very good.  Food came fast.  Now, the irks begin.My $14 mound of pulled pork has no bread.  I asked the waitress if I get bread.  She say no, but I can BUY 2 dinner rolls for $1.  OK but HUH?!  Did I just come to a BBQ place, a place that sells themselves as BBQ, that served me pulled pork w/o bread?  YUP.  BBQ Cardinal Rule #1, broken.  Please go to TX, GA, Carolinas and see how this is properly served.So I get the bread and dig in. But  I want more sauce.  I dawns on me, no BBQ sauce on table.  HUH?  There goes Cardinal Rule #2:  place touts itself as BBQ but is stingy with the sauce.So after a few I start looking for the obligatory stack of extra napkins.  None to be found.  HUH?  No extra napkins to wipe the slop off our hands and faces?  YUP.  No extra napkins.  Cardinal Rule #3.  I ask the waitress.  She says OK but never brings the napkins.  And they offer no hand wipes after dinner.  Cardinal Rule #4?The pork was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy, but was bland.  The flavor came from the scant ration of BBQ sauce squirted over it in the kitchen.  I cook pullled pork, I know how to do it well, and IMO they need to work on the seasoning.  Red potatoes and gravy were great.  That's a 4-STAR dish.So the bill comes.  She charges us $4 for the $1 salad.  Five mins later we get her attention.  She fixes the bill, we pay (and far undertip our standard $20+ to 30%), and leave sticky.It's the failure to deliver the essentials that kills this place for me.  They're clearly cutting costs, and doing it in the wrong places.
I know what you're thinking. What tourist comes to Sin City and goes to a freaking movie on a Saturday night?! Though in my defense, I'd been fighting a cold all week, and when I landed into Vegas that Saturday afternoon for a work conference, the last thing I wanted to do is spend time in a noisy casino. So my partner and I decided to hightail it to the nearest theater, where we could digest our ridiculously giant dinners (thanks, Wicked Spoon) in relative quiet. First, this theater is super hard to find. If it weren't for the little sign in the alleyway, I never would have noticed it was there. The practically hidden location could partially be to blame for how abandoned-looking this theater is. (Well, that, and that there are a metric bajillion other things more interesting to do within a 1 mile radius). For our 10pm showing of an opening-weekend horror movie (Mama), there were *maybe* 15 people in the theater. Practically empty. Floors were sticky, seats were small, popcorn was stale, and employees were bored-looking and pretty lethargic. This theater is in dire need of an update. If I were a local, I definitely would not come back to this theater. If you're not too picky and need a respite from the more "traditional" activities Vegas has to offer, then it's definitely fine in a pinch.
For what you pay, the value isn't there: better to eat elsewhere.  The service is spotty (may forget about you for a while), the menus are a bit tattered, the place could be cleaner, and the food is not remotely on par with the price, although not bad.  I don't really recommend the seafood chow menu, but the tea seems decent (at lest not flat or bad).  Main perk is that it's open 24/7 and that the service is not terrible. Also, they're unable to split the bill between a hotel bill credit for food and any amount you might want to charge to credit (rather than room).
The young woman working the drive-up was incredibly slow tonight. She only had one speed. She tried to look busy by walking to various points behind the counter but always came up empty handed.  And I caught her looking at her phone.The guy who was maybe the manager also wandered around behind the counter.Meanwhile, the cars are stacking up behind me.I think they were hoping that people would give up and drive off.The food was actually good.
Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and "gooey" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)I got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed "boiled", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapatío), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!
Service was horrible!! Restaurant was VERY dirty! I eat here 5-6 times a month... different one over the valley.... this has been the worst! :(
For the price I was really expecting better. The bun on my burger was soggy and the meat was just ok. I had the salted caramel shake which was really good. The zucchini fries were good but greasy. If I were to come back I would just get the shake.
It's great gelato... but WAY over priced. I think I paid $6 for a single scoop of gelato. The most I've ever had to pay. I have to admit that it was really good though. Cocolini is located in the Venetian... appropriate I think. I guess they can really jack up the price cause it's vegas and people will pretty much pay no matter how expensive things are.
Great pedicure - rough salt scrub, hot stones, hot towels wrapped around my legs for $25. Then off to the nail station for a full set, gent had no clue what he was doing when attaching nail tips. Then I got to sit for 25 minutes while the woman finished another customer, even though I was there first. Royally upset and get to deal with three bloody cuticles now. Salon was somewhat clean and updated but nobody speaks even a small bit of the English language.
This is such an over priced establishment it's insane how this is a chain. In terms of price no way is it in the right ballpark, the burgers were super small and buying everything separate really sucks because you end up spending way more than with a combo.Service sucked the employees weren't very friendly or caring about a question I asked regarding the food. The manager seemed to be friendly when she was doing refills though.I will say the burger was pretty decent, I was just shocked by how small it was, especially for 6$. The shakes were absolutely abysmal. If I knew that the red velvet shake was just a strawberry shake with red velvet cake chunks in it I probably would've passed, but I guess you have to learn the hard way. This place is just a combination of Smash Burger and Steak n Shake just double the price for not really adding anything new or exciting into the mix. Really disappointed I didn't go elsewhere.
My husband really likes this place.  They provide all you need to wash your dog at a reasonable price.  In addition, the wash for the dog is about counter height which makes it easy to wash your dog without the back pain.  Here's for my bad part of the review.  The last visit, the employees were offering dog wash cards to the customers.  However, it wasn't offered to us.  Sadly, we couldn't help but think about some type of prejudice against us.  Did my husband look like a thug that day because he was wearing a beanie in the cold weather?  Or are they prejudice against the breed of our dog, an American Bully.  Whatever the reason, we were paying customers and didn't feel like we were treated fairly by simply not being offered a dog wash card.
First time at Chili's and probably my last... The food was okay but not amazing, definitely cheap prices. The service needs a lot of work as well as their management. Messed up our order multiple times and no apologies for it... You'd think as a manager you'd want to make sure people eating at your restaurant get great customer service... (not the case here). Also waited almost 25 minutes for our first refill when multiple servers passed by our table seeing 6+ empty glasses... Not impressed what so ever with this restaurant, SMH.
We have stayed at El Cortez 5 times so obviously we liked it. Key word is liked. Bad experience from the moment we arrived. We pulled in to the valet and instead of a hello or welcome the valet stated "I need to see your room key" when I politely informed him we had nor even checked in yet and without a word he took our key and car. Check in process was extremely lengthy, we had booked a Cabana Suite, our first time staying in that part if the hotel. They had no rooms ready and it was after check in time. We finally get our key and head over to our suite. Seriously, it was the saddest excuse for a suite ever. The room was TINY and uncomfortable. The room was dirty and had the worst lighting. There was no where no put your bags so they had to be placed on the already cramped floor. The cabana suites are more expensive then the regular rooms. If you are planning on staying there, don't bother upgrading to a suite, you will be quite disappointed. The service on the casino floor was terrible, the worst I've ever experience. I spent about 2 hours gambling at a machine and not once did a waitress come by to offer a beverage. I took notice that they only ask the people playing on tables. This has not been my experience at any other casino, ever. I am sad to say that is probably our last time staying there.
Went to Blue Hound for brunch today and I left  disappointed. I ordered the the brioche french toast ($12) and received one piece of toast that was marginal at best. If I am paying $12 for a piece of toast it better be exceptional, which was not at the case here. My husband ordered the spanish omelette which was decent, both portion size and taste wise, but the taste was still nothing great. His biggest complaint was that his coffee was not offered to be refilled one time. Service wasn't terrible but it was lacking, just as the food was. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I won't be going back.
I am a big fish taco fan, and to my disappointment this place did not live up to the hype. Food was just average. Margaritas are just alright. The ingredients seemed cheap. Perhaps their fame comes from being the only Mexican restaurant in NoDa, I wouldn't dare to say it is because of their food. I had the blackened mahi mahi signature tacos and  "meh" is all I have to say. Best fish tacos? Seriously?? Only if you have low fish tacos standards.
This restaurant is so loud inside that one cannot reasonably speak to their dinner companion over the plastic topped booth tables.  The open kitchen adds to the chaos.  We had the sea bass and crabbed stuffed chicken.  Both were dried out and over cooked--possibly pre cooked and put on a warming table.  When I spend $100-150 to go out for dinner, I expect a good ambience, great food, and a full menu.  Except for the service, this restaurant had none of the above.  We suggest other restaurants in this area.
I went to the Fragrance department to pick up a bottle of Versace cologne and the sales lady rang my $50 gift card up as 50 cents. She couldn't back out of the charge on one computer, so then we went to another one, where she couldn't get the gift card to go back to the original amount. She called someone on the phone and when she got off she said, "They said our system is down and you'll have to wait for 30 minutes." She asked if I had other shopping to do and I indicated that I didn't. My son and I then had to walk around the mall for 30 minutes, with other errands to run that day. When I returned, the card went through. NEVER did this employee take responsibility for her error, and NEVER did she once apologize for the inconvenience! If she had only done that, I would not be writing this review. Pathetic customer service, especially when I am buying an $82 bottle of cologne!
The queso is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican cuisine. This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Hence making it a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the chips and salsa set for the table - delicious. I ordered a bunch of queso for the table, and I started with a Tortilla Soup. It was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that it was kitchen scraps, and it looked the part. It was light tomato broth with a bunch of vegetables, a gob of cheese and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top. It was lousy and I wouldn't recommend it.We ordered a pound of chicken fajitas and a half pound of vegetable ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee). It went surprisingly far for five of us... but the veggies weren't grilled much, which is sad because they were otherwise delicious. Also, the chicken fajitas only had one piece of green pepper and one of red on top. It should be lush with peppers and onions that have been grilled or possibly even caramelized (the onions).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of onions," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow peppers. The fajitas were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent - cheese, lettuce, sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but it fails on almost everything. It's a true shame. This place needs to be on Restaurant Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the service was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her water. Very disappointing. The waitress first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that "we're not dirty, it's just the food smell." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a soda from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker room... it was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.
Went with a group of 9. Service was ok. Food was not tasty. Most remained their lunches. We tried their burgers, flatbreads, bowls, sandwiches. Nothing was impressive and honestly was bland. This was my third visit and likely the last. Unsurprisingly it wasn't that busy at the normally hectic noon hour
This place could be good, but needs work. I ordered 1 roll, spicy salmon roll. Was made traditional but had just the salmon in the middle with sricha dabbed on outside, for a very American style sushi place this feels to me lazily made. (Salmon tasted fine)  their happy hour was $$. 2 rolls for $9.95. Ug where are the basic $3.50 California or spicy tuna.  I also ordered 1 salmon tuna nigiri, was ok not good quality. And I ordered tankostu ramen. The ramen and veggies were tasty and meat but the broth was boring. It had no flavor.  This place could be good. I hope in the future.
Came here for lunch with my friend and her boyfriend. I ordered gluten-free tomato basil penne, which is a new menu item and my friend got the buffalo chicken potato skins which was a new flavour as there were other potato skins on the menu previously. We shared a dessert which was go nuts donuts, which is warm donuts stuffed with Nutella and sprinkled with icing sugar. The waiter was nice enough to bring us both the English toffee caramel sauce and peanut butter sauce when we asked for both since we could not decide which one was better.I did like the food, but everything on the menu looked quite expensive for lunch, I didn't really see any lunch specials and there was a lack of vegetarian options. There were vegetarian dishes, but it was severely limited, so you'd be stuck with whatever they offer on that option rather than having anything to pick from. The restaurant is very focused on meat, all four salads on the menu contained a heavy amount of meat. If they could improve their menus, I think I'd give it a better rating. Also, I was looking forward to trying some new advertised dishes on a Kelsey's promo that I got in the mail, but almost none of those items were available at this location, so I was disappointed because I already knew what I wanted to order thinking they'd have it. I've been here numerous times as I live close by and I even once held a birthday party in the past here, in which the experience was quite pleasant. It's nice to come here at night whether for dinner or late night appetizers with a drink. I would return and would recommend it to others, but would not specifically recommend.
Nothing to write home about. The ambience was nice and the service was friendly. We ordered take out. I got The Rebel, my husband got the Spicy Salmon Nabemono and my friend for the mix-n-match. The flavor was good. Not great but good. You can definitely taste that there are high quality ingredients used but it was nothing stellar. Now for the portion sizes. I would give that one star. All three of us joked about going out to dinner AFTER we had finished. The portion sizes are small and do not warrant the high price tag. After all My wrap plus iced tea was $17 without tax! Not something you expect to pay for a wrap a few pieces of lettuce and an iced tea.  We will not be back. We feel like FOX concepts struck out on this one. If you want great flavor, high quality and better portions do take out or eat in at True Food Kitchen.
Slipknot concert 8/29/15 - was in the lawn, the music sounded horrible. The sound would get quiet and soft occasionally the guitars would get turned up but then down again. I could talk to the person next to me with out yelling (this is a bad thing) why would you hold a concert in August in Arizona? Thank god for the water  cannon that would spray the crowd down every now and then. My expectations did not meet my reality, the bands performance was great, fix the sound. I went to listen to some loud heavy music what a bust. Oh and direct parking better as well!
Not what it use to be. We've had more than one bad experience. There are plenty of employees working, but somehow no one is doing the right thing. Waiting way to long to be seated, to long for water at the table, no one sure whose table it is. Brunch took 3 hours and not because we wanted it to. Terrible service. Gave a 2, because our food was good. Just took forever to come out. Just not acceptable. There is obviously a management issue, as there is plenty of staff and they are polite, eager and capable. They were not busy, lots of empty tables. I think there is misdirection. Obvious issues on many visits. Last visit for us.
My boyfriend had been talking about this "amazing" French toast he had at the Cheesecake Factory when he ate there with his family, so we finally made it over there for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bruleed French Toast and he ordered the Farm Fresh Eggs, scrambled/well, with potatoes, toast, and bacon (meat is extra). We planned to share so we could have a little of everything. I was surprised that they brought out the complimentary bread before our brunch, but it was almost lunchtime. I sure do enjoy the honey oat bread. Sourdough is alright too.When our food came out, I took a bite of the French toast and was instantly turned off by the mushy consistency. It's so thick and, I'm sure, soaked in egg. It was not appetizing to me. My boyfriend offered to switch plates since he'd had it before and liked it, so we did. The eggs were fine and maybe had a little seasoning to them. Most of the potatoes were crunchy, so I was not impressed. The bacon was really dark red in color and very crispy. I don't know if that means it is extra lean?? The toast was really not necessary after all the bread I had just eaten...Overall I was not pleased with this meal, especially for the price! And I had a stomach ache afterwards. There are so many other places I'd prefer to get breakfast food. Our server did not really have a sense of humor either.We did get a couple slices of cheesecake to go, for good measure. Vanilla Bean and Lemon Meringue. Unfortunately the meringue had melted off the top by the time we got it home... The vanilla bean tasted a lot like vanilla ice cream. So it was good, but even half a slice was too much. The lemon meringue was rather tart but the whipped cream helped to balance it out. I've enjoyed other varieties of cheesecake more than these two.
I've had better. I come from the Bay Area where Asian buffets come a dime a dozen. My BF raved about this place and being a sushi lover, I of course had to try it!We went for lunch after doing some shopping and we were seated very quickly. Selection wasn't as good as I had hoped for and they didn't have signs listing what kind of sushi you were eating so you were in the dark. The beef terriyaki was good and I ended up eating mostly that.So why the 2 stars? Why not 3? Because my stomach was not happy - AT ALL - an hour after we left.
They don't seem to fully have their gas dialed in and I tried 3 different beers and they were near flat. I saw one guy at another table and his beer looked carbonated but his friends was flat and I asked him and he confirmed.  The bartender was nice enough but  told me (in his own words) its because it's micro brew and Im used to "Coors Light".  I tend to steer clear of the large and light shitty beers.  This is the 2nd newish bar Ive been to and the beer tap operation hasn't been sorted out. So I think its a new bar thing, I'm sure in a few months they'll figure it out.  Please don't scapegoat the customer by assuming everyone but you drinks microbrew.  This wasn't cask ale they were serving up, this was ales, lagers I tried.atmosphere is nice and staff are friendly.  I don't think the guy was trying to insult me but its rude to be like,  our beer isn't flat you're just used to shitty beer.
They have come out to our house twice on service calls and done what we've asked them to do with no problems. We gave them a call because they had serviced the previous owners and we had their contact information. Their work on the service calls was 5-star.The 2-star rating has to do with some estimates they provided to help repair some issues with our pool. I think, in general, pool service work is overpriced - "if you can afford a pool, you can afford high prices" seems to be the prevailing thought that I've found thus far. Their prices were in line with other quotes we received. However, we had a particular issue with our spa side remote - the buttons did not seem to work and turn on the specified functions. They quoted us a full replacement on this that came close to $1000. When I did some more research on my particular problem, I found that the side remote was simply not programmed - I programmed it and now it works fine. I was appalled that they would have taken my $1000 for what amounted to programming a perfectly good remote - this makes me very suspect to use them for any of their other estimates, and when I need to get that work done will go elsewhere. I feel that they should have known that the remote was not programmed when they made the service call and feel that thy were trying to fleece me with this one.
Generic menu (salads, burgers, and steak). Highly over priced steak for the quality of the cut and meal. The foods ok here. The restaurants at a nice spot with a great view of the lake. Make sure you walk all the way to side of the restaurant and sit by the bay window.Looks like there was only one server for the whole restaurant during lunch. Props to the lady giving us good service.
Local florist.  Review is based on special services.  Site and shop offers traditional bouquets for all occasions, however, they do not offer any email contact for events like weddings.  I'm not local so it is difficult to find out quotes and information from Freshland Flowers without calling or going to the shop in person.  Dated consumer service system.
Do your intestines need a workout?Do you miss your toilet and would like to spend some quality time with it?Well.......come to Carambas!Yes, for a limited time only we can pummel your digestive system with 2 pounds of slop that we like to call the wet burrito!Thats not all folks! Throw in a plastic bowl of stale chips and day old salsa and you're in for a real treat!
Stopped in for carry out. I didn't have great expectations after reading some of the reviews, but I wanted to try it out. I was really hoping for a great Japanese restaurant on the north side of town and, unfortunately, this isn't it. I was promptly greeted by a friendly server. He didn't have much experience, but he tried his best. The menu is pretty limited (I didn't see any poke on it) so I tried two rolls. The Tiger roll was the better of the two, but I wouldn't order it again. The spicy tuna roll was covered in mayo and that dominated the flavor profile. Even after I wiped as much of it off with a napkin, it's still mostly what I tasted. I ended up finishing the Tiger roll but threw 1/3 of the tuna roll away.
My husband I went there a few weeks ago because the menu reminded us so much of a little gem we found in NYC a few weeks prior - we were craving some more!  So we thought this would be a great local find.  Maybe it's because we had such high hopes based on this other restaurant, but Flower Child misses the vision.  We likely won't return since the prices were just too high, the quantities too small, and the service was so-so (only brought us food, never followed up or checked on us). If we hadn't studied the menu before going in, it would have been confusing to order. We were still hungry after spending $30-40 for the two of us (no drinks included), so we went over to AJ's next door to pick up some healthy snacks. We aren't big people, just healthy and fit, so we have a healthy appetite. Wish the healthy menu was healthier on our wallets and was more satisfying. Gave it two stars because at least it's trying.
I'm now convinced this place just isn't worth the hassle anymore. We used the NoWait app, which was fine enough. We arrived and waited another 20 minutes before we were seated. Fine. The reception and service though, are just pretty awful. First of all, we were asked to look on our phones for the menus on their Facebook page because they couldn't get them printed in time. Really? Couldn't even write them down on the chalkboard? Now I have to use my data to look up your menu in your restaurant? Then, you have to literally chase someone down to get any kind of attention, from checking in to getting refills for water or coffee. Even trying to get the check was a process. After a while I was so tired of waiting I just got up to the counter to get charged so we could just finally LEAVE. Oh, and 40 some people for ONE bathroom. Food was alright. My shakshuka was good but my boyfriend's omelette was just...an omelette. Definitely not worth the wait, which was at least 40 minutes. I've been here some 3 times now, and don't think I'm going to subject myself to this nonsense again. Spare yourselves the same and find somewhere else, where the staff will maybe care at least a little bit.
My gf and I moved to Bridgeland last week and yesterday we tried Main Dish. We wanted to pick something up to bring home because it was a busy night. We got coleslaw, 3 quarter chickens, mashed potatoes, and rice. The chicken was dry and one of the portions had very little meat on it. Also at $7.50 each they were overpriced IMO. The rice/squash combo was very bland and also dry. The coleslaw was too vinegary. The mashed potatoes were good except charging $5 for a little portion like that is unreasonable.  It's disappointing they advertise their meals as tasting 'home cooked' because that is not the case. It was about at par with the delis at Safeway, Co-op, etc. but more expensive.  The only plus was the service. The staff were friendly and courteous.
Love Trader Joe's, but this new-to-the-neighborhood location fell short of my expectations. My expectation is for the store to be well stocked. At least as much as Smiths, Whole foods, etc. no cucumbers, no lettuce, slim pickings on produce and even frozen food. Please step it up management on your ordering.Oh, and cute cart girl, when you see a customer walking toward the carts, don't shove the cart in your hand into the others, offer it to your customer.
Don't know why this place is so popular,very average food at best and OVER PRICED.You can get far better quality at Portillos.They don't even offer Italian beef sandwiches.I really wanted to like this place but by Chicago Standards it is sub-par ! Skinny winners,uninspired hamburgers,I have ate here four times,not worth the drive.I can't believe people give this place 5 stars,makes me wonder where they normally dine.
So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  Lunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.Co-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.TM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??Me:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.TM says she'll be back, and walks away.Me and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)We finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response.
A nice restaurant to drop in and have a drink...but that's the problem as East Fremont is growing there are plenty of nice places to drop in and have a drink. Love the ambiance and decor but the food is simply meh.  Think Chevy's meets Vanguard Lounge...except I can at least think of a couple dishes at Chevy's I like.I came here with several friends and one asked the server for nachos. The entertainment went as follows:Her: Can I please have nachos?Server: We don't have nachosHer: Do you have chicken, tortilla chips, salsa, cheese, beans, guacamole, and sour cream.Server: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.Her: Then you have nachos.Server: Sorry we do not serve nachos, this restaurant is authentic mexican.Her: [pout face]She then proceeded to order each individual item as a side and dumped them on her plate and made...yup nachos. So yeeeahhh, if it's not considered "authentic" I get if it's not on the menu but if you have the ingredients what's so hard about accommodating a guests request? She didn't ask someone to go slice up some beef stomach and make menudo. I guarantee it took more energy to individually prepare and serve those items, then to just dump them on a pile of chips. I don't get it, anyway, rant over. The food is subpar and considering that there are multiple "authentic" Mexican restaurants within a two mile radius, this place would only be good for a quick drink.
Came here with my husband, BFF, and her boyfriend... It was crowded. The wait that was "30 minutes" ended up being an hour at least. And no one mentioned that it would be longer or anything like I don't know ... maybe something that would be the job of the hostess?  The employees here seem a bit... cardboard and detached from reality. Me and my best friend sat at the bar to wait (glad we did with the ridiculous wait) and the bartender never came around to ask if we wanted a drink.  My friend's boyfriend had to go all the way down to the other side to order a drink though the bartenders machine that he was staying at was right in front of us. The "loaded fries" were skinny tasteless luke warm fries with sour cream lightly drizzled on top of them with a dash of bacon and a pinch of chives... on top of some nasty cheese sauce that tastes like it came out of a can. Does that sound loaded to you? The burger was pink even though we asked for no pink. I found the burger to be vastly overrated and quite mediocre. Especially for the price. The egg was gooey tasting on our breakfast burger and the patty had no flavor but was juicy. The bacon added no flavor either but a slight crunch though the burger turns into a gooey, sloppy mess half way through. The bun was also basic considering the attempt of the establishment to appear 'high end'. And everything is 'a la carte' a fancy way of saying you are going to have to pay $7 for chintsy  "loaded" fries (because they don't serve fries with their $10 plus burgers) and $12.50 for the burger. The server was also not friendly and everyone who worked there had that aura of trying too hard which is never appealing. I won't go back here- this experience just sealed the deal.
All reviews are based on price point...Getting tired so a bullet point review:-- renovations don't bother me-- not having hot water one morning was unacceptable-- telling the front staff and being dismissed...unacceptable-- no coffee pot in rooms...I enjoy coffee in the morning and tea in evening-- beds are very soft...tough on the back-- for towels the first day, two thereafter...one towel needed to soak up the shower water that splashes out of the glass enclosure--  there are better places to stay
Meh, not impressed. The portions are small which is fine, it's the pasta that's the problem. Way undercooked pasta, with watered down sauce.....yuck !! And it's a pasta place!!!!!!!!!!!! The chicken piccata and veal marsala were fine, as well was the bean soup & Caesar salad. Ordered the broccoli rabe, it was over cooked to the point of almost mush. The best thing we had was the caesar salad.
After many years of enjoying and recommending Kaya, I am reluctantly forced to downgrade it from 4.5 stars to  2.5. As uncharacteristic as it is for a Big Burrito Group establishment, I must sadly report that the  service and food quality have diminished to the point of  consistent disappointment.
I'm going to open up this review saying that I have several tattoos and have been into many tattoo shops in my lifetime. I am not just some college girl who wants a tattoo on spring break. Saying that, this shop had a sign out Halloween weekend for $25 tattoos. I had a couple pieces in mind that I wanted to get done (most importantly my San Francisco Giants tattoo) so I decided to just go inside and see what the dealio was. They were doing Halloween-themed only for the deal. I jokingly mentioned that mine was orange and black. When I told them what it was I wanted, one of the artists said disgustingly, "I won't do that for $25." Wow that was rude. All you had to tell me was that it didn't work for the Halloween special. Now you lost a potential customer. If you are trying to get foot traffic, being rude to your customers isn't going to help. I'll just go back to Tattooed Planet, where I don't feel judged for being a young college girl.
Why do I continue to still go here? Cold fries and didn't get the ranch with my Ched'r peppers and no ketchup I asked for. Is It that difficult?
Not worth the money. Bad drinks and equally bad overpriced food. The pay roll was bland and possibly the worst I've ever had. It made the $35 roll taste even worse. The mongolian beef is better at P F Changs.Service was good. Decor was very nice. It takes alot  for me to say these things about any place. Good luck.
I went in with a 7 day free trial pass that they completely ignored and they convinced me into signing up for a month to month membership with a three day cancellation window and the added bonus of waiving the (utterly ridiculous) $75 enrollment fee. That really should've been my first clue.After two visits over the course of two days where I found out the pool was less than spectacular and a number of their cardio machines need maintenance, I decided I was fed up and took advantage of the cancellation window and thought that would be the end of it. Of course, it wasn't and I got a lovely surprise this morning when I discovered that, despite cancelling within three days, they still withdrew the $30. Classy.The one bright side of this entire mess is that I'm supposed to be refunded my $30 in 7-10 days, so here's to hoping that will actually happen.
Was excited to have a dim sum place in Madison. We ordered a bunch of different dishes. 7 total which is a bit too much for two people but we're able to take them home. We were disappointed in the Xiao Long Buns (Baos). There was no juice in them. Typically, you eat these with a spoon. You place one on a spoon and nibble some of the top off. Then you proceed to slurp out the super yummy juice. Anyways, these are more like steamed dumplings though the meat was very mushy and wouldn't hold its shape. It seemed like they used a lot of fillers, possibly flour, that made the meat act this way. I would recommend the pot stickers instead though there were a LOT of chives. The deep-fried dough sticks was the best dish we had. It's best to eat these hot. Although they do mention *picture for reference only, please prevail in kind* on the menu, it was disappointing to get no veggies in the vegetable crepe. There are absolutely no greens on the dim sum menu. Instead it was filled with different types of fungi. It would have been nice to have some real veggies in it. On to the sweets - the deep-fried sesame balls are good. The outer shell was a bit harder and crunchier than I have had before, but overall they were tasty. The puffy egg custard tarts are good though the shell is a bit in the buttery side. The flavor is good though. The service was good and attentive. They speak both English and Mandarin. I didn't hear any other dialects when I was there. If you have never been to a dim sum place, they will walk you through it. Basically, just mark down how many of the dishes you want. You can always request more later. Each dish will come one at a time so expect a wait in between dishes. For those who have had good dim sum, you may be disappointed. Things are on the greasy and salty side, as others have mentioned.
The food is good but the portions aren't very generous for the price.  I ordered a salad to go for the 1st time and it seemed about half the size of the dine-in size.  Oh well, maybe I just eat too much.
Well... I liked the organisation of the store and the staff are really helpful. BUT what I also noticed was that the games were pretty darn expensive for used games, I guess if you're a "video game collector" these prices are ok, but  for someone who just wants a game to play... no I will not pay $30 for a game that during it's day was only worth $20... I think that next time I'll just hit up the Cash Converters, where I can get a game for any of the old systems for under $15
I really wanted to like this place because, yes, I'm one of those people that loves a great chef.  Maybe it was tinted by the fact that we had a few days of such wonderful meals elsewhere (Craftsteak at MGM for dinner and MOZen at the Mandarin for Sunday brunch were awesome) but this was really mediocre. Lobster tacos were just fine, my husband had the salmon and had the same response. The best selection would be mine which was the vegetarian chili relleno and I'm not a vegetarian. It was very flavorful and crispy; we both liked it best. My $16 margarita was so tasteless I ended up not finishing it. We realize that when we come to Las Vegas it is expensive and we expect that. When we went to Craftsteak, we spent $300 including the tip (we don't drink much) and we felt it was well worth it. But we left Mesa after spending $150 with tip and felt robbed. The service was good though.
I'm sitting here still at the vig waiting for about 20 minutes while our waitress Sierra  chit chats away with the host Instead of  checking us out. This has absolutely been the worst experience I've ever had. I usually go to the downtown vig but decided to come to this location since it's closer. Boy do I regret this so much. She didn't take our kids drinks orders and walked off in the middle of me trying to place my order which was extremely rude. All of our drinks remained empty for most of our meals. This will be my last time coming.
Utter garbage. Service is abysmal and the food isn't much better. I got excited by some of the novelty items on the menu like bangers in a blanket and Irish nachos but everything was terrible. The cooks make the food and bring it up from a flight of stairs. I don't understand what the waitresses are good far.
I ordered the fettuccine, after trying to figure out the menu, sigh.  I've worked in several Italian eateries/restaurants so I'm pretty familiar with  consistent and quality Italian food, which this was not. The noodles were rubbery and I can tell you that's from being over cooked and left out too long. Very disappointed. The carrots were fine but that's not saying much. I didn't finish my meal.  The place was clean which is good, the music was great, but really, it's the food that's supposed to speak volumes about your reputation and it definitely didn't. The manager Debbie, was very courteous and pleasant. But I won't be going back.
Normally we love Papa John's, but they don't deliver to our place.  We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store.  Our mistake we ordered from here.  That's ok.  It was our mistake.However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  It gave us a time.  It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  They were just putting them in the oven.  So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.The pizza was fine.  It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.  But....it's not worth the trip and while I gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time.
We were underwhelmed. My boyfriend had eggs benedict and everything was overcooked or lacked any real flavor. Came with a thin side of burnt to a crisp barely edible hash browns. I dont know how you could make that meal bland but they did it. I had their buscuit special with eggs. The eggs were dry and taste like they were going bad. The biscuits were served cold and again, everything was bland. Its not the worst resturant, but I wont consider coming back. There are much better places out there.
A disappointing meal here today.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, medium spicy.  It arrived not spicy at all, with about 3 peanuts, a handful of chicken and mostly water chesnuts.  What bothered me most was the quality of the chicken.  It did not seem fresh cooked and had a weird, spongy texture.  This place used to be great.  Not anymore.
Average burgers at best. If you like a frozen patty, this might be for you. Fifteen years ago this might have been good, today it can't compare to better/real burgers available..
Was not impressed....made a 7:15 pm reservation and had to wait almost 45 minutes upon arrival to be seated.  Then once we were seated we had to ask a passing server if there was someone for our table since 15 min had passed with no one waiting on the table.  Poorly ran front of the restaurant which takes away from the food which wasn't too bad.
over-priced place.no waffle cones. Soft, almost melting ice cream. I don't think I will return and pay $5 for a scoop of ice cream. There is also a sign saying you have to pay $1 if you take a sample but do not purchase. I know it's yourkville, but the quality is just not worth the price.
Thank you Eric M. for a response. However, based upon previous reviews citing the same issues of unrepaired broken equipment, the general state of the gym's cleanliness and  - one I didn't add - the fact that weights are thrown around the floor or not unracked - and the ongoing lack of attention to these matters over the months, I'm not really sure why responding to you one-on-one will help. The gym either fixes its issues, or it does not. If the proposed 24-Hour Fitness at Blue Diamond / Buffalo / Durango ever materializes, EoS will lose a lot of clients. Not a shill for 24-Hour, but from my experience, they have people who go around the gym hourly and clean up, etc. I have not found their equipment in constant of disrepair. I don't think the issue is the staff at this location, per se. The problem is having thousands of active members, but not paying for the appropriate levels of staff to maintain the quality of the experience, and equipment. It also didn't help that the contractor that was used was probably not the best. From the git-go, lots of things didn't work. That seems evidenced by the numerous electrical type problems - such as the stereo not working on all of the speakers in the gym, 50% of the TVs at any one time not getting reception, etc.Still, there is significant cash-flow to the gym and insufficient maintenance. Also, the layout / choices of cardio equipment not the best -but apparently the least expensive. I stand by my assessment of the gym being run by a company owned by an LBO firm intent upon strip-mining  our membership dues and fees. :-)
Good breakfast meals. Gluten free options. However, service is horrible. My mom and boyfriend came in way before a couple of other tables and we received our coffee after everyone else. I guess you need to be a table of young girls to get your waitor's attention. On a Saturday around 1pm, we waited to be seated for about 15 min.
The food is an A and the bier an A+, but the service is soooo unorganized it ruins the good parts.
Ok went Saturday at lunch time not to busy . We were seated quickly. That's when it all went wrong. The waitress was to busy talking to get our drink orders we waited about 8 minutes for her to quit talking to another employee to come over. We did get our drinks waited another 10 minutes  for her to come back and get our order. Everyone around us was given bread we had to ask twice before she remembered to bring it. Someone else brought out the food . It was good. But never got a refill or did she check to see of we needed anything else . Then when we she brought the check we ask about dessert she said u want it Togo . We said no then she was like oh ok . Then she dropped food on the floor and just kicked it out of the was hoping someone else would pick it up. Spook with manager on the way out he apologized.
We live in mountains Edge so this new location is pretty close. I give 2 stars because every time we have been there (5x now) the bartenders are soo moody, u never know what you're gonna get! We gamble a good amount of money and still get a tab for $60. We are locals, support all local bars and restaurants..but here is a joke. I hate to review poorly but I also hate leaving a place feeling the way we have on multiple occasions.
Due to the unprofessionalism of Alex at the Gilbert location, I've decided to cancel my membership. My family member and I were served with cancellation papers on the floor in front of other patrons which was humiliating and unprofessional. I was told that I could not have my family member train me which we complied. We took turns on the machines and even did our bicep curls side by side. Into our next circuit a PT walked up and handled us papers and said "your membership has been cancelled at this club". How embarrassing! We tried to explain that we followed their rules, but Alex insisted that he and his trainers saw otherwise. How dishonest! We were told that we couldn't come back to his gym, and that our accounts were flagged. When I inquired whether my daughters membership would be impacted Alex said no. My husband and some friends encouraged me to cancel our family's account only to find out that Alex had cancelled my account and my daughter's. How Rude! She had nothing to do with this situation. I'm only giving this review 2 stars because the Mgr at the Val Vista location was very understanding and sympathetic about the situation. I explained that I understand the policy, but as a paying customer I deserve respect.
I actually saw this show twice because my in-laws insisted that they take us to see a show. On the spot, I racked my brain for shows my husband and I both haven't seen and for some reason,  the name Mystere came to mind. Maybe I should have said Ka... The day we were supposed to go, I said to my husband, "What the hell was that show with the giant ugly baby called? Was that Mystere?!" After a moment we both realized, oh no, it was. And we both just totally forgot what it is was called. The show, obviously, wasn't really all that memorable. The second time I saw it, I still enjoyed all the acrobats but the side show attempt in comedy was still poor in my opinion. Some of the acrobats were amazing but I didn't really get their whole theme and felt it wasn't all that grand and surreal like how Cirque shows try to be. Just odd.
i wasnt really impressed by the meat or the selection of sides. i was expecting more and i was really excited to go since i hadnt had KBBQ in awhile. oh well guess have to go elsewhere. upside the decorations are awesome!
I think my review is based mainly on the fact that I'm over the age limit to be in here.  We came about a month ago with some friends to go dancing.  We got all decked out, had too many drinks at home and off we went.The place is so crowded you can't move on the dance floor at all.  My husband is almost 6'5" and kept getting ran into by teeny tiny girls who had no regard for their surroundings or people around them.After about an hour of this we headed out to another bar with less people and more room.Bottom line - if you are under 25, or out on the town for a bachelorette party this is the place to be...ride the mechanical bull, dance in uncomfortable confines and shoes....regret it in the morning.  If not, head somewhere else!
Eat N' Park is the type of restaurant where you can already sort of tell what's going to be good about it. They are big on the smiley cookies as well as the pies of the month. Those pies are delicious, and the strawberry one in particular stands out as one I have to have every so often.Why the two stars then? Well, when I have to actually go in and Park N' Eat (bad pun intended), my experience is much different. I've been here several times over the years, and service has ranged from fine to nonexistent. I've never had mean servers, but I have had aloof ones. I remember a couple years ago I had to wait 30 minutes between being seated and having my order/drinks taken with family, then another 30 until the food arrived. That could be forgiven if the place was packed, but it was just about empty. It may not be fair to add that to my opinion since it was not recent, but it's those memories of a place that stick with you.Onto the food, over the years the staple for the family and myself is the mile-high meatloaf. It helps that it's hard to screw up, but those have always been nice and hearty, not to mention filling. In recent months I have also had the chicken wraps. They are nothing special, though the buffalo one is much spicier than expected. I've had a couple of their seafood dishes as well, which I haven't cared for.I would not go out of my way to eat here, especially with two buffets in walking distance of the place. If someone was in the area and knew exactly what they wanted from there, however, then I'd go, since if you know what to get and are able to be a bit patient, it can be a fine experience. If not, it's going to drag.
You really have to be a vegan to enjoy the food here.  Most of the "meat" dishes are made from tofu, which I love to eat, but not when it's made to look like something it is not.  At first, the taste isn't too bad, but after a few bites, you realize you are not eating meat, the texture is just not there and neither is the taste.  Well, I gave it a shot, but no way could i enjoy eating this type of food consistently.
Pretty average spot. Italian food priced reasonably but won't really 'wow' you. I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut. Service was adequate. Is Baldwin street actually good?
This is about the only movie theater in Gastonia so even though they charge $10 for a ticket on a weekday, it still fills up fairly easily. Guess there's not much else to do around? Not exactly on my to go list, but as my date that night suggested we meet here to watch a movie I went with it.Walking in you're greeting by the smell of heavily buttered popcorn and plush purple carpet. My charming date bought a medium soda and some gummy fruits for a whopping $9. Then we saw the size of the huge cup of soda given out and balked a bit, just to give you an idea of the size of a medium. He remarked "I think this is enough for at least 5 people, maybe I've been in London too long". The theater itself was serviceable, not much to say there.Expensive weekday tickets, oversized portions that may give people diabetes if they manage to finish it to justify oversized prices and being extremely out of my way make this experience two thumbs down and just as many stars. My date better be glad that he was extremely charming and lovely or I'd have left slightly upset.
Neat when first walk in.  Then tables are terribly uncomfortable, menu is puny.  Food is average at best.  Too many other really good places!
The menu is very odd, kind of chinese but not really.  I had the dumplings for appetizer which were fine and the chinese short ribs for dinner which were disappointing, not nearly as tender as I had hoped.  I did enjoy the goat cheese mashed potatoes.  I wouldn't go back.
Upon arrival, the place was almost empty except for a large group and a couple of tables. Not what I'm used to when going for weekend brunch in Toronto. Even so, we had to wait 30 minutes for our food because they had a large table. They're not set up to accommodate a large crowd in the kitchen (even though they have the seating for it). We asked if we could get the fruit that came with our meal while we waited the 35 minutes for our poached eggs to arrive, and the waiter assured us he'd bring something out for us. Nope! He definitely didn't bring anything to tide our hunger over; even the fruit that is supposed to come with our meal. After about half an hour, out popped our stale-looking breakfasts on hot plates. Once the food arrived it was quite mediocre. The cod cakes on my Newfoundland Breakfast were good but for some reason the entire meal was nauseating. Not sure if the hollandaise was off or something. My friend noticed the poached eggs were too watery.One of the servers seemed quite inexperienced. The other was friendly and promised to bring our fruit out (and didn't). Not the best service, waitstaff or kitchen.One of the worst brunches I've ever had. My friend and I both felt nauseous afterwards even though we had different breakfasts. Only items in common were the fruit (which seemed fine), the eggs, and the hollandaise.
We shop at smiths all the time, we enjoy the value and quality of products we receive from this establishment....  How ever at first I could not remember why we stop shopping at this particular location until today..... The staff needs to undergo hospitality course.... everyone at this location are extremely rude to customers, (from the customer service counter, cashiers, floor staff, and manager)..... The Manager- the main staff member that's suppose to set an example (I wanted to talk to him about the rudeness of his staff), when I over heard him yelling at the cashier (who went to retrieve him for me) stating their in a staff meeting and then slammed the door in the associate's face...... I walked out and said never again, I am done I have no respect for this location at all !!!!!!!!!!!!! Shopping here is not that serious... I refuse to be disrespected being a patron !!!!!!!!!!!! (I respect you and I expect it in return !!!!!!!!!)
Where do I start?We have been here many many times.We continue to hold out hope for this place because when the stars align you might get a tasty lunch at a very reasonable price. The lunches are 6 to 8 dollars with the usual soup/salad and egg roll with it. Portions are small but adequate.Various sauces do well to hide the taste of these fresh from the freezer offerings. Just 2 miles from Sun Lakes across from the Fry's Market. Come as you are. Teeth are optional.
Had to get them to wipe the dash they missed the center part and they use very little soap on your vehicle I will not go back
I have been here when it's busy and when it's not.  The woman at the front desk is condescending and rude EVERY time.  The phlebotomist seem nice but c'mon on now.
Monday Memorial Day) we called Oriental Express for take out. I ordered the Moo shu pork. It was very (hot) spicy. I couldn't eat it. I also ordered the Wonton soup. My wife ordered the Beef Broccoli and there was hardly any beef in the Beef & Broccoli. She said the egg roll that came with the dinner tasted nasty so she did not eat it. This place serves just plain below average - average Chinese Food. As for quality,  sometimes well, you don't get what you pay for. Yet I was torn between giving it "meh" or "A-OK".  That's because their wonton soup is excellent.  So I rated the place 2 stars.
Hilton just has not got their act together with this property.  Noisy, no coffee available in the morning, service is cold, decor is something out of a playboy magazine.  No, not good.  Not worth it.
This review would of have 3 stars if there wasn't a hair in our food. The food taste great but I would not order the meat meals unless you enjoy soy products. We ordered the orange chicken, hot and sour soup, beef sizzling plate and egg rolls. The soup and egg rolls were my favorite. Their sister location VegeWay is by far my favorite vegan restaurant in the SW area! Who am I kidding it's really good but Wynn has better options. For the price, looking for fast, cheap, vegan food. It's the best!!!
I decided to try this place out as it was the only viet place around the area and I was craving pho. The pho was done extremely poor as the broth was very salty and dark which from first look you can tell its not very "traditional". The beef was super over cooked and aside from that I don't really remember much about it. For $9 (small) I can really find much better pho basically.My friend ordered a pad Thai instead which looked pretty decent.
I stopped by here for dinner and wasn't impressed. At first, I was standing in front of the al pastor because the menu above says "Express Line" under each description, so I naturally stood where it said the express line for the al pastor was. Then an employee came over and told us to order with her at another area. They really need to put up the signs better because it's confusing. If I'd been here before I'd know, but being this was my first time, I had no idea and just went with what the menu said. The lady who took my order was very nice and the inside appeared clean. I have to say the salsa/veggie bar is larger here than at most places with more of a variety. Our food was to-go, so we stood near the supposed "Express Line" and waited for our order to be up. I thought it was strange that the whole time I was there the al pastor on the spit wasn't turned on. No spinning meat, just meat there on the spit. I also never saw anybody carve any meat off for the tacos I ordered. Al Pastor Taco ($2) - Just meat, tortilla and if you'd like they will add pineapple at no charge. This was just bad. I only took 2 bites and then couldn't eat anymore. Some of the al pastor was so badly charred and the parts that weren't had zero flavor. They don't even out onions and cilantro on them! I kinda thought that was crazy to be honest. The menu shows what the tacos look like and they have onions and cilantro on them. If the meat and tortilla were good enough, it wouldn't even need anything else, but this wasn't anything tasty and I'd bet money the corn tortillas on my tacos came from a grocery store and weren't made on site. "Ranchero Al Pastor Taco" ($3.50) - This taco has al pastor, beans, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. The toppings saved me on this taco. While I only found one glob of melted cheese, the beans, sour cream and guacamole had good flavor. Those toppings helped me get the taco down thank goodness because that first taco just wasn't edible. Hubby had asada tacos and I tried a bite and spit it right back out because it was gristle. I wasn't happy with the overall taste of my food and can't see returning.
Beckett's achieved a neighborhood feel-good joint  that was rustic and casual; however, the high-end service did not meet the expectations of the food.I found the food lacking in flavor and pizazz.  Comfort food seems to be a fad now-days but for someone watching what they eat, this joint is not for you!They had some great choices for wine but all three of the entrees we ordered were dull and flavorless.  We ordered the zucchini appetizer which was nothing exciting.  We also ordered a fish entree and short rib entree which lacked major flavor and disappointing to the palate.  We  will only return for the wine in the future.
Blah. Tacos and empanadas are not up to par. I would not even compare it to the Filbertos on every corner of Phoenix. Very Americanized tacos, which lacks flavor and spice.
The rooms stunk. It smelled of strange cleaning product. Didn't like the location as it was in an undesirable area. It didn't feel safe to walk around at night. A motel guest was blasting music between 11 pm and 1:00 a.m, which could be attributed to the thin walls or lack of action from the motel night staff. The cleaning staff were unfriendly. They did not greet or even acknowledge us as we crossed paths. However, the front desk ladies who checked us in were nice even under pressure of having to turn guests away during the busy long weekend. Overall, my wife and I would not stay here again or recommend anyone to stay here. We appreciated the low rates during the holiday weekend but for more rest and peace of mind we will stay with a different franchise on our next visit to the Tempe area.
This restaurant deserves more than 2 stars because the food is great like it should be at any tk restaurant. However, the service we received while dining at the bar was so mediocre that the excellence of food couldn't even save the experience. The bartender helping us seemed like he had no use of his own brain. One mistake after another, and in place of recovery we received a couple of insults. This won't stop us from dining at other tk locations. Writing this review and hoping that management will read it and do something about it.
This was my first visit to this location for Take Out last week.  The restaurant was located on W Charleston Blvd near the Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas.  I have been to a Pei Wei's in Denver a couple of times and have liked it.  I had an internet coupon for BOGO.  I ordered the Thai Coconut Chicken and the Broccoli Beef.  I specifically asked for the broccoli to be undercooked and the gal said that they always cook it that way.The Thai Coconut Chicken had tender slices of white meat chicken.  It was okay.The Broccoli Beef had yellow (old) pieces of overcooked broccoli and tough pieces of beef.  The rice was soaked with oily sauce.I will not be back to this location.
Okay, I've eaten here a number of times, and can truly say that I am un-impressed.  Once you get over the hype/ theme of the restaurant, you will quickly come to learn that the food here can be easily made at home.  Now here is my criticism :1. The food lacked flavor 2. The price for just a single pancake ($7.99) is outrageous 3. The food is never hot4. The coffee is always closed 5. The only free refillable drink here is waterOverall,  my brother enjoys this place but I can definitely miss this.
All I wanted was a haircut and style my hair for my b-day. My hairstylist was not happy she had to take me instead of her friend. Then the whole time they were chatting while cutting my hair right next to me. The hairstylist was in a rush to get me out, did a poor job in styling my hair. No hairspray or anything extra, only blowed dried. I could of done a better job myself.
This is my third time here.  We thought we bring our friend here, who is visiting from out of town. We signed in at 7pm. Place is busy!  But there were only 2 names ahead of us (party of 8 and a party of 3). Great, I thought!  Hmm, not so much.  We waited one hour to be seated.  Somehow, I saw at least 4 - 5 tables sat before me.  A party of 12 just miraculously was written in ahead of me and then sat. And the lady who signed in after me got bumped down when the server just added a name above her.Now, I worked in a restaurant before as a host. I know that when you do something like this it causes frustrations and disgruntled guests. Even if this was happening, for whatever reason, I don't think that it was right for the servers to leave the list out for us to see. While we were standing there we saw the server scratch names off the list and insert other names.Then if that wasn't enough, after we sat down we specifically asked for our order to be made in a weigh that is typical of other Korean barbecue restaurants. And the eyes and the stares that we got from the employees was horrific. We had to continuously ask for certain things and by this point the restaurant wasn't as busy so it couldn't have been that they couldn't accommodate these simple requests.  Rather, they just don't care for the customer at all.
Unfortunately this banks customer service is abismal anymore, my company has been banking with Pnc for probably 30-40 years at multiple locations and up until a few months ago we never had any issues but recently it is terrible. The tellers are rude to my employees most of the time and after an error that was their fault I spoke with the teller manager I believe her name is Brittany, who was incredibly unhelpful and rude. Now when my employees go there for daily business they aren't even greeted at the door now and the tellers are consistently unfriendly. Such a shame and difference from a few months ago when the staff was lovely and competent. Very unpleasant to do business here anymore. If you notice any positive reviews are from at least 2 years ago.
I was excited to dine here... Until I dined. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food--simply mediocre and along the same line of Chinese food I could get for $40 rather than $240. The dim sum was decent but the snapper was dry and the prawns and curry just didn't work for me. The nightclub, to add, felt like a cave and my party and I left shortly after being escorted in. I will say, however, service at the restaurant was excellent.
This place is conveniently located in the Stratosphere, but the food is NOWHERE near the quality of the price. I could have been unlucky or just picked the wrong dishes, but I felt a little robbed. The service was great - attentive, professional, and just charming. My water was never half full, and the complimentary bread was awesome. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and my boyfriend got the Mediterranean seafood linguine. The portions are really huge, which some people like, but I'd choose quality over quantity any day. His dish was full of seafood and linguine, but the seafood was not well-cooked (some was good but other pieces were rubbery) and the flavor of the sauce was really bland. My eggplant parmesan had a good flavor, but it was a tad oily and the side really wasn't well-planned. Every entree includes a side of either pasta or potatoes. Potatoes as a side didn't fit the eggplant parmesan, so I chose the pasta. I assumed, since Fellini's is an Italian restaurant, that the pasta would be good, but I swear the pasta I make at home is better. They served the spiral pasta with the most bland marinara sauce, no cheese or anything. It was something out of a cafeteria. The eggplant tasted really great; it was breaded and cooked well, so it melted in my mouth, but the sauce was the same average marinara sauce. Of course, like most chain Italian places, they put an overwhelming amount of cheese over everything. Overall, I would not go back.
First off, this place smells terrible inside. Second, the pricing is ridiculous for basically the same thing you can do on your Xbox or play station. I really hope I don't have to come here again, it's so loud, the only reason I'm here is to be the DD. The only good thing is that our server was nice.
First off let me say that the room wasn't all that bad, it was updated and we got an upgrade at check in. However, the pillows were so uncomfortable, they were stiff and felt like you were laying your head on a brick. The shower had really good water pressure (most hotel showers you get no water pressure), but it was too good, lol, it kind of hurt to put my face in the water. Now, the thing that knocked this place down so much was the elevators!! One of the elevators was super shaky, felt like it was going to break any minute. And they were SLOW. I would have taken the stairs but we were on the 17th floor.  I also liked the fact that we were in a central location on the strip. All in all, not that bad, however, I'll probably stay somewhere else next time.
This office is so unorganized. I've been here coming here now for about 6 month. But today was the worst. I have to drive 45 minutes to get to this office. So then when I get there you have to get this card before you can get your shot. So they tell me we're sorry we are out of cards. Ok... Then when shot lady calls me up for my turn (had to wait an hour just for that) i procede to tell her that the lady at the front said that they ran out of cards. Of course she's like you need a card. Maybe you should do something so you don't run out. Then on top of that I tell her that my asthma and allergies have been really bad this week. So she's like I can't give you your shot. Wow!! So I ask them could you ask the doctor if he could maybe prescribe some predisone because I'm having a hard time breathing and my inhalers are having no affect. So surprise surprise they can't do that either. You have to make an appointment for that. Wich of course will be like a month out. Now I have to suffer. Thanks for nothing!
I won't rehash the ins and outs of the menu, as many other reviewers have done this admirably.  We went for a late lunch (2pm) and the place was nearly empty, i.e. no wait.  Service was good but in all honesty, she didn't have much to do.  I ordered a custom burger, pink center on a brioche with lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo and ketchup.  It was above average but overcooked and not anything special.  The accompanying chips were also overcooked and not particularly tasty.  I really wanted to love the place, but for my money, I'll walk up the street to Murray Ave Grill for an exceptionally juicy, tasty burger that is actually cooked to order.
Today was my first time there, the environment and the staff were awesome but my barber (Jordan) was not skilled. To be fair, he didn't not have the proper tools for a 000 cut with a line up. My biggest issue is the price, I got a cut with a goatee line up for a massive $39.95!! WowI was going to go back and try again but my neighborhood barber charges me $20 all in so it's a no brainer. Good luck boys!!
We went for dinner and it was alright. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal! The pizza was soggy and the quinoa salad was alright.
I give beer 4 stars.. The food 3 stars... And the service 2 stars.  It took almost 30 minutes to get an order of wiener dogs at a time when no one was inside and only three other tables were taken outside (so they weren't busy).The beer I order also took 20 minutes to get after ordering. The food was pretty good, but I really thought the chef went a little crazy trying to make everything unique with unusual ingredients.Overall I don't think I would come back here.
The food here is amazing, but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been here 3 times and every time I hope that the service will be better but it never is. Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE.
I've been to several spring training stadiums and this is my least favorite. The concourses are small and crowded, making it difficult to walk around. The space between the rows of seats felt smaller than usual. But the worst was the handicap access. The parking attendants could not direct us to handicap parking. The front of the stadium has a ton of stairs and the ramp is off to the side. I will say I thought the food was good and I appreciated several vegetarian options. But my family would not attend a game at this stadium again. There are other stadiums in the area that provide a much better experience.
As a CAMBODIAN, this is the closest taste that is similar to my own. I would not recommend this restaurant. It is highly expensive for the crappy service like this.I walked into this restaurant and stood there along with many other customers and no waiter cared enough to ask us until I decided to walk down there at the cashier and asked where can I sit. This is not so friendly service at all. That did not end there. I've been sitting there with no one come to ask me what I wanted to order for like 20 minutes. Finally when I do, it took another half hour for the food to arrive.I spent 22$ for a bowl of soup, tiny little bowl of noodles, and two drinks. People you can eat at other Asian restaurant and more food than this.
Cannot complain about the food but the service needs to improve markedly to obtain a better review. Had reservations and had to mail almost 20 minutes before being seated. During that time I was asked my name several times as well as being asked if I had reservations. Several people who arrived after us were seated immediately, makes me wonder. Once we were seated it took 45 minutes to have the appetizer served, half dozen oysters? Later the waitress left the desert menu while my wife was still on her main course, leaving an impression like your taking to long. We originally had planned to go to the Hard Rock but wanted to try this instead and was very sorry that we did, no comparison as to service and quality. I would give them another chance in a few months hopefully they can address their problems.
Everything was going so well! You walk in, and a woman is making flour tortillas, and the service is as warm as their tortillas, but then they forget about you. It's been about forty minutes sitting here, And she hasn't even checked in on us twice!  Food is good, but service definitely doesn't want to make you come back.
Downgrading by 2 stars as was made wait for 55 mins over estimated time on a pick up order. This is the 2nd time it's happened. It was busy, but after spending $80 I would expect some gesture of goodwill since they admitted they lost my order after 2nd time checking up on it. Phone order 6.50pm, got food 8.10pm.
First impression:  Coming in i didn't like the parking lot the entrance closet to the building is actually the exit. When I get in two people are waiting come to find they haven't been helped yet. The staff seems to move slow and seems slightly depressed. The food is vegetarian but good. The coffee is good, I had a ice coffee macchiato. It was delicious. Went around 3pm and it wasn't crowded but they are open 24 hours. Will have to try a different time to verify if they are just slow or if it was the time of day.
It's good for an afternoon of coffee and deserts but DEFINITELY not a place to have lunch or dinner. I've had better pizza!!!!!
Average coffee. Decided to try Mayorga at the recommendation of a friend and was disappointed. The espresso lacked any kind of rich or creamy quality and tasted like a latte you would order at McDonalds or Sheets. They have a mixture of Torani and Monin syrups, and it would have been nice to know which flavor was what brand as Monin syrups are much better quality and probably would've helped. However, the staff was friendly. Prices are a bit expensive but hey, it's an airport.
The whiting (they ran out of catfish) was all kinds of bland except for a really strong fishy flavor (whiting is the least supposed to taste like fish), especially for "cajun fried", or was that what the bucket of hot sauce was supposed to represent? The jerk chicken tacos tasted nothing of jerk, the only noticable flavor was from the sweet thai chili sauce added on the side. The mac and cheese side was a congealed mass of fake cheese with some tasteless noodles to bind it together, and the rice and red beans were essentially that, a layer of rice with canned red beans poured over top. The only saving grace was my partner's cajun grilled tilapia, the highlight of the meal.
I wrote a bad review the other day before I had time to cool off. My gel nails started lifting after 3 days but I went back and told the girl who did them and she fixed the ones that were messed up as well as touched up all the others for no charge. Still a hassle to deal with though and they told me they can't do ombré style which is what I originally wanted.And the repairs have already begun to lift as well in less than a week....
Food menu is good but if you go with kids be prepared to wait over 2hrs---we got in at 1030 and got served at 12:16pm‍Not cool when you make reservations for your group and to experience such delays as other got there food and left....
I hate to give just a two star when I literally go to Starbucks daily. Sometimes more than once a day. But this experience was super annoying. Customer service however is great. They are very friendly and comfortable with their coworkers. But they cannot seem to get this whole coffee making thing correct.I generally order the same thing every time I get a Blonde Cinnamon Almond Macchiato for me and Americano  Nuevo for my bf. The girl at my Starbucks makes his Americano Nuevo on the clover. So I get here order the same thing. First the cashier doesn't know how to type them into the register, asks another guy and he tells me they usually do it w brewed coffee. I said ok but I usually get it this way is that ok. He says oh ye and tells the cashier he has to put it in as some other coffee and add a shot of this and a blend of that. I was confused but maintained my faith since I love me some Starbucks.The girl finally hands me the coffee( huge line up btw w only one cashier and 3 ppl stocking and "cleaning", 2 on coffee). i look at it and see bubbles on the top and automatically know its incorrect. Taste it and its horribly. Iwait for the second coffee and my bf comes in from next door. I tell him taste it, he asks what it it i said same thing I always get. no its not lol, yes it is.So I tell the girl its incorrect and she says do I want her to make it again , obviously it would taste the same . I wasn't sure if it was how she made it or what the guy wrote.She asks the other girl to make it over for me, But I wasn't impressed at all either way, so I said no just give me a caramel macchiato. I figured should be easy its a popular drink. The second drink came up as well, tasted so burned and gross. My bf didn't believe once again it was his regular drink. He said it tastes like Ikea coffee smh.First time we had more than half a starbucks coffee gone to the garbage.Never again!!
This gym is extremely overcrowded and I have often had people hovering over me when I have been lifting waiting to use the machine I am on.  The front desk staff is not friendly at all.  Whether it's 5am or 3pm instead of saying hello and scanning your key pass, they just stick the key scanner on the counter and put their head down.  There are many times that there are 2 people at the front desk.  Instead of being attentive and scanning your key, they are more concerned about the conversation the two of them are engaged in.  This is when I wish they would just revert back to ignoring you and putting the key scanner on the counter.  I have often asked questions at the front desk about hours, such as a holiday and have been given the cold shoulder.  I feel management needs to train their staff better.  After all if it wasn't for people and their memberships, none of them would have a job.  Another issue is all the women take the smaller pound free weights into the fitness classes and so we are left without any on the racks.  A friendly hello and goodbye would be nice and some attention to the facility.  Also, the spin classes on Sat are ridiculous! You have to get there almost 45min prior to the class starting.  The people that have attended the 1st spin class sign up for the 2nd spin class so there are people that do not get a chance to even attend 1 class.  Then when you do get into a spin class people save bikes and you don't have a choice when you are one of the first ones that got there.  I think management needs to monitor things more.  I could not even tell you who management is.  You never see them or even know they are there.  With all the money we spend for our memberships, there should be more attention to things that need to be changed.
Overpriced . Small portions . Very Americanized chinese food . One star for the white decor and another star for the goldfish aquarium .
Second time here... Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City. We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti & meatballs and a small cheese pizza. The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plasticThe spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more.. The sauce was also very flavorful and thick.The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor.. If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good & chewy. Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning. .
It was really hard to find, and the whole experience was underwhelming. The service was strange and borderline bad - the server sat us at a table where the lights were not working even though there were open tables that were properly lit, the server took my drink order and then forgot to take my friend's, and the server didn't ask how any of the food was during the entire meal. Speaking of the food, it was boring and just totally bland. The meat was overcooked, everything was under seasoned, and more of less every dish had an uninspired mushy quality. I would have given this place one star, but the wine selection was good and the interior was really lovely. Overall though - avoid.
My first time but probably won't return. We had a party of five and didn't get drinks or a waiter for about 20 minutes... then once we did order they gave us our drinks in plastic cups you get at Walmart... Our beer also was served in a plastic cup then we noticed people around us had glasses. So it was hit or miss, but once we did ask for a glass the server gave us attitude about it. We ordered a lot of food so the time in getting it was understandable. The prices we mild but I didn't feel like we got what we paid for. The pizza wasn't bad but the service and cheap plates, cups etc. wasn't a positive vibe.
I have so many mixed feelings about Eliot's Books! Have been here many times and made quite a lot of purchases. However, every time I have to deal with the staff, I come away feeling like sh*t.From a buyer's perspective, 4 stars: good place to browse, quite good selection (although many times I've gone looking for well known titles that weren't there), decent prices. Certainly the best used bookstore in this part of Toronto (there are two more within walking distance). When you are making a purchase, the staff seem friendly enough...BUT I've discovered that friendliness is limited to interactions that involve only pleasantries!From a seller's (and overall customer service) perspective, 1 star: I've only ever seen the same two men working here, and their manner is absolutely atrocious! First of all, FYI, they only buy books on Tuesday and Wednesday from 11:30-5:30. If you go any other time, they will be extremely dismissive, and will not even deign to give you advice about what sort of books they would purchase were they to give you the time of day. Once, after I tried to get *any* indication of what they'll actually buy, I was told "If you have Hemingway, I'll take it". Um, thanks for that clarity? In fact, they are extremely picky about what they will accept, so don't get your hopes up. I recently went with about 40 novels, all in excellent condition, ranging from classics (think: Dickens, Shakespeare, LM Montgomery, George Eliot) to more best-seller type paperbacks (e.g. Le Carré, Joshua Ferris, Kathryn Stockett), and he wouldn't accept any. I guess Dickens is not exactly the same as Hemingway, how silly of me! I've also tried to bring in more general science books, non-fiction best-sellers (e.g. about terrorism or the Italian mafia), classic political theory books, children's books, design books, Canadian Lit, anthologies of classic authors. I have NO idea what they would accept. Except Hemingway. I officially give up!Now, I don't totally blame them for their pickiness because space is limited, but there is something in the mannerisms of both people who work here that make me feel belittled and horrible when it's over. They don't use bad words per se, but they have terrible attitudes. You know when you have an interaction with someone where you keep playing it over in your head for days, and continue to feel awful about it? That is how I feel every time I try to ask them any kind of question.I sort of get the impression that I wouldn't patronized and spoken to so rudely if I wasn't a young woman. But of course, I can't back this up: it's just a hunch. SUMMARY: go there to browse for books, but trying to sell them books is a nightmare!
I generally like this place for going to sit down and eat, and sometimes I get takeout from here, too.  The food is always good and friendly in person service.  However, the past couple times I've called in to place and order for takeout, the people who answered the phone put me on hold and either forgot about me or purposely let me sit so long on hold that I'd get tired of waiting and hang up.  I was irritated the first time it happened, but then when it happened again recently, I was mad enough to come write a negative review on a good restaurant because you just don't do that to people who call in trying to give you good business.  I have been a good customer for years and to ask if i can hold and then never come back to the phone to take my order is rude as hell.  Bad business to do that.  Fix your phone skills Patron.
Expected amazing , not amazing. First I was the only one in line instead of greeting me he takes a phone call, not a quick one.I tried the lobster tacos at 13.18 for the very small portions I was expecting high quality tasting food, it was only average taste and too high price point for serving size.  The food wasn't horrible , but I wouldn't repeat.
the avocado had the consistency of a carrot. When I called back to complain I was told this is "Seasonal ". I guess one expect complete mediocrity during certain times of the year!  Close the place down!
there are some restaurants i frequent where i will order different things on the menu every time i go; chipotle is not one of those places. i get the same order every. single. time. i know what it should taste like because i have eaten the same thing at many different locations for several years. that's the beauty of chain restaurants, right? consistency and familiarity in a potentially unfamiliar place? i've been coming to this location off and on for the last year or so and it has been consistency disappointing.often times i will get a burrito bowl to go and take it home to eat it since i am LITERALLY 4 streets away. this might be a weird thing to look forward to, but when I get a to go order, i like that when i get to the place i am eating at, the steam from the hot food has melted the cheese inside the container. however, at this chipotle, i have to actually put my food in the microwave to heat it up because it was never that warm to begin with. how is it even possible for my food to be so luke warm when i am only traveling a few minutes away? in addition, almost every time i've gone to this particular location, there has been a to go order being made when i arrived. of course this is not chipotle's fault, but every time that's happened, i have been completely ignored to make the order. no greeting, no "we'll be with you in a minute", just employees pretending i don't exist until their 15 burrito to go order has been completed. why can't you let me order quickly in between? i know exactly what i want; it will take 30 seconds. my favorite is when no one has even arrived to pick it up by the time i have waited, gone through the line, paid and left. why are you rushing to make food for customers who aren't even RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU ALREADY? i am also then fully aware that i am getting the bottom of the pan food because the fresher stuff has been used for customers who aren't even there yet.chipotle, i have loved you for many years now, but i just can't go to this location anymore.
I only go every now and then because it's close. The servers are high-strung and not friendly. One or two of them will ask "how's everything?" but boy there's this one server that has awful service. The sashimi is nothing compared to Zipang or Roku but their ramen is delicious!
First I'll say that the service is OUTSTANDING! Possibly the best I've ever experienced!!And, second, I hated the food. I'm sorry--I'm sure it's good for many of you out there that love cheese, bacon and butter. I tried to order some non-greasy sounding vegetable sides but they were so heavy in cream and butter than I ended up only taking a few bites of each.I'm from the south and really, sometimes I would just like a southern place that does justice to what we ate most of the time--freshly picked field peas and a side of buttermilk cornbread with some serious raw fixin's on the side like green onions right out of the garden, freshly picked tomatoes and cucumbers and some home-canned jalapeño peppers (and once in awhile a side of fried okra). None of those were cream, butter and meat-laden and they were still awesome and yummy!
Never had a Vietnamese sandwich, its a good place to start ... the McDonalds of Bahn Mi. If your looking for the 'real thing' good luck in this valley. Lots & lots of poser's. Try the one over at 4 Peaks Brewery, it gets close to the real thing ... on a good day.
I had a lot of expectations for this place, but I have made more gourmet pb&j in my own kitchen. There is really nothing apecial about this place. I had a sandwich and then went to get some real food else where
We got this on Hotwire, as neither of us would have paid money to the racist blowhard namesake.I have to say, though, that being at a hotel that isn't part of the party-circuit, with no casino and no screaming drunk people was a relief.  We had a car, so we could drive everywhere.  Without a car, it is a schlepp.Everyone who worked here was super-nice.  You have to flip an electronic switch if you want cleaning, and we didn't know that. Our cleaning lady (Hispanic--and not a rapist, murderer or drug-dealer, maybe Trump should actually meet some diverse people before he gives his next speech) kept an eye out for our return, to tell us they hadn't done the room because we hadn't hit the button, and to bring us extra towels and coffee.  That was so thoughtful!  We ordered room-service once, and they let us order things off the restaurant menu that weren't on the roomservice menu, and the delivery guy was so lovely, setting us a beautiful table by the window.  They also had a warming box, so things were delivered quite warm.  Unfortunately my omelet, which I asked them to cook lightly ("please don't overcook") was very overcooked, and my friend's $6 bagels probably got their start in a Lenders bag.The hotel is, on a surface-level, very luxurious.  I loved the quiet-calm of the lobby, especially after being in other hotels to see shows.  What a relief!  Unfortunately, our room, on the 58th floor, wasn't soundproof enough to keep the trains out of it, and I was woken up every night, around 4 in the morning.That said, there's this weird discrepancy between the posh surface and the cheapness under the veneer.  There was stuff on the windowsill being held in place with plastic tape, labels that hadn't been completely removed from the sides of furniture (that you could only see from the tub) and a general sense of ethereality that made the veneer feel false.  The "kitchenette" had granite counter-tops and 2-element, flat stovetop, didn't include a single pan, knife, plate, or any instrument for cooking. (You can call housekeeping to request items, but who, really, is going to call?  It makes it almost impossible to cook because, say, you forget to ask for a ¼ teaspoon, and then have to wait for half an hour?) There was water damage inside the empty drawers.
Let's face it.for 20 bucks, all you can eat, it is decent.the meat was ok fir the price, the spicy pork was a bit too hot, but still good.the problem was servers.I had to look for them every time we need more dishes and every time they came,always lower the fire.never asked first if we need any thing.I think I rather go to Hwaro on decatur.felt like ignored.
Food was fine, but WOW the service.  There is just not a friendly vibe here.  We've noticed the same at Gallo, but not as bad as the waitress we had last night at Otro.   Drinks were slow to get to us.  The blond waitress last night seemed like we were almost inconveniencing her by being there.  At one point my husband asked for hot sauce or a spicy salsa to accompany his tacos and she seriously ROLLED HER EYES!  What are you 12?  Disappointed and won't be back.  There is too much competition popping up in this neighborhood for management to tolerate snotty waitresses.  Will stick with Urban Taco.  The owner comes out multiple times to check how things are, it's a warmer atmosphere and their food is just better.
On prépare ma crêpe bien avant que mon amie reçoive sa commande qui demandait plus de temps à préparer! Je vois mon plat être sur le comptoir et les lumières pour le réchauffez semblaient brisées, car après 10 minutes d'attente, ma crêpe était complètement froide! J'aime Juliette et Chocolat, mais je recommande d'aller à un autre que celui sur Saint-Denis! Toujours une longue attente et les plats sont rarement chauds, plus tièdes..
Great service without a doubt.  Decent space, though not particularly romantic (some harsh lighting in spots).   I've eaten there twice and while the food is fine, it's not something I'd return for.  Tonight I had a flatbread with goat cheese and eggplant and tomatoes. I think it was fine, but I'd suggest that it if it had been grilled, served hot, and maybe with a lemony dressing (as an example), it would have been a much better experience.  Similarly, the kale salad was okay, but the dressing was overly vinegary.  Nothing wrong with a simple oil/vinegar dressing, but it's also not something I go to a restaurant to experience. Overall, very friendly, respectful service with so-so food.
I'm writing this as I sit here. I got here at 7:50pm and ordered food at around 8:00pm.  We ordered two appetizers, one soup, two entrees, and one drink. It is now 8:27pm and one appetizer came out. We ate our appetizer pretty fast because we were famished. It is now 8:31pm and nothing else has come. The second appetizer came out at 8:35. We received the rest of our food at 8:43pm. We finished our meal, paid the bill, and left promptly at 9:01pm. Generally, I am a very patient person. However, tonight, I was irritated. I do not understand how it took almost half an hour to receive two fried appetizers and a cup of soup. I was also annoyed that they forgot the drink. I also felt bad because the couple next to us was receiving the same level of "service" and their child was really hungry. I have worked as a waiter in a similar restaurant of size and cuisine with the same number of staff members. Our average time from order to appetizer to entree was 5 minutes and 10 minutes. This restaurant somehow managed 27 minutes to appetizer and 16 minutes to entrees. I'm not placing the full blame on the waiter. I'm placing blame on the entire establishment. I will give credit that the food was good (note two stars instead of one) but it was accompanied by poor logistics, timing, and service. It was very disappointing and I have to say that I will not return.
Mixed thoughts on this hotel.The room was nice and electric black-out curtains were awesome. That was a nice luxury for the tired/drunk/lazy. The customer service I felt was condescending whenever I called the front desk, or one of the multiple concierges.  I booked on Expedia/Hotels.com and each time I called or spoke to the folks in the lobby, because I booked on a "Third Party," they treated me like some cheap coupon guy.  Womp.  WIFI is charged $10/day if you book for though a third party, also, I was told.  Rules are rules, but again, no need to be condescending.  HHonors members get allowed a code to get wifi, depending on who you talk to.  The cleaning team and security were all nice-Thank you to you guys!The parking.  Sucked.  Very difficult to find a space, with multiple cars "parked" waiting like hawks.  Long walk to hotel as well.  Not a good hotel if you want to drive anywhere else.The pool/jacuzzi is beautiful, however closes at 6PM.  Yes, closes at 6PM.  So after work I was unable to swim laps, or just sit and bake in the bubbles like a fat happy bastard.The lobby is beautiful, however, its bland and boring, even for older folks.  Waste of space.  All in all, I'd rather be treated as a guest, then just a number visiting Vegas.
Let me start off by saying the food is just okay, however the service leaves little to the imagination. A group of 4 of us were seated 40 minutes after putting our name on the list- and were informed they were full on the inside and no longer seating people there. After ordering and waiting for 45 minutes, we came inside due to impromptu rain which soaked the seats we were sitting on. Miraculously, they were able to find a booth upstairs after one of the people in our party put up a fuss. Unless you're willing to wait an insane amount of time for average tacos, go elsewhere. And my octopus tacos were burnt!
I love a good prime rib and had such high expectations based on other reviews that I was disappointed to find the food very bland.  There service is exceptional and decor is straight from the 40's which made it a fun place.   It was a weird to me that the waitresses wear uniforms from the 40's.  They actually look like nurses.  It wasn't too far from the strip but unless someone else pays their high prices we won't be coming back.  Still in search of that elusive good steak in Vegas.
Tried for the first time today. I had he Kung pao chicken it was not that good. The sauce was good but chicken was rubbery
My first time here. I ordered chicken with garlic sauce, hot & sour soup and chicken rice soup (in place of sizzling rice soup, which they did not have). The chicken with garlic sauce was the best of the three. The flavor was good and had a good amount of chicken and veggies. It also has some kick to it. The rice in the chicken rice soup soaked up all the broth making it rather gross. The hot & sour soup was also a huge disappointment. The broth was thin like chicken soup - there was absolutely no thickness to it, which I'm used to. It only had a couple pieces of chicken. The only pro was that it was open late.
I had been a loyal client to Oreganos for many years; today our relationship ended. I had noticed a steady decline over the past couple years based on some menu changes all geared toward bottom line profit. I get it, and have no problem with it, IF, the service and product remains consistent. For instance, you used to get all drummies when you ordered wings, now you get a mix and only 10. They've started using chips and now up-charge for waffle fries. The quality in the food product continues to decline while demanding more from the consumer. I made a to go order and after driving 20 minutes to get it and get back home I find that it's wrong (wrong type of wings) and one of the items was horribly made. I called and commented on the experience and although they reversed the charges (what they should do) I have decided that there are too many options with more consistency and care for the client. Putting profits before people is a poor model and Oreganos used to be an establishment where great food paired with great value was served by incredible people; that is no longer the case in my opinion. I bid you farewell and truly hope you get it back on track, I absolutely loved this place.
Green House came highly recommended while we were in town, but we were disappointed in the service.  Our food, on a sunday night,  took exceptionally long and not once while waiting for our food, did our server come over and check on us to see if we needed anything until just before our food arrived.  Our entrees - everyone ordered burgers - took an hour. The meal started off on the wrong foot , as we waited for another table to leave from the patio to accommodate our group of 8, while an empty table that could accommodate us sat empty nearby. We finally had to ask if it was an option, and wound up getting seated there, 20 minutes after we were told we were about to be seated.  Presentation of our dishes was also lackluster. Thankfully, food was quite good, but the rest of the experience was frustrating enough we won't return.
My experience here was ok. I am new to town and wanted to get my nails done on a holiday, fortunately they were open. However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency.
I LOVED my room. It was nice and modern and came with a refrigerator and a nice tub. The problem came when there was a call on the room phone from the front desk waking us up. We answered and no one was there. After laying back down to attempt to go back to sleep, there was pounding on the door and there was a man in the hall in front of my door who looked shirtless. In the end, he was nude. The security came up and for another 45 minutes or so, there was banging and yelling in the hall outside our door. We called the front desk back asking why they called us and the reason was because they thought the guy was coming from our room. No one apologized, said anything. I even reported it the front desk the night before and they mentioned there were other complaints and that the manager would call me back. I checked out Friday morning, I believe and there still has been no call. The reason I took the tome to complete this review is because myself and my daughter have been hotel hopping for the past 4 weeks because we have been displaced and this is the second hotel that let me down. Knowing that I am working hard daily and checking in at 9-10 pm at night, bedtime doesn't officially take place until about 11PM or 12am. So that was a huge inconvenience and my daughter has to be at her bus stop by 6:20AM. That was not nice at all.
Nothing notable about this place whatsoever except that it is extremely far from pretty much everything.If you live in the area and want a stagger-distance unremarkable common bar then this is the joint for you.Prices, service, and food are average.
Poke has been a new trend in the GTA around the past 2 years, majority of poke places are opened in downtown so it's always exciting to see poke joints opened up closer to me. They have a ton of variety. You can either build your own bowl or get one on their fixed menu. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of food they serve. Perhaps the protein they use isn't fresh? It's already premixed with zucchini and scallions and drenched in soy sauce. The quantity of food is fair and it does fill me up, but is it good? Or will I ever go again? Probably not. There's also a line up which I don't understand since it's not even good and I'm practically surprised by how high this place is rated.
good service , nice ambiance...terrible pancakes
So we have stayed at the Flamingo the past 3 years, the last week of July. This year will be the last. I should have listened to all the other recent reviews. We got the GO room floor 20, it stunk so bad like mold or who knows what, and a bucket sitting in front of the elevator for leaking water from ceiling. We called down to the desk and told them and they moved our room one floor up , with no smell. They charged us 80$ resort fee (they never did that in the past) for wifi etc. Had NO wifi connection the whole time I was there , and needed to check into my flight. Spent another hour at the desk complaining about this. Then the next day we had no air conditioning in our room. Yet more time at the desk trying to resolve another issue. The last thing I want to be doing on my vacation is complaining at the service desk. Oh and don't forget the food court was closed due to the plumbing issues and constructions going on in the casino stunk like sewage from an incident a few weeks ago. They did resolve our issues in a timely manner however , refunded our resort fees, free breakfast etc. Next time Ill be staying at the Hard Rock for the same price.What I love about the Flamingo ... The pool is always a BLAST !!!GO rooms are really nice for the price and you cant beat the Flamingos central strip location!They just really need to work on the rest of the property.
No surprise. Very basic grub served by tough looking staff. Overpriced. You get what you would expect from something owned by Sammy Hagar. Only went to take advantage of deal for frozen margaritas - meh. Skip it unless you are DESPERATE.
My visiting out-of-towners, extended family aren't really adventurous eaters, despite the fact they have a ton of places to choose from in Vegas, of all places, to eat. We decided on Mimi's since it's kinda like Chili's - everybody will be able to find something to eat. I went here on August 19th around 8:30ish PM.   The place was completely dead yet it still took a good 10 minutes for a table to be set up for 9 of us (we were seated at a large round table.) I don't know why,  but for an empty place, we sure got terrible service. I got one refill despite us being there more than an hour and a half. I wasn't the only one at the table with the lack of refill. Nobody would take away our dishes either, so we were stacking all our bread plates, salad plates, dinner plates, trash, bread baskets, and empty cups on the lazy susan so we'd have enough room on the table to eat. I have the picture to prove it too.I tried to order my usual - the kid's meal turkey dinner, no potatoes, double stuffing, with an unsweetened ice tea. Nope, the waitress wouldn't let me because I'm not under 12. I hate these age restrictions on menus - especially since I've ordered this a million times to go back in Cali. I ended up ordering the French Dip with no sides, just a side salad, no croutons with ranch. After picking out the croutons, the salad was fine. It took a long time for the meals to come out, and my sister and aunt only ordered french onion soup - and for some reason, they had to wait about 10 minutes after everybody else's food to come out to get their soups. We eat as a family so our food was getting cold waiting for their meals to come out. My French Dip came with cole slaw that I didn't order - BLEH. It was gross (I hate cole slaw, so I'm biased.) I took half of my sandwich home and tried to wrap it in a paper doily I found in the bread basket to protect it from the nasty cole slaw that my dad said he'd eat. I ended up throwing out the bread and just eating the meat off of the sandwich the next day. Meh.For 9 of us to eat (2 of the meals were kids' meals,  2 French onion soups, 2 adult turkey dinners, 1 broiled chicken dish, 1 beef dish and a French dip sandwich) it was about $105 and they still couldn't clear off the table or get the check to us in a timely manner. BOO.Mimi's, I'm over you!
Yep it's a neighbour hood pub. The day we were in they had no staff on one cook/manager and one bartender/waitress/slot machine attendant. The food was typical for this establishment. Your not going here unless your buddies are meeting for drinks. Not a place for a good meal.
I made a late night carryout order about 15 minutes before arriving to this place. My oriental chicken salad was fine but my fried zucchini wedges came as slices - when I read wedges on a menu (online) I think of something resembling pickle spears. It was also cold and soggy, like completely cold and soggy. Misorder? Refrigerated? Just completely old.
Went here for their Groupon $99 deal.  That is six 5 minute laser hair removal sessions for $99.  Of course the hair removal sessions were spread over 6 months.  After the last session, the female attendant burned me slightly, and even after all of that time and patience, only about 75% of the hair growth has been reduced.  Glad I didn't pay more.  Obviously laser hair removal requires much more time and effort in the goal of ridding oneself of unwanted hair.  However, you wouldn't know that with the information you get from the people who work at Bellair.  They encourage you to keep coming, and attempt to pressure you into more ridiculous deals, such as 3 body parts at a time for six sessions at $400 or more.  If the laser treatment didn't completely work at $99, why would I want to pay $400?Do your research and skip over this place.
I drove to Sears Home Appliance showroom because an advertisement was placed on my front door with appliances up to 50% off. I was not in the market for an appliance, but I might be coaxed into buying sooner with prices like that. So, I decided to go there. The sales guy informed me that the flyer was wrong, and that there was only a 30% discount. When I got home I re-read the ad to see if I missed the posting for the date. Nope! False advertising. Aside from that (which is what is influencing the large majority of this rating), the staff was nice. The products looked to be of quality, and the showroom was clean.
Do yourself a favor: Order Carry Out, not delivery. I order here like twice a month, but about 1/3 of the time I order delivery they attempt to deliver my pizza to the wrong apartment. Not sure why their drivers can't plug my address into Google Maps and figure out where I am. The staff at this location have proven to be incredibly incompetent and I am sick of giving them 2nd, 3rd and 4th chances.
Wow I have been here four or five times. The first couple were a few months ago and I thought the pizza and pasta was great! I'm from Chicago and appreciated having this nearby. Well I'm not sure what happened but the past three times in the last two months are unacceptable. Just bad. First visit -- watery spaghetti and meatballs. It was marginally ok ... I ate it. The garlic bread was ... Terrible, I could have made better with wonder bread and garlic salt which is basically what it was ... Second time, I waited in line and their computer system went down it was a Friday night and they had no clue what to do... I forgave them for this, it happens but they could have written down my order and made my pizza ... They were completing orders and had other customers they just decided to freak out and not take mine, how did people order pizza and pay before computers? I had cash too. Third time tonight is just unacceptable. I don't eat a lot of pizza or carbs, when k to it's a treat ... I just spent $35 for a take and bake pizza (it was not cooked) and eggplant Parmesan (which was surprisingly ok) but the garlic bread was also not cooked. When I say this stuff was not cooked I mean it was not cooked. I had to break out my toaster oven which I did not appreciate. Terrible. I guess I have to find a new place or stick with due forni even though they are not really a take out place, huge disappointment I was hungry... 3 strikes you are out.
I wish I could say what the others say, but while Stacy is clearly good with straight hair (as the photos show, that's most of her work), she's not as good with curly hair.  She knows a lot about hair cutting but hair does not always follow the rules and hair on different parts of the same head may curly differently or not at all.  I went back to get my haircut adjusted and she did more cutting, but my hair still sticks out at the bottom and the slant in the back is much less than I asked for.  She seemed rushed and annoyed with my request to re-cut my hair and when I indicated how I would like it, she argued with me and did what she wanted to do.  If you have curly hair, you already know how hard it is to find a good hairdresser.  I'd hoped Stacy would be that person, but this did not work out.
I hate to say this, I just can not recommend this place.  It's nothing wonderful and it is pricey.  Service is great but, for the price of food and drinks, there are SOOOOO many better places to try.  The Jerk Chicken salad was OK, and the Paella was bland.   However; the bowl of strawberry/red pepper gazpacho was the best thing we ate today.  Maybe its hit or miss here but, for me... it's been more MISS.Ill take my business elsewhere... OH and FYI Kaya is part of the Big Burrito restaurant food chain which encompasses my FAVORITE place  MAD MEX !!!  Just not sure why Kaya is so inferior.  So I guess it does not matter if I wont come back to Kaya because Ill still go to Mad Mex every chance I get; ether way, Big Burrito gets my cash.
Not very friendly, seemed in a hurry. Pedi was average, nothing I make a point to go back to for $40. I was going to get a gel fill, until she said $45... for a fill. I left.
Salty Seniorita is an old town institution. I have spent many spring training afternoons and mornings at Salty's. It has been a favorite of my friends and family and we've developed an affinity for their friendly service, good drinks and great food. However, over the last few years, the service and attention to detail has deteriorated to an extent that I won't be taking my business here any longer. With so many new options in old town that actually provide some level of competent service (including RnR across the street), it doesn't even make sense. Yesterday, my party and I were seated after a 15 minute wait (not bad for a spring training afternoon) but the service was just terrible on so many levels. We started with two orders of the bacon guacamole which the waiter said would "be right out"'after a 20 minute wait. They turned out to take 20 more minutes. When we finally placed our food orders and 45 minutes had passed, the waiter came to ask us how we'd like to split the check BEFORE we even had the food on our table. Truly egregious. We had an outdoor table and it was kind of ironic to look across the street and wonder how much better the meal would have been at RnR. Again, the waiter and restaurant had clearly failed any measurable service standard and instead of trying to make amends, he simply tried to accelerate shuffling us out of the restaurant. Unacceptable way to treat long time customers. The food did eventually show up and as always, the tacos did impress. Salty's still does a great job with the food. So my advice: if you want great Mexican food with terrible service, Salty's is your spot. But if you want decent food with some actual service--there's 30 other options in old town alone. Bring back the old Salty's atmosphere!
I have eaten here a few times. It was good at first and went down hill from there, the last time i ate there the waitress asked how my food was, i told her it was a little over cooked (omelette) and the fruit looked old... She replied "well i dont cook the food, if i could i would" laughed and walked away! Then i seen them on the news for dirty dinning! Look up the story for your self! Just be aware But i will not be returning. And i am a local
Wow.. the prices for food and beer are pretty outrageous. Even the ballpark has better prices. My only positive is that I really enjoy the lawn area (with the exception of the huge columns that block your view). What really bothers me about this place is the sound. They really need to crank the sound up here. You can barely hear the music. Also add some screens so we can see the stage from the back. Other than that, I only see a show here when I get a cheap ticket off groupon.
I love Primanti bros,but it says the place closes at 2 am on weekdays when in actuality it's 12am. BEWARE
I would describe myself as a very experienced, and frequent Chipotle visitor. My husband and I usually drive to our normal and well known location (Rural and baseline) but when we want to make a quick stop, or are close to our home, we visit the Mcclintock and Elliot store. This store is sad. The people are never upbeat or  friendly. This most recent experience was the worst one yet. We entered the doors, no warming welcome, we approached the glass, no hello, a rude and annoyed "what can I get for you" We often order just rice and fajitas (2 sides) and that is all, occasionally we order chips and salsa. we said we would like chips and salsa and named the salsa's, they got them without question. Two bags of chips, salsa and guac and two sides should have been our order, instead they rang us up a veggie bowl, chips and salsa, and chips and guac. As frequent visitors, i knew this was incorrect. So i said, actually this is just two sides, not a veggie bowl. it is only rice and fajitas. The friendly male cashier was very nice and said im sorry and rang it in correctly. However, the female on Salsa looked at me, rolled her eyes and turned around to the female in a collared shirt, brown hair and glasses, and started talking. Assuming it was about what i had said. The manager then looked at me rolled her eyes as well and the continued to talk. Very rude to say the least. I am a customer in your restaurant and to make me feel like i need to leave as soon as possible because i did something that you didnt like is a very uneasy feeling. I usually dont say anything when these situations occur but i spoke to the cashier, telling him that he was the nicest person throughout our whole experience. This location is terrible. The have terrible customer service, everyone seems like they are miserable and that they hate their jobs.
This Famous Dave's was awful!  The only reason I didnt give it one star is because our waiter was so friendly. My husband complained that his Sprite tasted like dish water. I laughed him off thinking he was being particular. When he got his food he said his mashed potato tasted like medicine. So I decided to try it. Sure enough the mashed potatoes had a peculiar after taste and the Sprite did have taste like how dish water smells. My son said his burger was burnt. Took a look and the edges were burnt. Our food came out lukewarm. I get hotter food at my job's cafeteria. The corn was tasteless, like eating water. They need to change the distributor where the get corn from. Vons have great sweet corn on the cob, LOL!!! Im sick to my stomach to have spent the money I did on a HORRIBLE dinner for 4. I'll never, ever go back to this Famous Dave's and I'm on the verge of not going back to this chain all together. If you want good REAL BBQ stick to the mom and pops non chained non franchised places like TC Rib Crib, Big B's Texas BBQ etc. It seem like chain places dont put the effort or care into their food because they've made their millions and a name for themselves so why care.
I enjoy this hotel/casino. My family and I go bowling here, go to the movies, and also have brought family friends here when they're in town ans have recommended this place for people to stay when they ask for a decent priced hotel to stay at. My main complaint and why I didnt give 5 stars is that this is an off the strip hotel/casino ans they dont allow Locals into their pool. Thats just silly. I have lived in Vegas for 18 years and I you fo to most off the strip hotel/casinos and you show a valid nevada ID theres never an issue just as long as you're not taking in an entire party of people. But two or three people going to the pool to buy drinks/food and enjoy their pool in 115 degree heat is a must. Hotel/casinos are supposed to cater to the locals. I mean we are the ones that put in a good word for for people that ask where they should go. It should just be a limit of a certain amount allow in and possibly a pool locals guest list. My daughter and I would for sure be at South point everyday if this as the case because I dont like M resort as much. And M resort is too far.
Limited menu and have not yet been impressed with the food.  I have been to the West Charleston location previously and really liked it; the Henderson location I have been twice, and not sure what all the excitement is about.
Dr. Jordan is great so I hate to write a negative review but the staff is pretty bad. With the exception of Cindy who has been very helpful. I've called with questions multiple times and when the person who answered the phone didn't know how to answer my question they told me someone would call back in a few minutes with an answer. No one ever called back. I recently received an email saying I'm due for an exam with an option to request an appointment online, which I chose. It asked me to put in 3 options for dates and times, then told me none of them were available and someone from the office would contact me. 4 business days later & no contact. I called and told the woman who answered I'd like to make an appointment for an exam and that I've been there before. She couldn't find my information and started entering me as a new patient. Then told me my insurance didn't cover contacts, which isn't correct. When I questioned that she asked again if I had been there before & then was able to find my information and tell me I wasn't covered for another month. Why am I getting notices if my insurance isn't covering anything for another month? Apparently I've had a different experience than most reviewers here & if it were a one time thing I wouldn't be bothered. Unfortunately it happened a few times with phone calls and the most recent appointment experience leave me wanting a new office...
This location has been around for a while for good reason, but there's definitely a cycle of employees here that happens regularly. The management has definitely changed since I was last a regular here 2-3 years ago.From a chain store you'll get exactly everything you expect - whether it's buying or trading in. Consoles, games, accessories and what not is all honored. But it never really leaves face value. Trade-ins especially used to be semi-enjoyable despite terrible values, yet this location became a real stickler on policies. I'm all for following the system, but it's offensive to be shown disdain when I trading in a product and asking why it isn't accepted.I guess I'm saying this place feels soulless or hollow. I used to enjoy coming in and just browsing, felt like I was talking with some of the guys. Now coming in is like watching that unnamed show on CBS. Doesn't seem worth it compared to Amazon prime or Best Buy GCU.
Service is not one of their strong points, but the food is..If you love Korean food, you're going to like this place, but for any owners of the all you can eat concept restaurants, you can take notes on how to clear out your patrons from Woo Che.    Just seat the patrons, bring them their drinks, and leave them alone the entire visit, and don't ever check on them.     I couldn't find my waitress for a refill, and was dying for anything that looked like a liquid by the second plate.I really don't like their square grilles, because it didn't get a even heat on it, but the bugogi was good, and  they could cut the beef brisket slightly thicker, because most of it sticks to the grill.Why I'm giving this place a two star rating is due to the claim by the host that they won't accept Yelp deals for lunch, and can only be use during dinner.     There is no mention of this on Yelp deal.
My husband and I have had lunch here twice.  On our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and I did not want cocktails with our lunch.  He repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, "No, thank you."  We ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  When they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  Split a drink?  Seriously?  We were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in Vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  We tried Mesa again on a visit last October and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  We both ordered the barbecued lamb cobb salad.  Our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  So, why not call it the grilled lamb cobb salad?  Not a deal breaker.  The salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  Why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  Can't say I just can't wait to get back to Vegas to go to Mesa Grill again.  We do say this about meals we have had at Todd English and Wofgang Puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this IS Vegas). What I can say about this last experience is, "Bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!"  The portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  The large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  This item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  If lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?   The good thing is that all during the rest of our trip, we kept laughing about this salad experience.  Bobby, we still love you but we don't love Mesa Grill!
On the positive side, the place has nice ambiance and the staff is very friendly.  On the negative side, the food just isn't that good and our service was a bit slow.  We tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was a bunch of bun and a small piece of chicken.  Two different burgers were tried with the sides mixed up on each.  Last was a wood fired pizza which came out 15 minutes after everything else.  It was evidently the pizza guys first night, and it showed.  The pizza was soggy in the middle and not what a wood fired pizza should be.  I would love to say I would try again, but when 4 out of 4 entrees are average to not good, it is hard to recommend.
Classic junk food. It's pretty bad. If you want a real burger go up the street to Le Barbare.
Was just in here for a few coffees.  Very slow service.   Not real friendly.  And we happened to notice lots of flies inside around the foods.  Also the cutting board used was gross.  I am sure that would not pass a health inspectors inspection !!
The food is great. The service is.. bad.. very bad.Upon arrival we were told just go find a seat anywhere there was only 1 booth open and 2 with tons of dishes on them. We went to the open booth because we have a baby and it's easier to block her into the inside of a booth. We go to the booth and it was super dirty the server came by and cleaned it for us after a few minutes. She came back and took our drink orders at which point we also ordered the street fry appetizer. They were delicious but they took 15 minutes to get out which in my opinion is a long time for fries. While we were waiting for the appetizer we ordered our main course. We were 1 of 2 tables left at this point. After finishing the appetizer it was another 20 minutes for the main course in which time our server never returned to our table to refill our glasses which were all empty at this point or to even ask how we were doing. FINALLY our food shows up on their station with the heat lamps where it sat , while our server chatted with the bartender, for another 10 minutes. She finally decided to bring us our food and says oh I'll be back to refill your drinks which didn't happen for ANOTHER 10 minutes. She finally returned and 1 of my party of 4 sent their wings back. They were burnt to a crisp and cold simultaneously..weird.. she offered to bring him a slice of pizza, which she did, after yet another 15 minutes. At this point nobody was hungry anymore everyone's food was cold so we sat, another 15 minutes. Before finally I got up and asked the server who again was chatting with the bar tender for our boxes and our bill. She brings our bill fairly quickly at that point.. the only thing she did quickly. Honestly.. if it wasn't for the amazing pizza here it would be a 1 star review, but, the food really is very good. Just order it to go.. you don't want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth from the untrained service who couldn't care less about you or your experience.
Well, we went here once before and I was really impressed.  My husband really likes another fast food Chinese place, but I am not a fan of fast food.  Teriyaki Madness is a blend of "fast" food and good quality food.  I was really impressed with the quality of the food!  We went back tonight for a second visit, and we waited about 25 minutes.  We saw some other people come and go with their orders.  I asked the cashier if they had forgotten our order.  She was very polite and said she was not sure.  After 45 minutes, I finally asked for a refund.  Again, the cashier was very pleasant and apologetic.  My problem is the person from the back who had to ring up our refund was sort of rude.  No apology.  I do not remember what she said, but I believe she was trying to blame the cashier for ringing up something incorrectly.  She seemed inconvenienced that we wanted a refund when in fact she should have apologized.  Not sure if we will go back.  Maybe we will call in our order.  I saw a few people came in and just got their order immediately.  Being new to Teriyaki Madness, we did not realize it was an option.  IF we go back, that will be the way to go!I'd give one star, but the cashier was super friendly and we had a good experience the first time.
I've lived here in Plaza Midwood for a couple years and haven't tried this restaurant yet. Now I know why. Ordered the vegetable fried rice. One small bit of egg, 2 pieces of broccoli, and hardly anything else. Not what I consider VEGETABLE fried rice. Very disappointed:/
I effin LOVE hot dogs so when I found out that this place was opening down the street I was delighted, and went opening day.I order the basic naked dog since I find it's just to judge a place on how the they cook something simple.So what does a $6.50 hot dog taste like?Not much different than one for $3 that you can get on a street corner.The sausage was average, nothing special. The bun was a dissapointment and wouldn't surprise me if they get it from the same place your corner hot dog vendor does... it was also burnt a little. I understand that during a rush this is something that might happen to a piece of bread left over fire but the place was empty. Common guys.The toppings were creative but unnecessarry, rhubarb this, blueberry mayo that, somekind of crab flavoured sauce. Why would I want to put "fresh" soaking wet mozzarella on my hotdog? The relish was good.They didnt appear to have yellow mustard, which I am assuming isn't goumet enough, BUT they had ketchup.While I was eating, 2 of the workers were discussing what appeared to be a sausage at the end of a long fork that one of them was holding. After some deliberation he threw it into the garbage. That's 6 bucks doooood, I could have taken the bus twice with that sausage. That sausage couldve helped me pay my phone bill last month.I wanted to try the maple lemonade I read about but it was $5. That's five dollars for lemons and water people.Save your time go to WVRST for a larger, cheaper, more interesting hot dog/sausage selection.
I stopped in on my way home from work, and it seemed like the women rolling silverware was more focused on that then helping the people coming in. I stood for a while with the to go menu, no one acknowledged me, so I just walked up to the counter. I had a 20 voucher, and the women didn't know what to do with it and had to go get someone else. Kinda weird. We will see how the food tastes.
The shop has a large and clean environment. I had a deluxe pedi($50) at here but I don't recommend that if you want the same service although they were friendly to me. The skill of the nail technician need to be improved because the color on my nails wasn't acceptable.
I knew this place as Shoeless Joe's some time ago, so when it closed, I assumed with the construction on the exterior that the entire building was going to be razed in order to provide Toronto with another block of o-so-needed condominiums.  Next thing I know, Stix & Stones arrived with a sandwich board outside inviting you in.Keen to try out the new digs, I found a day that had a decent hockey game on and assumed they would carry over the sporting theme.  With a name like Stix & Stones, you'd expect a pool lounge and sports bar.  Well, they've got a pool table, and TVs that show sports in a surrounding that is more an attempt at urban chic than cozy sports bar or pool hall.  It's nice enough, but not what is expected, considering the main door still has the old Shoeless Joe baseball bat door handles welcoming you in.  The construction outside pretty much hides the restaurant from plain view, so they're already are kind of behind the eight ball.The menu is wide and has usual pub faves.  If the nachos are an indicator, food will have high and low points.  The array of multi-coloured chips and the amount of toppings were great, presented in a long stylish plate different from most other nacho platings.  Sadly the chicken on the chicken nachos seemed to be obviously pre-cooked and rubbery.The tap list is really limited for a bar and you find yourself resorting to the next best thing unless you like what they have on offer.  Service, though friendly, was really lax for the few clients they had.  Sad to say but the nachos are indicative of the place as a whole.  Stylish, but with some poor elements that are hard to ignore.
It's way over priced for what you get.  The burgers are good the frys are soggy and undercooked and they're not shoe-string like advertised.  You can go to Hamburger Works and the best burger in Phoenix.  You can get a "great big one" with everything including a large 1/2 pound of fresh beef for much less than 5 guys charges.  I also didn't like having to buy frys for 2 for $3.00.  A small burger, frys and a drink cost almost $13.  I tried it once but I won't go back.
We only stopped into the bar and didn't see the evening show. Sitting in the bar area, our server was friendly, and we all ordered a round of sugary frozen cocktails (covered by a Groupon). All of the drinks were quite sweet, which I guess is expected. The frozen lime margarita was okay, but the strawberry was almost undrinkable due to being saccharine sweet, but I guess that is typically of slushy-machine drink. They were out of Mango, which was really disappointing to 3 of our group.  We ordered 2 appetizers also, so combat the sugar rush. The hummus was ok, but came with very few flatbread. The artichoke dip was just ok. Overall, maybe I'd come back for the evening show, but I wouldn't come for drink or food again.
Had lunch here a few weeks ago.Food (3/5)- Spinach salad with pesto and chicken- Asian chopped saladService (2.5/5)Price (3.5/5)Ambiance (2/5)
The service here is seriously lacking. Despite there being no lineup andmany tables available, We stood at the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us, and when they did, it seemed like it was a problem.  My boyfriend commented they act like they dont want customers.The food was nothing to write home about,  but it filled us up.  The mango smoothie was the best part.
The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?Ordered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though. Also got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).We were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon. I'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer.
Well this is a first...my two kids had the best meals out of the four of us! The mac and cheese was great as were the corn and carrots but jeez, this place has no business serving fish and seafood! The crab meat cocktail and the sea bass were both nowhere near fresh. Just so bad I wish I had sent them back.  The fillet mignon was perfect and really that is what this place should be...a steak house. Period.
So I stayed here because the event I was attending was here and they offered a great price for Memorial Day weekend.  That is where the good stuff ended.  We waited close to an hour to check in...at 1am!  Then to help us feel better about that we got an "upgraded" room.  Got to the room and there was a dressed up Murphy bed that folded into the wall.  To be fair it was comfortable...however if that was an upgrade, I really do not want to see the regular rooms.  Next the Internet was $14 per 24hrs.  When we went to use the safe it wasn't working.  To their credit they did say it would take 30 min for someone to come look and it only took 10 and he fixed it within five minutes.  Just felt like if the room price wasn't so great on a holiday weekend I would have been extremely upset.  Know you are not getting super customer service...just getting basic stuff without the class even if they try to say it is classy.
Not happy this year, bad customer service, bed bugs, not willing to refund for my inconvenience. The 2 stars r only for the Go Room, its sheek. Management does not care. Must wait 5 days for someone to call regarding refund. Bunch of bs.
I feel bad giving such a bad review because the people there were all extremely nice which is the only reason I gave a second star but I feel like people should know what they're getting into. First of all it's not the type of massage where they lead you to a private room and you get naked and under a blanket. You must keep your clothes on because it's a huge dark room with see through pop up curtains separating people. They put a rough towel over your body and your face, and of course you still have clothes on (in my case jeans and a t shirt) so the entire massage takes place over so many layers of fabric. About 10 minutes into the "massage" the towel on my face slips off a little and I see a middle aged man standing there staring at me while they get the table next to me ready for him. They did put up a divider between us but it was incredibly jarring seeing that. My massage itself was subpar (the worst I've ever gotten) and was just incredibly uncomfortable, the man was definitely not a real masseuse. I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
Very nice staff! VERY NICE!! Not very helpful though. They don't know where their own items are located throughout the store, but they expect you to find it. I asked for specific items. She (and manager agreed) said "I don't know where that's at, because we move things around the store everyday. Just look towards the back of the store... " So I did.I Searched for quite a while. Never found items, or assistance. Thank goodness there's a Michaels around the corner.
My food was made totally wrong, I was very specific in what I wanted and he just said ya ya ok and brought it out per the menu.  Overall was really pricey for mexian food, I should have listened to the other reviews!However, the Mirachi band was fantastic!
Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy.
Pros:  cool building, nice view of the brewing equipmentCons:  beer is mediocre at best.. Tastes watered down, food is way overpriced, and the shrimp mousse appetizer thing is horrendous... I mean disgusting.  The chefs creations remind me of the crap I see on Gordon Ramsays kitchen nightmares where the chef gets excited with weird flavor combinations that don't jive... Plus bizarre glasses and food holders that are just annoying.  I will not return.  There's no value here.
Just ok.  I had the roast beef sandwich which was ok, but a little salty.Also tried the Ahi salad sandwhich which was a grilled butter bomb.  And tasteless.Salad was good.Ribs were OK, nothing special.Koloa Pork was soaked and oozing in BBQ sauce.  What?  That's not Koloa Pork!  Awful.The Tilapia taco whatevers as an appetizer were ok, but needed more zing.  Service was nice enough, but didn't seem like she cared or had any passion.  good beer was enjoyed though!
I know it is common for Filipino restaurants to have a cafeteria style setting, but sometimes this is cause for disaster. For this particular restaurant, it was a total disaster. This place is new and popular, so everyone is going there. There are whole families waiting in line, so employees are unsure who to serve next and it makes the entire experience disorganized. The food is expensive for what it is: I could probably make the same thing at home for half the price. There was nothing special on the menu. I ordered chicken BBQ sticks and they throw them in a to go bag and it's very messy. My mom ordered mussels and they were stingy, only serving three while they served other customers double the amount. There's just no consistency here and like I said, it really is nothing special: just another mediocre Filipino fast food joint. I won't be going back.
Excellent location right at Yonge and Eglinton. I love the idea of a place that does one thing, but does it really really well. Unfortunately The Contruction Site isn't one of those places. The restaurant feels a bit too 'fast food chain' and doesn't feel like that much effort went into it. I wouldn't mind that if the sandwiches didn't start at about 6 dollars for a grilled cheese sandwich without taxes which IMO is waaayyyyy too steep for what is basically two slices of bread with cheese in the middle that is heated up. I ordered mine with tomatoes (a dollar extra)  in it which was a big mistake. The tomatoes took a longer time to cool down than the cheese in the sandwich and some bits of it were disintegrating (probably from being pressed while being grilled) I would expect them to use better quality cheese for the price and was a bit dissapointed with how it tasted. All sandwiches are served with chips or a salad. The chips are apparently 'home made' but they didn't taste too different from something that came out of a box. This brings me to my final complaint - the box that it is served in (even if you're not getting take out) had a slight wierd carboard like smell to it. Now coming to the good part - the service is great and the staff was very patient with me. They also have free wifi and offers if you check in on foursquare. There you have it - my compliment sandwich for The Contruction Site.
Update Two (the morning after): So when I booked the movers, I was told I only need two men, so that's what I paid for and budgeted for. When they finally showed up for the move (two hours late and after all the phone calls and messages), the "manager" brought an extra guy, which I figured was a customer service gesture because they weren't even STARTING the move until after 8pm. It wasn't until 10:30pm, when they were finishing up, that the manager informed me that he was charging me for the extra guy and the trip fee had increased as a result. Ugh. Additionally, four pieces of furniture (out of 13) were scratched, chipped or dented because they did a shoddy job wrapping things and were hitting them against stair railings and columns. I watched one of the movers try to carry a chair into the house by walking in between two columns and he hit the chair against both columns at a full walking speed. This wasn't my first time using movers, but this was definitely the first and last time I'd ever use Skinny Wimp. Update One (mid-move): after quite a few phone calls of increasing anger, I finally was able to get movers out....two hours after the end of their "time frame." I will give credit where credit is due though, those boys hustled their butts off. Had the scheduling and communication not been a nightmare, I would give them five stars but we just got off to a really bad start.Original: I would love to write a review about their moving services, however these guys took my deposit and never showed up to move anything. They missed their time frame for the move, and now no one is answering calls or returning messages. They charged me $275 to reserve this time frame and now I'm stuck with an apartment full of furniture that I have to somehow move at 7pm on a Saturday night by myself. If I could give them less than one star, I would.
Coffee is amazing as always, but only 1 person was there working at 7:30am on a Sunday morning... my order (5 drinks) took approximately 30 minutes. I just wish that the barista would have let me know rather than take payment and then have me wait while he made them intermixed with taking new orders and making other customer drinks..
Was always intrigued by their "concept" of meats coming on skewers and sliced right on your plate. And this past weekend, as part of Restaurant Week, got a chance to try them out in person. Was it worth it...NoDecor : A little to dim and red for my taste. From a far it looks fine, but get closer and you notice the slight grime on tables, the even darker ambient furniture. Our chairs had nails sticking out on the edges so that was not nice! (They really outta check that coz that can injure someone)Service : Pleasant had it been a normal ala carte restaurant but the concept here mars the it down a notch. Once you've tried all meats/veggie ensembles, you basically then "wait" until that particular favorite one comes by to you, which mostly doesn't as it would just get devoured by tables before you. And then you keep waiting more....Food : I'd give the crazy wait a pass had the food been worth the wait. Alas it wasn't. The steak variety was chewy, overly rare and devoid of any seasoning. The pork was better as it came grilled/roasted with Parmesan cheese so the moisture from the cheese helped balance the dryness of the tenderloin. The sausage was average at best and can be associated with one you get from Walmart, laden with salt. The chicken legs were weirdly tiny to make you feel they may have come from ones that were malnutrition-ed!! The lamb was a best "MEAT" of the worst. It too lacked seasoning and was cooked a tad dry. But the char on the outside skin gave it the a much needed boost of flavor.Long story short - Meat varieties tragically disappointing with over cooking and gross lack of seasoning/flavors.Now the reason why this place got 2 stars instead of 1. The absolutely and sinfully sumptuous Grilled Cinnamon Pineapple!!! Take it from me, I'm not a pineapple guy and but man o man was that  good or what!! We must've had 3 courses of it and had to wait easily 10 mins between each (The hungry parties before our table gobbled them all up before it could come to us!!) but worth it.The so called "Unlimited Buffet" section has a few hits (brazilian nuts, goat cheese) but overall doesn't help bring up the atmosphere of average cooked meats going around.Despite being Restaurant Week, it came to be $30 pp before drinks, tip and taxes. Nopes, not worth that money. I'd spend that kind anyday on better dining delights in Madison :)
Would not recommend.  It is usually a good price due to being off strip, but you are TRAPPED there.  The cabs are virtually non-existent after 5 PM.  Forget going out to a different club or hotel after dark.Rooms are pretty nice for the price - elevators seem to be from the 1930's and take forever - stay on the 1st floor if you want to save time.Definitely not worth the money unless you don't have much.
This review is for the service, not for the food!   My parents was excited to go to Vegas, and wanted to try this restaurant.  When they were there, it did not seem busy inside, and she told the waiter 2 people, and the waiter did not check inside at all, just pointed the small table near the entrance and told my mom that's the only table he had.  He did not even ask if my parents want to wait for better table.  His tone was not friendly with attitude.  My parents were not happy with his attitude, and they left.  It should be a beautiful night at Vegas, but the service was not good enough for Vegas standard!
While I so wanted to love Okra, I unfortunately did not. Let me start on a positive note - I love the decor, the waitress was a total sweetheart and the fried chicken skins were excellent. However, we had some problems with our cocktail, which were never remedied. My husband, a regular vodka drinker, ordered a vodka/soda. When it arrived he took a sip because it tasted funny and asked me to taste it. I tasted it and sure enough noticed exactly what he was talking about - it tasted like tequila mixed with vodka. We informed the waitress and requested a fresh drink and she said others had complained of the same problem, but that she thinks it's just "the type of vodka they use." (The bar uses Titto's vodka, which my husband has had many times.) The waitress replaced the cocktail anyway and brought a fresh one, but when we tasted that one, it again tasted like tequila. My husband (who used to work in a bar) notified the waitress that the bar tender was likely not rinsing the measurer between measuring different liquors and she assured my husband that he does. Since were were sitting near the bar we were able to watch the bar tender make drinks and saw firsthand that he was definitely not rinsing the measuring cup between liquors and confirmed this was the cause of the tequila vodka soda. Since tequila has such a powerful flavor, it was finding its way into our vodka soda every time. We paid for the drink, but my husband could barely drink it. Now, onto the food - we ordered a seafood special which they offered for the evening. It consisted of five shrimp, some mussles and two oysters, along with a piece of bread and some pickled green beans. The cooks forgot to include my oysters along with my meal and they also left an item of another gentleman's dinner at my table. But the worst part of it was that the mussels were slimy and undercooked. I didn't send it back and just kind of stomached what I could and put aside much of it, because we had already complained about the drink and I didn't want to be "that customer." Like I said, I wanted to love this place. I'm hoping for their sake they were just having an "off" night.
My first time there was terrible, the rolls were packed with rice and falling apart, the waitress seemed annoyed was constantly on her phone,very unprofessional. I went back a week ago to give them another shot. The rolls were still jam packed with rice the quality of the sashimi was lil better but I would not go back there.they close at 10 I was there at 9 and they were rushing me out and forcing me to order at 920 not impressed
Pad se ew had alright flavor but a little on the dry side. Liked the flavor of the spicy fried rice but rice was a little hard and there were no cucumbers or tomatoes. Portion size was good though. Maybe if I had saw the cockroach review, I most likely wouldn't have come here.
Dirty and overpriced. Came here expecting good food for a good price based on reviews and info but was fairly disappointed. Only plus is their service was okay. Would not come back.
Had a horrible experience at this establishment.  All of orders were incorrect and it took us along time for our orders to be taken. The waiter was not very suggestive. The best part of our visit was the hostess. She was very attentive and took of us when we needed something. I only suggest this place if you wanna sit at the bar for a drink and food.
This was my first visit EVER to Smashburger. The cooks did a great job. The food was very good, and the girl working the register was very kind. Although the food is a big part of the experience, the customer service is of equal importance. The mod, who I believe was named Matthew, however was VERY unfriendly and not only to the customer, but also to the other employees. I couldn't help but notice him repeatedly give the cashier dirty looks when she walked by. What kind of manager is that? One that makes the customers and other employees uncomfortable? One who makes you feel unwelcome? If you're having a bad day leave it out the door before you come to work.... I can only imagine how he treats his coworkers when the customers aren't around. Unprofessional, unfriendly, cell phone in hand texting..... I don't understand how these unprofessional teenage jerks get hired for management.
I had a 1/2 chicken dinner with fries and BBQ sauce. $14 + tax.The seasoning on the chicken skin was delicious, but my chicken was noticeably dry and chewy. I imagine it had been sitting there for a while.The BBQ sauce was good; the fries were mediocre. The service wasn't exactly rude, but definitely not friendly.I know they make a big deal about their food quality, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I probably won't go back.
I'm happy that Nevada has a no-kill shelter option, but when you're dropping an animal off, the staff is not very nice at all.One evening I heard the sounds of kittens mewling LOUDLY outside my apartment building. I went to check it out and found three very tiny kittens huddled together under the stairs. They were way too fast and it was way too dark (I was using my cell phone as a flash light) to catch, so I left water and softened food out for them. The next day it was all gone.Fast forward a few weeks, I'm outside my apartment with friends and I spot the kittens huddled together outside a patio of the building across from me. There were three and we successfully caught two, a white one and an orange tabby. They were crying like crazy, but no other cat (or human) came out to inspect what was going on, so we figured they were abandoned.I took them to my place, put them in my cat's pet carrier with towels, a warm bottle, some water and softened food. They ate the food like they'd never seen food in their lives. We went back to where we found them because the apartment with the patio where they were sleeping, we could see it was abandoned, but there were two more kittens inside. The abandoned apartment was open and it was clear a cat colony had moved in. The carpet of the three bedroom apartment was covered in feces. We had no luck grabbing the other kittens (then ran to a hole by the dishwasher). I told my apartment maintenance about the apartment (they happened to be next door installing a washer) and they said they would try to take a look at the apartment later that day.I spent the next few days calling animal rescuers I knew, the humane society and the SPCA. No one was willing to take the kittens, and they told me I should foster them or keep them myself. I thought I was doing the right thing by rescuing these kittens, but I was really starting to regret it. The kittens did not want to be touched and the only time they didn't cry was when they ate and immediately after when they went to sleep.Almost a week later I got a call from the SPCA, they would take the kittens the next morning. I brought them in and explained who I was. No one said anything to me, just put two forms in front of me. I started filling them out and a woman came from the back hallway and without saying anything to me, opened the carrier with the kittens. I told her to be careful because the white one is really vicious. She ignored me and stuck her hand right in, only to snatch it out after the little white kitten went crazy and tried to attack her.A second woman (who also didn't say a word to me or even look at me) managed to get the orange one out, held him by the scruff upside down and was saying "come one, lift up your neck, show me you're strong". I thought that was odd, but they're the professionals.The first woman got the white kitten out by using the towel that I had in the carrier to toss over his head then pull him out. She grabbed him by the scruff, but he was still going crazy, hissing and twisting around. The two women though it was funny.I told them about the abandoned apartment with two and possibly more kittens. And the two women just walked away with the kittens (and my towel) and I was left just standing there. I didn't expect an in depth sit down session to explain what was happening, but could you at least introduce yourself? Do I need to pay a fee? Are the kittens going to be okay? Is there anything that can be done about the cat colony apartment?I'm thankful for the service they provide but it doesn't have to be such an awkward experience.
Waiter was nice, service sucks..really expensive. The only reason I ate here was cause I got to Vegas Late Thursday night and everything on the strip where I wanted to eat was closed by 11 or 12..so I didn't feel like walking all over to find something and I was just really hungry at the time. I wasn't really expecting this place toCharge $67 for two burgers and a drink each for me and my girlfriend, the food wasn't bad or anything, but definitely NOT worth $67..I assumed a 24 hour restaurant would've been an okay priced place for all the travelers and drunk people to grab a quick bite. Like I said earlier the waiter was cool and all but the service was bad and place is just way to over priced..if you're willing to spend that type of money for the same food you can get somewhere else for only 30/40 bucks then go for it!
This place is really expensive, not worth it. I got regular manicure and with tax it was $80. Haven't even been a week and my thumb nail is already coming off. Very disappointed
The spicy chicken is great but the bowls are 95% rice and 5% meat which is not good!! I thought this place might be better! Disappointed
We got a couple of pulled pork sandwiches that came with one side each. We got beans and potato salad. Very dissappointed the pork was so dry and the buns were semi hard. After dousing them with 21/2 packets of sauce it wasn't bad. The sauce was good but the sides weren't anything special. I can get the same at walmart. For the $ price I would go someplace else. $20 for everything. I guess the que for 2 would've been better. It will be long time before I come back.
I hate to be the bad news bear, but 3rd visit last night for dinner, and the food & service were both not the best.  I had the 3 veggies plate with mac & cheese, collard greens, and cream squash.  I also had a few bites of the fried pickles.  Fried pickles were good.  Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable.  Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that.  Cream squash was OMG kinda not good.  It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup.  Waitress wasn't too friendly at all.  I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on!Seriously, I'm getting tired of all the hypes floating around town about these hip new places.  So far I've been disappointed by most of them.
Food was ok. . Sauces were sweet.  Tortillas made fresh.  Staff however was horrible. . They could care less what question you had.  Prepared multiple  meals wrong in our group of 10.  Group in dront was there firat time there staff provided no help and had no patience for questions.  Just wanted to rush people through and the place was not busy but dirty.  Tables needed to be wiped down. Drink station was a mess, lemonade fountains were empty and were never addressed for the whole time we were there.   Sad to see . . No reason to come back.  Plenty of other places right there with more to offer
We came here with an open mind since there are many negative reviews about this place and we want to be our own judge.Unfortunately, just like most reviewers here have experienced.  Don't waste your money and time here...go to Hot N Juicy.   Everything is better at Hot N Juicy EXCEPT their soft shell crab basket is a little better than HnJ.  Service:  They don't seem to know what you are talking about.  We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, "I don't know what the price is... plus we don't have it anymore anyway".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don't have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn't come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren't mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn't deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  The only good thing about this place is it's on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn't have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.  We will definitely NOT returning again and will continue to go back to our favorite still ; Hot N Juicy!
ahhh... so much potential!!! If I had to rate The Suffolk punch purely on decor and ambiance, I'd give it a whole 5 star rating. Unfortunately, there's so much more to consider.The food was average at best, the service was really quite terrible (the drinks took foreverrrrr to get to us, some things never made it to us at all, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time)The first time we went there in the morning for a cup of coffee, we were so excited because 1) the coffee was awesome 2) the decor was even more awesome. We couldn't wait for them to be open for dinner. and when they were, we decided to check it out with some friends.We ordered a lot of food, almost everything on the menu - from the potato croquettes to the foie gras popcorn, from the beet salad to the pickles, the punch burger to the market fresh fish - and while non of the food was terrible, none of it was memorable either. The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming. The drinks that did make it to our table were good, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a drink, they ought to be amazing - either the drink menu needs to be simplified, or the bar service upped.There's tremendous unrealized potential here... perhaps things will improve with time?
I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food.
The ony thing i could think of was the same level of disappointment that i had when i visited the new wet n wild location last year... What is with these companies closing their locations down and making locals wait years for a new establishment that has less to offer than their previous location? Terrible way to earn your old customers back. Seems like a trend happening in Vegas and its really doing bad for tourism when all the companies are just penny-pinching and reopening shitty locations. Dont reopen if you can't deliver!
.... Not good ....They're saying my review is too short so I'll expound. We got the cocktail of the day. Pear vodka with prosecco. 3/10The margarita pizza was a sloppy mess as you could see from the picture. It felt like they rain it through the dishwasher before the brought it out to us. Gnocchi was average, pretty bland.
I have to say my visit to the flamingo was not a pleasant one by any means. the only positive part about our stay is it was in the middle of the strip, so it was easy the get from one end to the other. Margaritaville upstairs is always fun and a nice view as well. it was a friends bachlorette, and from the moment we got there, she was in tears because she had been promised a room that was not the standards she agreed to. we were promised to sleep 8 with a pull out couch and had to beg for free cots. the staff was very direspectful and not accomidating what so ever. we were re issued about 10 keys because none of them work and couldnt even get into our second room for a long while. when we searched for the ice machine, we had to go to 3 different floors because none of them had working machines. when we asked about it, they simply said "did you check all the floors" which was extremely rude considering. we should not have to search all floors obviously; but instead quoted us $8 for ice to be brought to our room. They could not even tell us what floors were working. i blame our bad experience to the lack of accomidation by the staff. I will not be staying there again to risk another bad experience in such a fun city!
I finally decided to stop coming here after several years because I've grown increasingly dissatisfied. I suppose I stuck around so long out of convenience.To start, I'll never understand why it always takes 3.5 hours to groom my 18-pound dog. And last time, he came home in an itching frenzy. He finally stopped after a whole month. The vet told us that something irritated his skin, but we don't know what...could've been the shampoo or maybe a powder of some sort? In addition to that, inconsistency seems to be an issue. It would be nice if the staff would take note of what their clients ask for, so that they can ensure the grooming will be the same each time. Also noticed some blood on my pup's nails a few times... they clearly cut too close to the blood supply. When I calmly brought it up, the person totally downplayed it and didn't apologize. Listen, it happens. It's not easy cutting a dog's nails, but for the love of God, a simple apology goes a long way.
Just ok. Had the fried shrimp, below average same with French fries. The vegetable mix was decent. My husband had the stuffed pork chop, mashed potatoes and gravy. He gave it all a thumbs up. I took a taste of the potatoes and are not fresh but I'm a fan of the box stuff so I agreed they were good. The service was good but it's doubtful that we'll be back
Mehhhhh....My dad wanted to come here because he saw the hand pulled noodles.  I must say I was excited initially because I feel like hand pulled noodles are kind of being forgotten and seldom used by restaurants.I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.My parents both got the seafood noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  I got the Zha Jiang Mein noodles with hand pulled noodles as well.  So I'll start with the semi positive, the broth was nice, clean, tasty.  Oh and the vegetables in my noodles were tasty too.  Now the bad, the huge shrimps and scallops were nice to see, but they were overcooked, a bit rubbery.  I mean they weren't super overcooked, but a bit over.  And paying what, like $16 bucks for it, the seafood better be cooked well, dang it! The Zha Jiang Mein noodles were SUPER SALTY, gah, I could barely eat it so I took a bit of the seafood broth in the noodles. Ahh, much better.It is WAY too expensive, WAY too expensive, but then again, it is Vegas.  But I just feel like Asian food should between $5-15  ($15 is on the expensive side and I'm NOT talking about Panda Express) Sighh...I was just disappointed, verryy disappointed.I don't recommend you come here, don't LET the hand pulled noodles DRAW you in, IT'S A TRAP!
Waited 3 years to get a Whataburger. I was so excited, but when my order arrived at the table... the fries were undercooked and lukewarm, the hamburger patty was not brown and crisp, but a greyish-brown; the cheese was not melted completely; and the bun was cold-ish. This is not the food I craved for years. Downhill Whataburger. Sad.
The service was friendly and food was quick. I was the only one in the place the whole time which should tell you something. But after eating my stomach was upset and I had frequent trips to the bathroom if you get my meaning. No doubt what caused it. I won't be back.
This place BLOWS. dont waste your night here.its a restaurant turned club.Only 2 barsDance floor is as big as a cheap hotel room.no wonder it was free on a Sat night.half star for strong drinks
Not worth the high cost.  Go across the street for a bit better grub if you want to spend the money.
Now that all there friends got the their positive reviews out of the way, I think the truth will start to surface. This could very well be one of my worst experiences ever. Clearly I am not the demographic they are looking for and I am truly glad, I wont be back.  I had the steak and eggs box and I can sum it up in one word, gross. Nothing more needs to be said about the food.  The music was loud and annoying, no comfortable place to sit. The staff was polite, but not skilled in the food service or any service industry. The fries were good and freshly cooked, thank gawd something.
The hotel is in a not great part of town. I walked into the lobby and it was so stuffy and hot. The room itself was okay, it was clean, except for in the bathtub there was mold on the faucet. The breakfast in the morning was decent. but the feeling of the lobby and hallways were very uncomfortable because there's no air flowing through.
Holy smokes, you want how much for ice cream?  Then again, you're looking at a guy that just buys vanilla and if I get a little bored, squirt some Hersheys Syrup in it and mix it up.  I guess the ice cream is good, but when I can go and buy a steak at the grocery store for the same cost, every bite I sit and imagine that I could instead be eating a ribeye cooked at home.Another thing occurred to me, what would it look like for someone to be an ice cream kneader if they werent high school aged?  Well maybe it would work if it were an older guy with a handlebar mustache.
My husband and I were excited to check this place out because it's a new concept in our area. We're also big tea drinkers so we wanted to give that a try as well. We drove up yesterday and everything was confusing from the moment we walked in. While the interiors is done well, it falls short on food, drinks, service and flow of the space. Maybe it was one of the busier days that they've experienced and that made it hard to do things well but here's why our overall experience was not great and why it didn't work for us:1. FLOW/SERVICE/MODEL - as we walked in we notice that there's a counter and a line forming. We had to loop around the space to even get in line and as we're walking we notice people sitting at tables with menus and staff delivering drinks and food. So we were confused if it was table service and we should grab a table. There was no one greeting at the door or handing out menus so we decided to ask one of the runners as she was passing by. She didn't understand what I was asking and spoke little english. She kept telling us to sit down and then the last time I asked "if we sit can we order from the table" and she said "no" so why would we sit without ordering first, confusing. The place kept filling up and more confused faces were walking around. By this point people were realizing that tables were getting limited and then started grabbing tables for their entire parties. The problem with this model is that you're standing in line for 30-45 minutes, during that time people with no food or drinks are saving tables and just sitting there holding up tables while their group is in line. The people who have already ordered and not holding up tables now have no place to sit. It was a chaotic sitting room with people just hanging out saving tables and the people that needed to sit to enjoy their food had no place to do so. You get a number once you order and now you have runners also walking around very confused trying to find tables. Either don't over serve more than your seating capacity or have a host greeting, sitting, guiding and keeping order. The queuing also seemed backwards. You had to walk around the entire place to get in line, maybe that was the intent but seems counterintuitive to the fast casual model of ordering at the counter that's placed at the front of the space. Definitely lacking order and organization. Lastly, once we were done with our food a runner came around to pick up our plates but she had a tray which she needed both hands to carry, so we had to put the plates on the tray for her, not very efficient tray choice.2. FOOD/DRINKS - very disappointed with the food and teas that we ordered and felt they were very overpriced for the quality. We ordered the turkey smoked gouda croissant, fig salad, chai vanilla latte and Kenya black tea. The croissant was the better item of the four. We ordered one to share because the size of the one displayed at the counter was very large. The one delivered was half the size of the one displayed and we should've ordered two. The fig salad had poor presentation, barely any dressing on it, don't know what part of it was the fig, maybe it was the glaze that tasted more like balsamic vinaigrette? There were cranberries, nuts and cheese on it. It was a large plate with a lot of arugula and not much more, not worth $11. The chai tea - sooo sweet, I couldn't finish it. The black tea came in a beautiful tea pot, but for $6 I expect a full leaf tea brew not a tea bag that's thrown in the pot and by the time you get to the second of third cup of tea it's so bitter because the bag has been brewing for longer than it should, you can't really finish it. Disappointing tea experience. Provide a spoon and brewing recommendations at the moment of serving your teas, especially if they're being served at the table. Not everybody wants the sweet sugary teas and coffees and for the prices I expect them to be on point. Would we come back and give it a second chance, possibly if the food and drinks were improved. The instagram pics alone aren't cutting it for us, it has to be more than beautiful, especially with the higher prices.
Meh. I've experienced better.Standard Target selection to be found at this one.  Only thing that takes it down a notch below others is the cleanliness of the store.  Not filthy -- just not up to par.
Food:  4 starsAmbience:  3 stars  Service:  1.5 starsCare for patrons:  0 star  (I will explain this later)I finally got around to visiting Casa Imperial for a Monday afternoon dim sum.  I was hoping to host a party here for my daughter's first birthday for 50+ guests and needed to check it out before sending out RSVPs.  Since I did not want to schlep out to Markham with an 11 month old in tow, I called them with some basic questions first.  In this phone inquiry, I was told that their "private dining room" could accomodate 50+ guests.  A BIG FAT LIE.  Yes, they have a small private dining room but it can barely seat 25 guests comfortably.  Instead, we were told upon arrival that that they could make the entire 2nd flr available for us which opens to the rest of the dining area.  This is not the same as having your own room where your event can be closed off to the rest of the restaurant.  I did not appreciate that they were outright deceitful over the phone to get me to come in to their restaurant and they did not hesitated to do this when I told them that I would be coming in with a small baby.  This is the short explanation for the 0 star for "care for patrons" rating above.  Oh yeah, that and their laughable "change table" for my little one.  Anyone interested in exploring this further, you can send me a message.So here we were.  4 adults and a baby (11 months old) on a Monday afternoon...arriving around 11:30 and the parking lot was packed!  Already a bad sign.  I'm sure they will not have adequate parking available for my party guests on a Saturday if the place is this jammed on a Monday.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was not amused to see the once beautiful Devonsleigh Place turned into this garish operation.  Gone were the old world charm and understated opulence of the former restaurant and what I found in its place was an ill-fitting juxtaposition of a noisy, wanna-be-high end Chinese restaurant.  All the servers were dressed in formal attire in attempt to convey attention to detail and class but they did not know how to address guests properly and this became painfully evident when we had to ask for a high chair twice and still wait some 15 min to get it.  And to top it all off, they sat us at the farthest corner of the second floor dining room when they could clearly see that my mother in law was walking with a cane.  Sigh....Between the 4 adults, we tried a healthy variety of dishes off their dim sum menu and I must say, the food was good.  Here is a quick run down of our food experience:  Shark's fin soup tad too salty for my taste, Beef shumai moist and well seasoned, Steamed chicken with black fungus and orange daylily was one of our favorites with juicy (but boney) morsels of well seasoned chicken cooked in lotus leaf.  Chicken feet, baked abalone & chicken pie, crispy taro dumpling, crispy bean curd roll, fried turnip cake were all good, as expected.  However, the tripe was too chewy and tough.  Perhaps my favorite thing about their dim sum was the milk and papaya puff.  These cute flaky pastry beauties held creamy, milky custard filling studded with pieces of papaya.  I almost wanted to order more to bring them home.  All this came to $75 including tax and tip.   Not bad at all.  After a mixed dining experience of good food and bad everything else, I have decided that Casa Imperial is not where I would like to have my daughter's first birthday after all.  I can put up with bad service if I'm on my own but I refuse to subject my guests to it and Casa Imperial's laughable "change table" for my guests with babies.  As for  vising Casa Imperial again, sure....I would drop in if I'm back in the area but I will not go out of my way to eat there any time soon.When I called the restaurant to let them know that I will not be holding my party there, the manager (older Chinese gentleman whose name I will not mention here) was extremely rude on the phone.  His exact response was, "whatever, I don't care" before promptly hanging up on me without even asking why.  If Casa Imperial really wants to be high end, they have a lot to learn about genuinely caring for their patrons and providing much better service than just putting on a uniform and buying a Victorian mansion.
When I walked in and saw the person at the front desk on a personal call, I knew I should have turned around and left. She did not end the call while I stood there. There was no one else in the waiting room. If I was feeling better I would have found some place else to go. She finally finishes her call and acknowledges me. I complete the required paperwork. I go to bring it to her and she is on another call with a patient. She saw me walk up with my paperwork and place it on the counter in front of her. Another person walks in, she ends her call and proceeds to help the next person, after taking all her info she stands up and says to me "why didn't you tell me you completed your paperwork". I did not even answer her as I knew I would have been rude. She calls me up, tells me I have to pay completes the transaction. I sit back down. The lady from back calls me back. Asks what is wrong, asks about medicines I am taking and my history. I am telling her everything, and she keeps asking me how do you spell it. Everything I said she could not spell. OK, I know medicines and diagnosis are not easy to spell but seriously, I was getting pretty annoyed at this. Plus all the while she is sniffling, I was already sick and the last thing I need is for it to get worse. The Doctor came in a few minutes later, and says hello and says you have the flu. Alrighty then, I could have told her that myself. that is why I have not gone anywhere till today. She finally says well let me take a look, we are talking about my headaches, she says well I can't diagnosis headaches, you should to to the ER for a cat scan. That was it for me. A cat scan for the flu. She tells me to rest for two more days she will give me a note for my employer. Pick up the note up front. I get back to the front ask for my note. My favorite receptionists says we only give those if you ask. I reply the Doctor told me to come get it, not the other way around. I honestly could not take another minute of this so called urgent care. I said i do not need the note and left. I do not need the note. I do not call in to work, so I am not worried. The bottom line is this place is a sham for an urgent care. If you are ill, honestly go to your own Dr. if you can, Even quick care is better than this. I give it two stars because my crankiness may be playing a part in how I am writing this. I am trying to be fair., by taking into consideration I do not feel well.
1 - 5 scaleFood: 2Service: 4 Atmosphere: 5Service: 5I really like the decor as well as the staff at La Comida. Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: "if you think it's salty, it must have been really salty". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I'm not the only one in the group that didn't think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were "meh" and the Guacamole dip was even more "meh".  I don't feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun.
Friendly staff but the coffee is quite inconsistent here. The brews get mixed up on a regular basis. Perhaps it's because the staff have a high turnover rate. Nice atmosphere with couches and wifi.
This is my second visit and I am still not convinced by the food here, hence the reason I'm keeping it at 2 stars. My previous 3 star review was removed by Yelp HQ, upon the request of the restaurant owner.Where do I start this time? Coming back for seconds, I think I can put a solid score for this place, no bias or discrepancies. The first time I had the cheese burger, fries and beer and I was not entirely impressed. This time I had the Central Park, something that's supposed to scream "quality" over the regular cheese burger (I would assume the quality be served to me whether I ordered something expensive or cheap?). Like I said before, this burger did not impress me. It had a relatively thick patty, but considered thin if this place was all about the gourmet burgers. The patty was slightly overcooked, but most of it was covered by the onion ring, blue cheese and sautéed mushrooms so it's hard to tell in the picture. It was juicy in some spots but dried out in some. The fries, though it came out nice and golden, was still overcooked just like my first visit. I also ordered my beer to wash down the food, so that was the best part. I keep thinking in my head, I paid $16 for the burger alone.. With beer around $20 not including taxes + gratuities. Is this what a gourmet burger combo/meal is supposed to be?The most unfortunate part of my visit is the realization that I made a mistake by coming here again instead of driving further north and dine at The King's Landing or Main Street Burger Shoppe in Stouffville. Not to mention they don't charge serving water. Even if they did charge for water, it'll be a dollar less. It's not a problem with me bc I like my burger with beer anyway.Service was fine, but not spectacular and managing a business, especially an eatery has its challenges. 2 stars for managing and maintaining this place, 0.5 for food on the second try.
Sigh. What a bland place. On all counts.Perhaps dim sum just doesn't do it for me, but I'm pretty sure that my issue with the food was that, although it was objectively okay, it had an objectively low flavour content.Almost worst for me was the dim sum service; the service was as convenient as a buffet and just as charming. Again, perhaps this is how it should be, but the servers didn't even pretend to care what we might find interesting. They were not in the least bit interested in making suggestions. Whatever. They didn't care. I don't care.The space is huge though. I bet they can fit a million people here. So there's that I guess.Oh, and the tea was excellent (even if tied to the teapot with a plastic tie). Yes, the tea. If I visit Silver Dragon again, I'll take the yum cha, hold the food.
Check in took around an hour, then they decided to charge an extra fee of $100 on top of what I paid on Expedia. Cold showers all three days of our trip. The bathroom is missing tiles. Nothing like what was shown in the pictures online. The maid turned the heat down to 60, and we were left coming back to the room freezing with not even any blankets on the bed. And the room always seemed to have a smell of vomit.
Decent beer and liquor selection but the food situation is quite poor. There is absolutely nothing local about the ingredients. They serve pre-made burgers, freezer section sides, and Mrs Ts pierogies that you would have at home. The sausage gravy and biscuits was atrocious. Cake like biscuits broke apart and could not be forked. The whole dish appeared to be heavily salted prior to serving, so it overwhelmed the whole plate. No kidding, so much salt my tongue felt shriveled and rough. The corned beef hash was straight out of a can. I feel that the "local" aspect of this place is deceiving and inaccurate. Nothing fresh to be found here.
I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it appears as though the high end stores have decided to fore go their zip code on this one.  On the plus side, it does have a two huge arenas in its corner, so at least you have something to do while waiting for your event to start.  I would have liked to have seen more Kierland type stores in here.  It's a bummer since this place had so much potential.
Had the escargot and rib eye steak. The escargot was okay, but it didn't seem like too much effort was put into it. The real disappointment was in the steak. It was a bit too overcooked and the outside was really burnt. I don't know about you, but I would rather prefer my steak without a black crust that leaks into every bite and ruins the flavour of the meat. They had a 3 beer selection.
Very disappointing. On the plus side, greeting and service was very friendly. Decor was cool. We visited on 9/19/12 around 11:30 am. The food was a huge disappointment. Two eggs, chicken sausage, potatoes and biscuit $7.99. Chicken sausage was hard, dry, and maybe made the day before?. Terrible!  The potatoes also could not have beent fresh, reheated, and tasteless. I'm not sure what the moon dust was they advertised, as they were plain. The signature biscuit was large and hard, cold and dusted with sugar. Poor value and bad food, not a good mix, sorry but I'm being honest.p.s. I originally wrote this after our visit on 9/19/12, but not sure why it was sitting waiting to post. So here it is, hopefully, gotten better.
Food is good here but the staff and policies are out of control.We sat down for 65 mins and were told it was last call for alcohol. Reason being, 1 member of out party showed up 15 mins early and they changed out reservation to 6:45 instead of 7 and have a strict 2 hour policy. Anyways, if you want to go to a bar, don't go here cus you get 1 hour to order and eat. Lame
I thought we had a good thing going with this place but after this visit I can say we will definitely not be back. The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. There is no reason for almost an hour wait between receiving our appetizer and our entrees. Drinks were empty for probably 30 minutes of that time.This place needs to get their act together with the scheduling. After coming here weekend after weekend experiencing the same issue we can clearly see there's a problem that those who come every once in awhile do not.
Salad sensations is a place some people from the office like coming here because it's fresh and healthy. I've eaten here a bunch of times and honestly I'm not a fan of the place. I'm all for healthy food however I find their sandwiches uninspiring and bland. Sure they have lots of options but I don't really find them very flavorful.  Maybe because they are too damm healthy they don't taste as good to me. The last time I was here I ended up using copious amounts of sriracha just to give some more flavour. The last time I was here I had their le frais sandwich. I've also had their l'hyperactive soup. Again it was okay but I find the flavour lacking zest. Maybe because we use lots of bold seasoning in our household. When friends from the office mention to come here I cringe like taking a bite into a sour lemon. You may enjoy this place but I concur it's bland rabbit food for me!
Meh - not impressed. The guy was super distracted, they didn't seat me by my friend even though we were the only 2 in there and the gel manicure didn't last.
This place was alright. The price and the portion doesn't match. It's nothing different compared  to a hole in the wall Chinese spot. I'd rather have gone somewhere else.
Came here during my lunch to process my application for a passport because they were the closest. They had a sign near the counter that weren't doing them today. Their hours are 11-4. What a joke.
This place continues to go downhill. Service is slow and food is below average. It used to be much better. What happened?
There are so many better options close by for ayce sushi. The quality here was at best average, as was the service. The entire time we felt as though we were inconveniencing them by being there. It was several hrs before they closed and I don't believe we were being rude. With Jjanga, Umiya, and Goyaman up the street in either direction you can easily pass this place up and be happy with your decision. These guys simply can't compete.
I was really looking forward to going here, what a let down. Nothing special about the food here. The burger I would rate average at best and cold fries. Nothing special about this burger.
Wet burrito was bland and tastelessChips and salsa were like eating half cooked chips and pace picante...I don't reccomend this place to anyoneMy lunch was a burrito which said it was grilled chicken when it was braised and shredded instead, chips and salsa, and a soda and was $15It really didn't taste fresh and when you use products that come from a can instead of fresh products - we can tell and it's not cool man.AlsoI smelled like a dirty deep fryer when I leftMy shirt and beard smelled like nasty old fryer grease.  I went home and had to do laundry.Try again Boca Loca!I won't be back.
This is the phone company you can't reach by phone.Try it out, call the number. Even voice mail is full.If you get lucky you can leave a message, and never get a callback.Drove to the office, signed up, 10 day wait for install.Guy showed up, said that he couldn't do the install, another guywould be by "in a day or two". That was five days ago, no show.Manana, baby.
Not sure how i feel about this place as today was our first appointment for OT and Speech eval tomorrow is his PT eval.  First thing the building looks like a house im giving it a chance bc they do have horses. Walking into the front entrance the waiting room is small, the bath room Is A Porta-potty which is DISGUSTING. I asked how the state can allow this to be considered a handi accessible bathroom my son is in a wheel chair but he is content. We had to physically lift my son to urinate which resulted in urin on the floor, along with all the Other Urin on the floor, apparently the bathroom is hooked up to a septic tank and would not accommodate the amount of ppl who would be using it, the pool pump was broke. And the water was Green. I have waited a year for pt so im gritting my teeth and pushing through, the Speech eval was working with a mask bc she had an upper respiratory illness and despite me telling my children are low immune she found away to get back into the room.  Ill update further as this review develops.
My wife took me here last night for my first time and her second. The establishment was filled with middle eastern folks so it must be good right? We placed our order and then waited for about 20 minutes to get it. We stood in the back of the place waiting and then finally moved outside to watch as the young man made the crepes. As we were sitting I noticed a female employee who was. Asking drinks and delivering orders inside and out of the place, with no hair net or hat to hold her long hair back. She constantly moved her hair back with her hands  and or would touch her face and then go back to what she was doing. Never wore gloves nor washed her hands after touching her face or hair or even when she would go in and out of the front door, grabbing the handle. Occasionally she would wipe her fingers on a white towel but gross. I'm not so sure this is a place I would want to come back to until she reapplies for a food handlers card.
My first visit here, I came for lunch with friends and it was packed.  This place kind of reminded me of Panera Bread, but with more choices and a little bit cheaper.  They only took half my order because you order soup/ salad first then down the line you can order soup.  They got my sandwich order, but completely overlooked me and went to the person behind me,  I did manage to squeeze in my soup order (I was going for the pick 2). My other friend was successful in placing both his orders, but his sandwich never came down to the cashier. Then they said they will bring it out to him and it took almost 15 minutes even when he went back to ask them what happen to his sandwich.When it came to finding a table, the empty ones were dirty with no one in sight to clean or wipe off the table.  I had to go to the cashier to ask them to send someone or give me a towel to wipe it off.  I did enjoy my turkey spinach artichoke panini sandwich though.
This place drives me crazy. I went once a couple months back and hated it. The person that asks what kind of wash you want would not stop up selling me. I decided to never go back. Then they put up a sign saying the place was under new management. I went back and it was worse than before. the guy wouldn't quit up selling me. Then the window crack lady jumped on me. Then it took forever to do the wash. I won't be going back...ever!
Stayed here during work meeting at Wynn for cheaper rate. Big mistake. Greasy, bland food. Bathroom with malfunctioning whirlpool. Location was fine for the Wynn but still a hike for everything else. Aside from the dysfunctional whirlpool bath, might as well have been staying at a Holiday Inn. If you feel like hoofing it through a shopping mall to get anywhere this place might be for you. If you want a more convenient, pleasant experience, stay somewhere else.
I always wanted to try this place but was very dissapointed with the food. It was outrageously expensive because probably of its location but the thing I didnt like most is the the house special steak tasted like your average steak at a random bbq party. There is absolutely nothing special about this steak house I personally prefer fresh meat over aged meat and a place that knows how to marinate their steaks to make the mouth water and not just throw a piece of meat on a grill and serve it plain.. We paid $150 for 2 and drank sparkling water with our meals. The portions were large and we did take leftovers home.
Service is ok but Mercedes should be since it is at a2-3X premium versus regular quality shops. Sales is priced high and then they try to impose a ridiculous mandatory $695 admin(paperwork must be really tough in Charlotte?)fee and and sneak it by consumers!.? Fees like that are illegal in other states because they are exploiting customers. So I bought a Mercedes in Oh for thousands less and a reasonable $295 admin fee. I don't mind paying a fair price but refuse to pay and uninformed and inflated price.
Food: ok to good. Service SUCKS. Just the waitresses. Its ALWAYS been like this. This will be my last time here.  By the end of my birthday get together I wanted to take my malfunctioning ipad and smack my server with it.
Let's start with this. The food is great. Everything we ate was cooked to perfection-albeit stingy portions for the price. Not to say that it's easy but their style is all pretty much pre made. Nicely roasted chicken, rice, etc. So it should be pretty easy to keep it all smooth right? Well not in the slightest apparently. We were quickly seated, handed menus and offered drinks. Fifteen minutes later the bartender noticed nobody had brought them to us so he did himself. And took our order after noticing nobody had done so. Food came out and that was the last we heard from anyone there. I stopped a waitress and asked for a second drink. Never got it. Our plates sat empty for a good half hour as staff busily wandered with nothing in hand. We had to beg to get a check and then beg even more to pay it. I hope they get it together. The food was really good. But it won't last long if they don't.
Oh, Bobby Bobby Bobby.... With your cocky attitude and plastic smile, your condescending behavior to everyone, you are indeed the vision of the American white man I hate. He should be grateful he's never met me in person.But, when going on a celebrity chef tour, you can't reject Bobby Flay. This is the greatest excuse for me to talk shit. We walked in and his books with all his smiles welcomed us. Yes, buy my books before you sit down. The interior is nice and fiery, a visual representation of what he wants his food to be. It's all good and all, but what the hell is up with the bar being a completely different color scheme and even art style that clashes so horribly with the rest of the place? Another freshly graduated interior designer, it seems. "MESA" is the big name you see no matter where you're sitting, in an oddly half-cut big block lettering. Nick commented "I wonder if anyone told Bobby that half his letters are missing." The logo makes no sense with the interior design either, all of which just says to me "failure".I did not keep the receipt but I still remember a good part of the meal.Tiger shrimp tamales, an appetizer, is an absolute must in trying Bobby's food. It is an absolute must because he always makes it. So you have to eat it, because it is his signature dish. Obviously it is his favorite, so he better do this right. And it is good. I'd hate to say it, but it's a well-made tamale. Sure not exactly Mexican, but it tastes pretty good. It had all of two shrimps. A spicy mayo sauce is gooped onto it. A ceviche turned out to be leftover bits of grouper fish tossed in lemon juice. The fish was nice and fresh, but that ain't ceviche. Two different fish dishes were decent, good ingredients prepared by good workers. Such a pitiful thing that Bobby does is overpower everything by drowning them in sauces. You don't really taste the meat, you taste the sauce. And Tony Bourdain was right. You can tell all too easily that the sauces came out of squeeze bottles. And before then they came out of blenders. Something... that just kills the cooking essense of cooking.The dessert was at least very good, worth going to Bobby's for. Warm chocolate crepes with strawberries, with plenty of warm goopy sauce around it.The best part of the meal, and I've had too many experiences like this at "fine dining" places, was the free bread that was passed around. Corn bread with actual corn chunks (to remind you that you're eating corn bread), was a bit more crumbly than I would like (it just means crumbs everywhere!!) but it did have the corn flavor goodness. With warm butter (although that made it crumblier) it was better.I watched a steak being served to another table, and the load of peppers and sauce on top of it made me cringe. As we left the books bid us farewell.
I have to say Pho Viet has an awesome website! The menu has pictures how each single item looks like!! And I can tell you, the real things looks exactly the same! :)I was there for lunch on a Friday afternoon around 12 pm. The restaurant is not busy at all when I walked in and by the time I leave there is a wait for tables!Pho Viet seems to be frequented by people working in the area. The owners knows what their usual orders and that made them feel really welcome and special.I have the pho noodle with raw beef.. I ordered a LARGE... The soup is quite tasty, the main disappointment is the noodles not being fresh ones. The noodles they use in the pho are the dried varieties. There are tons of  noodles in the bowel though, for sure you won't be hungry after eating that. However, I just don't like that taste of dried noodles at all...There are not much ingredients in the noodles though... I guess when you order a bigger size, that's is just more noodles....not more meat.There are no lunch specials.They accepts Interac and Cash only.
After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco's I finally decided to try it out. And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was "ok" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened.
I have always came here (2years) and received the worst customer service but sometimes I have to come in here due to my packages ending up here. Recently I came in and I don't know if Nicholas just got hired or hes been there but he has given me the best customer service I have ever received there. I am giving it 2 stars just because the other female employee is horrible. I seriously always pray I don't have to deal with her. They should have Nicholas train the others on how to customer service.
The outfield fence is very tall when it doesn't need to be; move the wall out and shorten the height.You can't bring in food.  This is the only ballpark I've ever been to where this is the case.  To add to it, the food options once you get inside are very unimaginative.The grass is always half dead, even on opening day.There arn't enough windows for buying day of game tickets / will call.Metal benches are very uncomfortable.  You would think that after 30 years you would eventually upgrade to seats.Don't go on dollar beer night.  The douchebaggery is at sky high levels.
The food is good so is the service. But wow is it pricy. Been a while since i was here. Most meals are 20 bucks and up. For half the money i could get just as good a meal down the street at a less pretentious restraunt.
We just finished eating here. The food was just fine but the service was so sad. Our waiter was pleasant enough but could not seem to handle more than one table at a time. My son wanted a refill of his soda and practically had to trip another waitress to ask her to get him a soda. Thank god we were able to pay at the table or we might still be there waiting for our check.
In the past six months I have seen a steady downfall in the preparation of the dishes and service at Mimi's. ( Stephanie St. location). I ordered the salmon dinner and it was dried out. There were few vegetables on the plate. There was a small amount of spinach and four, yes,  four small roasted potatoes. Another time, I ordered the egg breakfast. The bacon was stringy and in parts inedible. Recently, I again ordered the breakfast (2 scrambled eggs, bacon,roasted potatoes, English muffin and coffee) The restaurant was not crowded yet the wait was a long one. When the food finally arrived, the eggs were lukewarm, the bacon was stringy , again!, and the potatoes were, well, one was completely frozen, and the others were cold! The server neglected to ask me if everything was ok until she arrived to hand us our bill.I told her about the potatoes and she willingly gave me a small fruit cup in its place. Oh good, their fruit cup is usually good. The fruit in the past at Mimi's was clean, firm and tasty. Again, disappointment. The grapes were mushy, and the cantaloupe was not sweet. The pineapple was also tasteless.  Big changes at this Mimi's and not for the better.
Peanut Butter Paradise is the bomb, the service really  slow.  I have seen the employees texting on their phones and us the customers have to  waited for them to finish and I mean not just a couple minutes, I mean like ten minutes.....  it's the only one by my home.  Staff need more training on how to have better work ethics........  Good Luck with that one!
Ugh here we go.. this is my second time ordering from crepe club through Postmates. Both times big let down. I order through Postmates several times a week and rarely ever have any issues so I know it's nothing they could of prevented unless the drivers start sampling the food and drinks before delivery. I ordered the regular chicken florentine - crepe was cold, doughy and undercooked. It was generously stuffed, almost too much. Spinach was fresh, but not cooked so it was like eating a salad in my crepe...the mushrooms, clearly were canned precooked mushrooms. I'm not totally offended by them, but when you put a ton in a raw crepe...not really tasty.Iced latte- there is no option to NOT add flavoring which is baffling in itself. Flavoring should be a option not a requirement. Given I can't stand sugar filled syrup pretending to be caramel in my coffee, in the special notes section, I specifically asked NO flavoring, and add a extra shot. Guess who got a caramel syrup latte?  This girl. Why even have the special requests field if you aren't going to read it? This happened the first time I ordered. I don't know if they can't see the notes or figure it can be put on Postmates. It's all very confusing.Chocolate croissant- tasty, seemed fresh. Nothing special but compared to my $10 crepe and watered down overly flavored latte it shined. Dear management, read your reviews. Common theme, crepes are undercooked. If you are going to be so bold to name your establishment after a certain food, you best knock it out of the park. IHOP makes a better chicken Florentine crepe. That's shameful. I gave it two shots both were overpriced let downs. Their space can't seem to keep a business longer than 2 years. I'll be shocked if they stick around.
The clinic is clean and the staff is courteous --they  have free bottles of water. Some of the technicians were pleasant and some of the doctors were pleasant. Yet, I would go across town to use another diagnostic service if I had to, here is why.Three months into the pregnancy our OBGYN spotted something unusual in on our ultrasound. It was right before Thanksgiving, so we went straight into the center so we didn't have to worry during the holiday. My healthcare insurance wasn't kicked in yet, so I had to pay everything and it is an expensive service. The technician surveyed all over the mouth area of my child, took lots of ultrasound shots and found nothing to be alarmed at. One of the doctor's came in and gave us a consult and said they couldn't find anything special, but maybe the baby had a big nose and pointed to me and said maybe it's just from dad. We were relieved, but they said come back a month later to check again. This time we went to see Dr. Elliot. We went in for the ultrasound, and this time they spotted something odd. The technician became uncomfortably quiet and told us to wait for Dr. Elliot, who didn't show up on time for our appointment. Eventually Dr. Elliot comes into the office in a rush and disheveled. He comes into his office and gets his technicians out to ask us to come to his office. He couldn't be bothered to get us himself. We sit down and he immediately tells us the bad news -- our child has a bilateral cleft lip. We were devastated to hear this, but he told us he was 97% positive the child didn't have a cleft palate. The difference between have a child with a cleft lip vs a cleft palate is wide. Cleft lip requires one, maybe two surgeries. A cleft palate takes up to two decades of surgeries.  My wife is extremely upset so I made sure the bill was paid so we can go home. Yet, the bill wasn't ready and wouldn't be ready quickly because they didn't have they didn't do their job. When eventually they did get it figured out, they called me as if I ran out on the bill. I was extremely pissed. I went back to the clinic to pay the bill and found out the Dr. charged me for a 30 minute for 80 dollars but he barely spent 10 minutes with us. I hope he doesn't bill insurance like this, to me it feels highly suspicious . After I called him out on his nonsense, he called us back and spent more time answering our questions and lowered his fee. They then scheduled us for another ultrasound, but this time my insurance was kicked in but my card had not arrived. We were told to pay anyways and they would send us the refund after three weeks they got in the information. It took them two and half months to finally send me a refund and that was after making 4-5 phone calls. Our child was born on the 9th of this month, but the doctor had his diagnosis wrong. All those expenses trips to this clinic all that time spent and he was wrong. Our child was born with a complete bilateral cleft lip and palate.  Dr. Elliot had the diagnosis very wrong. So in review.1. Clean organized office -- good enough staff.2. Extremely expensive3. Didn't have paperwork ready when we left.4. Completely missed a cleft on the first expensive ultrasound, and completely missed the cleft palate on the next two ultrasounds.5. Dr. originally overcharged me for this time. 6. Dealing with their billing department is a time sink. If anyone at Valley Perinatal wants to contact me about this review, please do. I want to talk about getting my refund for your third rate service.
Again, this is another restaurant that I only learned about when they offered a Groupon.  I went for lunch and took a friend (that had also never been there).  We go to lunch every couple weeks and usually to Mexican places.  They told us when we arrived that the coupon was only good for dinners, but that if we order from there dinner menu we could use it.Their food was average.  Chips and salsa were good.  Drinks average.  Nothing special and since it's a bit of a distance from my house, I won't go back.  The service was excellent but possibly that was because there were only a couple other tables occupied.  But the service was good.
It's a clean, well-stocked store but their sale items are mislabeled which is pretty misleading, and they won't honor the price after you've waited in line for 15 min! Nor do they bother to tell you there's a 40% coupon for full-price items as an alternative. I was buying picture frames today, and there were sale signs ALL over the frame department (in EVERY isle!) that read "Buy 1, Get 1 Free!", but then I was told at the register the "Home" frames weren't included in the sale. Huh?! What's the difference?! Pretty lame way to lose a customer. I had to wait in line again and, thanks to fellow shoppers who clued me in, I used the coupon. Annoying.
Rude car wash cashier attendant. $8 was their cheapest exterior car wash option. Not worth it. It's just a short ride thru their automated car wash and not enough time going thru the dryer at the end. Cashier needs a serious attitude check.
I've heard great things about this restaurant and was so excited to give it a try.  Honestly, I wish I didn't.  I made reservations (highly recommended) and we got there about 10 minutes early.  When we got to the hostess stand to check in, the hostess saw me and didn't even acknowledge me, the girl standing next to her said hi to us and kept looking at the hostess but she was acting like she was busy. She looked like she hated her job and seriously if you're gonna look and act like that to your customers, then get a new job.  After a few minutes the other girl asked us if we had reservations and that's when the hostess looked as us and finally helped us but was being really rude.  We finally got seated, our server was really nice and helpful.  The food was alright, nothing special, I've tasted better.   I got the lobster surf and turf and it was $125, my boyfriend got the prime rib and that was only $45. We also got sides to share and that was alright too.  Overall I don't think I would be coming back here.
I'm in Phoenix for the weekend and as I'm hooked on driving the karts at K1, I have to go check out their Phoenix track too, right?   It's also my buddy's birthday so another reason to go!    Plus I found and bought this great deal on Groupon, 2 licenses and 4 races = $44!!  LOCATION:  It's not on a main street so you'll have to zig zag through a few streets to get here.  Once you find the address you'll have to follow a chain-link fenced in "alley" around to the far end of this big warehouse building they're located in.THE STAFF: One Yelper wrote the staff was really rude.   I didn't get any of that.  The staff I encountered were pleasant, informative and helpful.We arrived early Saturday to avoid long wait times later in the day.   We walk in and there are only 2 other adults and 3 kids and no one had raced yet.   SWEET!   The woman at the counter said she'd add us to this first race so we wouldn't have to wait.  NICE.  However for some reason she didn't.   The (kart master) held that race about 5 minutes waiting for our names to be added.   He even walked over to the counter a couple times to ask.   He finally sent that group out without us.   Hmm, OK.  But it's still early, so we're good.   The adult's race, then the kiddos and now it's our turn.   The kart master gives us our kart number, we walk over and settle in, or try to.   I need more leg room, can't slide the seat back because there's no adjustment lever.   I go to the kart master about this and he says "None of the karts have seat adjusters, they keep breaking them and they're $300 each."   WTF???   "Umm OK, can you find a kart I can fit in?"Aside from the seat adjuster issue, the kart in the first race was fine.   The kart in the 2nd race however needed some attention, mostly tires I assume.   One tire had a horrendous flat spot because it was thumpin and shaking the kart the entire race.  Plus when I'd turn right the kart would go NOW, but when turned left, very slow to respond.    Yeah OK this made for a more challenging drive, but still.ALSO... during another race while we waited for our 2nd, they shut down the race because a kart hit the wall.   I spoke to that driver later and he said 2 of the 3 bolts holding the steering wheel came off!   WOW, no wonder he hit the wall!OVERALL: K1 Phoenix has a nice facility and track layout, but it seem with the flat-spotted tires and a steering wheel coming off, they need to get better at inspection and maintenance of the karts.   Because of this AND no seat adjustments, sorry K1, just 2 stars.
Had the steak and egg. Others had district one combo and pho tai nam. All was not very tasty. Overpriced for what you get. Service was ok. But the food was just so mediocre. Pho tasted sour and the steak and egg was nothing to write home about.
Very slow moving restaurant. It took twenty minutes to order a drink and one hour after being seated before our entrees came.  No acknowledgement or apologies for the delays. The bucatini dish I ordered was so salty, I couldn't eat it. Serving sizes were small. Very disappointed.
Party today was just okay.  Nobody helped me so my guests had to help us serve the food to kids and clean up.  Thank goodness I had my friends there.  Child enjoyed the party but I wouldn't do it here again.  For $450 I'd loved to have talked to my friends for a bit.
I attended this show last night and was under the impression that it would have more of a concert appeal than the typical Vegas show. I've seen JLO in concert twice and was looking forward to a more personal experience with my friend who accompanied me. However, this was not the case. The crowd was BORING. I understand that not everyone is a huge JLO fan, but I really wish they would've considered those who are. IT IS A CONCERT! People are entitled to stand, dance, and sing, when they have paid money to enjoy their time. My friend and I were in section 103 and a few rows behind the VIP section. I was one of the few who were standing and was told three times to sit, one woman grabbed on my arm twice to make me sit, and another even smacked my backside; apparently hoping this would make me sit. That was the final straw. I had been playing nice and even ignored the first attempts to keep me seated, but after being hit in a more than personal area by a complete stranger, I decided I couldn't take the harassment any longer. I was willing to forfeit my tickets just to avoid a situation from progressing to something worse. I alerted security who confirmed for me that dancing IS allowed and thankfully allowed my friend and I to change seats. They were not nearly as good as the seats we had, but I was grateful to finish the show without any further disturbance. To say the least, I didn't enjoy my time; especially because my trip to Vegas was FOR JLO and my birthday. Unless you're able to attend this show/concert willing to pay for 6 tickets at VIP table, beware of the crowd.  5 stars for JLO! She is a dedicated performer and has endless energy that unfortunately didn't rub off on the drab crowd. The costumes, lighting, music, choreography, dancers...etc was fantastic! I absolutely love her and plan on attending again in the future at a VIP table.
Completely underwhelmed. All the hype for nothing. Target in canada is lame and doesn't even come close to target USA. In the states, target actually competes with Walmart, not so much in canada. Their website isn't even up yet, at least not the shopping section. Pros: exclusive line of clothing and food products.Cons: not competitively priced like their u.s. counterpart.In my book, walmart is still better.
TOTALLY OVERPRICED!   I live within walking distance of a Panera and wish I could be satisified with their food, but I find it way overpriced and underwhelming at best.  This time I tried a new quinoa and lentil bowl.  It cost me $9.29, consisted of a funky broth that tasted anything but real and had a few kernels of guinoa and a few lentils.  With ingredients that inexpensive, how on earth do you skimp on them.  I almost laughed out loud when they brought the bowl.  I left starving.  I think I'm spoiled by eating at mom and pop shops like Pho Nam where you get a good bowl of pho with a complex and tasty broth and more food than you can eat in one seating for $8.  This time, I left Panera and walked straight to a little mom and pop Mexican joint on Odana Road and got an awesome quesadilla for $3.50.  Was filling and flavorful - the opposite of Panera.  I've learned my lesson for good.
The pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, I guess. Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out.
This place took over for some Cajun seafood  restaurant and had the same feel to it. All was well at first. I ordered the coconut mojito which took forever to come out. I think because they were car I up a fresh coconut to serve it in. I hope. The food took a while to come and when it did, it was just ok. I ordered the pork belly rice bowl and my wife ordered the pork chop. Her pork chop was overcooked and dried out. My pork belly came with an undercooked egg and in a dish separate from what is anticipated. Despite this I hoped initially that the food would be ok. At the end of the meal I felt unwell. Ended up getting sick. Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend, although the servers were nice-ish.
I choosed to go to flor de sal to celebrate one of my team that so deserved a great meal. Based on the reviews that I read, including the reviews I religiously read in toronto life (which have not disappointed in the last year) I was expecting a lot from this restaurant and got disappointed. It was regular food at best, the flavors were not unique and the presentation of the food (except for a vegetarian meal specially ordered) was ok at best. The food arrived cold and the polenta served as an accompaniment to the branzino was caked to the cool plate. The service was nice enough, but flor de sal failed to deliver on the eating experience I was expecting.
Omg!! Service was reaaaally slow. It's a serve-yourself fast food place, but it took them 25 minutes to make a kebab combo! The food was alright but very oily. The salad was just lettuce with a gross amount of Cole slaw dressing that got all over the meat and the rice, and quite frankly made half of the dish inedible. I'm so disappointed. It's been a week of bad food for me :(
While visiting Vegas with my sisters we decided to find a sushi place that open late I went on yelp and started searching for sushi restaurant around the area and  found sushi 21 they have an all you can eat sushi so my sister and i did the all you can eat.  I was a bit  disappointed the sushi came out fast but the rolls was not good and the server don't check up on you unless you flagged them down . Over all if I'm back in Vegas again I won't go back.
Not impressed with Enterprise or their taxes and surcharges! Nor with the fact that while a child was talking in my one ear, the customer service agent took that weakness and upsold me to a small SUV. LOTS more money, but NO more space. When I had a chance to breathe, I was angry.  In addition, you have to pay a $75 fee to return your Enterprise rental back to anywhere else BUT the airport. DISLIKE!
A few months ago, I was very excited to try this place and I was disappointed. As far as decor, it is a cool and modern place. However the service is not great at all and the food is okay.I went on a Friday night and it was empty in there except for a few people around the bar area. My boyfriend and I were seated at a huge table even though it was the two of us. Then our server only visited our table a total of 2 times (once to get our drink order and once to bring the check). We had random workers stop by to ask how things were and to bring out our food. They weren't very organized and every interaction was kind of awkward.Although the service was not great, I believe that it could be fixed if the staff would have interacted with each other a little more and had a game plan for the few customers in the restaurant. They just seemed so unsure of themselves and we could pick up on it. Despite everything though, the chicken quesadillas were good.
The service is all around Slow. There is major construction going on and the is no easy way to the Strip. Also all the pools and hot tubs are closed because of construction, except 1 pool and it is jam packed with people laying in walkways and on steps. Management doesnt care and says "the web site warned us". My point is; stay away till at least memorial weekend. It is supposed to be done by then.
Street taco meat was over cooked and the black beans were completely under cooked. Server spilled our host's dish. Probably not going to come back here again.
Ok Beijing Peking duck in the area . Service was decent , the food was a little bland . Nothing too special overall ... prices were fair i suppose but make sure you check your bill - they calculated my bill wrong twice and then after finally getting the bill right , they gave me back way less change than what it should've been ...if they hadn't don't that I would've given them 3 stars
Its totters between Meh - I've experienced better to A - OK.  During game day for football its pretty fun.  Always a good place to have that last drink before heading to the stadium.  But for pregaming before basketball... well it was kinda dull.I never had food here, and I have no desire to even try the food here.  The brews can be improved upon.  I know its a brew pub, but I recommend getting a well drink or something.  Like I said, good place for that last drink before heading into a game.  Sadly, not for much else.
Waited 1:30 hours to get to the main dish.  Service was erratic at best.  The food was OK (dried due to the lack of service and probably standing under the hot lights for a while) and the ambience was noisy. Server used the same cloth to clean 30 table without ever cleaning it, the place is dirty, the service is a touch and go.  The prices are well overprice, most gelato have a crust on them and they still serve it the way it is.  Overall a 2 star experience.
I once got busy in this burger king bathroom. Not all the humpty dance has it hyped up to be. I have been hittin up BKs across this great country of ours for decades.  So I was quite disapointed with this joint when I had to spend most of my time in the restrrom.  Maybe it was something I ate before my double whopper, but I doubt it. :(
Food was delicious, but service was terrible. We arrived for Sunday brunch and were told it would be a 35 minute wait for a table, but we could sit at a high top in the bar right away. We were hungry so we took the high top. Our table overlooked two regular tables for 2 in the restaurant that remained empty literally the entire time we were there. We asked if we could move to one of them, but were told no. So, we just watched empty tables for over one hour. Waiters were totally scattered and overwhelmed in the uncrowded restaurant. I had to get up and get menus because we were not given any, and it took a long time to order, get the check, and pay. We were brought wrong items, and had to ask for coffee and water refills every time. Brunch took nearly two hours with the slow service. I've had dinner here before and it's been amazing, but the service has just gone downhill. I will not be returning.
Not at all up to its rating on Priceline of 4 stars. Heavy smoke smell in casino (poor ventilation)Garden Buffet food was good for the money.  Coronado Cafe was terrible.  My porterhouse steak was literally 1/4 inch thick! Rooms big but looking a bit dated and tired. Overall just low quality everywhere you look. Front desk manager terrible!  I asked to stay 30 minutes over check-out as I had a very early business meeting and needed a little rest before hitting the road. She refused me in an unsympathetic way on top of it!  It was just rude. There wasn't even a cleaning cart near my room.  I left for fear they would automatically charge me.  I wrote into the hotel and they sent back a "cut and paste" answer that said sometimes they are booked.   Would not stay there again.
This place could be great, maybe even a top 10 "must stop for kids" in a what to do while in Old Town, or even Phoenix/Scottsdale . However, they have a way to go before they even make the top 50 list. There is a really bad smell as soon as you walk inside the door. The restrooms and general areas are not clean.  The food is average at best. I had the chili with cheese and onion. They gave me a "slice" of cheddar, it was strange, and the chili was 90%beans, no flavor. It's such a shame. The decor, if clean would be on spot. The theme is so cute, down to the menu. They need to shut down for a weekend, hire a professional chef to revamp the menu and clean the place from top to bottom.  So close, but yet so far!!!!!
A bit overhyped as the food was a little too salty for my taste. The waitstaff and ambiance was great, but my husband and I both suffered extreme food poisoning from the rainbow trout we both had, so that definitely cemented our review of this place as negative.
We had one thing in mind when we entered Kahunaville, drinks. I had some expired Travelzoo vouchers and I was pleased with how easy it was to use them for the price I paid, not always the case. The drinks and service, however, left something to be desired.Part of this was our fault, we were not really feeling the crazy, fruity, enormous cocktails. But I had heard their bartenders had won awards and such, so I figured a basic Manhattan would not be a problem. I was wrong. It wasn't disgusting, but it took some work to get it down. After that, we switched to frozen margaritas, which were far better. I would have gone with 3 stars, but the service was just plain bad. We were sitting at the bar, but were often forgotten and the time between drinks was just not OK. We likely would have had another drink or two in the same amount of time had we been given the chance. But we had somewhere to be, so we left with only a mild buzz and feeling pretty happy to get out of there. Under different circumstances, like a drunken bar crawl, I'm sure I might have had more fun. Fairly certain I will not come here again.
So it's been a while since I've been to a Church's, this one recently opened in our 'hood. I think I know why I stayed away so long. We used the drive thru for our order. Service time was reasonable. Staff was friendly and answered our questions. We ended up ordering an 8 peice Mixed Chicken Special, we asked to make sure that it included 2 breasts since that's what my husband likes. LOL. They assured us it would.Well there was one breast so my hubby got screwed but he is willing to eat dark meat too. We got the chicken original style, so we could gauge how good the chicken is without heat. Well it was moist inside; crunchy outside, not too greasy but utterly tasteless. The mashed potatoes and gravy were worse than school cafeteria potatoes. The coleslaw was okay. The biscuits are super small, but they were the best thing we had. $15 for that, I'm sad. I will not be returning. Popeye's and KFC are better by far and that's not saying much.
After reading numerous rave reviews about this place me and my friend decided to try it. The restaurant is smaller than you would expect but the ambiance was very nice.I ordered the jerk chicken dinner and my friend chose to order the jerk wrap. His wrap came to the table already broken which was very irritating as all the meat kept falling out as he tried to eat it. For my dish I was happy with the presentation but the food not so much. The portion of the rice was small and my coleslaw was rotten. It smelled sour and the taste was rancid. The smell was so bad my partner almost threw up from it. What irritated me the most was that the owner was there and asked the server what the issue was. Afterwards she continued to talk to the diners she knew and paid us no mind. I don't know about her but if I owned s restaurant I would have at least stopped by the table to ask if there was anything she could do or apologize for serving rotten food. On top of that we had to remind our waitress for a coke that we had ordered and my chicken was not fully cooked. Several pieces were a bit too tender but after constantly calling the waitress over I gave up on the meal.  We got our bill and left. At least the waitress took 15% off our bill. This place wasn't memorable and I wouldn't dine here again.
Mediocre, flavorless food. Burger King fries. Rude hostess. Slow service. And somebody walking in on me in the bathroom because the lock was faulty.This is all I remember of my visit to Poppy Den, because it just wasn't memorable at all. Such a shame, because it sounded like it had so much potential.
We had to eat at the bar because the wait was over 1. The waffle was like eating an eggo except it was flatter.  The chicken was good not great. The fries that they served us were cold and felt like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. You eat off of a plastic plate. Which would be okay if I didn't pay like I was eating somewhere where you eat off of China The bartender ignored us and didnt refill our drinks. Yes we didn't have any alcohol but why does that matter. She was more focused on the other guests that actually had alcohol.
Had breakfast there they gave me some raunchy toasts. And I asked for more toast and it was $2.59 for 2 slices of toast unbelievable. I could have bought a whole loaf of bread. Then I also only got one cup of coffee. Breakfast for two is $31 wow. Last time I go there
Came here for the ayce seafood buffet what a disappointment.the crab lags,muscles,and crawl fish was served over a bed of ice the crab was almost frozen and mush.the clams was ok. The only redeeming part of this was the cook that was making fresh seafood pasta.other then that if you are coming for the seafood buffet save your money their are other places that will cook it for you and not short cut it. Oh and service was less the Desirable
Large space which often has great shows of local artist's work. Nice egg sandwiches with pesto sauce for dipping (although you generally have to ask for it.) Okay coffee. Free WI-FI and thus jammed full of students who park it for the day and order a glass of hot tea. Also, the only thing Fair Trade in there is some coffee. The food is all Sysco and the like.
I stopped by to grab lunch before I went to visit my hubby in the hospital.  The parking is crazy!  That plaza is jam packed.  Got to the store, the tables are dirty, people are everywhere, and the employee was ready to take my order.  I just stepped in the place and I have not been there in a LONG time.  I ordered the turkey swiss bagel for lunch quickly. The sandwich was ok.  I think I will stick with bagel with cream cheese.
Friendly service, but very disorganized and slow.  The restaurant was packed for Winterlicious which led me to believe that I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the food was merely ok and came out very, very slowly.  They auto-gratuitied a table of 2 for 15%, it was definitely not deserved but lesson learned, I won't be back.
We went on a Sunday evening & the staff was quick to help but the place was sadly dead. The overhaul was pretty extensive but the place was still recognizable from the previous Minder Binders which was really nice for the nostalgia. The food menu didn't look great & I mistakenly ordered a foo foo chick drink which I rarely do (a pina colada) that was so, so lacking on the frozen end it was border line warm from over blending. Also it was Tempe priced in a shallow margarita glass. Hook me up with a hurricane glass full of frozen goodness & that's a Pina Colada. What I got was just sad. Hubs got a beer which was cold & what he ordered. Next time I will do the same. At the old Minder Binders I would have only dreamed of getting a beer. I should have stuck to that thought process  but with the fancy bathrooms & extensive overhaul I thought hey let's be fancy. Gotta try again for nostalgia's sake & order a burger & beer like the good ol' days & see how it goes. But right now I'm afraid to say it's like putting lipstick on a pig. :(
My friend found a hair in his food. Definitely lost my appetite when he pulled it out of his mouth. They compted his meal and drink and gave him a free double. We're  probably not coming back, the food wasnt that good.
Not impressed, had a thin, because I was told it would take an hour for a thick. Comparable to fuzzys, if you remember it by Albertsons off bell and 83rd. Medium was $22.75, wait was 1/2 hr, way over priced, I'm told deep dish is better will half to give that a chance, we were there late Sunday, think I'll order to go, place is awful slow!
We got great service but horrible, overpriced food. My steak was cold, my salad somehow wasn't cut up whatsoever so I had to deal with huge pieces of lettuce. My friends burger was salty and the cocktail that I got was disgusting. It's a cool enough venue but I'd redo the menu because there's so much potential. Also who only has one dessert? Like we could choose from baked Alaska to a scoop of ice cream- are you kidding me?
The restaurant looks nice. The service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious. However, the price of a disc of Seafood Noodle ( just regular seafood, not even lobster and enough for 1 person) is $34.99. The same disc in Los Angeles is typically around $12-$15. Their jacked up prices have left a bad taste for us. If you have a deep wallet, it is a good place to go.
Was ok i ordered fish and chips, the fish batter was like cutting through wood.   It was very dry inside.There was a table of drunk guys and we almost left because they were so rowdy and moved outside. Server was good to us and friendly.Not sure if we will ever go back to this place.
If the food was as good as our waitress, it would have been fantastic.  Unfortunately, I ordered wings and when I bit into one, it was bloody and raw.  Tried two more...same thing.  Our waitress was very apologetic and got another order for me...but by that time I really was not hungry.  Service was fantastic...food, not so much.
Ok, so I will start with the service was good. I did have to ask for more water but, I can deal with that. A co-worker and I went for lunch as its next to the new Denny's on Fremont Street and wanted to try somewhere new. We ordered the calamari and caprese salad for the appettizers. The calamari was good but, the sauce could have used some "umf" to it. The caprese was really good. I would have liked a little balsamic for it but, I just added some salt. I ordered the spaghetti ai pomodorini. My only request was no tomatoes (not fond of cooked ones) and to use angel hair instead. What I got was angel hair in butter. No flavor what so ever. There was hardly any basil or garlic. So basically, we had an expensive work lunch ($50 for both of us) and it had no taste. Now I'm not a cheapskate but, I want what I pay for. I won't say I wouldn't try it again but, maybe next time I'll do a dinner and see if its any better.
Cute shop! Drove from the West Valley to pick up some sweets based on the reviews. There were very few items left in the case; however, it was the end of the day. Bought a few cupcakes and some cheesecakes. Tasted the Vanilla cupcake and it was less than noteworthy. There was nothing special about it and frankly tasted like box cake. The buttercream was horrible! It was cold, hardened and tasted like salted butter was used. Extremely disappointed! I definately will not be returning!!!
I previously purchased my flooring from the Chandler/Gilbert Location.  It has held up well, so I can vouch for their laminate's quality.  However, this location is understaffed, which seems to have led to a decline in customer service.They definitely need to have more people on the sales floor, preferably equipped with excellent customer service training.
We stayed here for two nights over a weekend.  The clerks at the front desk were friendly enough.  There was a conference happening, so I was willing to cut them some slack after listening to them deal with some of the attendees.  Checking into our room, first thing we had to do was call room service and order some towels.  The room was adequate; it served our purpose for the weekend as we were seldom in it.  Free wi-fi, but it was slow!  Maybe the conference attendees was using all the bandwidth.  I would venture to say that the housekeeping was problematic.  There were crushed chips in front of the elevator doors on the third floor the entire time we were there.  It was really noticeable as they were the only two elevators that we saw and it seemed like one was out of service most of the weekend.  If that was how the common area was maintained, you had to wonder just how clean the rooms really were.  Exercise room was small, only a few machines.  My wife complained about that.  The husband of another couple actually went across the street to the local mall and paid to use the fitness center there.  In summary, this being a Holiday Inn Conference Centre, I expected more than I received.
My son and I love cupcakes and thought we would try this place after shopping. He chose the Grasshopper and I got the Triple Strawberry. We did not enjoy our cupcakes. The icing was tasty, but the cake was bland and extremely crumbly, which made the cupcake too difficult to eat. Must have been an off-day based on other reviews. Also, we went to the bathroom to wash our hands and there were some congratulatory balloons hanging in the hallway. It's great that this business expanded to a second location, but the language on these balloons is just not appropriate for children.
I really do like this place however we went to take family here tonight and had a pretty bad experience. Place was empty except for some hooligans making terrible noise at the bar we were the only people in the restaurant. They cranked up music so we couldnt hear the noisy bar people but it was too loud. Food was good as always but then it came time to pay. They refused my groupon because they said I ordered a special item. They also assured me that I would save way more money if I paid the full price. Got home and looked at TOS of groupon and they lied about that and then calculated my price w groupon...they lied about paying full price would be cheaper as well. I can see the owners try really hard with these place but it sounds like they have hired some incompetent people. That stunt they pulled tonight cost them a serious customer. Such a shame......
Prices aren't bad, but if a waitress rounds down my change when bringing it back, it's your last opportunity at my business.
Just another Big Y restaurant with decent food and horrible service.  Way overpriced for what you get. Be careful when ordering or a piece of plain grilled fish can easily top $50. Our food was ok but under seasoned.  I had to get up and search out the manager to get some salt and pepper when our server was no where to be found. The deck is nice in good weather but why they leave the sliding doors completely open in hot/humid weather is mind boggling.  Please allow people who want air conditioning an option.  Like all other restaurants in the Big Y group, wine is 3 1/2 to 4 times retail, so you're paying $100 for a $25 bottle...pay their high corkage fee and you're still ahead.
Came here Saturday afternoon. I just ordered a regular coffee but someone I was with had a mocha. Cup was half empty and inside looked like powdered hot chocolate that wasn't stirred. Lol. When returning drink there was a line of other folks who needed their drink fixed or remade.
The service is terrible. Servers are rude. The food is over priced. The ambience is terrible. Food is okay.There are better Ethiopian cuisines in town.Would not go back here again.
2.5 stars.I found out about this place after seeing the most amazing pictures of the Blueberry Hill (griddle cakes with blueberry). My friend was making an impromptu visit to the GTA, so I figured it would be a good time to try their brunch. Well, we arrived around 1:45 and we were seated around 2:45, but it was my first meal of the day and I ordered a waffle, so I'm still calling it brunch.I ordered the brown sugar bacon and banana brûlée waffles with a side of sugar cured smoked bacon because... bacon. Also, I was intrigued by that fact that it was also called "butcher's crack." It was OK. The waffle was nice and eggy, but nothing special. The bananas were anything but brûléed... a more accurate description would have been "battered and fried." The bacon had a nice sweet-salty-moky balance, but for whatever reason, I was expecting candied thick cut bacon and what I got was not that. I don't know.Service was OK. Our server was pretty blasé and not very proactive. Water glasses were left near empty for quite awhile and our empty plates remained on our table until we managed to flag her down for the bill... which was a task in an of itself, as she was nowhere to be found.TL;DR - long wait, average food, sub-par service
Hadn't been here in about two years and remembered that it was good so we went back. The place has gone downhill. They used to staff the place appropriately to keep the line moving but now it's excruciatingly slow. Ordered a Chicago style, asked if they knew how to make it and they said yes. They did not. The hot dog was literally half the size of the bun and it had hot sauce on it. I, at first, mistook it for ketchup and took it back. When they said it was hot sauce I asked why they put hot sauce on my hot dog and they just stared blankly. Husbands burger resembled a tiny hockey puck. They seem to clearly be cutting corners on staffing, ingredients, and training and it shows.
Cute bakery/eatery in beautiful old Montreal. Opt for the pastries instead of the savoury meal options. I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.  I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comté cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs. I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that.
This review is not limited to this particular Albertsons, but for many, including the one near Bermuda & Maryland, as well as the sister company Von's at Anthem Drive in Henderson. Shoppers BEWARE. When I presented my "just for you"  discount for certain items, the cash register price is higher than the stated "just for you" price.  This was not a singular experience. Without exaggeration, this occurred in more than 50% of times when I shopped there (at least 10 times in the past 2 months). I have no intention to destroy their reputation, but simply want to warn shoppers. In fact, I have switched to Smith for this reason.
Great food/atmosphere. Don't expect attentive or timely service. 70% of my visits have witnessed servers who only check on their tables once every 30 minutes or so. Perhaps it's a staffing issue.
The service was fast, meat portion of the order was on the smaller side for the price you pay, bread was good, food was very bland almost no flavor, there are much better options in Vegas for this type of food, don't think I'll be back to this place again. Had higher expectations but was let down.
I ate here once and loved it, came back and not so great .. came back and not so great ..service was bad and food was bad. The rolls fell apart. And I waited over a half hour for a simple mixed drink. Mann, bummed cuz I thought my go to sushi restaurant. . Guess back to the search
The food was really good! We ate mainly appetizers. The slopes were hard and the meat was cold. The flautas were very good as everything else such as the guacamole and ceviche. The service was TERRIBLE... it took the server 45 min to tell my father that they didn't have the bottle of wine he wanted wasn't available... it took them 45 minutes to bring out some food. And another 20 min to charge the bill..The waitress honestly had a terrible attitude whenever we asked where our drinks or food were.. the food overall 5 out of 10.. the service 3 out of 10
Food is consistently good here. Portions are adequate, but the service can be slow.The space is tight, and parking can be an issue in lawrenceville.
Natalie the owner is very nice and sweet but giving this place 2 stars not because of her work but I just didn't appreciate that when we got there for our appointment she tried telling me she had to shave down my Maltipoo close to chihuahua fur, I understand my dog was matted it's been 3 months since he was last groomed but she insisted that's the only way even when I told her I don't agree to it so we actually didn't follow through with the appointment. I feel like the price is cheaper than others but that's maybe because she just shaves down the dogs instead of giving them the look that someone is asking for. We just went back to our regular groomers which is at Las Vegas spaw :)
The atmosphere is gorgeous and I loved the garden just wished I had come during the day to check it all out. Unfortunately the food is a bit bland. We order zucchini chips, a Sonoran dog and the bbq chicken pizza. The zucchini chips were the best item we ordered but just okay. We will go back and try it again during the day maybe for breakfast. Cute place but the food was disappointing.
...They advertising everywhere, so I went to fix my iphone..But this place is so hard to find..... The service is pretty good tho.But they are little bit expensive , since all the phone store lowered their prices :(it's okay to try, but there are my cons.1) Location; it's so hard to find and that just totally irritated me. it looks like some kinds of offices instead phone store.2) price, since other phone stores has lower prices.3) lack of accessories overall, it is okay tho.But I won't recommend...
Disappointing. I am a sushi lover and was expecting something different. The quality of my sashimi platter was five-stars so I have zero issues on the food. It's fresh and wonderful, but very expensive for the setting, which is my complaint. Ginko is located under Dante, in a very tiny and terribly noisy basement, where there is barely space to fit in the bar or the few tables. This concept would be fine for a moderate price sushi experience, but it's a fail in a restaurant where you spend around $100 per person to have, I repeat, wonderful food... just in the wrong setting.
I found the place overrated, the food underwhelming and overpriced, and the portions small. In fact, the scallops that we were most excited to try seem to have gone from 3 for $17 down to 2 for $17. They were tasty but hardly worth it. The steak was thin and fine. No complaints or real praise. The pickerel was sort of nice but bland and unmemorable. Desserts looked good but they didn't have the Maple Cheesecake that is on their online menu, so we skipped it.
Service was good,  but the food was horrible.  I'm Mexican and this was not good Mexican food at all...most of the food seemed like it came from a can and the tortillas were most likely store bought. I will never come back.
Decided to try this place out after seeing the near perfect reviews it got on Yelp. Ordered the Master Burger and a poutine. The burger was really big, but nothing too special besides that. The poutine was pretty disappointing, the gravy was jelly-like and very chunky.
Gee, they are on the way to the convention center and there is a convention in here. Maybe they would be busy? Slow and not friendly service! Come on you can do better for the prices you are charging.
The women at the front is always on her cell phone. She stays on her phone when your doing a transaction. Give them a week to dry clean something and dont expect it back a week later. The only reason it got 2 stars is because the dry cleaning job was well done, but $6 for a pair of slacks? I'm not John Rockefeller.
I've been to this trader joes location 5 times in the past few weeks... I usually shop at the one in westlake since I live out that way... but since I'm working in beachwood now I was excited to know I was very close to a trader joes..  Let me just say that the service at this one doesn't even compare to the westlake location.. When I go to westlake they make me feel like family and I have a great time shopping there.. The service here is poor and not nearly as fun and helpful as westlake.. I usually checkout at the register closest to the door and the past 3 times the cashier was rude!! Never said thank you, good bye, have a great day or anything!! Rude!!! Westlake kudos to you for being WAY better and MUCH friendlier!!!
It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats.  A little over priced for what you get as far as quality.  All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third.
First time customer and very disappointed.  First tried to up sell to the detail and explained came with all the items in $39 package I was looking for.  I indicated first time there so just the  Platinum package for now.  Once that was settled the attitude seemed to change.  The folks inside were very nice, asked about how long and told 30-45 min, so went for quick walk.  Came back and saw my car in bay area being worked on.  Waited inside for a bit and finally went up to the front desk and asked don't they call numbers or have listed somewhere to know if done.  The guy indicated busy today, otherwise would come in and announce, so walked me out and told me to give ticket to one of the guys.  Gave me car keys and started to walk back to where my car was parked at back, when got to my car turned around the guy was gone.  I got in and oil everywhere from the leather cleaner, smelled terrible.  My trunk wasn't vacuumed.  Started to walk back, but thought forget it I had it done on Saturday and even yesterday my daughter was asking what is that smell when she got in. I certainly didn't expect a detail job, but would have expected my trunk clean and not all kinds of oily stuff streaked across the trim inside.  I ended up taking a rag and cleaner to it myself and will have to go vacuum it later today.  Only reason a 2 was because at least it was somewhat cleaner and my tires looked better.   I will not go back.
The specialty sushi rolls were good and the price is great compared to other similar rolls..... BUT I got sick a couple hours later and remained sick the rest of the day.  Unfortunately the sushi seems to be the only possible cause.
My two star rating of this restaurant doesn't mean that the food is not good.  Instead it is suppose to expresses my disappointment after build up in my mind about this gastropub.  I would revisit for a couple of specific dishes however I'm not one to enthusiastically  encourage anyone I know to go.My date and I went to celebrate her birthday and experience one of East 4ths signature restaurants.  I wanted to get a complete idea of the menu so I ordered the four course chefs tasting menu while she ordered the Whole Grilled Padrón Peppers and the  40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Since I was driving and she was not we considered ordering a half bottle of wine until we saw the high prices of the wine, ($30+)They first brought out my Peel & Eat Gulf Shrimp and her Whole Grilled Padrón Peppers. Both were excellent although I felt it was a lot of work to peal and devein the three large, headed shrimp.  The Padrón Peppers were described as 50/50 sweet and hot like a jalapeno but the ones she had while delicious were not hot.Next they brought my Crispy Chicken Wings Confit which is one of two items that I would go back to get.  The menu said that it's served with roasted jalapeno but I couldn't find or taste any, in fact these wings didn't have any heat what so ever.The entrees of "40 Clove" Heirloom Garlic Roasted  1/2 Chicken and 40 Day Dry Aged Rib Steak Frites.  Presentation was wonderful and worthy of the highest complements.  The taste on the other hand was average at best.  The chicken gives the impression that you'd get chicken roasted with 40 cloves of garlic or some other herb but other than the chicken being served inside brioche bread there was no notable garlic or herb flavor.  The steak was served as a ribeye and a separate braised rib but ended up on the fatty side.Served with my chicken was the other reason that I'd go back, the Very Very Very Spicy Greens n' Beans.  I'm not considered a greens lover by any stretch but I love these!  The chili paste is balanced against the white beans.Lastly we split the Cinnamon Roll Warm Bread Pudding with vanila creme anglaise.  What seemed like an excellent concept turned out to be a terrible disappointment.  The bread pudding was more like a dry bread casserole and the the creme anglaise was presented as the dreaded "spoon push' smear.I could go on but suffice to say if you want presentation over taste Greenhouse is your kind of choice.
Yep rental car company strikes again. Told our car would be right up in 15 - 20 mins. 20 mins later they say there are no cars in our class available but they are going to give us a free car upgrade. How about you not waste our time telling us you have a car when you don't and just give us the upgrade from the start? rolling my eyes
Brought my son to the splashpad on a whim. This place is filthy. The bathrooms are disgusting and the whole area smells like a trash can full of old hot dogs. If the place were cleaned occasionally I would likely give it 4 stars.
After reading reviews, I was super excited to visit this salon! I recently moved here and have desperately been trying to find a salon that does great nail art.My first time there was amazing! Kaitlynn was super friendly and patient as I tried to figure out exactly what I wanted. I left super impressed and couldn't wait to come back.The 2nd time I came back knowing what art design I wanted. I had a different nail tech and as we started the nail design, we couldn't quite get the look I wanted. I was trying to get a bright ombre but the colors weren't quite sticking. I told her it was okay and I understood, so we went with a 2nd design. I could tell she was getting flustered with me as my appt. was taking forever. We went with a second design but it wasn't at all what I had wanted. You can still see my old gel color on the sides of my nail, the gel already looks chipped by my cuticles and my nails are rough to the touch - all of which I am not used to. I also didn't receive a hand massage which is fine except the first tech I went to did give me one. I am super bummed as I thought I had finally found my new nail salon :(
The dream of the 90's is alive at Bob Coffee. There's "graffiti". Vintage indie rock - think Oasis. Motorcycles. Bukowski. Nirvana vinyl! There's industrial metal shelving and spotlights and branding on every damn thing in the whole place. Everything here is for sale.We visited Bob just a day after their grand opening. I waited a long time to order, not because of a long line, just super slow service. I waited even longer for my beverage, and while I waited I watched as the counter person forgot to give customer after customer their baked goods. The London Fog I ordered was very tasty, but I have no idea why it took so long to make. We also had a drip coffee, it was so acidic we only drank a third of the cup before throwing it out. There was a female barista, and a female counter person. As they worked, an unsmiling, unengaged man stood behind them and watched. He made no attempt to speak to any of the customers. I can only assume that he was the owner, supervising - but shouldn't the owner, on day two of business, make an effort to smile and say hi?The unsmiling management only heightened the overbearing masculine energy of this place. It's all very smug, as if they are planning on franchising into the next Starbucks. I think it's supposed to be gritty, but it just seems contrived? Boring. Functionally, those metal shelves are at just the right height to put your kid's eye out. Despite this being a family heavy neighborhood (indeed, Bob is right across the street from Action Potential Lab!), there is no change table, not even a hook for your bag or coat in the basement washrooms. The ladies room had no toilet paper at all. Overall, the whole vibe was unfriendly. I like my coffee shops to be warm, cozy, welcoming, and inviting. Bob is not a place that I want to spend time in. Get  your coffee to go here.
Not very friendly staff and WiFi only works part of the time.  Our site is under water after what a Floridian calls a summer shower. No cable tv but good antenna reception. This is an ok location but everything is 20-30 minutes away.
Very disappointing... And here is why...1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!)3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight. Not a great tone to set for patrons. 4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer. What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer. 5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet. Lame. 6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife. A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask. 7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke. Ended up costing $16+$31+7 (tip for pizza guy)= $53 for two mediocre cocktails. Won't be back.
Not the best gym to have so many around. It is not the facility or equipment that rates this a two but the piss poor customer service and money hungry employees. Nice, helpful and very friendly when signing you up. Once that is done..no one has time for you. You can clearly see what their goals are. Reminds me of people working for commission. Billing department is worse. I have seen several employees personal life come into the gym not in a good way. Staff and managers about to fight in front of a full gym of customers trying to work out.Facility is lovely with a dry sauna, indoor pool, different classes and cardio machine inside a movie theater upstairs and down. 95% of their machines are operational. They made this place 10x better when they got rid of the  fitness sback place. They were another problem. Unfortunately still have kids working and over zealous employees. Came back to see a lot of changes but even with a different staff they hire the same kind of people who have poor customer service. I waited 30 mins just to get info while young men are watching women come in and out, joking like young teenagers. One of these young men helped me when he realized I was the customer waiting. It was actually disappointing to see and no supervisor to discourage this behavior. It can be considered a form of sexual harrassment and may make women not feel welcomed. This was the same behavior 2 years ago and sad to see when i try to return ...no change in employees professionalism. This was on a Tuesday at 1pm when i came. I can only imagine after 5pm or weekends. Seems like high school or fraternity running a gym. I do not recommend this gym. You will think you can get over it because of the great facility but trust me the employees will cause you to leave. Easy fix...hire right employees to help and be a real gym..not immature young men who sexual harass women in the gym.
Wheat bread is stale, very dry and no flavor, very disappointing to get home and my sandwich was not what it should have been
What an odd No Frills.  As a No Frills goes, stock wise it's actually superior to most -- lots of things here you wouldn't normally find at a discount grocer.  Prices are good, nice variety... but:1)  shopping carts are dingy, old, and broken down.2)  shopping carts (again) are located either in the below ground parking lot, or in the NASTY corral outside that has on occasion smelled of urine, vomit, and dead animal.3)  terrible layout... where the hell is everything?  is there any rhyme or reason to how things are stocked?4)  questionable staff -- I actually witnessed a staff member stocking halal meat next to and on top of bulk packaged pork... a manager was there, told him he couldn't do that, and they subsequently got into a heated argument (complete with 'F' shots)All that aside, I can't ignore the variety available here... so every few weeks I'll come back, pick up a few things, and be done with it.For a better No Frills experience, try the one at Brockton village at Dundas W & Lansdowne.  Cleaner, fresher, superior layout.
Well.  I really wish I had a better review.  We really didnt have a good experience and wont be back.  The service is really, really lacking.  Something is wrong with housekeeping.Our room didnt have a luggage rack (waited 20 minutes to unpack)  Discovered the next morning that I didnt have a hairdryer (waited 30 minutes for them to bring one)  Housekeeping never came when we requested, however they were in our room at 3pm when we came back from shopping.  This hotel, even though its a non gaming, is not without trash.  Dont think you are getting anything extra special.  What you are getting is a hotel that really far away from the strip, very poor service disguised by a good name.  We will not be back,
The food is pretty average here but the service was super friendly. I ordered a falafel plate and it was decent though a tad bland and kind of soggy.  It was a decent value though there wasn't anything particularly spectacular about this place. I've only been once so I'd be up for trying other items on their menu but their falafel was lackluster.
Pathetic. $10 just to view Ferraris that are roped off?  They could have done this in a more friendly way, perhaps at least allowing some reasonable viewing from the outside and through the glass.  The Ferrari dealer here in AZ has about the same selection and you can get as close to you want and browse on Sundays when the salesmen are not there.  What a disappointment!
extremely busy. but understandable for a clinic.one male nurse is extremely angry and gets pissed off if you don't respond within a second of him calling your name. i even saw him hit the door and say fuck out loud. definitely not a bedside manner i want.
The course is in poor condition, the 18th green had a very large, and deep patch of sand on the front of it (so much so that you could leave footprints in it). The rest of the course was bone dry and looked like it was dying. Besides the course conditions, the interactions that I had with the staff were so bad I will not be coming back nor recommending this course.  The woman in the clubhouse was very kind, the starter was gruff but polite; the "players assistant" aka a crotchety old man on a golf cart looking for people breaking the rules was confrontational and extremely rude.I turned the golf cart around, and in the process went into the desert briefly. He drove up to us and said "You're in violation of the rules, do you know which rule?" I said that I did not, he said that I must know because there are signs on every hole cautioning not to drive in the desert.  Instead of asking politely, he turned this non-issue into a confrontation and made all of us very uncomfortable.  There is a reason this goat patch has almost every tee time available on a Saturday morning. Stay away from here, there are many other courses for the price that don't include belittling staff.
I never like to write a bad review....but if I experience bad service for the money that I have spent with you, then you're gonna get it.Only 4-6 people were actually inside dining- I stood at the bar for nearly 5 minutes to pick up food before receiving the first 'hello.'Food wasn't that bad, actually even better the next day as left-oversBut for the $$$ spent, I'll stick with my other favorites...will give it another shot someday when its nice outside and I can take advantage of their outdoor seating.
If you are going strictly for the quality of food and have an unlimited amount of time to spend- then this restaurant is awesome. However, of you have anything else to do in a day, maybe you'd want to go some place else. I believe we were forgotten about; sat at our table without being checked on for 40 minutes. When I asked if we could have our lunch to go because we needed to get back to work, it still took another 20 plus minutes for that to happen. I believe that they forgot to put in our order until I asked to make it to go. There was never an apology; I'm sorry that took so long, we messed up, or anything.. that is disappointing - as I am empathic to being busy and making mistakes- everyone is human and the food is good. But due to their lack of awareness, empathy or basic customer service; and borderline annoyance of being asked about the side order of kimchi (we were told it was in the ramen bowl, but not visible), I (nor the friends I was with) will not be going back to this establishment.
Unfortunately, I have to post an updated review for this Fausto's. The original was five stars, but this location has gone downhill the past year or so. The first thing is that they used to have three delicious salsas that I used for every meal. They were great. However, those are no more. Now there are only two salsas that are both pretty bad. Tonight they were so runny I couldn't even get any to stay on my chips. Sad!To make this issue more pressing, the entrees seem to have lost all flavor and I have no delectable salsa to mask that fact. I had enchiladas and a taco and both were incredibly bland. This used to be a place I'd bring friends from out of town to try and now I think I may have just made my last visit. I just hope management reads this and fixes things because I saw other reviewers stating the same thing.
Pizza and appetizers are pretty nice. Beer selection seemed OK, but not particularly vast. They had one poor bastard working there on the Sunday night before Memorial Day and it was like one of the only places open on the street. One person at the bar and doing table service for food. Service was predictably, cripplingly slow. Assuming this was a one off because of the holiday weekend I would give this place another try. The patrons having shouting matches outside also provided nice, light evening entertainment.
What a bizarre experience.  How many stores of the same kind can you house in close proximity?  This is full of small shops for chinese herbs, small electronics (i.e. cell phone accessories,) beauty salons (i.e. facials,) foot massage/acupuncturists.The only thing they've got going for it here is a bubble tea shop that sells fresh fruit juice and non-poweder based bubble teas with tasty fishball snacks.What's worse is that parking can be difficult despite the lack of patrons inside.Oh yeah, there is no "tower" at the Splendid China Tower.  I guess they are just being optimistic that someone will want to launder their money *ahem*...invest further in this place.
I'm very disappointed with this restaurant. I called to make a reservation and when we arrived, there was no table available.  We were seated by the bar, and changed to a table after we ordered the drinks.Our waitress messed our orders; she forgot to place half of the order, and she brought an appetizer to our table. The food took a long time to arrive. One of our friends had ordered black bean instead of the beans with pork, and her order did not arrive as she had asked.  The waiter stated that she would bring the black beans, but she never did.  At the end, my friend asked to have the black beans to go. I read all of the review prior to making the reservation, and I had high expectations for this restaurant. The food was very good and the appetizers were a must; however, customer services must be a priority for this restaurant. The waitress seemed to be annoyed with us and barely came to our table.
Size is shrinking after their 2nd store opening while prices remain the same. Service still inconsistent from rude to here you go.  I will need to find myself a new noodle house in RH.
Mixed feelings about this place. Scheduling - I think it's wrong of a family practice to not have some same-day appointments. My husband and son were in a car accident and needed to follow up with their primary after being treated at UMC.  When I called for an appointment just in that same week, I was told the first available was in 3 weeks.  What????  After me hemming and hawwing, miraculously an appointment appears with Dr. Gardner for that coming Thursday.  A family practice needs to be responsive to the fact that most families can't predict their illnesses two weeks out.  Wait Times - the other reviews are correct.  You will wait, and wait, and wait.  I've accepted this.  I think they overbook and it backfires.Dr. Forte - I only saw her once and she was actually very insightful with some issues my son was having.  I appreciated her candidness.Dr. Gardner - The first 5 minutes he was in the room, I thought he was just plain weird.  He didn't even introduce himself.  After awhile he grew on me a bit, but still not the greatest bedside manners.PA Joe - I think he's a jerk.  My husband sees him for regular check-up and thyroid meds,  I guess if you're an "easy" case he's okay.  After the car accident, his bedside manner was awful.  I had more questions and he just disappeared into another room - didn't even say goodbye or ask if we had any questions.Referrals - We have Teachers Health Trust and they've actually been surprisingly quick with getting our referrals set up.Overall, I'm not very impressed.  I think we'll shop new primary doctors in the near future.
I sought out the new b-dubs in downtown Kent. Having never been to the new location I was impressed with the building and T.V set up and everything else. Very impressive however it ended there our waitress on a dead afternoon came by 4 times and really didn't talk the even ask us how the food was she would just grab our drinks with no heads up and bring them back. Really frustrating service. Very disappointed because with only 3 other tables being served on the floor by other ppl idk what in the hell could keep you from providing some decent service
I've been here numerous times sat at the bar and had a few appetizers, love the bartender she has always been great.. I totally wish today I would have sat at the bar just like every other time, needless to say I was terribly disappointed with the service, food and overall experience, not only did I have to wait for a waiter once he finally came to "help" he was rushed and short got us some waters and came back to take our order, after taking our order we waited at least 15 minutes before we saw him again at which point we asked him to bring us a couple drinks, once he brought our drinks my fiancé realized his beer was not the one he had ordered, he then waited for this waiter Richard H. To come back so he could address the issue, once we were able to see him we noticed he was busy with another table so my fiancé went to the bar and asked the bartender to change his beer for the one he had originally ordered, we waited about 20 additional minutes and our food finally arrived it was cold and stiff I tried to mention it but Richard kept running up and down our area he finally asked me if I wanted some A1 sauce, at this point I was halfway into my steak I was so hungry and didn't wanna go through the hassle of having to wait an additional 20+ minutes for my food..... He finally brought our bill after asking if we wanted some desert... We put our debit card on the card holder and he took it but when he brought the bill back for it to be signed our card had gone missing... To be later found in his apron!!! I was very disappointed angry and irritated all I wanted to do is leave.. Needless to say I will not be coming back here and will not recommend this location to anyone else!!
I really wanted to like Momocho, but unfortunately, this experience just didn't deliver. The hostess was really nice and squeezed in a table for us on New Years eve, and then proceeded to seat us immediately when we came in. However, the experience did go downhill from there. We got our tables close to 7:45, by which time the restaurant was not as busy as earlier in the evening. However, it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to get the attention of any server (despite me waving at one). The drink orders were decent and the guacamole was pretty good, however the chips serving was not very much - just an average sized bowl. This would not have been an issue if they were not charging $8.50 for a guacamole serving, and $2 for each chip refill. For the main course ordered the Chilli Relleno, which was pretty good, a beetroot Taco dish which was ok, and their best beef tacos, which, honestly were tough. We've had more tender meat at a Taco Bell.Overall, it seemed like a place that had potential. There were definitely sparks of greatness (Cucumber Margarita and Chilli Rellenos). However, the overall experience just was not what I was expecting.
I went there for the second time today and have downgraded my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars. I concentrated on the freshly prepared "Live Cooking" items and was not as impressed this time by their taste as I was on opening day. The show was good, but the food was bland. The rest of the Chinese food items available in the restaurant are inferior to the Mandarin and the sushi is inferior to AYCE restaurants such as 168 Sushi.
If you're looking for breakfast, do yourself a favor and go to the Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet instead. My breakfast of granola, strawberries, bananas, and vanilla yogurt was crazy expensive, inedible, and disgusting. The yogurt was what I'd imagine unicorn sperm to be: gloopy and sickeningly sweet. My boyfriend ordered a bowl of Raisin Bran (one of those single servings you can buy at Costco). It was $10. I know it's Vegas, and everything's more expensive, but $30 seems like a lot for yogurt, 2 coffees, and a cup of raisin bran. The atmosphere sucks, too, unless you like smoke wafting in from the casino, and watching promos for "Extra" on one of the many TVs in the restaurant. Meh....
My housemate had a good experience here with gall bladder removal surgery, but I can't say the same for a recent emergency visit.  After an invasive medical procedure at another hospital -- see immediately preceding review -- I developed a high fever with severe chills.  I am diabetic which means a fever over a certain level is a cause for immediate concern and mine was above that point.While the emergency room was very fast (probably because I went there around 3 AM and they weren't busy) they were completely useless.  After taking my history which mentioned the diabetes and recent invasive procedure, the young doctor who examined me said it was probably the flu and sent me home. I took a copy of the bloodwork as I wanted to take it to my personal care doctor the next day.  I looked at the various white cell counts and noticed the neutrophils were high and the remainder of white cell types were normal.  After consulting Wikipedia, I learned this is a definite indicator of bacterial infection - the various other white blood cell types react to viruses or parasites, but neutrophils (the ones that create pus) are specifically there to fight bacteria.  So obviously, this was not the flu, which is viral.  My personal care doctor wisely gave me antibiotics - including an injection - the next morning.   I strongly believe this was a case of sepsis so if I had not questioned his diagnosis and gone to see her I might have become very sick or possibly died.The doctor who saw me was foreign, but one wold think that proper reading knowledge  of blood work - especially something apparently  as basic as knowing the difference between types of white cells - would necessary to become a doctor.  Perhaps he slept through med school that day.  I welcome comments from the instution or those in the medical profession.This was especially obnoxious as the ER was totally not busy and they had plenty of time to examine things carefully.  The extra start is due to the better care my housemate had with his surgery; otherwise I would not have given it.
Place has gone way downhill in the past 6 months. My favorite dishes I no longer order, as they are greasy and bland where they were once fresh and bursting with flavor. Still have a couple things I like, spicy chicken fried rice and thai hot & sour soup are still good but I think it's time to finally look for a new thai place to get delivery from.
Honestly worst place I have been to in Vegas. The guy I had didn't file my nails evenly. I asked him to make my sns thin and they are super thick. My nails and fingers look short and stubby. Didn't even put oil on my cuticles so I walked out of the salon with dry fingers and and ashy.
Pork chop was served rare, tough and flavorless. Hostess was indifferent. Brought us to a really bad table when nice tables were available. Said something like they may be reserved. We too had reservations. Just a bad vibe.
I ordered a simple cake for a friend's birthday. I was very specific with the way I wanted the words written on the side of the cake. I also asked for the cake to be ready by 2pm today. When I went to pick up the cake at 3pm the clerk told me that he was going to put the message on the cake. Why wasn't that already done?  When he finally brought it out, he had put the message on the cardboard that the cake sat on.  This is the same person who took the order. I didn't have time to wait for him to redo the icing to add the words to the cake. I was embarrassed to explain to my friend how cute the cake could have been but wasn't.  I specifically went to this bakery to support a local business. Next time, I'll go back to Publix.
I had the more expensive membership for about a year and I never really used the benefits that came with it so I decided to downgrade to the most basic membership. I was told but they're front fest staff that I would need to come in when their GM was working because he is the only one who knows how to do it. I work and go to school full time so I have to plan my schedule around their GM hahah what a joke. Just be prepared to be charged a $30 down grade fee. No matter what time you go it's always packed! Even at 11 PM you're gonna be waiting for equipment. Also, it's annoying how the staff checking you in will ask if you have a towel. But only sometimes and those times when I was asked the person before and after me were not asked. If you don't have your towel they make you pay a $1 fee to purchase one. Honestly it's not a big deal to bring a towel it's just annoying when they are not consistent with a policy.Only giving two stars for the convenience of the location and hours. The classes are fun too but that's about it.
It's not bad, but there is nothing that stands out, either. Breakfast was fine, but expensive. Service was fine. It's okay if you are staying in the hotel, but 100% NOT worth a special trip.
Spent the weekend at the Trump Hotel in Vegas across the street from the Fashion Show Mall. While in the mall I noticed Grimaldi's Pizzeria. A sign in front said it was voted best pizza by the Food Network. Not sure if that's true, but that's what it said. I couldn't wait to try it out, so I ordered a pizza to take back to the hotel room. Boy, was I underwelmed. Not even close to the best pizza I ever had. I think I should stay open-minded about this and maybe visit another location. But at this point, it wouldn't even make my top twenty list. I do have to say the service was good. The bartender who took my order was very busy, but still took the time to walk back to the kitchen to check on my order.
Just a very average breakfast as we tried this place for the first time.Best part I was told was the sausage gravy.Smoothies - they must use a mix because my ingredients separated and both smoothies (even the one with kale ) were super sweet.Breakfast Burrito - not alot of bacon and that bacon was not crispy. Also the potatoes were overcooked and had the odd tasting skins on, so it became more of a mashed potato thing .Side of salsa - pretty uninspiring.2 Breakfast Burro's and two smoothies were $25. The middle size smoothie costs $7 and then they nickel and dime you on the burrito. It starts at $4.50, but it's extra ($1) for potatoes, extra to have it grilled, etc.Might go back and try a sandwich at some point.
Is it me or does it seem like Trump spent the majority of his budget on the exterior golden windows and lobby. Guestrooms were NOT impressive enough, after walking through the amazing lobby and  front desk area. Very dissapointed. For looking like a gold brick from the outside, the guestrooms are dull and lifeless.After staying at Wynn and Encore, Trump tower seems like a slight downgrade. I mean its probably fine if im a 65 yr old woman. Service here is seriously BELOW average. The Valet failed at washing my car, when they PROMISED to do so. They expected me to roll around Las Vegas Blvd in my dusty vehicle, dirty from my 9 hour drive!! super pissed!! At least they offered me a free towncar to and from The Strip. And later that night, they finally detailed our suv.Also......One of the girls at the poolside cafe, accidently, charged my boyfriend $200 for suntan lotion instead of $20. So glad he noticed and had the manager refund the 180$ (which took over 25 minutes of valuable tanning time.)Some good things i liked about Trump was the food at the Poolside cafe. yummy. The gym was very nice too! I had a great workout.I also Loved the decor.... in the LOBBY.. ONLY... Prob wont be back to the Trump International... unless i have a free offer. Encore is my HOME
$10 for a single mushroom/Swiss wasn't good value in my opinion.  Bun was unremarkable and beef was a bit too blackened for my liking.  One of these days a burger joint will open that puts fresh sautéed mushrooms and real Swiss on a high quality bun.  That would be worth $10.  As it stands, I can get a higher quality burger for the same price from national burger chain.  Lower this price point, and improve on quality & this place will do much more business.
Customer  service  was rude and had me pull to the back to wait for my food which was no biggie at first.  7 minutes later someone comes out and hands me my food. When I opened my food at work I found about 5 soggy hash browns in a large bag . So I thought ok I get it let's move on to the sandwich and with no surprise at all the sandwich was crap too. Burnt until black on the edges of the chicken, the biscuit  portion was over cooked as well. It's almost like that was the biscuit that's been slow cooking in the back for 2 days. If you're going to pride yourselves on breakfast  foods and coffee at least put some effort into it. I get early mornings suck ,but you don't have to suck too.
I was very dissatisfied  with my first visit to this restaurant. I saw some nice pictures from friends and I wanted to experience the same. Early in the afternoon they had run out of two popular dishes (big bone soup and lobster pho) as well as their coconut ice cream. I know certain dishes in restaurants do run out due to popular demand but in those cases I would expect the staff to at least suggest alternative dishes. They didn't even do that or show much empathy to the fact that I was disappointed that they didn't have what I wanted. This staff lacks customer service and pride for their food and restaurant. What I got was a waitress that alternated with another waiter while they clearly displayed a miscommunication of service. At the beginning these two made them selves available to take our order at different times when we had already given our order to one of them. Then they alternated breaking the news of the dishes they ran out of. In my opinion one unavailable dish is permissible , two is cause for concern, and three means they may need to fire their purchaser. They have good product but the business is amateur. My visit was 1/3/15
Went there for lunch on a Wednesday, were seated and served very quickly. Ordered the lobster roll which was good, and then had the bacon bleu burger and the stuffed chicken burger and the baltimore fries (gravy and cheese on them). The burgers were ok (I've made much better at home), but the taste did not match the presentation: the chutney on my bleu burger soaked through the bottom bun making it a soggy mess and they drizzled this weird honey concoction on the chicken burger which just dripped everywhere making a giant sticky mess. If you have to go wash your face half way through the meal, there's something wrong with the ingredients. There are definitely better places to go for a burger, like the Red Rock, especially for the price.
Avoid the salads. What a rip off. If you get a salad that mentions a specific ingredient in the title you probably will see the tiniest amount of it. My chicken cob with avocado salad had the most depressing amount of avocado like.. 1/6th of the avocado.. One small crumble of bacon and two thing strips of chicken.The same situation happened the last visit. With the Mediterranean chicken quinoa salad. A teaspoon of quinoa and two lovers of chicken.What a complete joke.I'd be OK if I could just go to a different location and have a better experience but happens in all the Paneras I go to...The Italian combo was great, on the bright side.
I had been really excited to try The Gallery for a few months now, but unfortunately I had a pretty mediocre experience. A younger man and woman at the counter greeted me and asked to take my order. I said that I would like an iced latte and asked if they had any flavor syrups to add. The woman said yes but had to look up in the computer which kinds they had. As she was naming them off she mentioned coconut so I said coconut would be great! Neither one of them seemed very confident in what they were doing, as they kept looking nervously at eachother and were quietly questioning each step of the latte making process. Soon after I see that they've just made me an iced latte with coconut MILK. I took it anyway since I was running late, but I'm not impressed.
Hate to write a bad review here, as many people really like this place. I'd say 4-5 stars for the food, but the service was really bad when I visited. Here's the scoop:  So, when I arrived there was only one other customer who was waiting for their to-go food order.  I was greeted by the server, and told her the order was to-go.  She gave me a menu and disappeared.   After about 10 minutes, I was going to walk out, but someone from the back came out asked if the server had taken my order -- I said no.  This person disappeared for a few more minutes, then returned and took my order since there was still no sign of the server.  This mystery person was not a server, but was super nice and helpful. She took the order, got the food, computed the bill, but when I presented cash she had to find the server for change.  After the transaction was complete, the nice person said goodbye, and wished me "Happy Easter" (while the server making change seemed almost angry that she had to do something).  I turned to the nice person that did all the work and put a tip right in front of her, looked her in the eye, and said "thanks for helping me out".  Then the most amazing thing happened.. the server (who did NOTHING) reached way across the bar and stole the tip from the person I gave it to!  Wow!  In hindsight, I should have said something, but the action was so crazy, rude, and unexpected that I just walked out amazed at the audacity of the server. I feel sorry for the nice person that has to work around such a person.  I have no plans to return.  :(
Fix the elevators! I stayed at the Flamingo for 5 days and 4 nights and only 2 elevators worked at one time (by the end of my trip, only 1). A group of 50 people or more would always be waiting in the elevator section waiting for one to finally come down. The average waiting time would be about 15-20 minutes. One night, we decided not to go out because we didn't want to have to brave the elevators. Once we finally found stairs, they were in one of the most sketchy stairways I had ever seen and it led us out a side exit of the hotel.The room was perfect. I have no complaints about the room and cleaning ladies.Check-in was horrid. All weekend, the lines were LONG. We got lucky and checked out on a Monday morning at 7am with no line. But any other time, you spent 30-60 minutes in line.The flamingo exhibit is great as well.$7 shuttles to and from the airport, non-stop.Get a bus pass (the Deuce) in front of Harrah's if you are visiting. It takes you up and down the strip.
Cool ambiance.  Completely overpriced menu with mediocre food.  Lobster pot pie was over baked and tasted like a frozen one.  Sea bass was cooked nicely, but the rest of that entree was soupy and unappealing.Flatbread pizza was good, although a bit pricey.  The wine by the glass options were extremely limited.I expected more.
Visited this place for lunch. It was pretty empty and I sat at the bar. The bartenderess was nice enough and attentive except when it came to bringing the check. That came out very slowly. The food was surprisingly plain. It started with thick tortilla chips with hot and mild salsa, neither flavorful. Both were thin versions of salsa, which is fine with me, but some flavor or even heat would be appreciated. For starters, I had the queso fundido, which was pretty good and came with soft corn tortillas to eat it with.  Then I had the steak tacos. These were completely flavorless, and improved to decent with the addition of a few good shakes of bottled hot sauce.The margaritas were actually pretty good, but they were insanely expensive, and I'm not one to complain about cost, especially on vacation.
Great food, horrible service! We made reservations and still had to wait 45 mins for a table. At the end, we ended up splitting up our group of friends to eat because we couldn't wait anymore. Overall, I wouldn't go back. Although the food was good, the service was a big disappointment.
The food was alright but they are completely disorganized in terms of seating and service. Tables are super small but they clog it with a HUGE basket of milk/creams for coffee.  Costed us around $40 for two people and breakfast, quite expensive.
Meh. I was here for a private party. It's a large space. Plenty of room to move around. The stage area was alright, but far from good. There were plenty of bars, so getting a drink was always easy. The beer selection was meh. The food spread was pretty awful. I can't say how it would be here on a typical night. However, based on my private party experience, I would go in with low expectations.
I was really excited to try this place, but it's just more of the same. It's more of an upscale version of El Pollo Loco meets Chipotle . I loathe the fast food Mexican, and this place doesn't offer anything extra except a bar, beer and Sangria. They're as expensive as the actual dine-in Mexican spots. They have a "salsa" bar (nothing exciting), but, it's basically just like all the other "fresh Mexican" chains around. We've got at least 6 within a 1 mile radius of Boca Park: Cafe Rio, Baja Fresh, Chipotle, El Pollo Loco, Hussong's, and Viva Mercadito. This place won't make it, unfortunately. Their prices are too high, food is just mediocre, and Summerlin has too many other great spots to dine at.
Came here to see Catching Fire. We arrived 15 minutes before the movie started and were asked to wait while they finished cleaning the theater. After waiting for about5-7 minutes we were finally allowed to take our seats only to notice that there were at least 10 people already in their seats. This was annoying since clearly they were allowing people in the room. For having several cleaners, they did a terrible job. There was popcorn left on the seats! The seats are very uncomfortable too. The backs are straight and don't allow for comfortable movement. Also there was a flooded toilet in the women's restroom and at least one other stall without toilet paper!  Probably will drive to other theaters from now on.
Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street.
2 stars for one main reason: I did not want to give 1 star because I did not give the place a chance to earn 3 stars. I left the property before sunset as it was not my type of place to stay (i.e. safe, clean, and relaxing).Better A/C units in rooms that are newer and less noisy. Better cleaning services that notice things like liquor bottles/caps under the table and bloody kleenex re-stuffed in the tissue box (that was a nice surprise). But most importantly, improve property security, I did not feel safe in this property. The casino had yelling, angry vagrants inside and out, and obvious drug use just outside on the sidewalk.
The outside looked nice. We were all like "Let's go inside!" Then when we got in it turned out to be an ill favored dump. The waiter was nice but had big grungy finger nails. Pizza was so-so crab artichoke appetizer was horrid due to the fact it was icy cold in the center and the crab meat seemed to be synthetic. I would not visit again you could get better food at Wal-Mart. Do not go here.
Meh.Overpriced but typical vegas.Service was somewhat slow for not being busy.Pho was so/so. But it had no mint! Wtf?! The spring rolls didn't have mint either, wait soooo not what I was expecting.$20 pho I'm not impressed!!!!Never agaib
Dined solo while on business. Had the Corned Beef & Cabbage and Guinness Sampler flute. Was a pretty small portion especially for the asking price. The brisket was fatty and the cabbage and potatoes very sparse. Lots of broth and diced celery. They have a very nice gas-fireplace but for some reason they didn't have it on. Even though a snow storm was going on outside. The experience gave me the impression of money woes for this establishment.  Would probably not return.
Came here bc we wanted to try a New Mexican restaurant and when I discussed it with my boyfriend we figured since the establishment had been open for so many years that they had to be good.  I think they are more based on nostalgia sake then quality of food.  And because there are so many other good quality Mexican restaurants in town we figured they would have to at least stay competitive with the other business.  Walked in and slightly dingy- aged interior- which is fine we knew they had been around forever.... we were seated at a booth which only had 2 place settings not 3 as we had a party of 3.  No one brought us an extra setting.  Service was pretty good, but food quality was sub par especially for the price.  Chips came out cold- salsa was chunky in water and another in a syrup dispenser.  We ordered a combo dinner platter which we were disappointed at the quality of the beef and chicken.  Biggest regret was the fajitas which only were overly oily cooked meat and chicken with onions.  Only 2 thin uncooked slices of peppers on top.  The beef was chewy and unappetizing.  Cooked in way too much lard/oil to try to mask the quality.  I wish I could of had better things to say.  When we got the bill we were shocked- almost $75 for 3 for a subpar meal.  Too expensive for the overall meal and ambiance.
While the store is big, bright, and clean, it just can't compare to my beloved Dollar Tree.  I suppose 99 Cent stores excel in the availability of canned goods, so if you're into off brands, this is the place for you.  I'm not.I didn't go out of my way to get here, but dashed in while on an errand in this shopping center because I needed to buy a sympathy card.  I knew my choices would be far greater at Dollar Tree, but wasn't about to shlep further, when I knew 99 Cent sold cards (at twice the price).  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  They had Valentine cards.  They had birthday cards.  And that was is.  No wedding, shower, new baby, happy retirement, Nuttin' honey.  They also don't carry sugarless sucking candy, which I get at The Other Place, so necessary because of my oral fixation.  Otherwise I'd be on a perpetual sugar high.  Sure left a sour taste in my mouth.Just remembered while writing this that a Dollar Tree opened just a bit further, on Rainbow off Lake Mead.  Duh.
First time eating here, the atmosphere is nice, the waitress was friendly but never around, and the service was sooooooo sloowww!!!! and it was not busy. The chips and salsa were good to start, but the beef fajitas were the worst fajitas i have ever had the meat tasted like it was marinated in A-1 sauce, and that's gross on a fajita. Wife's flautas also were not very good, though and my dad had a chicken dinner that he like but said it was too salty, and my mom was not happy with her salad either. (if only twin creeks was open on Mondays)
My coffee was luke warm.  I ordered a medium coffee with cream and honey. The cup was warm on the outside so I didn't notice it until i drove away and by that time I wasn't about to go back and wait in the long line again to ask for a hot coffee. They either just serve "warmish" coffee or they put to much cream that it makes the coffee cold. Either way it was a big disapointment as I was on the road and had to drive through starbucks around the corner to get a hot coffee.
Tonight was the second time going back. It was my friend's birthday and thought he would want to try something different and cool. Prior to our dinner, I spoke w one of the servers, and told them it's our friend's bday and if there's anything they can do In terms of dessert w candle. They said we can order a dessert, and they would have a small candle with it. So we did. We ordered the well known back ribs, as well as the chicken cheese platter. As the second order came to table, one of the servers already brought out the dessert, and eager to put on the table.  I stopped them immediately, and asked them why they would bring out the bday dessert now, when we haven't even begun our dinner ?!! Obviously the surprise was ruined. My friend saw the cake (and actually without candle), and we were disappointed. I spoke to the manager at the end to address this common sense issue we encountered, and also asked them to cancel the cake order. We ended up going somewhere else for dessert.
I love Einstein's Brothers Bagels and when they changed this location to a Caribou I was excited that they were keeping the Einstein's menu. However, the customer service here is nowhere near as good as when it was an Einstein's. Customers are not allowed to get their own coffee refills, and if you buy a $4 latte they charge you a full coffee price to get a drip refill, even when you are reusing your original cup. Some of the younger employees are quite nice and helpful, but overall the service is more in support of the corporation than the customers.
This is a beautiful restaurant. I love how the waiters dress. The wall art is cool. This place is all together a great looking restaurant. Super fast service. The chicken is delicious. Nice waiters.
My mom had a hankering for rolled tacos. Being that we are originally from San Diego, we have high expectations when it comes to authentic Mexican food. This establishment took my mother's order, beef rolled tacos with guacamole, cheese, sour cream and a side of pico de gallo. The cook took 5 pre rolled tacos out of the freezer, literally dipped them in hot oil for about 3 minutes, packed them up and gave them to my mom. She took one bite and was completely unsatisfied! She said she will never go there again! I personally think that her expectations may have been a little high when it came to this place and it's food. Try it for yourself. My husband didn't have a problem with it. He said they weren't the best, but they weren't bad.
Well the two stars are for a clean restaurant. Sat down for 15 minutes and was never acknowledged by the waitresses who kept walking by. Its a shame, with all these good reviews we were excited to try their food, but we ended up leaving hungry and went to another nearby restaurant.
This place was all hype. The desserts were basic and the patty melt in ordered was messy and not seasoned at all. Prices too high for what they offer. But the service is where I was extremely disappointing. She was rude and never checked on us and we never got one refill on our waters. We will not be returning.
Chicken is good ! the salsas and their  refríed beans are very watering as , their horchata has 0 sugar 0 flavor taste more like Ice melted their food quality has been decreased bad !
Well its French--circa 1960--tired, uninventive, cholesterol packed fare at dinner. Its true fat and salt can make anything taste good, but perhaps stick with spam. Emblematic of the experience was greeting the three employees at the host stand with, "Bon soir, comment vas tu?" and receive puzzled expressions and no response all around.
Giving them 2 stars because they have made their cups smaller and I only get one drink from here which is the lemon king. It comes with a lemon and because the cups are now more taller and slender, the lemon is stuck and I cannot suck up my toppings. The cup also doesn't fit in my car holder cup because it's not standard and now the cup just falls back and forth and so I cannot drink my drink without it spilling over. I don't understand why they changed their cups when it obviously doesn't work for all their drinks. I had to open the plastic and pull the lemon out just to eat my tapioca. I would give them a 1 star but luckily their lemon king stilll tastes good. Just maybe next time I will ask them to leave it out.
We know and love good restaurants and this is not one of them.  The Camelback Inn is fabulous, elegant but this restaurant missed the mark.  A previous reviewer was correct:  the chicken liver pate/ the amuse bouche was the best dish of the evening. The staff were bland, left the used dished sit a long time before clearing and the room was half empty.  The hostess was strange.  The ceasar salad which they plated for two was served in soup bowls and it looked and tasted on a par with Denny's.  The onions rings were floury, doughy and greasy and served in a peculiar small dish as a spire.  The steak was disappointing in taste altho cooked well, and was served in a warm, not hot, cask iron pan.  The sauces were uninteresting and served again like at a coffee shop.  The hotel is great and the room is nice with a very nice chalk board mural but the food and service left me cold.  I hear that Katie's Kitchen is a much better choice in the Camelback Hotel.  Ruth's Chris is a far better bet for a steak!
This place got such great reviews on Yelp so my son and I went to check it out. We both ordered Pho because it's our favorite. The beef and tendon was nice and soft. The broth was very average and the noodles were really sub par. Too bad. We wanted so much to find our new 'favorite' place to eat Pho. We are new to Scottsdale and will keep looking. Not good enough to go back unfortunately. :(
This place is sort of a local legend, and rightly so, as any place that serves ice cream as a breakfast food (on waffles!) is a place you should go to at least once. Having said that--We just went again and the service was terrible. It was a slow day, and there were a ton of staff on, and we still waited 10-15 minutes to have our order taken. My food didn't come as described in the menu, and the mashed potatoes came in a gigantic flavorless mound. If you want a ton of mediocre food, in a fun, old-school diner atmosphere, this is your spot. If you want something truly delicious, look elsewhere.
Pricey and overrated. The star rating might be higher if the prices were much lower, but they're fairly steep. One order of fish and chips with a drink cost me just under $20 for lunch. The portions are good however, but the batter wasn't my favourite. Staff are always friendly and great however.
Let me start by saying, I have not truly had a UTL experience yet; however, my mother and her friends went to the UTL and I requested that she bring back a dessert for me.  She called me and read all of the delicious sounding desserts, I selected the Lemon Bundt Cake for her to bring back.  When the dessert was presented to my mother and her friends, they thought the cake looked very familiar to a "Sam's Club" cake or "Costco".  They asked if the desserts were homemade, particularly the Lemon Bundt Cake, the server stated that the cake is "outsourced".  When I opened the take home box with the Lemon Bundt Cake, I looked at my mother and said to her, "This looks like a Costco's or Sam's Club cake."  My mother kind of chuckled and said "that is exactly what we thought."  I asked how much I owed her and she said it cost $5.95 but don't worry about it.   I am extremely disappointed and slightly disgusted that the UTL charges $6 for a slice of Sam's Club or Costco's cake.  My expectation exceeded the UTL's potential to produce a high quality dessert.On a better note, I will say that my mother had a pleasant dining experience, sans the dessert, and I am not opposed to personally visiting the UTL; I just will not order dessert.
Too long; don't wanna read: It's average dim sum at a price well above average. Won't visit again. If you're thinking about it: do yourself a favour and walk across the street to Rosewood Chinese Cuisine. Service: 3/5Food: 2/5Atmosphere: 3.5/5Price: 1/5My friend and I went to this place for dim sum just now, 2 hours ago. It has a decent review on yelp so we decided to try it out. We ordered 8 dim sum items, which amounted to approximately $60 after tax (that's ridiculous if you've ever had dim sum anywhere. It shouldn't be more than $15 per person in most Asian places). I'd gladly fork over $30 - $40 for a decent meal, however their food can be considered average at best. Highlight dishes:- The pork and onion pancake thing wrapped in foil- that was good. I think it was about $5 or $6. A little pricey for the quantity but worth it. - We got a medium bowl of congee, crab meat and mushrooms or something, $12. Way too much starch, and I think a little heavy-handed on the MSG. I'm still chugging water. - The pan fried buns (sheng jian bao). OMFG those things were awful. Tasted undercooked, looked undercooked, and the too-thick dough didn't rise at all. Terrible. $5- Shrimp Dumplings: $5 or $6. Edible compared to the buns, even a little above average in taste, but again, not quite worth it. The other dishes weren't even memorable, just some steamed bun or dumpling with something or other. Generally things you can find anywhere, and this place is starch-heavy on EVERYTHING. The dough is always too thick, even though the filling is seasoned nicely, it gets overpowered by a mouthful of dough. Honestly there's a place across the street called Rosewood Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum is $2/dish during happy hour, and the food is so much better than here. Service: waiter looked like he didn't want to be there, mumbled the dishes' names as he put them down, so we had to ask him to repeat it. Twice. Depressing man. The only thing that prevented me from giving it 1 star is the furnishing. The wall panels are quite beautiful. And the dipping sauce, but I mixed it myself so that doesn't really count. Though another thing: Their tables are quite small, so the two of us took up 2 of the 2-person tables.
Went there to go to the movies, parking structure to the elevator, elevator has no a/c. Okkkkaaayyyy, walking down to movie theatre everything good. Go into theatre and very sticky and humid inside, sat down and seats squeak when your leaning back, not just mine, everybodys, then when the movie starts ( we seen Lucy by the way ) the suround  sound speaker was blown making a crackling sound . I don't know if this is a GVR isssue or a Reagle issue but if your going to compete with Brendan or century this is the little things that will not bring people back.
Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place.
Well had heard from my friend that this was the best Italian in the city.  I was very excited.  It didn't take long after arriving to realise that this wasn't up my alley.  Their menu is very weird or uses unusual ingredients.  actually ingredients that not long ago were considered low end.   Beef tongue,  lamb brains, beef heart tartare and blood sausage!  Why try and make inferior cuts edible.  Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants?  Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it.  Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle.   Barely brown on the outside.   Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all.   I have had way better and at half the price.   The pizza was tasty,  but some of them are as much as $25,  seems crazy to me.Not a very good meal,  and I certainly won't be going back or sending anyone I know there.   Definitely over rated and hyped.   There is way better Italian in Toronto than this.
An alright place to get your nails done.Just alright. At first glance everything seemed pretty standard for a low end nail place. The lady who did my nails seemed like she was taking measures to do a really good job. But after I noticed leftover nail polish from the color I had before all over my hands and the polish she used all over my cuticles. The place itself is really dirty. There were nail clippings all over my station and the whole just seemed kinda of yellow tinged and unsanitary you know? English also kinda minimal. I give it two stars instead of one Cus the lady was lukewarmly friendly, although kept trying to up sell me to shellacIn short go here if theres nowhere else open. $7 polish change $15 manicure $26 pedi. Meh there's better
This place is killin' me! Such a great location and view, but the service is really awful. We're locals-this place is a tourist trap. You have to chase the bartenders down for service and then they give you attitude when you do (He even gave us the "be right with you" finger when our neighbors spilled their beer and broke glass). And I'm talkin' actually sitting at the bar for drinks and dinner over an hour. The beers are so expensive. And the food isn't all that much better and is just meh. Our bill was $150 for 3 beers, one appetizer and 2 entrees plus a microscopic side. The most attention we got was when the bartender was changing shift and wanted us to cash out. So, raise your hand, say hey! and hand over your wallet if you decide to come here.
Food was great, but service was terrible. One of the servers refused when I asked for more time to decide on the main menu, saying "Our chef would be glad to know what is going on with appetizer and main menu." Seriously?
Very good food but priceyLow rating due to service - waiter struggled through every facet of the meal including getting us our check - had to ask the water server and he ended up getting it for us Food not good enough to deal with the service
This was used to be my favourite cafe but not anymore..couches and tables are dirty not like before and it makes me feel like Cinderella not princess. Not a bad portion to go near finch station but not best. The other table was so loud/ shouting and screaming for playing board games and servers just let them to do. And food is nothing special. I expected to have better quality tea for the price but ended up having so cheap tea bags. Will not going back unless my friends wants to go
Second night living in Charlotte, and I was craving wings. I was excited to see a Wild Wing Cafe close to where we were because I was craving the Colorado Copper sauce (my fav) and the house made chips. The moment I walked in my eyes were drawn to the filthy floor. I let it slide because I was ready for some wings! My husband and I went to the bar to sit, and we both noticed that the bar top wasn't very clean either. I needed to use the restroom, and the restrooms weren't clean either. The stall had toilet paper hanging from the coat hook on the back of the door, another roll on top of the dispenser, but none in the actual dispenser. I sat back down with my husband before we decided to order, and pulled up yelp. I saw similar reviews to the one that I am writing. After my husband used the bathroom as well he came back and said, "okay, not sure if we should eat here." I agreed with him, and we left. This is so disappointing because I was excited to have a Wild Wings Cafe close by. In our old city we were there many Saturdays for lunch. I hate to say that we probably won't be back unless there is a change. Giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because the bartender seemed to be nice.Ashley C - thank you for commenting on my post. However, for some reason yelp is not allowing me to message the restaurant or you. Could You please send me a message (if you see this) so that I can send you my info? Thanks!
I really wanted to like this place because it's in a great location and has a good selection on the menu. As a vegetarian I was impressed with the fact that they offered more than one non-meat entree, including a veggie burger, a portobello burger, and an egg salad sandwich. The problem was that the veggie burger was almost inedible. They had deep fried it, which was certainly unexpected. Deep frying it robbed it of flavor, made it unhealthy, and made it scalding hot and crunchy. The bun it was served on was brushed with oil or butter and was ice cold. It would have been nice if they had grilled the veggie patty, which I assume they do when someone orders a regular burger. Service was lacking. The server, who came from behind the bar to take our order acted like we were bothering him. Despite there being almost no one else in the restaurant at the time, we never got a refill or were asked if the food was okay. I had to flag him down to finally get our ticket. We left half the food on our plates. He never asked about it or offered a take out box, which we didn't want but would have shown some consideration. Nice try but disappointing.
When you pay nearly 100$ per guest for a meal that is no better than Red Lobster, then something is wrong.  The appetizers were good, but you can hardly mess up shrimp cocktail, except that the price was 18$ for four pieces of shrimp.  Stingy!  We shared two appetizers, but it wasn't enough for three people.  The ravioli appetizer was excellent, and I would be raving about it had there been more than four pieces.  It wasn't worth spending money on, especially if you share appetizers.  Our lobster bisque had three small pieces of lobster, a bland cream sauce, and plenty of corn bread pieces, or whatever it was.  One of my guests hardly ate her soup at all.  My other guest did eat a good deal of his Caesar Salad, however he had to ask for more dressing, and I could certainly tell it lacked an acceptable amount of dressing.Our main dishes were fairly okay, I really enjoyed my dish, one of my guests really enjoyed his meal (however he did say there was sand in one of his scallops), however the other guest did not like her dish other than the veggies on the side.  In fact she hardly touched her food and packed it up.  The drinks were very tasty.  The service was attentive, however I thought it was slightly unprofessional the way the menus lingered on the table for so long while it was getting crowed with two appetizers and three drinks plus three waters.  In the end I wasted my money by coming here.  None of us felt full or satisfied.  We joked afterward that we should have just went to In-n-Out Burgers.  I would not recommend this establishment at all.
$4 for a tiny bottle (not a real size bottle) of Diet Coke (no refills). Mild salsa tastes like bathroom cleaning solution / has the aroma of urinal cakes. Overly expensive menu with Mexican food atrocities. Who puts pickled veggies on a taco? Gross. The carne asada meat was good, the tortilla was good. But stale chips and everything else that makes Mexican food good is missing. Sorry guys, not worth your time or money.
Bad service, steak not cooked to order and Caesar salad was not good either. Only thing  was lobster was decent. Couldn't even get a refill on water! Won't go back!
I should add that after I posted this review I was refunded my money. I do believe that Joseph is an honest person - It must be the other staff that is the problem. One of them said my car looked like $h!+ when I took it to them to begin with. He was a very rude and condescending young man. After that, I was offered an apology- so that counts for something.
I went to this nail place about a year ago, the girl that gave me a pedicure got the calus remover on my legs, they burned so bad for days. I thought I would give it a try again. This was my last try! The lady that did my pedicure did a really shitty job, never talked took her 15 min! I told the manager she apologized. That's it nothing else. The guy did my gel nails they don't look professional I know they won't last! He also didn't understand anything I was telling him!! I won't be going back! $75.00 wasted!!
I like panda express, and I like this new layout. However if I'm going to eat somewhere I want to ne treated a certain way. I'm buying THEIR food with MY money. I can easily go to a different location. Fix the staff attitude please. "they're high schoolers" is no excuse. There is still a professional standard everyone has to follow. Get a shift manager that makes sure the restaurant is running smoothly and everyone is treated with the respect they should be given. Don't gossip the entire time.
I've been there for brunch two or three times now and each time I go to service gets worse and worse. The restaurant has two hosts and is always short on waitstaff. The service is extremely slow I actually finished my second plate for brunch before they brought me my taste of a bloody Mary which was terrible and I did not get my drink until I was onto my third plate. I don't think we ever would've left had we not ask for a check.
Second visit to The Keg Steakhouse Yonge/Eglinton after being unimpressed last time. This time - it's just slightly better. At least the steak was cooked right.I can't pin it as to why but even a good juicy piece such as the New York cut could turn out dry and somewhat bland while served lukewarm. The cook was about right which is medium rare with some redness inside. Still though - again, ingredient / seasoning of the steak was just off the mark. Definitely couldn't justify the price.On the upside - the place has great ambiance (perfect for event, etc) and service is also terrific. Unfortunately the food did not deliver.
Was excited to try this new Indian fusion restaurant in Dormont. To start off, my one friend and I split the plate of lamb chops. They were quite overpriced as two  lamb chops were $13. In addition, my friend had the vegetarian curry and was not impressed. It was a dish, but not substantial at all. He is vegan, so he was really disappointed when he could tell that the meal had been contaminated by oil used in meat. He barely touched it and they didn't even take it back or get another option. After a lot of back and forth, they finally took off the vegetable curry. I had the tikka masala grilled cheese, which was fine. The grilled cheese was good and the soup had some hints of Indian spices. My friends enjoyed their tikka masala. Throughout the duration of our meal, three of us never even got refills on water. Towards the end our waitress became apparently hostile. Overall, their food is overpriced for the quality and quantity and their management was just not accommodating. Unfortunately, we will not be back.
My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a pricey dinner for our 10th anniversary. A first for us! We were seated, and based on the service, we were so impressed, and resolved to do this more often. However, after we ate our food, we quickly changed our mind! For the price, our meal was DEFINITELY not worth it! I would have rather taken the money spent and put it toward the couch I've been wanting for like a year...there's only a little resentment here ;)I would give a 5+ on service, but food, really just average, and no where near worth the price.
This nail spa is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by homes.. at first I was very excited to find a place so close to my house that wasn't crazy busy.. the inside was super dated and everything looked old.. when i walked in, there were two elderly ladies being attended to.. the owner (at least I think she was) was free and told me to pick a nail colour for my pedi and then had me wait until 1 of the other girls was done when she could've started on me.. parking was tight.. the nail job was pretty decent.. lasted a while.. BUT after a couple of days of getting my pedi done, I experienced an excruciating pain in my toe on one foot.. i couldn't put my feet down or walk without pain for a couple of days. I don't know if it was related but it;s likely that it is. Place just didnt feel clean to me. Won't be returning.
Went for lunch during restaurant week.  The food was good, but the service was slow.  I won't be back and pay their high prices.  Way better choices available in the area if you're paying Adega's prices.
I had eggs Benedict with hash browns. Lots of salt in every component: hollandaise, biscuit, hash browns. The eggs were swimming in hollandaise. My husband had biscuits and gravy and he was disappointed with the flavors, overcooked hashbrowns, junky sausage AND too much pepper in the gravy, and dense biscuits. He also said the coffee was worse than gas station coffee. I thought even the water tasted gross. The only redeeming qualities were their wait staff who are supremely kind and very quick, and it is decorated sort of cute.
This place is in the strip and basically overrated and expensive for what it is! I paid $47 for 4 little tacos, a steak bowl plus $3 for additional pastor meat (which I had to remind them to add once I saw my bowl with no additional meat yet they were quick to charge the additional $3) and a Mexican coke! On top of that I asked them if I can get a small amount of chips to dip in the salsas and they said no I'd have to pay for them!? REALLY! Next time I'd just stick to tacos el gordo at the end of the strip Just suck it up and go up to the room hungry!
Bland food, zero seasoning... Wait staff average to poor, won't be going back in a hurry, plus side nice location and generally nice restaurant.
The closest Vons aka Safeway to our hotel when we were in Vegas for the 2012 Olympia Expo and Show.Ummm, it's ghetto and there's NO bakery section. WTF?! You walk in and the only baked goods they got goin on is the little display counter in the front left side of the store.No self-checkout stations. Boo!And the produce didn't look too "fresh" to me.Only plus side to this store is that it's open 24 hours.
The food was great. The service was why I gave this experience a 2 star rating. I had ordered a chopped salad which was supposed to come with grilled chicken. I didn't notice the chicken was missing until I was half done but once I could get the attention of our server, I informed him and told him I was almost done so I didn't want the chicken. He advised he would "pass it along to management". I guess I was expecting to see the manager, or a discount on my tab or some sort of adjustment. But nothing. Not a sorry about that, not a nothing. I'm not even sure he mentioned it to his manager. In hindsight, I guess I should have docked his tip, but I didn't. Maybe my standards are too high and I expect too much but I would have liked to have seen better customer service in some way or another.
If you stay a place off the strip, expect it to be dead. If you want any late night bites or drinks, be prepared to leave the hotel because nothing is happening here. If you go to the pool, don't expect an infinity pool, a wave pool, or a river pool. You get a rectangular community center pool. The rooms, however, are pretty nice and come with a kitchenette. And a stove. They really shouldn't have given us a stove. The third day of our stay, I woke up drowsily in the morning to the smell of roasting chestnuts, reminding me simultaneously of Christmas and chestnuts sold on the streets in Hong Kong. Pleasant. It looked hazy in the room. I must've been really tired; this is a sign to sleep some more. I half wake again. Chestnuts going strong. Hazier now. Smoky, really. I sit up. The room looks like we hotboxed for 8 hours. Long story short, a towel burned in a pot throughout the night and we got charged $200 for smoke damage. Nuts.
I went here a couple weeks back after heading over to the Food Truck Fridays, I had a catfish poboy sandwich and got a catfish plate for my coworker...it was great, crispy, fresh fish, excellent seasonings, just really hit the spot. Went over today after my coworker bugged me the entire week and simply got catfish filets for the both of us and a side of texas toast.I don't know if it was bad fish, bad cooking or a combination of both but I ended up throwing my food away, the fish seemed undercooked, but greasy at the same time and the toast was extremely greasy. I even tried to eat it by dousing it in hot sauce and that couldn't save it either. I received 4 pieces of fish (instead of 2 filets as expected) and my coworker received 3 pieces instead of 4..all for the same price. My coworker even complained about her food, kind of turned off by this experience so I won't be back. There's another place over there with catfish I guess the next time I'm in the mood I'll give them a try.
My aunt recommended this place to me because she said this was her favorite place to get fries. I guess I should have realized that the fries probably just impressed her more than the actual seafood. I ordered the jumbo fried shrimp plate and got the fries with it. The shrimp was good but not great, the fries were really nothing special. The waitress I had was kind of weird and a bit rude even if she wasn't trying to be. The whole experience was just kind of odd.
I was so excited to have an Italian resturant in the area.  I absolutely love it.  I tried this place out and wasn't expressed with the food.  Now I have only had the delivery so that might be why I wasn't thrilled with my dishes.  I will be visiting this place again to try it out fresh.
This is near the downtown district and hard to get to by bus - you have to walk a good 1-1/.2 mile from the bus stop (yes we did not have a car).   The booth table was wobbly, we moved to the next one.   We were there at 12:00 for lunch and ordered the soup and sandwich combo (was told the soup would be "a few more minutes - not ready)",  we werent told our sandwiches were ready (we had to ask) and pickup.   However, our soup was never told it was ready.  We waited patiently as the clock ticked and we waited for OVER 1 hour for a cup of soup and we had to ask for it almost when we were done.   This is really a take-out place even if there are tables and chairs there.    Staff is extremely slow.   It is hard to find, and in a Gamblers Store.    Sandwiches were o.k., but location and service was below par.
food arrived cold. was either cooked too early or reheated. Service has a lot to improve. Ladies: if you decide to wear heels when going to this place, I suggest you DON'T. Steel floor between the entrance to the second door in both the restaurant and the marche has small undetectable, movable holes and unless you've been to the place before your heel will most likely get stuck in it. My $1200 Louboutin did. Both feet. Such a deadly trap. One should always do some research before trying new restaurant nowadays. If the restaurant is often busy, no need to participate in the Mtl A Table.
Came here today to watch Browns before visiting Playhouse for show at 3.  Looking forward to Wiener schnitzel...and they were out.  What German place is out on Wiener schnitzel on a Sunday afternoon...
Not much ambiance...Limited to no seating,  pastries???Different business in rear, not available to patrons.
I'm editing my review because it really is inconvenient when you can't sign up for class and ensure your spot. Sometimes we're coming from work or other activities where we can arrive on time and not 30 minutes early. Because they've stopped allowing us to sign up for classes online even more students are coming to classes because they can't track approximately how many people to expect per class.  It's fun to work out in a group setting but I find myself concentrating more on not hitting the person next to me than my actual exercises. The convenience of classes being scheduled through out the day is great, even with evening classes, but they need to cap a limit on how many people can attend a class. It takes away from the experience.
Second time at Crescent for a concert, it was equally a mess to get in....so hot and stuffy inside the ballroom. We left early although the sound system is great and the artist we saw was awesome...it was too hot to stay longer.
If you want to wait thirty plus minutes for your food come here. Bask in the non-air conditioned building. To be fair, it sucks to be working in the middle of Arizona summer with no air conditioning and only a fan. I can understand why they were so slow. But the mango on their straws is not ripe at all. Don't order the boba because unlike any place that serves boba, they don't give you straws to actually drink it. You have to take off the lid of your drink at the end if you ever want some. Food is meh, go to wing stop if you want the same quality. It's a trendy place for Instagram but not much else.
Update:Ok. We have come here each year on this weekend, at least 2 times per visit for 3 years. I feel like a relative has died. This is no longer an English Gastropub. It's a mish mash of anything they can throw together. It's nothing more than any other generic bar with food now. It's owned by some conglomerate and the quality is down. They have PBR ON TAP!!!!  For 4$. They are just doing the same get the drunks to come in thing that everyone else does. The music in here is some weird mix that more correctly belongs in a dark jazzy club but not exactly. It does NOT belong in this space. Nothing is congruent. Nothing is unique. And it's bad. It's 7:13pm on a Thursday and there is no one here. Just me and my husband. These are death throws. Jack of all trades, master of none. Anthony Bourdain would turn on his heels and walk out. Way to go conglomerate. This is nothing more than an Applebee's. More shitty mediocre food in the sea of shitty mediocre food in downtown. I'm disappointed. And I'm not coming back.
Good food, horrible service.  Went in tonight with my son and was seated promptly. Chips were brought to the table immediately.  After that, nothing! Staff passed by our table without ever greeting us or taking drink order. Waited 15 minutes before getting up and leaving. I have been coming here for years but the service has declined greatly.  I will not be back.
Ok serviceThe crab bites were way over cookedPrime rib burger dry with no flavor
The place needs more staff. Employees are always in a short supply.  I was looking for several things and they had most of them.
ugh I really wish I don't have to leave a bad review for this place. I have been coming here for years and I have brought in so many more customers for this place personally that I introduced this place to all my close friends when they would always walk by n straight to Starbucks next door . This place was shut down for 3 months due to not able to pay store rent in 2009-2010,i try to help n come more.I hv had 2 separated incidents in this place that disgruntle  employees are being rude. First time was in summer, when I just adopted a small Yorkie puppy that he was only 4 months old weight 4 pounds at time. when I was looking into the store window, a couple at patio liked my puppy so much offered to look after him at end side of patio in exchange that they get to pat him. my puppy is very small dude and he doesn't bark or bite. So instead of tying my puppy to the patio pole I left to the couple who's enjoying coffee at their patio chair. I quickly ran in to try to get my big usual chocolate chunk cookie asap but there was a line up that I had to line for about 5 minutes. During that time I kept checking on puppy on the patio window trying to make sure everything is okay. I got the cookies n were about to come out, a women (first I thought was a man first) with very shirt hair like buzz cut came up screaming (in a very public harsh n grunting voice, EXTREMELY DEGRATING) : "YOU KNOW YOU ARENT ALLOWED TO HAVE DOGS IN PATIO?" I was in shock wasn't because I was wrong was it was so unforsceen n someone shouted at me out of nowhere in public. The line of people standing beside me were like"what's going on". She rambled something else after in the same mannar, I don't remember what she said but was definitely VERY SELF RIGHTES AND CONDESENDING, her face reassemble with some with heartrate. I quickly grab my stuff n left . Feeling very HURT. I brought in SO MANY more customers when I developed a liking to this place. I brought at least 10 friends here to have them try this place n telling how good their cookeis are. And what I got was being LECTURED IN FRONT OF MASS AUDIANCE! I thought it was fine I had my puppy tied up in patio , he was pocket size clearly would do no harm. I only had him for a month it was my first dog I had no idea about patio laws prior. Just come up pull me aside to give me heads up, instead of yelling cross the room in public! This is Canada for god sake, what are ppl's manners. I didn't come to the bakery for a month after that incident. Just left a very sour taste after that time n makes me cringe every time I walk by the store. Finally time heals wounds, one day I passed by I decided to bring some cookie to friends and I walked in. I mentioned an employee n asked who was that short hair manly person that's so angry. Not saying trying to bash her looks, u really have no idea if she is a man or not just by looking at her. They confirmed that she is a chef at location, not the boss, also a VERY grumpy person to work with n didn't know why she would come to the front to yell at customers because she was suppose to stay at back. So I left at that assume she was having a bad day and came to the front and saw something she didn't like n happened to yell at me. Second incident is its a few months apart, I came in one day before store closing. They had full tray of baked pear and apple pastries. I was normally getting a cookie but decided to take a tart too. The lady was annoyed when I asked her how much it was, it was mildly annoyed. Then I kinda debated between the two tarts, when I finally decided to go with pear, she grabe me a small dry piece from the edge of the tray. I don't like dry pastries so I asked her to switch to a middle piece. then she tried to shovel the tart n cookie in the same white small tinny paper bag I had to request please put them in separate bag, and toss in a plastic bag too because their pastries are greasy n they always soak through paper bag . She was increasingly irritated n I could tell she was thinking I gave her hard time on purpose. The final bill came $8.91 something which was like wow! for a cookie and small piece pear thing! I double asked her how much it was for the tart, she was like : $4.99. when I say the tart. I guess its called tart, its like 2.5x2.5 x0.8 inch high flaky crossant like texture pastry. it was like $5.61 I ate the whole thing in 4 bites. I was suspicious of if she over charged me so I asked how much it was she said :"$5.99last night I came to the location to get a cookie they had the exact same thing and she was there too. after I bought a cookie I asked her how much that pear pastry was. she was like:$3.99! Bang This place has great pastries and great coffee. However I would not want to stay here. They seem to have high turn over of store front employees who don't take their job seriously. They also have angry employee at back comes to front to throw a tantrum at "young looking face" customers. Its totally not acceptable.
Their drive thru intercom is broken. I'm waiting 15 minutes so far with a car in front and in back blocking me from fixing my mistake. I haven't even put my order in. Tell my wife and kid I love them. For the love of god stay away if you want to live life outside this drive thru.
Star deductions:1. No wifi!!! Come on venezia @ the Venetian. Join the 21st century for goodness sakes. Make sure when if you book here to stay at the palazzo instead. Who even carries Ethernet cables anymore?2. T.V.s don't work. Yes t.v.s plural. There's two of them and none of them work. It's been 1 1/2 hrs since I have complained and no ones come yet 3. The maze to get to the elevators. The two stars go to the valet, the bell hop and the concierge. Joe the bell hop awesome dude, Sean the valet who parked and re parked my car after I realized I left my phone in the car and Jaquelyn the concierge who did not hesitate to move us to the remodeled Venetian tower after I complained about the lack of wi fi and non operational flat screens.
The decor is very nice, and the staff is nice and attentive. $4 an oyster, $5 a shrimp? LOL The hummus tasted.. not great. The salad was good, but nothing special (blood orange salad). The raw bar sampler was okay, but the ceviche was not fresh and made my boyfriend want to leave after tasting ... yikes.. I was embarrassed I chose to go there. There are lots of awesome restaurants downtown and this is not one of them.
We've been to this restaurant many times over the years and have always enjoyed the food. However, since changing their name to "Tandoori House," they have reduced the size of their lunch buffet significantly, and food is not replenished once emptied. Very slim pickings really, and no mango ice cream! They've also done away with the warm gold, red, green interior. Instead they have painted the walls a prison color beige and replaced the dark carpet with standard issue beige tile. Did I go to the prison cafeteria or an Indian restaurant? The staff was very nice, but they did not offer any kind of drink other than water. Sadly, the underwhelming food and stark, ugly decor equate to a deal breaker. There are many other Indian restaurants around Madison that bring their A game in all categories.  All those wonderful pictures you see of the buffet tables and the warm colors on the wall are long gone from here.
2 lackluster visits, and I'm okay with skipping it. It's very pricey for what is provided The menu looks and sounds great, but the application falls short.
My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a "patio" sorta), we chose to eat inside. It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a "c"...)Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO. Last time I believe a New Times food review. Come here for some eye rolls and bland food. PS-Perhaps the owners should establish a "complaint section" away from customer's ears as it's not super impressive to complain about diners-especially when they can see/hear you.
I just don't get it.  Why is this a local favorite?  The pizza is below average at best, with crust so thin they have to cut it into small squares to be handled.  I also ordered the Chicken Parmesan with linguine.  The chicken was tough and chewy and the linguine had a grainy dry texture with very little flavor.  They don't offer small side salads for dinner, only large two person salads.  I'd eat at Carrabba's everyday of the week before going back here.  The search for good pizza in Phoenix continues.
I have been going to this CVS pharmacy for 13 years, until recently. I was sad to part from them but I had no other choice. The staff morale has severely declined over the past year. It has been a very long time since I have gone here and actually been greeted kindly and with a smile. The staff is very rude and acts bothered every time I needed help. I was so sick of being treated like a burden for simply asking them to do their job and fill my prescription. I hope for the sake of all current and future customers of the pharmacy that they change their staff and build up morale again, but for now, I have no interest in ever returning.
The gym itself is good, but poor execution on some crucial aspects. The womens locker room is INSANELY cold. Air conditioned to the max. WHY? This is where people come out of the shower. You can catch a cold. My teeth literally chattered almost every time I was in there.Staff here - hit or miss. Some can be friendly, others look half asleep. I only got a membership for 1 month and only near the end of that month did I realize certain things I had access to, and no one bothered to tell me. For example, I had no idea I had access to a fitness evaluation until it was too late.The gym itself is a good size and I rarely had to wait for anything. Thats where the 2 stars comes from - and from the decent lighting - lots of natural light.Also 24/7 is false advertising, like other reviewers have previously mentioned.
Being from california I been to many corner bakeries. But this one seems a bit odd maybe because it's the first one in Las Vegas but they need to train the staff and cooks to step up to the franchise name
I was recommended to come here for an x-ray due to the x-rays being down at my physician office. I called ahead a week prior and was told that I could just walk-in. I came in at 0945 and was told to sign in and wait. I waited over an hour before I was seen and the only reason it was that long is because I got up and said something. Nobody came over and asked what I was here for. Several people came in after me and were seen. Once I said something the process went fairly quick but the fact is I had to say something and was completely forgotten about.
After raving about Harlem Underground to people, it pains me to have had a mediocre experience there. We were a group of six hungry diners who were ready to eat. We ordered caesars and red stripes, a round of appetizers, mains and sides. The server was not able to give a recommendation and seemed terribly confused. Our apps came without a hitch, the catfish layfeyette (battered and fried catfish) was moist and well seasoned with two dipping sauces, but the crawfish in chilies was underwhelming and overly finicky for the taste experience. Our server seemed to stop noticing us at this point, we had difficulty having drink orders fulfilled. When our mains arrived they hadn't remembered to order one of them. The rest of us awkwardly ate our entire meal while our friend waited for almost 20 minutes for his food. There was no profuse apology or rush to get it out once they realized their mistake. The fried chicken was good enough, but waffles and gravy was stone-cold. The mac n' cheese was bland. The best part of the meal was the coleslaw, which isn't enough for me to want to return. To top it all off, groups of 6 or more have an automatic tip on the bill - when the main didn't arrive, we expected it to be discounted at the very least and we did not intend on tipping the full amount. After we asked awkwardly, they deducted 50% of the main from the bill. So much drama when all we wanted was some good ol' fried chicken.
Huge hype, disappointing results. Perhaps they were too distracted serving Martha Stewart that night.
Joe's, I want to love you but I don't. I think there are two types of people that go here. People that know the food is average and people who are in denial because of its geography. Your food is extra "meh" with a side of "Hmmm."We have been here many times. The set-up is terrific. We make the trek and take our dog to nearby Cosmo Dog Park... then hop over for pizza, hamburgers, salads, etc. (I think we've tried just about everything... to no avail. How do you screw up BBQ pizza??)Since I may sound like a Negative Nelly, I will say I dig the milkshakes.So why is it so popular? This is a haven for East Valley apologists who want to have a signature restaurant to call their own but don't want to drive into "the city." Look into your hearts, people of Mesa / Gilbert. Enough of the charade. You saw it on Food Network and you're happy there's some place there with a line out the door.
Good food. But don't order online. Their lines are usually butt to nut, so I ordered online, with their cool new app. I placed my order for designated time.  Got here and no one was ready to take my order. Waited a few min at the register to find out it wasn't ready. I paid. Waited. Saw 3 people walk in and get their food who arrived after me. Might as well walk in and get it. Those people are long gone. I'm still sitting here.
Meh, I've had better experiences. It was a beautiful day, so we wanted to go somewhere close to enjoy both the weather and Sunday foootball. We were able to enjoy both.However, the food and service is what givesthis place a poor rating. I ordered an Aslaskan benedict with hasbrowns. It wasn't as tasteful as I expected, the benedit was dry and the hasbrowns were cool. The service... slow. Our server took awhile to greet us, so we had to order with another waitress. After ordering, we had to wait a good amount of time for our food, which as I mentioned earlier, were cool. The Alaskan benedict was rather dry, I wouldn't reccommend it. My boyfriend got a burger with hasbrowns, which were also cool.Finding our server to get the check was also a challenge. And waiting on her to get back with our check was another challenge as we were in a hurry to make an appointment. Overall, I won't be coming back.
This was first visit here and we arrived on a ridiculously busy night. Thought we were doing well to have reservations, but due to large party had to wait well over 30 minutes past the reservation time. Also the restaurant cancelled reservation so we did not earn points for visit. Very strange and no explanation as to why??? The server was not as attentive as we hoped,yet was pleasant and  knew menu well,plus  made nice recommendations.  Prices were a tad bit higher than quality. Food was not bad just nothing special. May return, just not weekend evening. Management really needed to do a better job with staff availability and booking large parties. Wait times without quasi reservation were 60-120 minutes. Little noisy, buy okay with us.
This is the first time I have ordered from this restaurant.  There was one kabob plate and two wraps on our order.  The lamb kabobs were over-cooked and dry. Plus sadly,  there was zero tzatziki to be found on anything.
Not good.  Freezing inside. Horrible service. Won't be back.I felt the pho was not salty enough and instead was sweet.  I was also aware of some mal-odor that was coming from the meat or the broth? Maybe rancid meat? The floors were littered with table scraps and even worse, stuck to the chairs and table like it's been uncleaned for days. I felt like I needed a Hep. shot after that meal.  I do agree that the broth was murky but I didn't mind that so much, it was the fact that it smelled rancid and tasted sweet. No, thank you, Pho Little Saigon.  I'll continue to get my 24 hr Pho from Kim Long across the street.
I am a frequent customer of Tropic Jewel. They have a nice selection of beads and materials to make your own jewelry as well as pre-made jewelry. I dabble in both options, but I am in no way a connoisseur of making jewelry. Because of this, I ask a lot of questions and need help picking things out. That is where my issue is: the customer service sucks. The women don't seem to want to help me and their answers to my questions feel almost patronizing, as if I should know the answer. Or, perhaps they do not have an answer for my jewelry-related question, but they do not seem to have any remorse for this.Tropic Jewel is incredibly close to my apartment and they have not lost my business because the prices are low, it is convenient, and I like to support local stores. But, I hope that they will take this into consideration because I know I am not the only customer that has experienced their less than friendly customer service.
While this location is much  closer to me, I find myself preferring to travel to further ones as the service here is far too slow and poorly managed. Always running out of tapioca etc and averaging 25+ mins for one drink? It would be faster for me to drive to highway 7 and back. It's been open for almost 2 years now. No more excuses.
It is a very busy place filled with people, but it gets really loud really quickly, so it can be hard to hear your friends.  the staff are friendly but dense and don't really go out of their way to seat or serve you.  Lots of different types of people go from biker guys, to new jersey shore wannabees, lol.  Food wise, the burder was decent bar food, and the perogies were fried and though not traditional perogies my friend did enjoy them, so non Ukies or poles would appreciate them.  the stuffed cabbage and noodle dish was very bland, and I mean bland.  It was typical squirled macaroni that did not have any taste or sauce to them, I had to add ketchup and vinegar.  the cabbage underneath was sparse but sauteed, and if there \had been more cabbage it might have saved the dish.  On top I ordered brautwurst which came in small slices and was slightly crispy and peppery, which itself was not bad, and enjoyable with our beer, but the dish really really needed a sauce or better noodles, i would not recommend ordering that dish.
My boyfriend received a BOGO deal via email which was why we chose to dine with Milestones this evening. Usually Milestones has great service and food at the various locations we visited but not the one on Queensway.Service started out fast in which we were seated immediately during the dinner rush, and drinks and salads came out pretty soon after we ordered. We were disappointed that they ran out of the Italian sausage ravioli so we tried the grilled chicken penne asiago. Additionally, we ordered a regular sized medium rare prime rib to share. The pasta was decent but definitely overpriced. There were barely any chicken pieces and the entree was a bit salty. Sadly this was when the service went downhill. We didn't receive our prime rib until 30 minutes later since we ordered it. The wait was so long that we expected a delicious prime rib. We were disappointed when it finally arrived at our table. I have to admit that the prime rib I made last week was definitely better...I'm not even joking. The next time I want to eat at Milestones it definitely will not be at the Queensway location.
Don't go here with high expectations and you will be fine.  Gym is good. Primarily Prime restaurant was good.  Garden Buffett not so good. Beds hard sheets crunchy but room was clean and spacious. Valet very slow and under staffed, A lot of kids and families so very crowded.  For the lack of quality at the hotel the prices were high for food and regular drinks.
If it wasn't the service that was good this place would be a 1 star. The fish belly was fried. The sashimi was not fresh. The dish and plate didn't feel clean. The crab leg was a joke and I'm not even going to mention it. The clam same thing. A tiny whatever with mayo sauce heated. The ginger milk look disgusting.
I'll start by saying that the staff was great...everyone was very friendly and helpful; my low rating has nothing to do with them! The facility though...that's another story. I've been there a couple of times, and both times it smelled vaguely of sewage. The women's bathroom was also super gross and none of the toilets worked. Literally none of them. To top it off, there was a giant cockroach on the floor in the bathroom on one of my visits.Overall, this place felt dirty. I went back a second time because I thought maybe the first time was a fluke, but my second visit was over a month later and it was just as disgusting. Not going again.
Meh.  I bought a living social deal so I ended getting a latte and a sandwich.  The coffee was not notable, and the sandwich was a bagel with a piece of cheese and a slice of tomato.  I could have easily made both at home for cheaper, and I think it would've tasted better...
Definitely overrated and overpriced! We are always on a hunt of great restaurants in AZ(California spoiled us endlessly with amazing food) so when something new opens and people rave about it, we rush to it! Unfortunately, Coconut's doesn't taste authentic enough. And the price is a turn off.
Maybe we caught it on a really bad day. My friend's brisket was mostly fatty pieces and this was after they had to take the plate back because she ordered chopped and it was brought out as a hunk. The Mac and Cheese was crunchy like it was not cooked properly. This was after the dish was replaced because the first one was rock hard. The hot chicken was bland and the only crowning glory was the cornbread, which was delicious. My friend said this was probably the worst BBQ that she has had here. Definitely won't be back.
Been here a few times.  The service gets worse and worse every time we come.  There was no receptionist to take names and there was a line of people waiting to put there names down.  Then once we got sat we waited 10mins for someone to take a drink order.  Then we ordered and waited an insanely long time for our food....even the appetizers too forever!  Too bad because we really like the food.
Iv been coming to this location for 7yrs. Iv always asked to vacuum out my own car since the guys are in such a hurry they tend to miss shit. Today I was told I can't vacuum my own car. Why not? The excuse was is against insurance policy. That's a bunch of bull... iv always done it. Then was told its because the owners were here so which is it? After coming on to yelp to see the low reviews of other ppl. Think it's time to find another car wash place.
Sauce has been one of my favorite places to go especially because of their Mac n Cheese. Why in the world would they change their perfect recipe to bland spiral noodles that has barely any cheese on it?! So disappointing. I'm finding whatever I can in my kitchen to give this some flavor. The only positive side to this was we had also ordered a side of Mac n cheese and it came in a big portion.
My fiance and I decided to try this place in Tempe because our normal Pho Place we go to (Nhat's off of University/Rural) was closed that day. We saw somewhat okay reviews and thought we would judge it for ourselves. Upon arriving there was no one to greet us as we awkwardly stood there for more than 5 minutes. An older Vietnamese lady walked up and offered to seat us. The decor was pretty standard 1980s styled vinyl booths, and when she offered to seat us by the window, there were FULL ON HORNETS IN THE BOOTH! I'm not even kidding. They were coming in through the crack in the wall and hovering at the table the lady offered to seat us at. We did not feel like getting stung to death while we ate, so we sat at another table. Unfortunately, another couple walked in right after us and were immediately sat at the booth of death and for some reason didn't notice (yikes!). The chicken pho had no flavor, and the noodles were just okay. I don't think we will return.
I really do like this gym but hate the hours. Needs to stay open till midnight at least. Most likely will be switching to another w longer hours. Sad since I've been with them a long time.
How does this restaurant have 4 stars on Yelp? Bobby Flay must have many die hard fans on this site.I sent back my food, and I NEVER do that. Yes - it was that terrible. Mesa Grill is a higher end version of Applebee's. My favorite part of my meal was the contents of the complimentary bread basket.  :(
Very slow service with limited customers. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. Food was ok
I heard a lot of excitement over this place so decided to give it a try.   I heard it was the In and Out of the east coast.    The burger was good, on par with In and Out, Smashburger and 5 Guys.  The main difference is the price.   Holy shnikes.  Over $15 for a burger, fries and drink.    I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for food and 1 star for price.
This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!
Went for brunch two times. Same bad and slow service both times. Second time we got a smoothie bowl. It arrived melted. We also order dessert which was taking to much time to arrive. We decided to just ask for the bill and leave. Even the bill took long to arrive. If you are very hungry don't waste your time.
I want to let consumers know that the service guy read my last review and did call me, but I still rate this one service low, but know that they were better service calls  in the past.
While visiting family in Brunswick I had an opportunity to try the local Chinese restaurant everyone raves over.  Well, its not all that. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and Hot & Sour soup. The chicken dish was okay. Could have used a little more heat. Portion was a bit smaller than I was used to but still adequate for a single dinner. The soup however was not even close to being palatable. No heat, No sour, wrong mushrooms used, no tree ear fungus, and what's with the corn and broccoli in it ? No lily buds either. Just plain wrong all the way around. Even PF Chang can do an acceptable H&S soup. Another in our group had the salmon sushi rolls. 4 of the 5 got thrown out. Not up to the usual standards. Won't be back.
NOTE: Yelp has two listings for this business but even after submitting edits, will not remove or merge them. The other page is under Jin Jin You Wei. Not sure what the deal is, or if that's just a translation. Former space occupied by Island Malaysian #2, in the same building as Ichiza.Now that that's out of the way...Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill.
This place has great sushi and I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2. It's unfortunate that they've priced me out of returning because you can get AYCE anywhere else for less than the price of 2 rolls here.
Over-priced, tiny portions of ice cream that tasted "meh". Disappointing considering other options nearby. Sorry but, I won't be back...
i love the food here!very expensive,the service is very slow,only one food server,i really dont like to wait around for 40 minutes for food when i work all day without lunch plus i have to pay a food that expensive!not worth of my time,lots of restaurant out there folks who will care for good customer service!
Pizza is average - they use the "sweet" sauce which I do not care for. Pomo is better. Service was very slow and not very nice.
Basing this review on the service. We sat for almost 10 minutes with no one approaching us. A table was sat next to us, then a guy comes by and asks for our order. The server to the table next to us, brought this chalkboard with specials on it, which I never saw, they also got their order in within minutes of sitting. Food was good, but I work in the industry. This was awful.
This place is under new management and goes by the name "Scully's" now. Which is unfortunate, because Scully's is a far cry from the good ol' Lucky Break I used to know and love.I went in here for a Saturday afternoon college game. The crowd was decent; not overwhelming but not dead either. I go to the bar and grab a menu. The items are mostly the same. There're a few new dishes I didn't recognize from the Lucky Break of old. I ordered the chili cheese tots; definitely won't be doing that again. They were God-awful. Just a big, sloppy, greasy mess.The bartender was a guy whose name I forget. He was nice enough. Got my drinks fairly quickly, but didn't seem too personable. Maybe it was a weird day for him, who knows?The waitress didn't seem any better. I wasn't served by her, but every time she'd pass there was a dead look in her eyes and she never smiled. Geez, at least pretend you wanna be there.Overall, I don't think I'll be back. The place is weird compared to the Lucky Break I'm used to. Time to find a new watering hole.
I have been going to this dealership for over two years, the experience is always good, but the wait time is awful.  I called last week to make an appointment because I received a recall notice in the mail.  My service advisor was busy so someone else set up the appointment.  I told her I was coming because of the recall and would get a oil change while I was there. I changed my work schedule to make this appointment.  It was at 7 am so I could get right in.  Guess what, they did not have the parts for the recall, so it could not be done. I was told we will send out another notice when the parts come in.  My service advisor said well you are getting an oil change anyway.  I felt as if my time is not important because I didn't spend any money this time.Please do not respond with , I will look into this.
I hadn't been to Roberto's in a while, but I was in the mood for Mexican food and since I had my dog with me, I needed to find one with a drive-through. This Roberto's has a drive-through (yay!), but the food was just as lame as I remembered it :(I brought my meal home to eat. Good thing, because it would have been an unholy mess trying to eat my order in the car! I got a beef taco and a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. I appreciate the freshly made taco shell, but the meat was really tough. (I must say I am not a fan of shredded beef tacos, so maybe if I would have gotten ground beef, it would have been better. But I didn't see that as an option on the menu...) The quesadilla was HUGE--maybe that's how they justify the $7 (with guac) price tag. But the chicken was bland; the peppers were undercooked; and the whole thing was really greasy. I only ate half, and I didn't even give the rest of it to my dog, because I was afraid it might make him sick.I did notice some out-of-state license plates in the parking lot while I was waiting in the drive-through, so maybe they get a lot of tourist traffic. And I do know several locals who swear by Roberto's. I guess it's just not the right Mexican food for me.
Positives: - good location - staff reasonably friendlyNegatives: - they don't do the dry manis/pedis they advertise on their website (so why not update their site)?- base coat & top coat blobbed on without much attention - the top coat didn't cover about 25% of the color on each nail- nails filed totally random lenths and shapes - some shorter than the end of my fingers, some longer- during the pedi, the woman wasn't paying attention and ended up filing my skin so much I bled- they have a cute tea menu, but they never offer you anything- definitely expensive for what you're getting - they don't answer the phone often- the pedi station isn't that comfortable - it's a slightly padded benchOther notes:- the staff always looks surprised and not sure what to do when I come in (sometimes they don't even say hi, and you have to ask if they work there)
Delivery took over an hour, the food was cold and low quality. Fried rice tasted like cardboard. Very disappointed
Well well well.....we've been wanting to try this place for a while. We had a night open and decided to try it out. Came in about 7 and the place was empty. Hmmm? Seated next to the bar and I noticed a sign for $3.99 craft beer special. Asked the server and she wasn't sure. She had to check and it turned out it was a bottle of Fat Tire. Not too bad of a price I guess.When I ordered brisket, appropriate for a BBQ joint, they were out of it! Very inappropriate for a BBQ joint. I decided to go with baby back ribs instead. They came back and said they had enough brisket for a side with my ribs... For $3 more! Couldn't I just have that for free since I originally wanted it?We ordered a kids meal for our son. Mac and cheese with broccoli. The portion was tiny for $6.Ribs came and they were not very extravagant at all. For a place that prides itself on BBQ, this was way below par. I'd expect this presentation from an Applebee's or chilis, but not this place.They were still flavorful, but the fries were probably the highlight. Coleslaw had a weird  taste.I'd be ok not coming here again.
I don't have any other cupcake place to compare this too, and except for my own humble creations which come from a box. 4 stars it is for now.  The boyfriend and happened to be in the area and they happened to be open.  We were there around 2 so pickins' were slim.  Still, we found 4 flavors to try, Mint Chip, Classic Vanilla, Half-baked and a Mango.  The people there were nice and I took a card as they do bridal and I have a friend who may need them for a shower or two.The cakes were moist, and well done.  For me, the frosting was just sweet enough without making your teeth want to run from your mouth, and the frosting was a good ratio.  The Mint chip is a buy again, the Half baked was good, and the vanilla was decent.  (I would prefer more of a pronounced vanilla flavor).  The mango will not appeal to everyone.  If you don't like mango or coconut, this is not for you.  If you do, like I do, you will really enjoy this cake.Will I go again?  Yes.  I want more of a cross sample to make a really good review.  Will I go at 10 am?  Yes.  (See above) I live close enough for me to do so.  All in all, not a bad little local shop.Update: April 17, 2014. I have reduced my review from 4 to 2 stars as a second visit has rendered me unimpressed.  I also have had more cupcakes from cupcakeries to compare these to and I will stick to baking my own. I KNOW I can do better.
If you ask me? I thought this was awful and the cashier was a unfriendly. The caramel chicken was ok but the brown rice did not taste done to me..overall it's a nice comfortable setting.
Mr. Cooks has cleaned up the place, made it more customer friendly and appealing. Food is good, the servings are good. The downfall of this restaurant is the lady who is suppose to take your order. She is ALWAYS on the phone and I don't mean for business purposes but to talk to friends. She does not care about the business just who she is talking to. Sadly this will be the cause of this restaurant to close. She could be nice and helpful to customers but feels she is more important than any customer coming into their place. So sad as Mr. Cook has tried to make it a better place.
A 3 star for the fish n chips, the absence of proper dishes to cut the fish (just plastic fork and knife) and the price that is expensive (15 CAD for fish, chips, softdrink) for what the place looks like and deliver brings it down to a 2 star.
I'm really not a huge fan of this particular store. I've visited this store three times recently, different times in different days, and I swear to god the same three employees were working. My most recent trip here really disappointed me, to the point that I probably will stick to a department store from here on out. I walked in with only one thing on my mind that I needed and when I found it became frustrated. There was no price tag to tell me how much I was about to pay. Of course there are none of those scanner things to find out either. So the next course of action was to go up front and ask for a price check. When I got up front one of the employees was already at the register ten minutes into what I assume was the world's worst return. As I looked around, employee number two was busy at the copy center. And to too it off, employee number three was standing at the next register ignoring the line forming behind the return.  I waited for another 15 minutes before the return was done and then had another customer in front of me. By that point I was frustrated enough to just buy the item instead of ask for the price. I wouldn't have been so frustrated and angry by the time I had left if it weren't for the lack of attention by the employees. It's really irksome when they act all smug. Relax there buddy, I did my time in retail, but I knew when to get out of retail and I can tell you it wasn't in my thirties.
My long time technician moved out of state, so I have visited a few salons to find my new 'nail home'. Yes, the salon itself is decorated very tastefully, it does smell pleasant, but it also has the feel of an assembly line. I arrived, door was opened, and was told not only yet, but to pick out my polish.  I signed in (I was second, the first was an appointment) left, and returned before 'OPEN' time only to find two handsful of people in line. I was again, three times, to pick out my color - it was on the receptionist's desk - each time asked! My tech had no (good) personality at all. I attempted, several times with her, to have cheerful small talk but it was difficult.  I had a snack with me during my pedi, which she kept staring at. I took two bites and put it away. Very non-gentle treatment with feet, legs, hands. Grabbing, pushing, shoving out of the way.  Good pedi, except for sharp corners left on toenails. On to mani, I wanted a gel job just like I walked in with. She had time to look and see what I had.  She complained about the condition of my hands/nails.  (I thought that is what keeps nail salons in business, to make hands/feet pretty, a again). She said I use my hands too much!?!?!?!Then trouble began, she couldn't or didn't want to shape my nails. I wanted oval. She had them square, sharp corners. I attempted by words and hand motions to show her oval smooth corners. She kept filing the ends and not the corners. After 3-4 attempts, she became very agitated talking in her language to another tech. The 2nd tech came over asking me how I wanted the nails done. As I was trying to explain, tech one started speaking, in her language, very angrily. I told the tech 2 that even know I didn't understand the la gauge, I knew tech 1 was speaking very harshly about me and I didn't appreciate it. Tech 2 took over, as tech 1 left still speaking angrily through the salon. The 2nd tech did a fantastic job on my nails, but because she was pulled away from her client to take over for tech 1, she was not happy, and very rushed.  Again, just like an assembly line!!We ladies go to get our nails done to have them to look nice, but at the same time it is our little oasis of time to 'feel' pampered and relaxed!! Sadly, this was not the case during my PAID visit to this salon.
Things have changed since I was last here. They now charge a $9 resort fee... some resort, wtf. FreeWifi but it is weak... I get better WiFi using my Freedom pop hotspot. The included WiFi was the sole reason I chose El Cortez. No poker room. Vintage rooms are above the casino and stairs only, no elevator. The room itself is okay,  but it is located on the edge of Fremont Street.
Went here for breakfast and ended paying steakhouse prices. Example 2 coffees and 2 orange juices 12 bucks!!!  Really!!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food was good. However breakfast for 2 should never cost 33 dollars. Will never return.
This used to be one of my favorite steakhouses.  It has been slipping for years now. No more Hank's for me
While the food was OK, yes OK, the service was terrible. I would like to point out that not everyone is at fault. Some servers are great mine was just rude, took 5 minutes to serve a coffee, and best part I had no set for a while. I had to get it myself. Just terrible customer service all around.
Wants to appear sophisticated but obviously misses the mark, like that guy wearing a decent suit with white cotton athletic socks and axe body spray.  So it just sort of comes across as needlessly pretentious. I went with a friend and the owner came by, introduced herself with a very limp handshake and regaled us with the specials, both of which sounded good.  I'm pretty sure she only stopped by because I was laughing at the Moroccan crepe on the menu.  The description said it had a "chicken and tajine stew."  A Tajine is an earthenware cooking vessel in which you prepare stew, so to have it "and" means you'll be eating a cooking vessel (there's a few other items on the menu that make it clear they really have no idea what they're talking about).When the waitress came by to take our order my friend chose the Chicken Provencal special and I chose the Pastrami special.  Neither of which the waitress was at all familiar with.  Luckily for her the Chef was right behind us.  Then the chef outright stated she had no idea what we were talking about.  Lovely.The waitress goes on to helpfully state that the owner liked to come up with stuff on the spot.  Which is great if she's in the kitchen making it but not when she does it while glad-handing customers with no intention of conveying her ideas to her staff.   We asked a few more questions of the chef to see what she thought was what and my friend decided to play it safe and order off the regular menu, I stuck with the Pastrami special.When the crepes arrived, fairly quickly, my friend's plate was overflowing with food while mine was very demurely folded into what looked like an empty crepe with some sparse decoration.   The pastrami was tasty but there wasn't much there, especially for $12 dollars. My friend said the Hawaiian wasn't bad but wasn't all that special.   Her crepe cost $14.  I wasn't that hungry that I needed a giant pile of food, but it makes them look bad that their portion sizes were so completely inconsistent, especially for the same table. Overall, if they hadn't been trying so hard to appear more than they were and just tried to be a consistent, decent crepe place, I'm pretty sure they'd warrant a return visit.   As it is, I'll spend my money someplace else.
First time in Cleveland. After we got seated and ordered, we realized this is the Radisson Hotels restaurant. I ordered the burger medium/well. I believe it was a frozen burger which came on a wanna be pretzel like bun. I would rate my meal a 1 star. My son got the herb roasted chicken which he really enjoyed. Definately overpriced.
Location: On the main, in the heart of the action - at least during the Mural festival. Street parking is available but metered. Your best bet is to use transit and/or walk over.The place: Bare with the quintessential minimalist look. I can't say the vibe is warm and inviting because really, it's rather sterile - perhaps they want to discourage lingerers? In any case, this attracts hipsters like a moth to light so it won't be in my top five coffee places to frequent. There's only so much pretentiousness I can stand.The goods: Not my favourite coffee. I found it bitter and unimpressive. I had high hopes but nope, it just didn't work for me. I had a Cortado and from what I tasted of the home made cashew milk, it had a nice flavour to it but the coffee roast just overpowered it. The croissant was fresh and pretty good.Service: Slow as f**k. There was some hipster douche bag who obviously knew the girl behind the counter and he just kept going on and ON about useless, superficial shit because HEY - no one else is waiting in line! Rather then move him along, the clerk just kept talking to him. Had I known the coffee would be so underwhelming, I would have gone to my usual spot. Price point: I think the Cortado was over $3, while the croissant was something like $2.25.
Walk in & walked right back out! Not the cleanest 'Donut Parlor made me not enough want 'Donuts anymore that day.
I ordered a beef dish and it tasted like a lamb. I didn't like the food. Service is good.
We stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas in the past, but DON"T confuse the LVH with the HILTON! This is no longer the HILTON!! I didn't realize this when I made my reservation on Expedia (my mistake). This place is smoky and run down. The first room we were given had broken curtains that would not close. I called the front desk and we were sent to another room several floors down from where we were. This room was clean, but the ceiling had a huge water stain. The carpet also had stains. We kept the Do Not Disturb sign in our door. We didn't trust anyone going in our room. The safe was $13 a day to use!!! What??? That's ridiculous!! We went to the diner cafe place and it is way overpriced!!!! My husband and I split a $11 bacon and cheese omelet...blah! What happened to the cheap Vegas prices?? Not at this place! We also tried the Vince Neil restaurant (see review..NOT recommended!)  Most of the staff working this hotel and casino had no personality or seemed rude!! I ordered a drink at the bar and I was playing video poker. I noticed a bill in front of me, so I asked the bartender if my drink was comped for playing. He picked up the bill and said, "don't you see? what does this say?" RUDE!! The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star is for my winnings of $600, but we do not recommend staying here!
First thing I noticed was there was no attempt at creating a comfortable environment. Food was good. High quality and fresh. BUT chips and salsa were $3.50 and when we asked for another round of salsa they charged us 2 bucks but didn't mention it. We found out when we got the bill. To finish it off, they don't take American express.They don't understand how to make customers comfortable. So I strongly urge all potential patrons find another place to grab a taco.
Meh. In a pinch it's fine, but there are way better burrito places within walking distance. Very heavy on the rice. Pretty bland.
Ugh. I wish this wasn't the closest McDonalds location to my house, or I'd go elsewhere. I've had a few good customer service experiences, but this place is pretty terrible. My biggest complaint is that they NEVER fill the french fry box! I always have to order a size up, because I know they're going to dupe me.Tip: Make sure your order is correct before you head home!
We were greeted and seated immediately. The carne mechada dish was small but delicious. My husband was not impressed with his shrimp dish. Service was okay, but not great. We were disappointed with the overall lack of care. Glassware was all so spotty that it was gross. Cleanliness was way below anything I've ever seen before. Not impressed.
Small place with very tight machines. The place also pumps in a scent to make it smell tropical but it ends up smelling like old lady perfume and its way 2 strong. It is connected to the Flamingo hotel and you will have much better luck sticking with the Flamingo plus they have better selection of games. Oh, and drinks take forever to get in this casino.
We made a reservation because of the ratings. We looked over your menu. Looked very appetising but got to entrées and all said Prices varies. Why? Not a good look...
Took my husband last week for his birthday.. First time for him. Unfortunately probably his last. He was nott impressed. The best part of his dinner was the atmosphere. He ordered the special - Scallops.. appeared to be frozen, not fresh and very small. I ordered the Stuffed Artichoke as my entree. The flavor was good, I believe it was cooked in beef broth, however there was enough bread crumbs to coat an entire chicken. all of our food was average to below average. We paid $9 for 4 oz of Pinot Noir,Service was great, too bad we can't say the same for our food.
I'm annoyed that our waitress was so uninterested because otherwise I'd give a higher rating. The sushi was really good. My fiend ordered a chicken entree and asked for no veggies and a substitute for a side but he got it as listed on the menu. Drinks were good. Took at-least 5 minutes for a waitress to greet us.
How is In the Company of Thieves?  It depends on what you're looking for.If you're looking for a place to get consistently delicious fair trade coffee?  You've found it!If you're looking for a place to get consistent costumer service?Not so much.I live right around the corner from Thieves, so I want to love it so bad.  It's the closest coffee shop to my house and, like I said, has great fair trade coffee. But Thieves keeps inconsistent hours and the barristas (owner included) seem uninterested in serving you.  Which, attitude aside, just makes everything take longer.Here's my anecdotal evidence: The first time I went to Thieves, when I got there, there was no one behind the counter.  I'd heard mixed reviews about getting served, so I thought I'd do an experiment and see how long it took.  After standing around for 7 minutes (and contemplating grabbing the cash register or one of those tasty croissants and making a run for it) a gentlemen who I now recognize as the owner reappeared (from the basement? outside? it was unclear.)  He moseyed over the counter where I was standing and took some time getting set up before looking up and saying, "What can I get you?"   No "Have you been waiting long?" or "Sorry about that, I had to go and deal with an invasion of panthers downstairs!" or another plausible explanation.  I ordered my coffee, it was delicious.And this has been the kind of experience I have come to expect from Thieves.
This paper is awful and its internet version azcentral.com is even worse. I will glimpse through the web-version solely for the purpose of reading local news and might pick up a physical copy for the crossword. It does, however, defy two stereotypes associated with a major newspaper. Firstly, it seemingly has a policy against ground-breaking journalism and discourages its reporters from "getting the scoop." Secondly, that whole "liberal media" characteristic does not apply to this paper at all. Every election it endorses campaigning politicians, though almost always backs the conservative. Letters to the editor are largely conservative and are little more than toned-down hate speech. However, simply visit their website, which is available to the public with a thread format, and you will see the unbridled hate speech, borderline clinically-insane comments faithful readers leave, that this media outlet does not monitor. Politics aside, the paper is full of spelling and grammatical errors, lags behind other Valley print media sources in content and could stand a massive restructuring from within, as in the business and policy side of this organization needs to be completely gutted and rebuilt properly.
I've been to this Shoeless Joe's location on quite a few occasions, and have been to a few parties in their bar as well. The thing about this Shoeless Joe's, is that I want to love it, I really do... but I just... don't. Why do I want to love it? Well the staff are super-friendly, and the space is amazing! They have a sports-centre in the back of the bar area with reclining leather chairs and wall-to-wall screens. They have a few private dining areas which are really nice, and their booths all have private TVs. They have a great, convenient location, and have a really full menu that has something for everyone. So why don't I love it? Well I'm extremely partial to sliders, and upon my first visit there I was so happy to see that they have tons of slider options. The first time I ordered them, it was St. Patrick's Day, and it was insanely busy. They got my order wrong the first time, but quickly changed it. However, when I did get my sliders, they were cold! So disappointing, but I decided to give them another chance, since it was so busy that evening. Maybe a week later I went back to try the Chicken Wing Sliders... unfortunately, they got my order wrong again... but this time I was in a rush and just ate the sliders. They were good, not great. The main issue I have with them is that they have a "wonder-bread" type bun. Just empty white-bread carbs that basically taste like nothing-ness - and if you're paying around $15 for sliders, I would hope to have something a bit better! I've been a few other times and have had salads (which are decent) and also they make an excellent Caesar, which have little pepperonis as a garnish! Their food on a whole though... is just okay. I really think it's the fact that I love the staff that will keep me going back... but they will probably keep disappointing me on the food-front!
Finally able to visit Perk Eatery after reading about their potato pancakes in a Phoenix magazine review. First off let me say the restaurant is a charming throwback to an old fashioned diner. The service was excellent. We were immediately greeted, shown a table by a window, and approached by a server who was very friendly and efficient. We went specifically to have breakfast and I ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce. My friend ordered an omelet with toast and coffee. Food arrived in a timely manner and looked great. I was disappointed in the pancakes which really had some potential, but they turned out to be  very limp and greasy, quite a difference from what was described in the magazine, which said they were crispy. The toast was burned, pretty badly. I'm not sure why a cook would serve that to a customer. We just didn't eat it. The coffee was really watery as well. I see other reviews here that are very positive. Perhaps it was an off day but I have had much better food at other breakfast chains so we probably won't return.
The Place looks fantastic inside and out I'll give that 5 stars!!! Most of the people are great that work there, I went there for a few times now and I just moved around the corner. One of the bartender I met I think his name is Mike is an arrogant asshole sorry for my language, he is very disrespectful to everybody that comes up to his bar when he is working and starts acting like a childish kid when he get busy, slamming glasses and ignoring people he doesn't like... He made my last two experiences there awful and I might not come back. Another thing they might need to fix is the chef with all of the hoops in his ear probably needs to learn how to be somewhat quiet and respect his staff some more. He was a little scary and seemed disrespectful. Hope some of the staff gets fixed so I actually might enjoy myself when I come back.
I'm sorry but this place doesn't deserve its rating. When you are doing only breakfast and lunch, you had better have those Nailed. They do not. I had chicken fried steak and eggs with house cut potatoes and biscuits with gravy. Eggs were over done not over medium.The Steak was bland as was the gravy.The potatoes were under cooked in the middle, but brown and crispy outside? ( pieces were cut too large). Service was good but couldn't make up for poor food quality.Parking also was poor, had to park behind another restaurant and walk through a "hall" then back to front door. I Won't be back for more.
Somewhat disappointing...WAIT VERY disappointing. I had high hopes for this place. Good location, lots of marketing here and there..but once you walk in...you think "Is it just this??"I roam around the room looking for a secret room that will expand to make the place bigger but alas there is no secret room.It's quite small. Hardly anywhere to sit!The only good thing is the music. I really liked the music but with such a tiny dance floor..it's just very disappointing.
Staff is nice and friendly but the car wash did a terrible job. They had employees dry my car but when I got home I discovered spots all over. I'll stick to Fabulous Freddy's from now on.
I will say the food is tasty, which is the reason for 2 stars. But the wait is ridiculous. I have been here 2 separate times, the first time we waited for 20 minutes for 2 lunch specials. Now the second time I am here, well over 15 minutes to pour (pre-made) soup in a bowl. And then I had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for a box and my check. I understand it was prime lunch hour, but I still found the wait to be excessive for what I ordered. Very annoying and probably won't be coming back.
As a bar = good.  As a restaurant = not so good.  This review is based on my "dining" experience...Love that this place opened in the neighborhood, but based on my experience, I will only go for drinks from now on.  Yes - it is very cool inside, and love the balcony looking over the city.  The menu looks great on paper but the execution and service needs to have some kinks worked out.  Hoping it is just the newness factor.  The staff kept bringing us the wrong table's food.  Most times we knew it - except the one time.... We ordered "spicy tuna" rolls - It looked like a mess when it came out (like I would have rolled it.) but had some avocado and extras in it.... After my date and I finished it, the waiter brought out the "spicy tuna rolls" and we realized we just finished the people next to us rolls.  The other stuff we ordered (grilled cheese panini, fries) tasted good - but how could you screw that up?  You can tell that the waitress was working hard and was still friendly to us, but it just seems like there was some execution issues going on.  Hope they get things worked out.
I have been coming here for years and I have to say most of the smoothies are good here. The last two times I have been here the guys working behind the counter are too busy talking with either their regulars or friends visiting them. Today the smoothie I got was so sweet and not even what I asked for I was super disappointed. The guy who helped me was not even paying any attention to what he was doing because he was too busy talking to someone. When I walked up to the counter he didn't even stop his conversation to help me instead took a brief pause and raised his voice just enough  so I could hear can I help you. I gave him my order and as he finishes my smoothie walks out from behind the counter still talking to his buddy and proceeds to hand me my smoothie I smurked a little and then he realized he didn't even charge me. Wow! I don't expect people to roll out the red carpet but come on really a little attention to the customer and what you are doing would be much appreciated! I will not be coming to this location any longer!
Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.
I was very happy to see Pei Wei open at the Airport.It was really a big deal. Since all the other Asian restaurants shut down there.Major disappointment.First of all ,only a few items to choose from. Which maybe is understandable, since they need quick food ready to go.However, it is mostly all the really fatty foods. So I got a salad that was pre made.High price, but I know it is the airport.I had to wait for the girl to come to ring me up. She was angry and not happy to be there, and way too  busy talking to the other workers there about their personal life.That drives me crazy, plus I was the only one there at that moment.The 60 seconds that it takes to ring me up my order, should not take away from your personal chatter.  Plus I had to ask for a bag.When I did eat the salad it was full of white lettuce and the spine of the lettuce. Why do restaurants always do that now?The spine of the lettuce should never be in the salad! Ever!!I will say and mean it, I will never visit this place again in the Airport.Because, I really like Pei Wei normally.
Very disappointing at best. A small trip to the market to pick up a few items turned into an hour plus event. The store appears well organized and clean. There is a moderate amount of choices per item. However, the majority of the staff are unfriendly and are not happy with their job. In addition, for the cost of living in this state, these are the highest prices I have experienced. The only other grocery prices this high were in Hawaii. The most expensive place to live in the nation. This is unacceptable under the minimum wage rates or rates below $18.00 an hour.
Very average. The people were nice but the food was average, I had the mongolian beef and so did my friend. Broccoli was cooked perfectly, the meat was a little too "pounded out" and fatty and had no real texture. The sauce was missing flavor. I think if they improved the sauce it would have been better, and of course the meat. I may try them one more time but likely will avoid.
Oh no,Service has gotten so bad here. I remember when I was a kid and it was an actual treat to get to go to Red Lobster, now its a punishment.Please work on the service at this location.
Over priced, coffee is not as good as dunkin donuts .  E ven mcdonald's ,coffee is good
Disliked when they premade the banh mi... It didn't look fresh. I asked for extra chili, the lady took one of the premade banh mi from the back and added more chili. She broke the top part of the banh mi and didn't even bother fixing it... just kinda threw the broken part in. Was really upset seeing that scene. However it's $5 for 2 so I guess I shouldn't complain. Quality is not the best, it is decent banh mi. And since they premade it, it's sometimes a hit or miss. It's quite dry sometimes.Recommend when you need cheap lunch or something quick to go with.
The steaks once received were for the most part great if the waitress was listening on the order. In our group of seven she apparently checked out on three of the orders. Outside of that if you have either a flare gun or road side flares then use them as that apparently is the only way to get service from the wait staff. One of our group did snag an employee passing by and asked if we could have our sides served to stave of delirium from hunger due to the pro-longed delay. No dice... Instead we got a kid in a suit advising us to not to "fill up on bread..." As our waitress shouted problems at him that we had brought up earlier.Steaks = greatExperience = badWait staff = terribleManagement = Pretentious... & covering for deficiencies!
I arrived two hours before the Chris Brown concert to assure that I will get good lawn seats. They said they would open the lawn at 6 but they didn't open it on time, which sucked because it was way too hot. Food and drinks are overpriced. The drink I got was 16.00 - it was delicious but not worth the price. Venue failed to mention that opening acts weren't gonna show up. Concert was supposed to start at 7 but we had to listen to crappy DJ's whose sound system was malfunctioning. Chris Brown came on two and a half hours later. Getting out of the parking lot was hell. Took almost an hour to get out. Park at the end of the lots if you are going to come here for a concert.
One of the worst pizza I had . They did not even bother to make the pizza correct for me. Overpriced . I would prefer blaze Anyday.
ALTHOUGH b.m. has created a beautiful room and probably a welcome local alternative to all of the clubs on the strip if you're into that sorta scene, it still is as far from cool as can be.Talk about a sausage fest!  I was hit on by at least a dozen butt-faced boneheads in the 45 minutes I was able to stomach this place.  Butt-faced in this case refers to both the people and their condition.If you're into (to borrow from a previous reviewer) douchebags and doubaggery, then you've hit the motherload!  There were more goofballs there with fake tans, coked-out eyes, highlighted faux-hawks and Ben Sherman "Vegas-shirts" than at a Jersey bachelor party!  Some girls might read this description and say "Count me in!".They get 2 stars for the room.  Well done.  Potentially great place, but infected by the douchebagism.Have fun, chix with skank-striped hair, orange skin, stripper voices, and tramp stamps!  You are going to love the Blue Mar-tini-weeney!
One of the worst meals we've had in Vegas. My  wife's Tuna was cold in the middle and after sending it back it came back tasting fishy. My ribeye with Bearnaise sauce was nothing special. The best dish anyone had was truffle fries.The desert menu was pedestrian at best. In no way did the meal live up to Thomas Kellers reputation.
We went for the first time and were very disappointed. The food was very average and somewhat over priced. Salads are extra on a $16 entreeAnd the least expense salad is $6. The waiter we had was poorly trained.We were offered "happy hour" pricing on drinks and were charged full price when we received the bill !   Had we known we would have ordered what WAS on happy hour. Again poor training on the waiter he made no adjustments to the bill. The is somewhat new but I would recommend training to the wait staff and some price adjustments.
Extremely slow service, and found 2 staff members just hanging out instead of helping customers out. They also don't accept Starbucks reward card and have posted a sign right next to the cashier.On the other hand, they are participating in the Frappuccino Happy hour that lasts until May 12th.
The food is amazing so 5 stars for the food but not sure waiting 23 min in the drive through is worth it...I could have just gone on a bad day and got stuck behind a car that ordered a lot but I would just go in and order. The lady at the drive through wasn't very pleasant either....Went through the drive through again and waited 25min only to have them get my sandwich wrong...so pissed. If I decided to go back it would only be for a fruit tart or cannoli..
We stopped here for happy hour. Drinks were not good. They didn't have much for taste and seemed to be watered down. The wait staff was very friendly and nice. However we were not impressed with the food or drinks. We enjoyed the patio with the cushion chairs. However, I probably wouldn't come back here.
You'd think that the menu items here would be vegetarian, looking at the restaurant name. Think again. *dramatic intro*Came here to celebrate being veg-curious with some cool folks. I'd been to the Mekong Plaza across the street and tried UnPhogettable, which offers delicious pho. I was craving something hot to soothe my throat and pho sounded perfect. I'd read in reviews that this place has two menus: an American and a Vietnamese. Wanting to order something authentic, I chose from the latter and got a pho combo with beef and chicken. Since I thought the whole menu was vegetarian, I was excited to see this option with soy meat. I also ordered cream cheese wontons as an appetizer.Our food came in waves in the order that we ordered. My wontons were pretty good and I liked the sweet and sour sauce. The pho bowl arrived and it looked surprisingly and suspiciously like it had real beef. Then when I noticed the bone marrow/gelatin, I knew something was wrong. Thankfully, Norm saved the day by tracking down our server and asking about it and somehow he gave me the real deal. It took 15 min or so for my vegetarian pho to come out and I didn't eat much of it. It was lacking flavor, even with the addition of Sriracha.This is why I have trust issues. Apparently, the restaurant has two sides and one serves meat. Reading the name and the menu, I didn't realize this and only found out after my snafu. I can look past things like the ambiance if the food is good, but this wasn't the case. The placemats reminded me of the 90s and there was a dead fly on the table. Like I said, I normally don't care about the aesthetics but figured it belonged in this review. I won't be back, and there are other places nearby that I'll probably try.
I got the beer battered fish tacos but I don't know if there was actually any fish in there or if it was just beer batter. I was very disappointed after all the great things I've heard about this place. I'll probably give it one more shot- maybe it was just what I ordered.
None of the refrigeration units to keep salads, fruits, veggies cold out on the serbing floor seemed to be working. Everything we took from these areas was at room temperature or above. Don't feel safe eating here.
I was relieved to read some of the other reviews of this cafe and see that I wasn't the only one who didn't feel that welcome. I've tried this place four of five times now and have just decided that though I want to like it that the quality of food and service make it a challenge. On my last visit I ordered a blueberry smoothie and ham and Swiss crepe. The crepe was perfectly fine but the smoothie was bland. The bigger issue is that the layout of the front order area is disorganized with things apparently placed randomly and the place overall doesn't come across as that clean. There was shelving in construction in the main order area with no signage to be cautious. In the meantime I noticed sandwiches being made with Wonderbread and have heard comments about pastries having come from Costco. I support small businesses in this area all the time but this one needs some quality TLC.
Stopped in after a long day of shopping and moving with a few friends. The overall cleanliness of the establishment was good. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a Red Chili burro plate - came with rice and side of beans - Lets just say I was very disappointed . The Rice was dry and bland - the Red Chili burro had no flavor at all, to top it off they wanted to charge you 25 cent for a refills! It's bad enough the fountain drinks were two or more dollars! tisk tisk.
I laughed by reading reviews before I write mine. Loyd must have had the same driver as we did last night. The one we took from Fremont street was a driver named Eyob, must be from somewhere Africa or Middle East. He was on a cell phone already and kept talking in a strange language all the way till we get off at Bellagio. Very unprofessional.
This place is located in an odd area as it's on a major road yet the only parking nearby is on residential streets. I have never stopped in this neighborhood as there aren't many commercial spaces nearby. The setup is ok with a good amount of space and decent seating. They offer a few other desserts like macrons and Liege waffles other than their claim to fame. Macrons looked interesting and would be liked by kids for sure. The main attraction has so many flavors to offer that it took a bit of time to decide what to get. I had the bourbon and butterscotch. They do brulee' after the order so that's an attraction I suppose.  After the novelty of fresh brulee' wears off this place offers a mediocre take on this dessert. I think there was too much sugar on top and the base didn't impress much either. Maybe I ought to have tried the classic version first. They do use vanilla beans and from what I could tell decent ingredients. Maybe the recipe was off. At this price point and location not worth the detour
This place is like the McDonald's of Chinese food. When I worked downtown, we'd head here about once a week or so to get out of the office and I would almost always get the Peanut Chicken, which would put me in a sodium coma for the rest of the day. You know, sometimes you just need that. Life ain't all Skittles and beer.
Although still often hard to get a reservation, the quality of the food and service continue to slide from an easy 4+ stars to now a 2 to 3-star rating.The food used to be well prepared and now it is either over or undercooked with low consistency. We used to come here and try to imitate some of their dishes, like the burrata, but we make it better at home now as their grapes are often not toasted, although we still reminisce about our first time having it there. Same with their pastas, almost always soggy and overcooked, never a la denete, even after you send it back. Service is pretty casual and sloppy now too, but at least they take items off the bill when they've served you something horribly made (although it still spoils your dining experience). And once they've tainted your dining experience, your server basically ignores you because they think they're no longer getting a tip, further tarnishing your dining experience. In fact, we had to flag down other servers for service.I highly doubt we will eat here again and recommend diners go somewhere else as this place is highly overrated. Enoteca Sociale is a superior choice for this type of fare and not much farther west on Dundas.
I wasn't impressed at all. The servers are helpful. But the freshly squeezed juices are horrible. If your going to charge me $4 it better taste freshly squeezed, hand picked, and good. As far as the crepes I wasn't too impressed. The omelets were dry. Plus the food was pricey. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place just doesn't cut it.
Was just in this restaurant and my credit card was declined.  They really need to use chip cards. I just used at two other establishments in Kent. Get a clue. Very unhappy
This place is cluttered, overpriced, and you can't open anything to see what exactly they're selling! The people weren't friendly at all, and only asked if we needed help when they saw us wander their aisles multiple times. Nothing is organized either! Watch your step!
It's seriously just a grass field. Surrounded by homeless people. Not a fan at all. Plus in the summer there is zero shade anywhere. Not on the field or parking.
After reviewing several reviews we decided to go to dinner at Gallaghers Steakhouse and boy were we disappointed. It started with a distracted waiter who took forever to take our drinks and meal order.  A table that arrive after us actually had their order taken before ours. It was kind of surreal but with all the great reviews we thought it would be worth the wait. Well, it wasn't! Our sirloin steak was bland and rather fatty. The spinach was way too salty and disgusting. Highlights of the evening was the mashed potatoes but this does not save their rating. This was a pricey adventure and one that won't be repeated. I don't have a steakhouse recommendation for Las Vegas visitors but if you are ever in Chicago and want to taste an excellent aged steak, check out Joes Seafood, Prime Steak &Stone Crab...mmmmmmm!
Very underwhelming , Great service but I expected better quality at a Sawyer restaurant ! Some of the key flavoring components added to dishes seem to be non-exsistant such as truffle mushrooms and foie gras .. where they just put in the description to boost sales?
Due to the location this restaurant is a common corporate meal option. I've been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and the best way to describe it is as putting in the absolute minimum amount of effort to milk the location. Drinks are extremely overpriced ($8 for a 16oz pour or $16 for a cocktail) and food is just ok although slightly more reasonable price wise. The restaurant itself feels somewhat poorly maintained if you pay attention to the details, things like properly working faucets in the restrooms.I would not recommend this restaurant, with so many options downtown your money would be much better spent elsewhere.
Korean food - 5/5 Sushi - 3/5 Service - 1/5. Awful.I've been here on three separate occasions. Each time I've come back hoping that my experience will get better, but unfortunately, this has not been the case. Let me start off by saying that the food here is grand. Probably one of the best Korean places in this part of town, and with decent sushi (of varying quality depending on what day you come/who's making it). The first time sushi was delicious and excellent, the second and third times, the rolls were sloppy and way too big and they just didn't taste that great. The place inside is really nice-looking and they have a nice way of giving you a complimentary steamed egg with your meal. How nice! The caveat to such great food and nice interior, though, is the ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE I've received every time I've come to Gogi. The servers are totally negligent. It is so hard to flag them down, they won't refill your water, they never ask you if you need anything or check up on you, they will blatantly busy themselves doing other stuff instead of stopping by your table once, even if the restaurant is empty. It took me FOREVER to get through dining here because of the servers. First it takes them forever to come around for your drink order. Then they'll leave and 20 minutes will pass before they ask you for your food order. They'll never refill or ask you if everything's okay (had to wait for almost an hour to ask for an appetizer, during which we changed our minds). Needed extra sauce or something with our food when it came... never came. Took forever to come and give us a check, longer still to come back and get the check. TOOK ALMOST THIRTY MINUTES TO RETURN OUR CARDS TO US EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT. So I've come to hate this place because of the slow and negligent service I've experienced each time I've come here. I've never felt more ignored (sometimes blantantly, I'll make eye contact with a server and try to flag them down and they'll walk away) as a customer. If you really want great food and can stomach being treated poorly, I'll still say the food (not the sushi) is great. If not, however, take your patronage elsewhere.
I went into this Vivah Jewelry a few weeks ago, planning on making a quick purchase. Little did I know, this simple purchase would turn into a long drawn out adventure.This location, like all other locations, was (is?) having a 50-60% off sale. I had recently started a new job in the area and was looking to get something nice for my mom. Just a little token gift with my new salary, not exactly breaking the bank, I know.During one of my 15 minute breaks, I stopped by the store to look around. It's a very small store with not much area. There was a customer being helped by a saleswoman and some displays and cases. I waited patiently to be helped by the saleswoman, not interrupting them. I looked around a bit and stood off to the side. In the 5 minutes I waited, I was not looked at or acknowledge by the saleswoman. No "hi one minute" or "sorry I'm busy". Not even a glance in my direction. I'm a young male who doesn't look like he frequents shops like this, still, I felt it was terrible service and left the store annoyed. I decided to give it one more try during my lunch break. When I returned to the store, there was a different saleswoman behind the counter. She ended up being extremely nice and helpful. Honestly, I was surprised at the polar opposite of the service (or lack thereof) I had gotten earlier. I would be happy to deal with her again. I decided to buy a watch with turquoise stones on the band and left happy.When I gave it to her, my mother liked the watch very much. However, after wearing it a few times, she noticed some of the stones had fallen out and you could see glue residue on the metal. Disappointed, I was worried about returning/exchanging the watch because it was on sale and usually that means all purchases are final. I decided to call Vivah Jewelry's offices using the # on their website to see if I had any options. I reached their repair line and spoke with a very pleasant woman. She explained that I could return the watch to the store I got it from to have them send it in for repair. She assured me there would not be any cost in doing so.When I returned to the store to turn over the watch for repairs, the first saleswoman I had dealt with happened to be there. While she acknowledged me this time, I was the only one in the store. I told her what the repair lady had told me and gave her the watch. She then produced another from the cabinet and gave it to me. While I appreciated this, she told me that my mom should be careful not to be too rough with the watch or bang it into things. I found this somewhat insulting because I know my mom is careful with her jewelry. And even if she accidentally bumped into something, it really shouldn't be hard enough to dislodge stones from the band. After my experience, I am unsure about shopping at Vivah Jewelry again. Some salespeople are pleasant, some really aren't. And it's not like they're the only option for relatively inexpensive jewelry. Perhaps if everyone was as pleasant as the second lady I dealt with, I would be more likely to return.
Good: 1. Elegant 2. The rooms have a nice style to it. We loved the kitchen, the bedroom and yes, even the bathroom style. It's very cool. 3. Nice pool 4. It doesn't have the smell of smoke. Bad: 1. One of our rooms smell like mold/mildew. We asked if the room can be sprayed with some scent. After 3 hours we called again because they didn't show up. Finally someone came but it still smell. 2. We press the clean button (room service) but they didn't clean our room. 3. The gym was dirty. I used the treadmill and there was some machines with people's sweat all over the screen. And when I turned on the fan on the treadmill it blew a cloud of dust on my face and the machine stopped working. 4. You have to pay to get an umbrella near the pool. It's Vegas and it is super hot are they kidding me. 5. They don't have rooms with two beds. The second bed is a pull out sofa. It's an old, uncomfortable, thin mattress. They should be embarrass that they offer this. It's such an elegant hotel and it doesn't really represent "Trump" . Or maybe it does?6. Hotel is away from the strip. You have to take a shuttle that stops running at 12pm.7. There is no casino.
Disappointing experience. Messed up our order twice and took 45 minutes to get our food.
Everything was awesome except for the one thing we came for - the steak.  I am not sure what happened but the bone in rib eye was way over salted.  They took it back but the second piece of meat the brought out was way undersalted and not a quality cut.  Service and oysters awesome
Let's start with the positive. The atmosphere was like a seen from the Sopranos which made for great people watching.  Additionally, it's always great when a restaurant has live entertainment. Unfortunately the food was terrible. I literally ate an old shoe for dinner. The prosciutto tasted like a shoe tongue. The pasta tasted like shoelaces. The mozzarella tasted like a rubber soul. I'm grateful for Prilosec OTC.
Friendly staff good beer but the food is overpriced and not that good at all in my experience and eating while 4 people are smoking in there makes it worse people should just smoke outside the door is right there and they should bring the food prices down since its not that good
I really wasn't too impressed. I walked around the entire store trying to find help and I couldn't. I mean talk about ghost town. I finally found someone who was helping someone else & I hate to interrupt when that happens but I didn't have a choice.After some of help, I found what I was looking for. The variety of choices here does not compare to other craft stores that I can go to. I wouldn't waste my time coming back.
It was similar to any chain restaurant in the states. People were nice, atmosphere was mall-esq, food was OK.
I'm not impressed. Overpriced for something that didn't hit the target. I spent over $12 for a simple wrap and smoothie for breakfast. The facility isnt too clean and the women barely spoke loud or clear enough for me to hear them. I should have just spent my money next door at Starbucks.
The food is 5 stars!! But the one waitress I had named Rebecca was nice in the beginning then she became rude. She's a heavy set white lady w/ short blonde hair. It was New Year's Eve & I know that some stores & food places give out cute "happy new year" hats. I saw that she had one & I had asked her "oh do you guys by chance have the hat with the feather?" Bcs I wanted a new little head piece. & she looked at me like I was stupid & said "no" in thee BITCHIEST tone. I thought I was the only one who thought her tone was rude... But my boyfriend commented on her tone once she left & my mom even said "why did she say it all snobby?" Little things like that upset me bcs it's not like I was being rude to her in the first place. It was a simple question & I was expecting her to be polite. Also, in the beginning... It took her forever to even take our drink orders. she never checked on us to see if we were doing okay. She didn't check if we needed any refills on our drinks. She just handed us our check & left. I will not come back to this restaurant if she will be my server again.
Le cadre est agréable (love la cave à vin). Le dejeuner comprend un accès au bar à salades (variées et tasty) et du pain/beurre à l'ail. Les pâtes sont en revanche décevantes. Cuisson limite et sauces trop riches.
Yeah it's a no for me... Was recommended the margarita pizza by the bartender lol.  I 'lol' only because I wonder if he was just 'trying' to sell an item on the menu? Does he not know good food? The tomato sauce base was so bland.  The sauce tasted like a brand I'd buy in the no-name section  of No Frills, if I was desperate and there were no other tomato sauces  left on the planet. I didn't finish the pizza - it was meh.I've had the cheesecake from Scaddabush at the Front street location, and the Mississauga location and it was creamy, however the same cheesecake at the Etobicoke location tasted tougher in texture. For the first time in my life, I can't really put a finger on it, as to why it was off to me. I noticed too it was a little tanned at the top of the cheesecake and I've never seen the cheesecake like that before at the other two locations. For an Italian restaurant, they really need to step up their game. It did not taste like authentic Italian cuisine. At the end of the day, I would have been happier going to Metro to buy the pizza that they make fresh and  fire in the oven. That's sad really... that I would have been more satisfied going to a chain grocery store for pizza.. C'mon , you had one job Scaddabush. Well won't be returning  to the restaurant. I guess  I'll make Joey's my hot spot for my end of the week treat!
Cleveland Hopkins.I live here, sadly, Hopkins is kind of a joke.Lets start with the parking ....And, how bout the parking ....Did I mention the parking ....Enuff said.
It's a decent buffet for a low price. The food is the same everyday. It never changes and it's usually cold by the time you start eating.
I used to like this Starbucks for its location and abundance of seats. But lately I've noticed that the baristas at this location are annoyingly loud, making it impossible to concentrate on study/work and carry a good conversation. They aren't the regular staff I used to see around here.If you want to come here for study/work, remember to bring ear plug or headphone. Even with headphone on, you'd cringe as their loud conversation pierce through your music. Bring back the regular staff please!
Pizza wasn't that great and was ridiculously overpriced, almost laughable. But hey, it was late and we were starving. The hostess was dense, but our waitress was friendly enough. Won't be back.
Patria as a restaurant is average.  Two reasons: First it is not Spain and some times the food can be good... sometimes.  The chef is not Spanish.  I believe she was trained in Spanish Cuisine, but there are some important details on her training that are missing.The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL, really beautiful, the bar, the decor in general... The food is ok, I recommend the paellas, and from the tapas the croquetas.  For dessert the churros are excellent...People go to Patria because of the ambiance, people go to drink.   After 10 pm is vibrant, a happy atmosphere full of of young and attractive people that go more for a a drink and experience than for the food.The service gets 1.5 stars... It needs to improve A LOT, from the hostess to the servers, and the person that helps with the wine needs to be more communicative. Management is average like everything else.
Fast-food in a Fine Dining RestaurantI made our reservations well in advance and was excited to be celebrating my wife's birthday at Beauty & Essex.  Unfortunately, I am highly disappointed by my dining experience and can't recommend this restaurant. The food was tasty and perfectly satisfying, as was the ambiance, I think.  The problem is we were so rushed through our meal by our server that I barely had time to enjoy any of it. Only moments after placing our order the food arrived, quicker than some fast-food restaurants I've been to. We were never even asked if we would like a second cocktail, the plates were promptly cleared, and then the bill arrived.  The message was clear, the restaurant values turning tables, not customers.
Jazz brunch, complete with a guitarist and bass player. Served 12-2:30pm Sundays only. We made a reservation, not knowing how busy they would be, when we showed up, we were surprised to see not as many people as we anticipated being there. First thing when I was seated in the booth, I immediately noticed a cluster of white hairs and old dried skin flakes right next to me. I wanted to vomit. Grandma had not only left behind the free newspaper they offer, but she also left behind her DNA. The server was apologetic and cleaned it up, then offered me a black napkin in exchange for the white one on the table (bonus point, I had a black dress on). This is a non-traditional style brunch. Going over the menu selection, you can either choose between doing just the AYCE serve yourself brunch for $45, or you can do the AYCE, in addition to entrees (Hong Kong Style Grouper, Belgium Waffle with caramel pecan cream, some of the offerings) for $58. They have a ramen station, along with what they were calling dim sum, there were only two available, pork bun and shrimp shiu mai. A salad station with different offerings like, caprese, waldorf, mediterranean, pasta, etc. A small charcuterie and cheese board (my cheese was hard at the ends) as well as crab claws and what they were calling Kumamoto oysters (I don't think they were Kumamoto) and chilled shrimp, as well as some sushi rolls that were about grocery store quality. My favorite station happened to be the fruits. They had lambootan, dragonfruit and my favorite, passion fruit. Dessert station had mostly parfait type offerings, with some cake pops and one truffle and different creme puffs. In addition, they offer "free flowing" Veuve Clicquot for another $35 or mimosas for $19 (this is in addition to the cost of brunch).Service was less than stellar. I had to continually ask for refills on my coffee and water, she didn't come around often. I left disappointed. I've had way better brunches in town and at this price point, you can do better.
I am SADDENED. I have gone to this Safeway for 14 years, I have witnessed changes, I'm a "regular".  I've never done ALL of my shopping here, but it's my go-to place when I need something fast. But I'm quite literally here 3 times a week. No MORE.They've changed it. I was worried about the business model with the Albertson's/Haggen's takeover, how would "our store" be affected. Well....it's been affected. LIGHTS LIGHTS, everywhere there's lights! My organic section has been mixed in! The shelving is sky high! It's HORRIBLE. It's like a Wal-mart. I LOATHE Wal-mart. It looks identical to Albertson's...I LOATHE Albertson's too. I'll never go back again. Safeway has officially lost my business to Sprouts, & Fresh & Easy.
Delicious grilled meats as always, fun atmosphere as always, just as savory as the original restaurant in Niagara Falls.. Unfortunately if you are in a large party or have been seated for longer than 50 minutes, the service grinds to a slow -almost non-existent- halt. This happened in both Niagara Falls and Toronto, it was not a fluke occurrence, and my friends experienced the same.I will be back for the food once in a while, on an indulgent and patient occasion, but I will not be making a reservation for the consistency in service. I think a big downside is the "built-in" service tip of 10% for parties 6+... which doesn't let you tip more OR less, and basically tells the servers to "stop trying" because they are going to get 10% no matter how hard (or not) they try. Grill on, keep the bacon wrapped sirloin coming... But for Brazil's sake, don't leave the large tables hanging, like your meat-juice soaked skewers.
The Service:Friendly and prompt. Awesome job.The Setting:Looks like a fast food place with a bar and Asian-ish touch. It has TV and clean restrooms.The Food we ate:-Love how the salad was crispy fresh...but the salad dressing ruined it...ick.-The calamari looked different (like puffballs), but they actually tasted better than I expected. The sauce that came with it complemented it.-The summer roll and its sauce was ok...not that good, but not that bad either.-My teriyaki chicken was a bit a bit dry with very little sauce on it. If they added a bit more sauce, it would've been perfect. It still tastes good though. The veggies that came with it was perfect.-My hubby's basil beef tasted like a regular stir fry. And let's just say we shared my teriyaki chicken instead.
Visited there on 9/29/07.  Had a 50% off coupon.  The clerk handled this purchase ok.  Then when I went back in the same time frame, I ordered two milk shakes for my wife and I.  The clerk charged me once for the milkshakes at 1/2 price and then turned around a charged me full price for each shake.  When we got the shakes, they were not even mixed up.  To hell with this place, I will never go there again.  Seem likes they don't give a dam about there customers-The only reason for them being there.
This place used to do a mean smoked salmon eggs Benedict, but today I discovered it is no longer a good breakfast place. For $15 for eggs Benedict I expect runny poached eggs and actual smoked salmon. But not this one, I had actual canned salmon, a smear of avocado, and hard poached eggs. The waitress didn't even ask for how my eggs were to be done. I will not be returning.
Some selections are pretty good. Unfortunately though it seems as though some dishes weren't cookies thoroughly. Baked chicken  has blood in it still. I wasn't sure if it was edible at that point. The salmon sushi didn't taste very well either. The service wasn't that great either.
Food is alright for a late night place. Chicken and gyro meat was a bit on the dry side. The falafels were cleverly-designed, elongated chickpea logs. This makes them easier to eat and more whimsical than traditional falafels. The service was polite and friendly. My primary complaint is the clientele. For dine in 2 stars, carry out 3.
I do not usually give two star reviews, but Kinka Izakaya North York earned it. I waited 30 minutes to order. Then had to wait another 40+ minutes for the food to come. The prices are quite high for the quality and the amount of food you get. The waiters are too focused on screaming when people walk in that they completely ignore you when you try to grab their attention for napkins or extra utensils.Also, WHY SO LOUD? I understand that it is all about "the energy" and making the dining experience "fun" and "different", but oh my goodness, I could not even hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me! We stopped trying to converse with each other after a while. There was no point in screaming at each other over the noise when we can go somewhere else and talk. I feel bad for the waiters working there. How do you not get a headache after being there for over an hour? We got out of there as soon as we could. Will not be back.The two stars I am giving is for their washrooms. I have to admit, they were pretty amazing, and very clean.
My pedicure was great but when I got my mani he totally skipped the lotion/massage part. When I asked he acted as if it wasn't part of it. No big deal right? I'll just make sure I'm not paying for something I'm not getting. We'll, it's supposed to be included. He said he gave it to me! Woman there said, "why would he lie?"  What?! Why would I lie? I felt embarrassed and a little annoyed. They took $5 off but I look forward to that part so can't get over the disappointment. I won't go back.
First time here from Ohio on business. Had the pub burger. This shop needs some work m. Burger was not quite cooked as ordered soggy bun. Not much on flavor. Sweet potato Fries also soggy and not real warm. Service in bar was slow always bothered by that. Will try someplace else for rest of this trip. The pickle was good!
Horrible horrible horrible service. I chose the restaurant for my birthday dinner. The food and restaurant itself were lovely, but I really can't stress enough how rude our waiter was. Lots of blank stares and disinterested looks, taking our order seemed to be a waste of his time. We also waited with our empty plates in front of us for 20 minutes while he gave the tables around us what we overheard to be very friendly service. I'm assuming this is because my boyfriend and I are in our mid 20's and the nearby tables were older couples. I realize Yorkville is known to be a snobby part of town, but I have frequented other restaurants in the area and have never had a service issue. Apparently if you are under 30 you aren't allowed to eat at this restaurant and receive good service. I would recommend going in with your Chanel bag and Gucci loafers or you'll be waiting quite a while to be checked up on by your waiter.
new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta "everyday" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as "charity bread" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn't open...served us a pizza called "americano" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we'd order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than I'd like, service can be significantly improved.
Went here last night had 2 appis, and 2 entrees. The appis were booth sub par. The fish tacos had no flavor at all! The texture was fresh but nothing more. My girl had salt and pepper wing and they were not very good. We couldn't put our fingers on it maybe it was the non granular salt, or the fact that they felt like they had too much skin. Entrees were good we had the prime dip, and the duke burger. The prime dip looked good and came with a strip of really good candied bacon. I had the duke burger with a side salad. The dressing for the side salad was almost in edible, but the burger was amazing! The burger is the 1 extra star out of this meal.
There are literally over 60 TVs in this place so wherever you sit youre going to be able to aee all four channels theyre playing. Sat down and it took longer than usual for our waitress to get to us. We ordered sodas and they were twice the size of a normal soda and we didnt need refills which was nice because our waitress never came to check on us. I ordered the ribeye and my friend ordered steak fajitas. Im not picky about fat on my steak (though 50% of the steak was fat) but what I am picky about is if there is a big fat VEIN in my steak. That is NOT normal. I stopped eating once I found it. I also ordered a caeser salad with it. I took one bite and pushed it to the side. It tasted old and the croutons had gross Italian seasining on them. My friends fajitas were good except when she ate the steak by itself, there was zero seasoning on the meat. The guacamole was just pureed avocado and was straight out of a container. Me and my friend had to convince each other to say something about the food because it was really that bad. The hostess came by and saw the look on our faces and told us shed go fetch our waitress. She came and said shed get the manager, Andre. He came and we explained everything. He was a little defensive about the food but overall he gave me a new cut of steak to go with more onion rings and he reduced our $50 dollar bill to a $20 bill. Overall our experience wasnt that great but I gave it 2 stars because of Andre. and how he did his best to fix everything. We wont be back.
Rated so low based on $260 price tag for 2, when I've had much better overall experiences for less than half the price. Food wasn't terrible, as long as you don't like pairing wine with dinner. We tried wine that the waitress suggested and literally never tasted the wine due to completely scorched taste buds. A filet that roasts your mouth? I expected to taste a top quality piece of beef nicely complemented by wine. Instead tasted...hot pepper and was that wine? Not sure. It was red but had no chance at coming through after my mouth being blown out by pepper. Weird thing is I like spicy food, this just didn't go with a steak. Not up to the hype or the price tag. Apparently Mr. Flay hasn't checked in with his "chef" lately.
Honestly. At best, food court quality. We ordered delivery, nice staff, quick, but all six of us were disappointed. It must have changed ownership since I visited last. Many better to choose from. Sorry to be negative. Hot and Sour soup was good. B
Ambience is great, location and decor on point! Quality of food goes hand in hand with the qualities aforementioned.Sadly, the 2 stars review will be based on customer service. This will be the first and last time we visit this place. We love trying new food and don't mind waiting if the quality of the food and service are up to par. Waited for over 40 minutes for food and it never arrived!The 3 waiters did not check on you (Avoid the table next to the hostess podium, seems to be invisible to them) After we asked for our food to go, it still took 20 extra minutes. The attitude of the personnel was extremely poor at the end after asking for a simple mistake to be corrected. We felt ignored most of the time and as such, cannot recommend this establishment.
I am not pleased with the staff or the venue.  The manager is less than professional, the venue is overpriced, and there is a severe lack of customer service with this.  While I do appreciate the beauty of the building, and the owners are so nice, I would say, take your money elsewhere.
not that impressed. I really wanted pancakes from ihop but my boyfriend's mom wanted to come here, so had no say. They had 3 pancake selections to choose from - I ordered the lemon poppy seed and wasn't too impressed and the pancake texture was kinda cardboardy. I also wanted a side of hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns are actually potatoes, so that was another disappointment. I also ordered lemondae which tasted pretty weird and watered down. Only food I find impressive here is their bran muffin - it is very tasty with butter. The restaurant itself is nice and clean and nice service, but I am definitely not a fan of their food.
This food... No. Ali Baba's usually pretty good for an average place. Meat quality is kind of bad... Great deal for 2 shawarmas but they don't taste that great. The veggies are fresh I guess, but the meat is what matters most. Really friendly and talkative owners. But would not make me come back.
The only reason I will come back to this place is maybe for a drink or two, other than that I will never eat here again. I ordered the steak and shrimp meal.  The shrimp was your average fried shrimp just as I expected so no complaints there, but on the other hand my steak was not cooked to my specifications. I ordered it medium and the first time it came out it was well done. Fail! So the server took it back and ten minutes later a second steak came out and much to my despise it was also well done. EPIC FAIL!!! So I just gave up and ate some of the dry steak. You would think that a close to $30 plate would get more attention to detail on a simple task. Not the servers fault, the cooks need more practice on steak preparation.
I came here on a busy day and got seated immediately. I didn't find it necessary to be seated immediately if my sushi came an hour later. Their beef sashimi is not authentic . They use raw beef that looks like the ones you would hot pot(sliced). I came here twice and I was happy from my first experience but I guess I was too hungry to truly realize the quality of their food and service. I guess you can't expect much from an all you can eat sushi place.
Breakfast was mediocre at best. Bland. Not cozy. We live close and never go here so it's just not our fav breakfast place. Service was ok.
I was so excited to try Hawaiian food. I ordered what I thought was a hamburger. What I got was white rice and some meat SWIMMING in a pool of gravy with an egg floating on top. There was more gravy than anything else, it actually made me sick.
got a chicken shawarma sandwichtaste was pretty goodstomach issues 2 hrs later though
I was staying at the adjoining Holiday Inn and found out about the 20% discount coupon for the Hyde Park Grille so it seemed a no-brainer to go to this place, especially after seeing the favorable Yelp reviews.  Living in Chicago, I am pretty particular about steakhouses but I was cautiously optimistic.  The restaurant is very upscale and seems out of place next to the somewhat rundown Holiday Inn.My son and I were seated in the bar area.  We had a pleasant server and our service was generally good.  Even though this is a steakhouse, we both ordered seafood.  Maybe this was a mistake.  My son had the sauteed shrimp and scallops and the scallops were overcooked.  I had the Chilean sea bass.  It was also overcooked, and it didn't quite have the proper texture of this type of fish.  This I attributed to being well-done but when our bill arrived, the fish that was listed on the bill was halibut.  Hmmm.  In retrospect, the fish tasted somewhat halibut-like and when I questioned the waitress about this, she investigated and returned to tell me that the bill was a mistake, it really was sea bass.  I'm not so sure about that and my Yelp rating reflects that.Anyhow, the highlight of the meal was my glass of Cameron Hughes 2009 Lot #279 Cabernet Sauvignon.  Delicious.  I will have to find that bottle somewhere.
Not a fan. This chain feels like the "Subway" of burrito chains. Very bland and generic compared to Chipotole or some of the other chains. Needs improvement.
2nd time here, 2nd time a disappointment!  I like my steaks medium well and both times I get steaks cooked well done that are like shoe leather.  Really?  A steak joint that doesn't know how to cook steak?  Yep!I also ordered a 16 ounce and think I was short changed a few ounces.Service was good but when I complained about the above and showed the manager the over cooked steak, I am not sure she cared.I won't be back.
We just got back from staying 4 nights at The Flamingo and we were very disappointed!  There were 6 people and all of us have stayed at better hotels in Vegas!  The only good thing about it was the location, being in the middle of the strip was ideal so was having the monorail nearby and also the Fashion Show Mall was in walking distance.  The rooms and bathrooms were ugly, I would never take a bath in the bathtub we got.  The hallways were ugly, may have been just the area we saw but still not impressed.  Our taps both leaked all the time we had to wrap towels around everything!  It was bad.  I will never stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone.  The pool opens to the public so it gets super busy and so I didn't even bother to go.  Next time I may try the Linq which is right beside it.
I have been to Fuchsia four times, all for facial treatments (no massage). The first time was a few years ago, and my treatment was pretty standard. I decided they were too far away from my home and left it at that.But recently I decided to try microdermo and did some research. Not only was Fuchsia's price one of the most reasonable in town, they used the diamond system, so I decided to return.First visit - HEAVY sell on the membership even before my treatment, which I understand and expect but it gets really old. My treatment goes well, although I am a little upset they do zero extractions during a microdermo facial, apparently. Heavy sell again on the membership again when I checkout. I opt to buy a special 3 treatments for $150 card. 15 minutes later I get a phone call asking if I can return to the store. They apparently gave me the wrong card. I tell them I am already two far away. I was slightly shocked they would ask me to return to correct their mistake. Oh well. Second visit - The air conditioner is not working. IN JULY. It's not horrible, but it is unpleasant enough that they opt to keep the door open while I get my treatment, which I find slightly strange and not very relaxing. I wish they had called me and asked to re-schedule. When I check out this time I receive the big sell on products. Again, I expect this, but it's still annoying. The products I am shown are very expensive ($65 mask, for example) and I politely decline. No samples are offered. I leave feeling and looking like I have a sunburn and still look that way the next day. I figure it must be working and this is normal. Third visit - Explain the sunburn feeling from the second visit and am told this is normal because they have "gone up" on my microdermo handle/wand/tool thing. At checkout another sell on the membership because now I am out of treatments on the card I had purchased. I tell them I will think about. I then got a sell on product, but this time they offered samples. I happily take my product sample and the membership brochure and am on my merry way. However, now I am worried that my treatment was either bad the 1st and 3rd time, or bad the 2nd time, because I do not feel or look sunburned. So which time(s) did I get ripped off?The front office ladies (possibly also the owners?) are very friendly and nice and seem to know members names, etc. However, they are always a bit disorganized (making appointments over the phone is always a little taxing) and heavy on sell of memberships, extra treatments, products, sparkly things they sell in the store. And frankly, I don't blame them. They want to make money! Bottom line - I don't think my treatments were consistent and they are too far away from me, so I am not sure I will return. If you are interested in a membership (at least 12 months) and you find a good person there who you can trust, it's probably a great deal. I, however, will probably continue my search.
MUST READ!!! The restuarant is under new ownership!!!! New menu in place. They still serve some dimsum but the other side of the menu is now completely fast food chinese dishes. I was highly disappointed as I don't just eat dimsum alone, I eat it with other favorite authentiic chinese dishes that are no longer available. Not that I don't recommend it but please be aware of this before you walk in.
They only take cash. They do not have a children's size/price. They are expensive. If you do decide to splurge, you may find they are out of the flavor you want but it's too late because you pay first. Yes, it is delicious (although I think their gelato is too sweet), but customer service does not stop there. Oh, and their bathrooms are disgusting.
Four Sons Chevron is the closest gas station / market to me and the only one within about a mile and a half. They are a neighborhood market,  located on the same block as Marley Park and have marketed themselves as such. It is so disappointing that over the 5 or six hundred times I have been inside to purchase something, there is almost always a line of 6 to 8 people. Nor a big deal if there were more then one cashier working, but, if is true that one cashier is behind the counter. I'm not talking about 3 in the morning, I'm talking about 7 or 8 in the morning or at 9 on a Friday night  Its amazing how much traffic this place gets and they skimp on the cashiers. If there is someone else there, they are smoking, in the back doing something or just in the office... no one calls for help. I don't think they pay enough attention to individuals who hang out in the front. I've seen anything from beggars to a person selling watches and others eyeballing cars people just got out of... and they probably think that because it takes so long to buy a candy bar, why not look inside the car, just not a safe place at night after 10 ish. The store is clean, bathrooms are clean and they make sure they keep the shelves full of chips or whatever. Gas prices are always higher then competitors. Speaking of competitors, a QT station, 4 sons is not.
I started taking my pup here for the self wash during the fall/winter months and it was great. The self wash is always clean and easy to use. The water seemed to be at good temperature in the cooler months. But as the summer months rolled around and the temperature outside increased so did their self wash water. I brought my pup here for her routine washing but I noticed that their water was insanely hot, almost scalding that I could barely keep my hand under. My dog was obviously uncomfortable as well. I was told to keep running the water to hopefully cool it. But after about 10 minutes the water did not cool down. One of the workers had told us that the water has been "sitting in the pipes all day." I figured that they did not have  temperature controlled water to ensure your pets safety. I was really disappointed to find this out especially because the staff is so friendly and I honestly love their self wash. Until it is fall/winter again, I will be going to another self wash.
Not impressed.  Waiter kept disappearing, bread was about a week old and eggplant parm was gross.  Manager took it off lithe bill but still we won't be going back.  Manager nice and trying hard but not worth it.  Took 35 minutes to get our check, pay our bill and get the heck  out!   Who has that kind of time?
We came here at 8pm of a Sunday evening.  We've been warned at the reception that they close at 8:30pm.  We said 'Ok' then went in as we can definitely eat for 30 mins.  It's understandable that the kitchen won't be making any fresh food for the buffet 30 mins prior to closing to avoid food wastage.What bothered me most was not the food BUT the service.  Staff at this location seems to be in a hurry to leave by 8:30pm!!!  There was still enough food at the counter (not the sushi rolls counter though) and you will feel as if the staff were trying to hurry you.I've worked in the food industry and when you say that you close at 8:30, it doesn't mean that you stop accepting customers at 8:15 or even at 8:25.  You accommodate those customers as they still bring you income, turning back a party of 6 is a lost income.As for the quality of food, just a mediocre...maybe you should start slashing the price at least 30mins prior to closing to attract more people and avoid food wastage.
Why is this theater so filthy? Dirty! Trash and popcorn all over the floor! CLEAN THIS PLACE!
Ordered Sushi #8 and Sushi Tsuka for two people. Bill came to $50 and change. That would be pricey in a sit down place, but this was takeout from a hole-in-the-wall. The food was fresh and the fish was pretty good, but I can get comparable quality from any number of other places for literally half the price and will do that in future. I won't go back until they lower their prices.
So this show has been running for 28 years and unfortunately it feels like it. The queens I saw tonight, with the exception of the Cher impersonator, looked old and moved like they were lacking energy. Now I love drag queens. Ever since Paris is burning, I've been hooked. I have a healthy respect for queens who have been in the business for a long time. I know it's never too late to teach an old dog be tricks... Also, the show is titled after this famous queen Frank Marino... Where the heck is he? Don't have a self titled show if your not going to show up!!!There was so much potential especially with the music choices. But when the Lady gaga impersonator did just dance, that queen just sat there! The song said "just dance"! You better dance! I was doing more dancing sitting in my seat than the guy did in the whole performance!Now the Brian person who hosted the show was hilarious. Every one of his jokes were funny and delivered perfectly. However he was one of the only highlights of the show.I was disappointed. I'll have to definitely check out somewhere else if I want to so l see drag queens in Vegas.
The server's were all nice and smiley except one who seemed grumpy when we asked for more napkins. Everything we ordered was bland! The complimentary soup was really watered down that no one wanted to finish their bowls. The best dish was probably the garlic veggies.  The crab fried rice was the most disappointing order... The rice was so plain! Even the crab legs/claws had no taste, not even a hint of salt water taste. Would unlikely come back.
Lately I've been going to another place, but decided to give this one a chance again. I ordered a large breve latte with sugar free vanilla. Was about 6 dollars.  Other places give 3 shots of espresso in a large latte, they gave 2. And it tasted like it.  My drink ended up tasting like hot vanilla milk.  Pretty gross.  I think I'll pay the extra 15 cents at another place and get something that tastes good with 3 shots of espresso in it.
Picked up a dim sum takeout order no utensils no napkins. Rating very low. Food just ok.
For nostalgic purposes only. The ice cream and sundaes are weak and it is looking so grungy and run down these days. Get your sweets fix elsewhere.
Well Fridays,  I think we are going to go our separate ways.   Your food was good,  the service used to be good and the beer was cold,  however,  the last 3 visits to different locations have proven that it's not just a location issue it's a company wide issue.  We had horrible service today for a lunch and the fries were nasty.  It took the server over 10 minutes to even take a drink order.  I was seated without a kids menu and when I did get one,  no crayons.  That's not a deal breaker as I carry them with me.   Our food took an ok amount of time and was super hot.   We had the rib special and chicken fingers as well as kids mac n chs.  The fries that both my husband and I had were horrible.   Cold and mushy.  The manager was so busy running food we couldn't flag him down.   Our server never truly stopped at the table she only paused long enough for us to say any thing as she kept try to serve the other table more then us that was right behind us.  I honestly felt like the "red-headed step-child" and was a huge bother to her.  Even trying to pay she never truly stopped at the table just tried to grab and run off until my husband said there was a striped reward written on there    She tried to say she didn't need anything but the phone  number, but my husband was trying to tell her there was a reward to redeem number written too.  I don't think they were under staffed as I saw many employees running around.  It seems as if a company wide training needs to happen since this seemed to be the same situation at all 3 locations.
Went there for 20 bags of mulch to neaten up the landscaping the day before Mother's Day.  Being right before Mother's Day, it was rather busy.  On the way into the store I see an employee and ask where do I go to buy mulch (thinking perhaps they have a cash register outside - they have at times in the past).  He says inside, and then pick it up outside.  So I pay inside and the cash register person flags a guy down and asks him to help me load mulch.  I go outside with my son and tell my son to wait by the guys at the mulch so I can bring the car over.  I drive over, we load up, and go.  All good.  Except, my 14 year old son tells me on the drive home that the guys at the mulch didn't know he was with me while I was driving over.  They were laughing and joking that I was too stupid to know how to buy mulch, dropping the F word about customers in general, etc.   So ok, maybe customers are stupid, but they also never checked my receipt, so perhaps this stupid customer made off with a bunch of free mulch?  That would be stupid too, huh?
I had an ok experience, it was during lunch on the weekend... not a lot of people inside and they had the games on but the TVs were blasting loud... couldnt enjoy conversation. I ordered the french dip, it was very greasy... the au ju appeared to be some form of a gravy. The tots were good.. nice and crunchy and not too salty. Its a ride from my house and not a place I would go out of the way to go to again.
Never again.Yes, I know never is quite a harsh word to use.  What I should probably say is never again on my dime.I got a deal through Vegas.com - I wonder if that is why I got such a horrible room?  The room was two rooms over from the elevators and it sounded like I was on top of them!  I did not even hear that much noise when I was actually in the elevator.  It was so loud, it was hard to fall asleep at night. In addition to the elevator noise, it took about 15 minutes to get some barely warm water out of the shower.  Also, the walls are way tooooo thin.
Stayed here for work reasons and that would be the only reason to choose this place. Like a previous review, I experienced the shower/tub that feels like you might fall down into the room below. I also got the experience of drunk idiots and their drama in the hallway at 12:30am. Some sketchy folks wandering around this place.The staff seems to do their jobs, but don't expect them to go the extra mile for you.The location is convenient for places in Henderson, but this is not located in the best area of Henderson. Lock your vehicle and keep an eye on your belongings.
It might be a bit early to rate this joint as it's still fairly new... BUT, because it's new, I can't say that I had a great first impression.  Thumbs up to the atmosphere and decor - it was refreshing to see a bar in Vegas that didn't look like a typical bar in Vegas.  I enjoyed the live music - definitely a nice touch.. took a peek at the lounge but didn't find it too inviting... As for the food, the appetizer selection was great.. the entrees?  Not so much.  Had one of the "TV" dinners.  Wasn't expecting much so I would say I was indifferent overall.Our server wasn't exactly friendly and didn't appear to know too much about the menu or what beers they had in stock (ordered 3 different beers and they were out).  Growing pains I'm sure... but I think I'll give it a couple months before I give it another go.
We went on Father's Day so the place was really busy but that does not justify the mediocre service and do not order strawberry waffles unless your like strawberry glaze from a can because that is what it is! Ugh! Also be careful with the build your own omelette as it was over $18!!  Granted we ordered egg whites and about 5 other items but geez, shouldn't the initial price include some items other than just the eggs?? We asked for a side of salsa and they server told us they have two types. We decided to try both. We got the bill and we were billed $0.75 for each!!  Our bad as we need to read the menu better as we were nickel and dime to death!! Thanks Brittany.
I am not a fan of the ice creams however this place is tried for my husband based on the reviews here on yelp. Completely agree with the negative reviews for this place. Their cookies are under baked and also their ice cream taste is not up to my expectations .Looks like this place got a hype which made me step in here and May not be a turn back place .
So where do I begin? This place is a little gem however there is room for improvement.The pool tables both hourly and quarters are good. The problem I had was the drinks (not cold enough) and the place was extremely dirty.
I have ordered from this place previously however this time around the experience was not good. I placed an order at 6:30pm and it's now almost 9:30pm and the food has not yet arrived. The delivery guy called me saying he was lost and I gave him directions but still went back to the store because he still couldn't find it. The wait time is awful and the food isn't that great to be waiting 3 hours for delivery.
Once a month I go through this awesome experience: "Let's go to old town"Me: Ahhh fucking Christ [anxiety starts kicking in as I picture crowds of douche bags, annoying people everywhere, struggles with cabs, girls attempting to walk in heels that look like they are fucking handicapped, and a guaranteed $100 if not $200 spend], where are we going?""Let's go to Kelly's"Me: "FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"The only word to describe this bar is: bland.  They have a solid piece of real estate, and a nice little setup, but apart from that this place blows.Drinks? OverpricedService? SlowFood? ShittyCrowds? YESWhy the fuck do people come here?  Kelly's is packed with a bunch of people who don't really know or like each other, people who aren't really good friends.  Friends have stuff in common, so they can agree on a certain bar. No one wants to go to Kelly's, it's just the only place left to go when you and a group of 8 idiots can't agree on a place.  Don't believe me? Read all the reviews on here and see how many of them say: "Me and 26 of my *closest* friends decided to meet here" or something to that effect.Newsflash: You shouldn't be in a fucking group that big, that's why this place is packed.  Girls night groups of 10 wander around waiting to get molested while even more single dudes pretending to be respectable huddle around with their dicks in their hands.Go here on a Sunday afternoon. I've done it, and it was decent. You'll have the place to yourself and everything I've said above won't really apply, except for this shit prices of course.However, if it's a weekend (let's face it: it is) you'll get more bang for your buck standing in line at a port-a-potty than standing in a line to get into this joke.
I was a 1-2x per week regular for almost 3 years. Until today. I called my order in like any other day. I'm told 20-25 minutes and my order will be done. Cool. I arrive exactly 20 mins later and pay. I'm told 10 more minutes, due to there only being 2 sushi chefs on staff tonight. Meh, ok fine. 15 mins go by and nothing. I ask the ETA and am told "a couple more minutes." After 5 minutes i see my order getting bagged up...but no...one of the rolls is missing. 10 minutes later i stand up and go to the counter. "Mom" as the staff calls her goes to the chefs to inquire about my missing roll. 5 minutes later it still isnt out. I ask for a discount on the order due to the time. Short staffed? Ok, but don't tell me my order will be done in 20-25 minutes and almost an hour later it still isn't done. Three tables worth of people walked in, sat doen and got their food. I ordered my food to go 20 minutes before I even got there and this happened? Mind you, i come to this place so often that the veteran staff knows my order just by my voice. "Mom" gave me $4 for the inconvenience, but I am so disappointed. Food is good. Prices are ok and the wait staff is hit and miss. If you go and get CeCe as your waitress, tip her well. She bends over backwards for her customers. Anyone else is a box of rocks. And apparently being a regular doesnt mean much.
Drove past this place the other night and made a note to stop by and check it out. Well tonight's the night. I must say that it's a modest, nicely laid out location with a small but good selection. That's about where the fun ends though. It hasn't been often that I've walked into a cigar shop (almost anywhere for that matter) where I haven't felt welcomed, but I have to say, this is one of those shops. I'm not sure if it's because of the great time I just had at Majerle's or if I was interrupting the game (which I came in to watch) but I simply "wasn't feeling the love."I smoked an Arturo Fuente Hemmingway which was perfectly moist and relaxed with my iPad for most of my visit. The clerk (proprieter?) literally said three words to me the whole time "cigar?," "$9.99" and "Thanks."  No offers of joining the rest of the guys, where you from?, what do you like to smoke?, not even "Do you want to smoke here? Need matches, etc" Although the guy after me at least got the last question. All in all, a pretty disappointing visit. Selection was ok, but I can find that anywhere along with a bit of camaraderie. Therefore I'll take my business and friends elsewhere next time. If you decide to check it out, I hope you have a more enjoyable time.
Used to come here a lot when I first moved to Vegas. Coming from LA, I had a lot to learn about Vegas nail shops. Biggest issue is they won't do two things at once. I want to get in and get out. One day I was there really early, got my pedicure started while the nail techs just sat. By the time my pedicure was done the nail techs were busy and I had to wait. Good service would have been for one of those nail techs sitting on their phone to start my nails so I could finish faster. Another time I bought my daughter and boyfriend to experience a pedicure, the wait was long and it took hours to do all three. Went again for my birthday nails and pedicure, thought I had planned enough time, nope still took longer than expected. So, I just stopped going there completely. The work is just ok but way too slow and nothing special.
Unfortunately this was a let down. Food was Sub par. Footlong grilled cheese sounded great but no baguette so they just served us a kids grilled cheese. The waffled cáptese - waffle machine was broken so they served a basic tomato grilled cheese. Burger was decent. Wings were good and I really liked their traditional wing sauce. Main reason for going was the beers. They weren't bad but nothing special. Just barely average. The Duke of Dank was good. Amber & wheat just okay. They were very bland versions. (See my ratings on Untappd). Service was good but would have helped if the server knew about the problems when we ordered.
Kristina did message me and apologize and stated that she was not the manager on duty that night and will look into the issue more.
Looks like I will add to the horrible reviews for this place.  The staff and practice as a whole is unacceptably slow.  They called my wife over an hour before her appointment regarding insurance approval.  She have then the approval number again since the approval person failed to do their job correctly the business day before.  Instead of doing their last minute call to the insurance company since my wife assured then we would be there early for her appointment, they did not call until well after we arrived.  We arrived almost 30 minutes before the scheduled appointment time.  After waiting 30 minutes after the scheduled time, we are informed that part of the delay is because of them verifying with the insurance on the phone.  We have been to 3 different companies for imaging in the last few months.  Simon Med is the only one that is not only late but continuously make their patients wait in a full waiting room.  When is corporate going to actually read these reviews and realize they need to evaluate their processes.  Some high notes(only reason they get two stars)1.) The front staff seemed professional.  They were not rude.2.) The music!  They play instrumental versions of Top40 hits.  I guess the popular music in a calming tone helps sedate people while their time is being wasted by poor management.
I made it a point to stop here based on the many glowing reviews. Perhaps my expectations were too high as a result but I found this place utterly uninspired. The various meats were all drowning in chafing dishes and once strained were flavourless and dry. We had the Barbacoa, Pulled Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Tinga and the other chicken, the name of which escapes me now. With the exception of the Chorizo they were all bland. I'm a big fan of these hip reinventions of various cultural foods, but the style here seems to be trumping the substance. Dry meat, bland flavours. Grossly overrated.
This place was cute. The inside was adorable and would be perfect for a cute girls brunch. The crêpes were good and beautiful. The portions were great. I got two minis and was more than satisfied. I was so excited to try this place and low and behold they were out of coffee!! I have no clue how this happens at a primarily breakfast spot. I was not impressed with the customer service. The lady at the register, young gal was not very friendly or welcoming. In fact there was an Uber eats guy picking up a to-go order and both young girls working the front didn't treat him very nicely. It would be great for them to understand that most people don't dine at a crêpe spot so explaining the menu a tad or showing any kind of crêpe passion would have made our experience more fun and enjoyable. Customer service is EVERYTHING in places like these. I mean if you are out of coffee and can't do coffee for us...tell us what you CAN do for us. Customer after customer came in wanting coffee and they didn't so much as offer to comp the espressos as most people want coffee when they come dine on a Saturday morning. That's the best part. Anyways, good food. Call first to make sure they have coffee and don't expect the young gals working here to be anywhere as sweet as the crêpes.
This place changed hands, and my son was so upset at the changes he cried. They took down all the superhero decor, removed the bouncy ball machine that my kids loved, and no longer allow the kids to make their own pizzas. They also dont have the coloring contest anymore and they changed the way the cheesesteaks were made, which was a big reason to come here. These were all the things we loved about this place - POOF - gone. I was super sad about all of this. My best wishes to the old owners, wherever you are. My best wishes to the new owners too, cuz this was one longtime customer who probably wont be back. Moral: if you buy a place and take over, dont make too many changes. You'll lose your customer base.
This place sucks. I was charged $9.50 for a bowl of mixed veg rice and $9 for 10 small soy nuggets? That is stupid. Then they wouldnt let us sit to eat because it was almost closing 9pm yet there were two families enjoying their meal at the table slowly, and they continued to bring them food? The tea is expensive about $5 a cup, on each table there are electric heat pads for your tea. Tea is obviously important here. Then I was ripped off by paying U.S Dollar and it took 3 people to figure out my bill. This place sucks.
My husband went there last night to buy me a birthday cake.  He showed up just before closing time because it was a work day and he was coming home from work.  He told me he wouldn't got back, he felt rushed and treated poorly when he was asking questions about the cake he wanted.  He asked if they had individual candles and was told no, (but they sell individual candles with the cake pops.) Also, the employee wouldn't write happy birthday or anything on the cake because of the scalloped icing.  I called today and spoke with Lisa who identified herself to me as the owner.  I can see why her employee behaves the way they did towards my husband.  Lisa did not identify herself to me when she answered the phone.  I had to ask for her name after she said she was the owner.  I told her that my husband received poor service last night.  Lisa did apologize and tell me that was sorry he felt rushed.  But the rest of the conversation was short and came off as very non caring.  I can't say we'll go back to this shop.  AJ's down the street on Camelback has the same products, accommodates requests like writing on the cakes, (they will pace a ribbon over the cake so a name or saying can be written on it if the cake itself won't allow for that.)  And with much friendlier customer service too.
with that pricw.  the foos is horrible.  i ordered a sushi platter.and the taste is soso,the eel sushi is highly fishy
Opulent by all means! Don't seat at the bar. Rude bartender! Seriously, I feel that people that work in bars and restaurants in Vegas, hate their job or tourists.
First of all let me start with the positive. The PT specialists are wonderful. They got me up after a total knee replacement and taught me how to walk again. They were encouraging without be pushy.  Now the bad. The doctor I had was called Dr. D. He was more worried about the pain meds than the patient. I was in a lot of pain and he kept decreasing my pain meds after a total knee replacement. I heard that he was retiring but I would definitely talk to the doctor there before I decide to go there. Now I'm home and my surgeon is giving me the right pain medication to help me continue with my rehab.
This place is crammed with people, and really really bad drivers as well. I just witnessed a hit and run in the parking lot this past Saturday afternoon and that woman just dashed away so quickly. After seeing that, I am very afraid of parking there anymore.And if you are the owner of that poor Odyssey, you might be able to get some info from the surveillance cameras around the Wal-Mart, Best-buy or Petsmart area.
El lugar es un ambiente mas bien para los hombres no es para estar con la familia. La comida si estaba buena pero no para regresar y comer aquí. La mesera se tardo mucho para atendernos y para darme el recibo. No es un lugar donde seguiré llendo.
First off, let me say I believe Five Guys has ruined me for any other burger place.I didn't like Char-Grill, I felt the burger was dry, even after I had chili put on mine and the fries were just ok.  I think I could have got the same thing at a fast food place for .99 cents.  I probably won't go back, unless someone else suggests it... maybe.
Over priced and under delivers!- A 12 inch pizza was likely only 10 inch.- It barely fed the two of us.- Tasted okay (definitely nothing to brag about)- At $25, this was definitely not worth the price!- Won't be ordering from there again.
Growing up in California, my family has spoiled me with only the best of Chinese food. I am a little reluctant to search for a good Chinese food restaurant here in Arizona, but I couldn't resist the 30% grand opening deal on dishes I haven't had in a while and crave.Since it was opening week, the place was packed full and service was in disarray.  The decor was interesting....it was an attempt to turn an open food court into a fancy Chinese restaurant - chandeliers and all. Tacky, but honestly, I think it's amusing and gives it character. However, the location is very loud because it is after all an open food court. The table arrangements are also a little bit too crowded and I found myself almost back to back with the table next to me.Food was decent and good price with the 30% off. I had the cold salt and garlic chicken, squid with black bean sauce, and the seafood tofu hot pot.  The hot pot was a little bland. It was nice to see them use fresh chicken, rather than packaged. Overall, it tasted decent. Nothing stood out, and nothing was terrible. It was nice to have a little taste of what I miss back in California, but I probably won't be returning here.
It puts a bad taste in my mouth when the servers are more concerned about the other guest just because they are the same ethnicity..my first couple experiences of this place were great now I don't know if ill come back
In town for business and excited to try out tako based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the service or lack thereof, soured our party on everything. First of all when we inquired about a table, we were told there was nothing available for the rest of the night inside. Not a big deal, we put our name in the waitlist for outside. Once seated, we waited for several minutes before a server came to take our order. Once we placed our orders, it was easily 20 minutes before our drinks arrived. Our drinks were simple, a house margarita and a can of ginger ale. This seemed like a long time to wait for such a simple order.We had also placed our dinner order and when we ordered our drinks. Our server never came back to check on us or to even advise us if our food was near to being ready. We're were a party of four and We each ordered tacos. At the 40 minute mark, still no entrees in sight it began to pour down rain. First of all, a 40 minute wait for tacos is ludicrous. Running from the rain, We brought our drinks inside and miraculously there were tables available, when we had been told earlier that the inside was booked for the entire evening.Our food showed up immediately, as we were seated upstairs. One of my colleagues posted a review in yelp as we were sitting down with our food, regarding the lackluster service. within minutes of it being posted, the manager came to our table to make sure that everything was okay. If our server had just been even half as quick to check in with us even once, maybe our reviews would've been much more positive. At that point, we were just happy to have our food after such a long wait. The true kicker though was the manager catching one of my colleagues on the way out. He told my colleague that her friend's review upset him.  What???? Many restaurants will offer some sort of compensation for such a bad experience. Maybe a free round of drinks or a coupon for a return visit. Nothing of the sort was offered. We were the ones that should've been and were upset. To be honest, my review on the service alone would be one star. I'm just bumping to two stars because the al pastor tacos were some of the best I've had.
Got me again flamingo!!!! Enticed by free room. Not worth it rather pay for better service. I've stayed at flamingo several times in the past as I am platinum total rewards member and often get deals. Last time I said I wouldn't go back but decided to try since I actually like the casino (the dealers are friendly and generally have a great vibe-Still believe that very happy with Blackjack experience).  My problems were with the hotel reception (supposedly vip status remember) and their willingness to help. Two stars are all to even out great casino experience with awful hotel experience. 1. Service is everything. I can deal with anything else if treated with respect, courtesy and feel they are trying to help. Three different people at guest services were unhelpful. 2 in special vip check in one at the desk. We were in vegas for 42 hours total and spent 5 hours fighting with flamingo...stupid. Check in vip room went well the first day. Next day got call that credit card wasn't working. Called cc company indeed it was shut off for fraudulent activity (not our fault). We called desk and then went back to vip room explained issue gave new credit card. They turned our keys back on. Ok all is well (we thought!) left for the day for other TR properties. Got over to Paris wanted to charge lunch to our room said we aren't authorized (2 hours after giving new credit card) embarrassing and annoying but ok. We want to charge to room as it's easier and we can use accrued TR points to pay at end do they screwed us. Called flamingo because we didn't want to walk all the way back, were waiting to see live band at Paris. after being on hold 30 minutes told they can't help great thanks. Spent night at Paris once again can't charge dinner or drinks to room so irritated. Walk back to flamingo play blackjack until dead tired and we have early flight Sunday so head up to bed. 20 minutes for elevator get to room both husband and my room key doesn't work. They shut it off again. Storm down to desk really mad and tired now. Again here less than two days don't need to waste time dealing with crap. Desk person no help at all no explanation no apologies for cutting off our charging privileges or room key. Hey thanks! Great customer service smh. Next day went to vip room when they opened explained everything. Got no apology, explanation, or any kind of compensation for trouble. Sarcastically told to talk casino host Knowing we had to leave for airport. Thanks again. Left to never return. So much for being loyal TR guests of 20 years. No different than anyone else. Loyalty doesn't matter. 2. Booked non smoking room, smelled of smoke and had to place towels under doors to keep smoke out of our room all night. Reported to front desk with no apology or help. Seemed to not care. I cared it kept me up all night coughing, I understand that smoking occurs in casino and I choose tables wisely next door with no one smoking but in my room I expect clean air. 3. Room tired dated scarce offerings. No coffee, refrigerator, lame toiletries, linoleum floor, worn out bathroom but good enough I guess to sleep especially if you're ten kids piled up as this hotel attracts. Go rooms much much better than the one we got don't even know what it's called but king standard I guess in heritage tower. These rooms are very basic and hallways and elevators old and nasty. View of roller not bad but the rest lame. I advise looking elsewhere if you value customer service.
Just got back from Vegas...what an awesome fun time! Too bad I can't say the same for the customer service at the Flamingo Hotel on the strip! Let me first say during my experience with the front desk personnel I was completely sober...they just lack in tact and professionalism! People send a lot of money to enjoy their stay in Vegas and because of this they should get the professional help that they deserve! Won't be staying their again! I recommend the Luxor...that was a better experience!
Just got back from dinner at Johnny's.  Used to like this place but what Italian restaurant has no pasta on menu for New Years Eve.  When I called for reservation they said they would have some regular items on menu but they just had a pre fixed menu for the night.  Filet was undercooked (raw) had to send back.  Food was  not up to par and  very overpriced for what you got.  They should have stuck to their original menu.  Used to be my go to while in Cleveland but not any more.
Le seul point positif est que ce bistro est accessible sans sortir dehors. Sinon la bouffe est très très moyenne.  Je ne crois pas y retourner à moins d'une méga tempête de neige.
I visited this bar come-music -come games venue around a month ago. First off, the huge, warehouse feel to the front section with randomly scattered tables and chairs didn't feel a cosy or nice place to sit down for a meal...and then when I looked at the meal prices, my mind was made up  - so expensive!The high cost continued with the whiskey I ordered: came to nearly $9 for a regular brand - and only 1oz too! Not cool in my books.Service was fine - although it was pretty empty when we went. The rear of the premises is set out for live music...it actually looks very nice! I haven't seen a band there, so I don't know about cover charges or sound quality..but I may venture back if i see a decent band listed there.Overall, a pretty average place with above average prices.
OK, so the entrees were decent but nothing to rave about. I feel sure we could have found better Italian elsewhere. As far as the baked goods...don't bother. Especially if you are there in the evening. One of the staff members told me by the end of the day everything " has kinda dried out."  She wasn't kidding. My advice, just keep walking, many other better choices available.
Walked in yesterday with my niece and nephew to have our nails done before we had lunch to kill some time. My sister and brother in law have had pedicures done here and loved them so that's why we chose it, and it so close to their house. It's a fairly large salon and looked clean and decorated nicely. Everyone at the desk seemed really welcoming and nice so I was thinking ok great! Well first off, there are no prices listed anywhere, and when I asked for a price list the girl at the desk said "What are you looking to get?" I said gel manicures and she popped off with $40! Uhhh I'm from LA and have heard between $25-$30 for a gel mani...never $40.00, that's a little outlandish for a manicure. So we stuck with regular manicures ($15.00- typically I pay $12.00 or so) and a kids pedicure. While I was waiting, I tried to look online for their price list and still couldn't find manicure prices. I did see on yelp that they offered complimentary wine and beverages but I was never offered anything as I sat and waited to be taken back to the manicure area.They took my niece first and the man doing her nails was on his cell phone for most of her manicure. When she was finished I asked her how it was and she told me her fingers were bleeding because he cut her cuticles too short... Well yeah he was on the freakin phone and not paying attention!! Which also explains why there was polish all over her skin too.My nephew gets taken back for his kids pedicure and after about 25-30 minutes he texts me asking if he's done. He said he woman doing his feet just walked away without saying anything and left him sitting there. He also said she spilled water all over his shoes because she let the tub overflow. Great way to treat a kid lady! My niece went back to go get him and bring him up to the front to wait for me.I had Amy, and she seemed really nice and meticulous at first. Then it came to the hand massage. Well she massaged my right hand nicely for a good 5 minutes and it  felt great....then it came to my left hand. That hand got about 1 minute of attention and had a ton of left over lotion left on it so she instructed me to walk across the room to wash my hands. After my nails were painted I noticed all of my nails were still really rough and not filed completely. She too just got up and walked away without saying anything. No "thank you", no "ok you're done" just got up and walked away. They have signs all over saying things like "relaxation and rejuvenation"... didn't really feel that with the owner barking orders at the 2 girls at the front.I most definitely will not be back, mostly because I don't live in Vegas but even when I am for visits I will try my hand somewhere else. As for my sister and brother in law, they too will be finding another place to go for their pedicures.
Inferior walnut cakes.  Tasteless chocolate chip cookies.  Will not return.  I would probably think the walnut cakes were ok if I'd never been to Hodo Kwaja but ... I have.  The custard filling was lacking in quantity - and it didn't taste that good anyways.  Prices a bit more expensive than Hodo Kwaja.  I'll allow that I got these 4 hours or so after baking but I don't think I'll bother giving a re-try - the smallest amount you can buy is 10 which is more than I'd like to make available to myself to eat.The chocolate chip cookies weren't good.  That's really all I can say about them.  Good amount for $5.  Maybe that's why quality was not so great.
Service is so slow. Took forever for us to get our drinks.... and it wasn't even that busy . Atmosphere is okay. Washrooms looked clean. Never got any food because of the bad start.
I don't live in CLE, but went there for an event and while I was there, decided to check out the mall (I had never heard anything about it until today so I had no previous expectations) When i first walked in i was impressed with the look of it. It really looked pretty. Once I started walking around, though, I was disappointed. As far as I noticed, there were only two clothing stores in the entire 3-Floor mall. Rainbow and VS, and rainbow looked dirty and dingy and I didn't even consider buying anything there. The only other decent, chain stores they had was foot locker, champs, and bath and body works/white barn, and journeyz (notice how most of these are shoe stores). There were no other stores that interested me. I didn't buy a single thing. The mall that I'm used to going to (Belden Villiage) while much smaller in size I think, has a much better store selection and coming to Tower City really made me appreciate my mall much more than I did before. I left with a question in mind. How do you have a whole mall and no clothing stores? I feel like that's an important thing.
Three strikes you're out: I gave this place three chances and all three times I had the same 3 sub-par experiences. Food is just okay, food is over-priced, and service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was brand new, so I tried again. Second experience, still fairly new but super busy, so I thought one more time.... but this time there was no excuse, particularly for the lack of enthusiasm by the wait staff. This is beer food at champagne prices.
This hotel was ok. It was good value for being in Vegas especially located in the middle of the strip.  The room was not too good.  The beds didn't even come with comforters and at the end of the bed was a rug like thing that was pink.  The bathroom was alright the shower had a little rust in it and there was a soap under the sink and the maids never picked it up while I was there which was disgusting.  The casino part of the hotel was pretty good when you have a low budget where table games start at 5 dollars and blackjack is 10.  You will get some good benefits if you have a platinum total rewards card or higher which can jump the buffet line or get discounts off of the hotel store. Overall this hotel is below average. I probably won't be staying here next time.
I give a 2 star for the food. For the location, I would give a 1.This is NOT a restaurant. DO NOT go here with family or think that you would get service and a table. This is in the food court of a small shopping center and it's like a hole in the wall. The food here is oily and ok but nothing special. Meh!
First off, long wait for a table even though there were many empty. They said they had reservations for them but they were never filled the whole time we were there. Atmosphere what fun though, and George had a great personality. They get the whole restaurant(not a huge dining room, very intimate) involved when yelling opa or singing happy birthday. The food is, well some was good, some was bad. The dolmas were amazing, and spanakopita was baked nicely and tasty. The gyro meat was quite flavorful but the onions they put on it was chopped horrible and fell right out. The mousaka and pasteesto were very overcooked and just mush, no texture at all. The vegetables were unseasoned and overcooked as well. Received the snapper in clam sauce and although the flavor was spot on, my dish was microwaved, or as it seemed. The fish had great flavor but again was mush, and came out so hot that you know it didn't come out of a Sauté pan. Our tab was eighty dollars without any alcohol and the dishes were subpar. For that price I expected properly cooked food, on clean plates. Not microwaved fish and dirty rims. I would like to say I would come back and give another try, but we drove out to this side of town just to try it and can't envision myself doing that again. Maybe if I'm in the area. Great service, cute restaurant, disappointing entrees with a hefty price tag.
I live here in Las Vegas.  I stayed at Trump last weekend for a Staycation.  I usually stay at a casino based hotel but I decided to try Trump because I have stayed at his properties in NYC and Chicago, both amazing.  Sadly my stay was ruined by the train the runs by a block away every 45 minutes to an hour all night and day.  I was on the 41st floor and it sounded like the train was in my bed.  It blows it's horn 4-5 times every time it passes.  In the morning I complained to management and she said they don't always experience the train all night.  I live here.. The train passes all night.  She offered to refund my resort fee and a %25 discount.  She acted like it was my  fault the train passes.  She said they were working with the county concerning the train.  There is a railroad crossing on the west side.  The train has to blow it's horn unless they close the pass.  Good luck.  Never imagined Trump would build a hotel next to a train.
Service was poor, food wasn't great. I would much rather go to Texas roadhouse for nearly that same price. Won't be going back.
The average wait times here are just laughable. I've never once been "in and out" and on average spent 45 minutes just waiting for my daughter to be seen. This is after I was informed on our 1st visit that if we were more than 15 minutes late our appointment would be cancelled. Our first visit should have been our first clue when we were there an hour and a half before the doctor even came in. I absolutely love Candace but I can't justify waiting like that. I've tried 3 times now to make our next appointment for a day when both daddy and I could be there with no luck. After asking the scheduler if we were going to be forced to wait again if I took the only appointment they had available over 2 weeks out, she got extremely rude with me. I'm sorry but that is unacceptable. We have received a referral for another pediatrician and was able to get an appointment for the exact day we wanted AND the woman was actually friendly. This is how it should be!
Pretty disappointed with our experience here given that most of the other reviews for this place are so great. The food was okay. It was edible but very lacklustre. I got the pork belly plate, it looked good, but everything except the coleslaw and pineapple salsa was a bit bland. It was like the fattiest piece of thing I've ever been served at a restaurant, and that's fine but it really was really lacking in taste. The super duper small fibres of meat that I did get at the bottom of the pork belly were really tasty though. One of my friends liked his sandwich, but everyone else at the table felt like their food was just 'meh'.We felt like we weren't really welcome there. We wanted to get drinks but the server wouldn't even wait for us to finish talking before he left. This happened multiple times. He was super impatient with us and the girl behind the counter was friendly to other patrons but she pretty much rushed us out of the restaurant after we finished eating.
Service was so slow- actually nonexistent! Had to show menu to server to get everything that was supposed to come with my meal.  Place was empty- but Took an hour for greasy egg whites and lukewarm coffee??  Seriously??
In 1980 this place was outdated. And nobody's changed anything since. The food was totally bland, took forever to get to us, and my hamburger bun was dripping of grease, as if it had been floating in it all day. I was totally displeased with this place. The only reason this review isn't one star is because I didn't see any roaches.
We gave it a shot be side it was the new guy on the block. The food was OK, just warm out of the kitchen. The service was friendly but not attentive. I think we will be sticking to our old standby in the next plaza south.
5 stars for the food! 1 star for the service. We came here on a Tuesday night for a birthday party. We waited an hour and a half to be seated (a bit long but acceptable considering there were 10 of us) only to end up at three different booths that weren't even in the same section. This place has good food but it's not worth the hassle and wait you have to go through. We will order take out but we wont dine in anymore...
Nothing special here. Some lights, a DJ, a small dance area, mediocre drinks, decently priced for a place in the Mandalay Bay, and lots of sitting room.  Convenient for those staying at the Mandalay Bay or The Hotel and not too crowded (no cover, open seats available) but almost too loud for talking with friends.
We've been here several times and we were disappointed this week. Our heirloom tomatoes are soft and near rotten. The grouper had an ammonia taste to it. My grilled salmon was very bland. The best item was the dessert butter cake and whip cream. To summarize, disappointed and expensive.
Came in for a drink at the bar and decided to have dinner. Their female bartenders played on their phones and ate behind the bar while we sought out male bartenders to bring us drinks. Food was subpar - disappointing.
Not so good, but I do like to get a slice or two after shows at the Grog Shop. Convenience is its best quality. Don't order online as they didn't start making either of my orders the times I did so until I got there 30 minutes later.
I recently had my seats shampooed to get a suitcase wheel mark off the back seat. I was quoted a 1-hour wait time since I was one of the first customers of the day. After 2 hours I walked into the garage to find out what was taking so long and I was told it would be another half hour. Once completed and everything dried I discover my dashboard, center console an all 4 doors to be cover in shampoo spots. On the passenger side of the console it looked as if the shampoo was dumped on and left to run down into the mat. It took me an additional half hour of cleaning to get the shampoo out...after the $58. The partial upside was that they got the marks out of the seat. However, they couldn't get out the spot from when I had set my bike tire on the seat.The car wash was good, but they always do a pretty terrible job wiping the inside of the windows and I always have to redo them once I'm home.I then got gas and used my fabulous Freddy's card, but what do you know!..it didn't work and I didn't get the $0.20/gallon off the price. The attendant did make a note on my receipt and told me I could bring it to the counter for my next fill up to get the discount.I'll be taking my car to Terrible's from now because it's much cheaper and I always have to re-clean my own windows anyway.
Walk in pedicure. Took over an hour and a half and hardly any callous buffing, no foot or leg massage. Techs were friendly enough, but unprofessional and seemed very inexperienced. Lots of confusion with phone calls, billing, walk ins and scheduled appointments. Would not return for any reason.
The DQ located on 2654 Horizon Ridge Pkwy, Henderson, NV I am not happy the way every time I have to call up for an issue that when I get a call they say someone will get back to me and here it's been from weeks to months I don't hear from anyone anymore. I know that location has closed now and has moved to new location a lot closer to me but that doesn't give them excuse to not call and apologize to me for what happened there in the summer of Jul 2017. Earlier, I came twice with my coupon for a smoothie and their machine would not be operating then they would overcharge me few cents using a card. What would be the reason at the time to send coupons in the mail if that DQ was not fully functional in the first place?
We were encouraged by the crowd, but unfortunately it was disappointing.  We were seated promptly enough, but waited five minutes for someone to realize we had no coffee or  water. We immediately placed our order while we had the waitresses' attention.  It was 25 minutes later that we were served a cold waffle and "heat lamp" bacon.  My Husband's meal was warm so that's why I gave two stars rather than one.  With the food's flavor being nothing special and the service being average, we won't be back.
This Vons is a stark contrast to the windmill location I used to shop at. It seems to be severely understaffed. The shelf layout is fairly incomprehensible. Many products are near the end of their shelf life, and the feminine hygiene aisle has a gate on it for some reason. The store is open 24 hrs and they have only the manager at the cash register to serve a very long line from 10 pm to midnight. The grocery bagger/ cart wrangler does triple duty, having to unlock and carry liquor to the register. I have to say James the manager and his compadre were troopers, they were very nice, funny, and worked well under pressure. The lady working the slot machines was not awesome and just pointed at the register and said "ih!" when I asked who could unlock the booze. I think I will take James's advice to NOT come in between the hours of 10-12... I probably will not come back at all. I'd guess that, unfortunately, most of the issues here are probably due to a crappy regular clientele. Oh well, I now have what I came for- my very own bottle of locally crafted vodka for zombie brain Jell-O shots, and a box of crackers.
Usually this is great. Recently I have been standing at a stop, and the asshole driving honks and points back to the last stop, as if the Orbit schedule I am standing at does not indicate I am at a stop. This getting to be bullshit. For info purposes, I was passed up by a Mars, this time.
I'll try the place again because it seems to have potential and the ramen broth was good flavor (although the noodles were a little overdone).  Lasagna was not good at all- watery, no tomato flavor) and served with 2 small slices of focaccia bread that wasn't really any good either.  The server was nice but overall I'd give service a 3... We are used to being greeted like family and treated so great at other places we frequent downtown. And it is HOT inside- we were sweating throughout the meal they need to do something to ventilate better
My expectations were high after reading about awards it's received.  Over-hyped should be their next.  Liked:  cool & swanky decor - drinks - short rib "cali-belgique" Where things fell short:* The fried brussel sprouts should be renamed "charred" brussel sprouts.  I was debating between the brussel sprouts & the cauliflower.  My waiter pumped up the brussel sprouts and made them sound like heaven.  Then they came served black & crispy.  :-(* The scallop diver surf & turf...where's the turf?  For real.  Don't advertise turf and serve flakes of corned beef with a $35 price tag for 3 scallops.  I better be wowed and just wasn't.
I feel bad leaving a "meh, I've experienced better" review for Muramoto. But, I have definitely experienced better.  *At* Muramoto!  (Both locations.)  Posting this review in the hopes it helps them up their game a little.We stopped by for lunch around 11:45 on a Sunday and it was nowhere near as busy as I usually see it.  Were seated right away (also unusual -- I've usually experienced at least a few minutes' wait).  I thought, "This is great!  We'll be in and out and on our way in plenty of time to catch a movie!"  Maybe I jinxed us.We got waters and menus right away, but that was where the good service ended.  A server never appeared.  We didn't actually notice for quite awhile because we were having a fun time talking amongst ourselves, but one of us looked at our watch and realized we'd been there 25 minutes with no service after the waters we grew a little concerned.  Just as we were starting to realize we'd been there such a long time, we overheard the table to one side of us was complaining that they hadn't been served what they ordered.  The table on the other side was having a conversation about how long it'd been since they'd last seen their server...Given that we had other plans for the day, we made a collective decision to just get up and leave!  Which I have never, ever done before.  I was pretty disappointed because I love their food.  But given it wasn't clear if/when we'd receive any (or, based on the neighboring table's experience, that we'd actually get what we'd ordered?) we gave up on lunch there and just went and got sandwiches.  Meh indeed!
I am not a fan of the ordering method here as I prefer the paper pencil experience. I visited solo during the lunch rush and probably won't go back again. The service was fine but the food itself was not right. I ordered salmon sushi, kamikaze roll, rainbow roll, salmon avocado handroll and a yam tempura handroll. Postive: - the rolls I ordered came in a set of four so I wasn't comatose after - the items came out promptly with very little wait time in between (good for solo diners)- complimentary green teaNegative:- too much rice in the kamikaze roll- not as fresh tasting as other AYCE's- low sodium soya sauce tasted like regular soya- tempura sweet potato was cold (see below)Just as I finished eating, I noticed the restaurant had vacated and I was the only patron inside. I thought I'd order something hot since I wasn't quite full so I asked for a tempura sweet potato handroll. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the friers (or so I thought) click on. Out comes my handroll in record speed. I guess they anticipated more sweet potato eaters during their rush and made too much. Low and behold, my handroll came out cold and saugy-like, not crispy, hot and yummy. I was super disappointed since I was the ONLY person there and they had no other focus to pay attention to but me. Wrongo. I won't return simply because the food didn't taste amazing, really good, or good for that matter. It was just 'meh'. I'll go try elsewhere next time. Two stars because the service was good. Food gets 1/5 stars.
I had said I wasn't going to go back here but someone gave me a gift certificate for a mani pedi. I loved my pedi even though I know it won't last long from past experiences. For my mani I decided to upgrade to their SNS, which is supposed to be healthier alternative to acrylic. It has potential to be good but the lady did such a rush job and was so distracted the whole time. She glued my finger to my nail, filed down the top of my finger, ripped up one of my cuticles, didn't even clean up most of my cuticles, didn't clean up the nails after and didn't even give me a hand massage. I still tipped her because I'm not an animal! But for reals if someone is paying for an expensive service I expect the person to give me VIP treatment, instead I felt like she couldn't get me out of there fast enough.
Nothing special at this place. The food is just Ok, and its not middle eastern food, its some indian mixed place.
Creepy little bar.  Dim lighting. Old.  Creepier bathroom.  My group of 6 walked in because of the good reviews on yelp.  The waitress ignored us.  We were the only ones in the place.  Finally we asked if they served lunch and she seemed really annoyed that she had to give us menus.  She warmed up to us after she brought the menus though.  It was super awkward.  She made all the food herself.  The food was good, however I won't be back.  Not my cup of tea.
Where is the good old Cantina 1511?! Bad location! Slow service, bad ambience.. Few years ago it was my favorite Mexican restaurant, not anymore!
I was staying at the Hilton, and didn't want to go out in the heat, so I decided to have a Scotch and eat at the bar. I had the chicken Marsala. I never order this dish, but my wife does and it's usually delicious. Not so for Nook Kitchen. The sauce was too strong. The chicken was tough. The Glenfiddich at the bar was superb, though.
The system here seems a little askew. Numerous cars came after mine were cleaned and finished before mine. I purchased the ultimate wash and waited a full hour for my car to be completed. Overall a decently clean car was the outcome. I will give a second chance another time in the future
I was sincerely hoping for something super tasty at this spot near my new home, but was a bit disappointed.  I would say it's somewhere between 2 and 3 stars.  Yes, the veggies are fresh and there are lots of them-spinach, red and green peppers, jalapenos, cukes.  However the olives are canned.  I had the chicken souvlaki with veggies and let's just say, it's not Chipotle.  And there was very little chicken-I felt like I was on an expedition.  The place was clean and at about 6PM there were only a couple of people in there.  Also, the folks who wait on you are just as friendly as you would hope.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to get a pita here which is more like a smallish burrito.  And yes, it's inexpensive, however for almost the same $ you get more and tastier at someplace like Chipotle.  However I might go back and try something else.
Yesterday was National Hamburger day, so it was my patriotic duty to partake in this directive. I was greeted by a smiling hostess and proceeded to the bar where an NBA playoff games was playing on the flat screen TV. I made it in time for happy hour but no hamburgers other  than sliders were on the menu. The Hawaiian is what I wanted and at around $9.00 I was ok since it came with Onion Rings. Order arrived with 4 yes 4 onion rings. I asked the bar tender/ waitress if this was it, and she assured me it was. She did offer me another side but I said no. Disappointed with the onion rings, I cut my hamburger in 1/2 and proceeded to eat. Frankly it was boring, slice of pineapple a bit of Teriyaki and 3/8" slice of onion on a bun that was as boring as the hamburger. Waitress brought me 4 more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, others arrived at the bar, a heavily tattooed Mohawk wearing individual with girlfriend. Every-other word was F this F that. Ate my burger drank my Blue Moon @ $5.75 for 16 oz. The bill  came to $16.33 and I left a $20.Sorely disappointed with this chain that lost its way. 4 stars to the waitress who knew how to handle a disgruntled customer. In and Out would have been a better choice.
Their rolls are good.  Chicken meh.. so so.  The mash potatoes are horrible.  Its like they threw the box itself that the potatoes come in.
I could really love @cibocalgary but won't. The food is lovely enough but the service leaves something to be desired. It's a shame the staff didn't even make mention of a Happy Hour menu for their $5 Happy Hour pizza, otherwise I would go back. But they didn't, and I won't. Not worth the price.
THE worst and most unprofessional TSA workers in the nation.  I fly several times a month and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.  It all starts with the hallway to TSA (see pic) which is hot, crammed and leads to two check stations that not only hand checked EVERY bag after being scanned but also acted like every task performed was a chore for them.  After tossing my bag on the table for a hand check, I was asked if I had sharp or breakable items.  Really???  Yes!  I have a glass ornament which is why I'm not checking my bag!  The airport itself is way outdated so no reason to go on about all its downfalls.  Save yourself the hassle and choose another city.  Keep it classy Cleveland
My experience wasn't that pleasant.  First time in there so had a wait of about 10-15 minutes.  No problem since I didn't have an appointment.  The girl that did my pedi never even said her name and didn't talk.  Same goes for the gentleman that did my fill.  The thing that was the worst was the zombie type movie playing right in front of me while the music still blasted.  Don't think I will go back.
I don't know where to start.....We chose this place because of Doug.  He has such a huge personality and makes you feel so comfortable.  He promises everything to get you to sign your contract.  He gave us the premium drinks for the same price so that was nice!  He said he would come and have shots with us on our wedding.  (he didn't)  Doug was great to talk to and work with but I did get the feeling from him that even though he said something on the phone, the message wasn't getting relayed to the office and put in the paperwork.  Good:Food was ok.  I had the option of upgrading anything I wanted or bringing in things of my own.  Gazebo was so pretty and I loved that the guests were under cover as it would have been very hot under the sun.My husband and I always had a drink and we had our food first.Bad:Biggest complaint that I have is that I didn't want to to go up and take pictures after the ceremony in front of everyone.  I wanted to walk back down the aisle with my husband and then have everyone go in to the reception room.  I had many many emails and phone calls about this.  They said that they would just start the ceremony later so it would fix the timing.  I was ok with that.  That didn't happen.  It was such a whirlwind that they had us go back for pictures while everyone watched.  I was so mad but didn't want to cause a scene in front of everyone.  Then the room wasn't even ready when that was over and our guests still had to wait!Photographer was HORRIBLE!!  The pictures are so bad.  He didn't know how to have us pose and the lighting wasn't good.  The locations were also very strange looking.  The only "editing" he did was make some photos black and white.  I would have paid for my own photographer but they told me that I couldn't.  The room where the bridal party was before the ceremony is gross.  Very small and smelled.  He had me take photos in front of the door with the metal bar in it.  I told him that probably wasn't a good spot but he said he wasn't getting it.  IT WAS IN EVERY PICTURE!!!  The DJ was horrible also.  We had sent in our list of requested songs and they didn't have them.  I guess the DJ that was scheduled couldn't make it or something so someone else filled in.  The daddy/daughter song stopped playing in the middle of the song!  We also had to have all of our belongings either behind us or under our table.  (looked weird)  All in all, get your own photographer if they'll let you.  Don't change anything in regards to timing and don't count on our DJ to get anything right.  Those are the only things I'd change but I wanted to let everyone know my experience.
Unfortunately it did not go well. The service was friendly but when I got my take out home I found there was hardly any sauce on the pad se ew so it had no flavor. I had to make my own sauce and add it. Then I was enjoying my fresh spring rolls when I found a bug smashed on the piece of lettuce that was under them. Not very appetizing to say the least. I probably won't be back since both dishes I received had issues.
I stopped by Bamboo Bistro because I used to go there a lot when it was Pho Hoang, a nice little family run spot. My girlfriend told me she liked a BB that she went to so I decided to try it out.For me, the pho experience is all about the quality/taste of the broth. When I got my pho tai the broth was only warm not piping hot so it was hardly "cooking" the rare steak. The chicken wing appetizer just looked scary!I'll keep going down the street to Jenni Pho.
The first time I went here for lane swim, they didn't update the online schedule to reflect that it had been cancelled and I only found out when I got to the building. The second time, I encountered rude staff at the front desk.The space itself is really nice (lots of sunlight). Change rooms and lockers are big and clean. The swimmers here go at a decent speed. Slow lane is slow; medium is just a tiny bit faster. Thank goodness the fast lane is exactly what I expect the speed to be. But one dude ruined my experience in what was otherwise a polite group of swimmers. Please, for the love of humanity, do not backstroke the entire length in a crowded fast lane without looking around to avoid whacking people.
Sushi was overpriced for what it was. There was four of us and we ordered a $200 platter and asked if it would be enough and they assured us it would be. We also ordered a seafood appetizer platter and told we would each get a piece yet it came with 3 pieces each and  ( 2 oysters) when we questioned why we were told they ran out of oysters but never bothered to let us know or even bothered to substituted so we all had to try and share. My cocktail was horrible it tasted like a margarita with olive oil. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because this place is quite entertaining. I Would only come back for sake and beer. I left super hungry even after spending so much money on sushi and appetizers. But it's Vegas so I can't complain much.
I heard great things about this place, so I tried it. I was very disappointed.  The service is great, but the food was terrible.  I ordered eggs Benedict with hash browns. The potatoes were cold. The eggs were over cooked. Almost no runny egg yolk. The sauce was for sure from a can. Over all the eggs Benedict was so salty. I could not eat one whole egg one a muffin. It was served with ham instead of Canadian bacon as the menu list. I must have caught then on a very bad day.
Got there for a Sunday happy hour, which is great because not many places have Sunday happy hours and the beers are $3.50 for a pint.  They have all the usual Four Peaks suspects but only 3 guest brews on tap, so a little disappointing.  We ordered the calamari to start out with and followed it up with the Italian Beef Beer Bread.  I'm not sure what arrived at our table that they called "calamari", but I can tell you that's not calamari.  It was more like overpriced fish sticks.  Very disappointing.  They should absolutely not have calamari on the menu if that's what they're going to serve.  The Italian Beef Beer Bread was over a little greasy, but not bad.  I'm not much a fan of battered fries either.  Overall the beer for $3.50 is a worth a visit, but I would probably eat somewhere else.
Appetizers were great. Lobster taco exceptional.Rib eye steak, one of the worst ever. Under cooked and full of gristle.No response from complaint to server. Lamb chop mediocre at best. Pork tenderloin good.2 beers one mixed drink no dessert, bill 180 per couple.Really?Would never go back.
Was excited to try this place even after reading some of the reviews. The staff was friendly enough but a bit slow to take the order. After careful selection of the limited menu we ordered the southern hospitality, a strawberry cheesecake, poutine, amd two small drinks, $27? Wow. The gnats were complimentary though, yuck. They are everywhere, my ears, my mouth, and our food. I must say that the cheesecake and my waffle were delicious. The chicken in the southern hospitality was good but the flavor of the slaw was not to my liking, thats simply my opinion though. As for the poutine, we trashed them after a few bites. Soggy fries, gelatinous gravy and cold curd. Want some good poutine? May I suggest The Rose and Crown pub. If you're looking to try this place I'd  say to probably stick to the waffles in the breakfast portion of the menu, not that you have much other choices. Really? How is "sorry, but we just recently opened" an excuse for not offering half of your menu?
Visited this place last week, and was fairly disappointed. Very small seating area, and the food was mediocre. I had their Greek salad and spicy crab soup. The crab in the soup was clearly imitation. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Only positive about this place is that it's fairly affordable during lunch hours. Don't plan on ever going back!
Boorring!I stopped in on Saturday for some lunch, and Udon noodles were just under what I would call "meh." First of all, the menu indicates the Udon soup will have vegetables in it. What their actually was, was one small piece of broccoli, one carrot wedge, and a whole crapdone of boring, not good onion slices. That was it.As for the quantity of beef in my udon, I would say that it was fair, but the actual quality of the Udon, and CERTAINLY the quality of the broth sucked. Bottom line is, for being in Coventry, you can get better noodle soup, or just a better meal. The staff were fine, and the place is clean and it takes credit, but I wouldn't recommend the Udon on my worst enemy.
.I went here because it's close to my home at Spadina and Front. I have said this before sushi places are hit and miss and unfortunately this place was a miss for me.Prices are a little high for what you get and the sashimi just didn't have the fresh or wow factor for. Service was below average and I think the only reason this place stays in business is because of the Rogers Centre.If you are craving sushi or more importantly sashimi, avoid this place.
After parking in the garage across from the Dodge Theater I followed the "Restaurant/Bar Open" sign to Crazy Jim's.  The "bar" part is a joke - it's a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools.  The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  There's quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees.  However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i.e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos.  I asked if I could get the vegetable "sub" as a "pita sub" and was told that that just wouldn't work.  So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   The pita itself was just fine, nothing special.  I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn't be held together so I had to use a knife and fork.  The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  Bottom line: Crazy Jim's is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater.
Waiter had a bad attitude. We took a while to decide, which we thought wouldn't be a big problem since it was mid-afternoon and the majority of the place was empty, but I guess it was for him because he came up to us at least two or three times, looking and sounding impatient each time as he asked if we were ready yet. When we were ready to order, he asked "So are you guys going to order anything at all?" which sounded pretty rude. Also our food was sooooo greasy. I don't think any of us finished our plates. My friend's omlette had more cheese than eggs in it. Don't think I'll be trying this place again anytime soon.
Giordano's is a well known Chicago Restaurant that's famous for their Chicago Style Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza. They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn't sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don't know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano's or not. My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn't hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the "Other" Chicago place uses.I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered.I would never go back for the pizza I received.
the beer is absolutely amazing. huge selection & a good happy hour. however the food is terrible, we ordered bruschetta, expecting your typical bruschetta, it was not even close to it. we ordered a burger & a brisket sandwich. when i first got the burger, i had to pick a piece of black plastic off the the bacon/burger. i ignored that & tried it anyways, it was extremely dry & had no flavor. i asked for some ketchup, thinking that would help, my boyfriend & i both believe that ketchup was bad. it was extremely sour. i told our server/bartender & she said oh well we just filled the ketchups on monday... it was sunday. again, i looked past it & asked for a side of bbq sauce, thinking that can't be bad & that would help the dryness... i was wrong not your typical bbq sauce which i wasn't expecting, again very sour/vinaigrette taste. i finally just sent the burger back after taking 2-4 bites. my boyfriends brisket sandwich was subpar, he said. i would go back for the craft beer & to support a local place/brewery, however i will never eat there again.
I love Mexican food and I was really excited when I found Hussong. They really didn't deliver when it came to great taste. The only things I enjoyed was the grilled corn and the margarita. The salsa was flavorless, the Chicken in the Chicken Fajitas barely had seasoning or flavor, and my boyfriend didn't enjoy his baja shrimp tacos. The service wasn't the greatest either. Food took forever to come and we felt rushed to leave. I wanted to take some chips to help me eat my leftovers since I ate all my tortilla but the busboy snatched them off the table before I could even put some in my box. For the money we spent, it wasn't worth it.
We booked a mini-suite from the picture shown on the Internet. The room on the Internet was very nice but when we checked in our room was the old section of the hotel. The room was dark and dingy with spots on the carpet and shower tub with a curtain. When I told the woman at the desk that the room was not what we booked, she immediately got an attitude; but we did get the room shown on the Internet at no additional cost. However the is what is called bait and switch. They also have hidden daily fees called resort fees to the tune of $32 per day. All and all this place is not worth the price and we'll never stay there again.
I haven't had the best experience here. The receptionist isn't the nicest. I got a new family doctor here but she never seems to remember me, and always asks the same questions, then looks through her notes and says "oh right, I already asked you that." She suggested that I do an ultrasound, then forgot that she suggested that, so I brought it up and she actually asked, "why did I suggest that again?" ummm...you're the doctor??  I remember at the end of one of appointments, after completing a test, she said: "you should do this every year. you can even come back here if you want." ...isn't she supposed to my GP? They also don't schedule appointments on the same day, even if a time slot is available... which is weird?
I don't  want this review to discourage you from going; I want it to make you aware they may have significant kitchen issues when it comes to the cooked food.  I really like the feel of the place; have eaten there twice.  Highly recommend sitting at the bar and eating the sushi/seafood.  Here's where the problem came from:  after Sushi (which was fabulous), we decided to try main courses.  We ordered a prime new york strip (they were out of prime filets) with the crab & asparagus topping (approx. $55 - not cheap, but worth it if the kitchen knows how to make it), along with the fried oysters as recommended by the bartender.  Sounds like a truly decadent meal, right?  WRONG!!!!!!  The Medium-Rare Steak, not only came out fully cooked, but even worse, came out as what I call "baked steak" - slowly cooked.  I couldn't believe it.  So, if you want a prime steak, personally, I would go to a restaurant that is good at making them, such as Flemings or Mortons or Maestros.  If you still decide to go here & want to have steak, be warned.  Also, they forgot to deliver our fried oysters and when I asked how much longer for the oysters, they suddenly appeared, completely cold.  So, we had a very very disappointing meal.  However, I would still definitely go back to sit at the bar and have sushi.
No Grill Items For 35 minutes. Sign said soups they had but we're out of the one I wanted. Staff didn't seem to care at all. Used to be better but got worse over time.
The casino is great here. The hotel is just gross. The rooms are straight out of the late 70's. The carpeting is so gross I don't think they ever clean it. The elevators are so busy you can wait up to10 minutes to catch one. There is nothing luxury at all about this place. The toilet in our one bathroom barely worked. Harrahs really needs to update this stale and just gross place. It's a definite value hotel if you can't afford anything better
I originally gave hefs a great review because I enjoy their food. However, I am updating my review after my last experience there. The service was absolutely terrible. My waiter (I won't name names) inattentive and when I asked for the check I wanted 15 minutes. Still no check. I finally tracked down another server and got the check. Never seeing my server again. Then with my bill which was $10.83, I gave a $2 tip. Making the total $12.83. The payment went through on my card as $17.83. They changed the tip amount!!! I am very upset over this and the fact that an employee would change the amount I tipped.
No, their gyros are not worth waiting on a long line.I went there on Wednesday, and it took me 45 minutes to finally order my gyro. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the lady who was making gyros because she didn't have gloves on. She was sweating badly, kept wiping the sweat off of her face with a dirty towel, and continued making gyros with the same sweaty hands! I was totally turned off and grossed out. If you want to see what poor hygiene looks like, this is the place to go.The gyro tasted good, but I don't think it's worth waiting for 45 minutes. I have had much better gyros before with much better services. I think it is arrogant to say to the customers, "We have our own rules, so don't ask us to do anything that is not our rule." Nope, I'm not going back there.
Horrible acustics, so loud inside. You can hear everyones conversations. Good coffee though.
This is one of the nicer VZW stores I've had the pleasure of visiting.  However, the wait is always long and the gimmicks are always in play.  I only go when I have to.  The displays are live and you can play with various devices until your heart is content.  The salespeople are always locked in to whatever Verizon tells them they can or can't do.  The customer service is lacking when it comes to troubleshooting or satisfying a customer's true needs.  If you simply want to buy a phone, they are all over it!  Good luck!
I make it quick and simple - do not come here for the sushi; for an Iron chef caliber, very disappointed with thinly sliced and ok tasting. Good entrees and excellent dessert & appetizers ; won't be back.Excellent services but for the $$, that's expected!
This buffet was kind of a let down for me.  I was really exited to go to a buffet that had all of my favorites.  Pho, a coffee station and I've heard from my Yelpers that they had cotton candy too. I'll start with the pho, it was horrible.  I don't see how they can even get away with calling it that.  The so called tendon was actually huge fatty chunks of beef most people use for pot roasts.  They had no hoisen sauce, hot sauce or sprouts.  The noodles were super small and tasted funny.  I can't even be certain they were rice noodles.  Two bites in and I was done.I found the coffee station but the machine was broken.  A little screen informed me only hot water was available.  That's okay, I was allowed to have two whole iced teas before the waiter pulled a dissapearing act.  The dessert bar is the best one I have seen at a buffet.  Chocolate covered strawberries, fresh made baby doughnuts, hand scooped ice cream are just a few of the treats here.  I asked about the cotton candy but was told the machine was broken.  Not two minutes later the kids at the next table come bouncing over with their purple cotton candy on a stick.  I guess it was only "broken" for me.  My husband enjoyed the food and said it was well worth the seventeen dollar lunch price based on the sushi alone.  I'm sure the pasta bar is great too, but I didn't want to wait when the line was ten deep.  Not all the food was bad, but even the good stuff is not worth the drive.
There were several good options for breakfast when I checked Yelp for our visit to Vegas (we were staying off the main strip that morning). We decided on this one as it had good reviews and was closest to where we were at. We were quite disappointed. I feel like they were trying to be too creative and forgot some of the basics. I'm from the Bay Area and have been to plenty of trendy restaurants similar to this, but thought this fell flat. My wife got the Fat Elvis (bananas, nutella, and peanut butter stuffed between two large slices of french toast with strawberries on the side) and I got the chicken and waffles. We basically split the two plates to try them both. I like sweet breakfast foods, but the flavors of the Fat Elvis just didn't work for either of us. It may have been the combination of the nutella with peanut butter. Aside from that, the actual french toast was pretty lackluster. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was bland--I can make much better waffles at home. The chicken was fine, but the sauce they used on top of the chicken wasn't that great. I've only had chicken and waffles one other time, and it was amazing there, so maybe the bar was set to high for me. The fries that came with the chicken and waffles were pretty good. We came in at an odd hour (about 10:40am), so we were the only ones there part of the time. The service was very friendly. But the two meals we got were ones recommended by the waitress, and we just were not fans of them.For the price (our meals were $13 each), I would have hoped for a lot better.
Not very good service. I paid 15 dollars for "chicken fajitas" and there was hardly any chicken on my plate. Don't get me started on presentation. It was horrendous. Wouldn't recommend to people who love Mexican food. Very disappointing.
I hate to leave a bad review for a chain that I love but this is a new location and they need to get their act together. They are always out of everything and the staff has no clue what they are doing. I am fine with new employees but have a manager or training person there to oversee simple tasks like good burrito wrapping! Step it up guys!!
Went to Applebee's for a bite Sunday night. The music was loud and... interesting. Not quite like the Applebee's I'm used to. We decided to get an appetizer sampler (2 smaller portions for $10) with the Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip and Mozzarella Sticks. My boyfriend also got a Maple Bacon Chicken Piadini (no lettuce and the maple mustard on the side, in case I wanted to share). Took a little while to get our food. I was afraid the appetizers would come out cold, but they were actually warm and my b/f's wrap and fries were basically room temperature. There were 2 long, skinny pretzels and 4 mozz stix. The wrap wasn't bad with some of the leftover marinara and cheese dip.We ordered dessert via the tabletop kiosk. We got 2 Dessert Shooters as well as the new Churro S'mores, which looked too interesting not to try. The churros were very skinny and should have been warmer. I liked the toasted marshmallows but was disappointed in the chocolate underneath. It was just chocolate syrup, not actual melted chocolate, and it wasn't even warm. Not my favorite. My Strawberry Cheesecake Shooter was decent and my b/f's Chocolate Mousse Shooter was very thick and rich.Our server was alright... he seemed a bit overwhelmed, even though it wasn't that busy. The pay function on the kiosk was disabled... What a gyp! Applebee's left a lot to be desired.
My boyfriend and I came to Montreal for a quick little get away from our kids, so we came on a budget. My bf read online somewhere that Santos is a great place for ladies night. So that's exactly what we did on our Tuesday night in Montreal. The deal was that from 6-12, you would have to order 25 dollars worth of tapas to get "unlimited drinks" aka "open bar." It said it just like that on the flyer they gave us with the rest of the drink menu. The ambience of the restaurant was nice, our table was really small though so we used the two chairs as tables. The music was amazing too. Our waiter was very kind, he spoke French and English, but more fluent in french (which maybe the reason for the language barrier at the end of the night when getting our check...)The food was good, my bf ordered the charcuterie  board and it came with two selections of cheese, and two kinds of Italian meats, mini pickles, a few pickled veggies, onions, pistachios, candies pecans, fig spread, mustard and some fruit and bread. My only complaint would be the amount of cheese was so little. And for 25 I would expect a little more. I ordered three tapas (so I could get the unlimited drinks deal) first was the shrimp tapas and it kinda looked like a quesadilla garnished with guacamole and another spicy sauce. Second was the tuna tartar with rice chips. The tuna tartar was very different from what I normally taste, it was sour. It was different, but not something I would order again. Lastly was the Mexican style wings, which has a BBQ infused sauce on it. I liked the sauce and the plate came with a paint brush which was kinda cute. Over all they did a good job plating the dishes.For drinks I ordered the Ave Maria (came with a ton of fruits) 2 Ya Man (to die for drink) and then a white sangria and a shot of tequila. My borfriend for the Potion, vodka soda water and a shot of tequila too. So fast forward to the end of the night, I had already ordered 25 dollars worth of tapas and we get the bill and legit, my mouth dropped to the floor when I saw the bill. It was $170 Canadian dollars. Like whaaattttt?!?! Our waiter changed me for all of my drinks despite me ordering over 25 worth of tapas. And then it dawned on me that maybe it was only for the 4 drinks that were listed on the "ladies night -open bar - free drinks - unlimited" flyer only? Well whatever it is, I don't think I will ever go back because of this. We paid 200 (30 for tip) and left with dust bunnies in our wallets.
Horrible, horrible service. And this is with the restaurant half empty. I came for a 7:45pm dinner with a group of about 12. There was another group of the same size seated near us who seemed to receive better service in some areas. We started out ordering drinks and appetizers about 15 minute after being seated. Our drinks weren't delivered for 25 minutes, and the appetizers nearly 10 minutes after that. Beverages really should not take that long! We had requested our server a few times in between this time frame and he didn't appear to take our entree order until 8:45. We were missing one appetizer and had to continually remind him as well. The entrees finally arrived about 35 minutes later, and the missing appetizer after that. Kindly, they at least removed that appetizer from the bill. Receiving the bill was another long wait, but we were able to use the Yelp check-in of 10% off which we had to remind our server of twice. The saving grace was the food. I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken. This was a succulent boneless breast of chicken with a wing attached, served atop wilted spinach and creamy red quinoa. On top of all of this was a marsala mushroom sauce. The dish had a ton of flavor and the creamy red quinoa was really the star for me. The mushrooms and wilted spinach balanced out the creaminess of the other elements. I wanted to like this restaurant because we all enjoyed our food. But I honestly would not come back because we spent over 2 hours here, most of it waiting around.
Well what can you expect it's a Burger King. This location seems to be fairly clean in comparison to other BKs. There always seems to be long lines inside the restaurant (15 minutes wait).  The thing that spites me the most is the fact that the men washrooms needs a key but not the women's.  I guess all men are bad -_-    It's a mediocre place to get a cheap lunch.
I pondered ordering from here for over a year because they put a flyer on my door. The pictures look good reviews seemed ok also but when I got my food it was not good. Looking at it looked ok but when I tasted it the chow mein left a weird film in my mouth and the vegetables fried rice had a odd taste to it that Made me feel like the pan it was cooked in had burnt residue in it or something. I tried to eat it because I was hungry but the lie caught up to me and I threw it all away. I wouldn't waste my money again eating here. I wanted it to be good but it wasn't.  Im sick of people throwing slop together with sweet and sour sauce here in the valley and calling it Chinese food!! Why cant we get good Chinese food here in phoenix.
I'm sad to write this review, because I'm actually obsessed with Caliente's Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing-- and that's pretty frequent (don't judge) and every time I call and order they tell me it will be 45 minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didn't want to give me a bad product-- ok fair. But, why wouldn't you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well. Maybe it's a training problem... a hiring problem?Pros:+Pizza is GOODCons:-Slow inattentive service-Slow delivery-general lack of concern about the happiness of their patrons
I've been here a couple times and am less than impressed.  The service is ok, my coffee cup was never empty but the menu is limited in my opinion.  I eventually settled on the mushroom and brie eggs benedict and although my eggs were supposed to come out medium, they were under.  The benny itself was edible but I wouldn't order it again, the potatoes that accompanied it were decent but again, not awesome.  I don't know what but it's lacking something.
Check your bill!  SO and I had a dim sum lunch together.  Food was ok, but the selection was challenging.  They were pushing the fried foods and noodles.  We were looking for more steamed dim sum items.We noticed several tables around us that had more items show up on their bill than they thought they ordered.  Keep an eye on our check-off list.  The servers attempt to keep it facing away from you.  Make sure the count lines up with your expectations as you go.  We did not have that problem.  We got to the checkout and the lady actually placed a different amount on the credit card machine that our bill added up to.  It seemed like this was not an accident - when we noticed, she ignored our complaints.  CHECK THE BILL - NOT TRUSTWORTHY.
Although the burgers are great quality and pretty tasty, they are VERY expensive for what you get. Try to go to happy hour in order to save some on the delicious zucchini fries, or else yo'll be wondering why you came here instead of In-n-Out burger for a double-double animal style or Smashburger for something with a little more kick.
hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! the food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, spinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio isvery rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :(
After being stranded at Tower City for an hour while i waited for the rapid to the airport i became famished!I wanted a healthier option so i gave mixed greens a whirl. Got a chicken panini, with a side salad and a drink for $10. The sandwich was awesome BUT the side salad was a complete and utter joke. I literally got some chopped iceburg lettuce with three olives and 4 red peppers. I asked for more but the girl said "only two toppings" like what the hey!! Bland freaking salad, there was no substituting for soup or some other side. I was stuck. Okay so i got past that. There were FOUR girls working this particular afternoon, and could you believe it still took 2:10 seconds for ONE of them to acknowledge that someone was standing at their counter. They were talking about babies and baby daddys. Not professional at all. HELLO IM STARVING HEREThis place has some management issues, some pricing discrepancies, and is cheap with sides. If thats your thing then hey to each his own. but im good for now.
Why is there a cover band in a Friday night? The whole place should be covered by the DJ. The outside (where the DJ was located) was packed, the inside (where the cover band was located) was dead. Drinks are good, food is good. It just seems like a missed opportunity.
i went there last week...2nd week open they will need some time...the crew has not been fully trained...the cashier has no idea how the chicken is made..hand dipped, buttermilk, double dipped etc...thats a management problemi love the biscuits but they are way too small, the coleslaw was good but my special order was 1 breast 1 leg and shades of kfc the chicken has 4 breasts with ribs and spine attached...ugh that being exactly why i no longer eat at kfc...add to that cooking A breast that has been cut in half changes the cooking time for the rib spine section which means the meat is so dry and overcooked u will choke on it even with your drink. hopefully this manager will take the time to have staff properly trained and get full breasts and not cheap it out will give them a second chance in about a month
Stayed at the Flamingo Hotel over the Memorial Day weekend, Sunday and Monday was okay.  6:30 am of Tuesday we were awaken by sound of jackhammers!!! There is a construction site next to the hotel. And the best part is at 9:00 am, no water!!! There was a water issue in most of the towers at the hotel and they are looking at it getting fixed in 3 hours. The front desk advised us to take a shower at the fitness center but there they run out of hot water. Continued on with our check out at 11 am. We will never stay at the Flamingo Hotel ever again.
Slow service, the branch manger who is an older blonde lady with glasses is very rude.If it wasn't for member rep Keri I would have given this place a zero. The branch manager could learn how to treat customer from her member reps. There were about 7 people in line and 2 tellers. HAd to wait forever to get service in lobby from a banker though
My husband and I were staying at a hotel near this restaurant while traveling through town. After reading reviews online, we decided to give this place a try for dinner.Now, I know that every restaurant and every cook has an off day and I'm sure that this was what happened here.We started off with the Cafe fries (fries, cheese, and bacon) and it was pretty good. Fries were crispy and the homemade ranch was definitely good. Unfortunately, one of the appetizer plates came to our table with old food crusted on it. I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. It was just awful. The potatoes had the strangest consistency and had an unidentifiable and unpleasant taste. I asked my husband to try it and he agreed. The chicken fried steak in itself was fair and the mac and cheese was greasy. The cornbread was a bit tough. My husband ordered the three cheese baked ziti with meat sauce. As my husband put, "it's not good". I gave it a try and agreed with him. It seemed almost watered down. Our waitress was a doll and was super sweet. She was very helpful and friendly.If we are passing through town again, we won't be back.
you'll notice from my review history that i'm not hard to please. maybe somewhat hard to impress into speaking in superlatives, but it takes a lot for me to leave a bad review. Looking at the other reviews for this restaurant I see a lot of "amazings" and equally as many 'just okays" to "wtfs".. and that's really all it is. this place is debilitatingly inconsistent. I've been here several times and the food is definitely overpriced but it's always been okay (neither exceptional nor offensive 'italian' fare), and the service is always lovely (thats what the points are for in this review).Went on NYE for dinner (table of four) and I know what youre thinking "it's a busy holiday, cut them some slack!"No. I've been there on busier fridays, and there's just no excuse for what was getting churned out of the kitchen. the wait staff is not to blame, i am entirely blaming the kitchen (and didnt undertip to punish the wait staff who were not to blame)let's just get to the shitshow. arancini and lamb meatballs were fine. The lamb (i love lamb, so it's not like i can't "handle" the gamey taste) was not fresh. Arancini is very hard to screw up, and they didn't. Neither is worth the 15 dollar price tag ( 4 arancinis in some forgettable sauce, and 7 lamb meatballs that were smaller than a teaspoon.. baffling). Now at this point of the meal i was pretty happy because it's NYE, i was with my friends, and the ambiance and wait staff were killing it. it was overpriced but average food, which is what I already knew about this place. the mains is where they completely lost us. our friend's pasta was good. It wasn't 25 dollar good, but it was a comfort dish (I know i keep bringing up the price but i eat at this price point frequently and it was more like a 15/person quality of food). the two pizzas were both dry and not well seasoned (pear pizza and the one with mulitple meats) and the special, bison cheek (which is one of my favorite meats) was literally inedible. I always take a takeout box, i literally left my entire meal at the table in the box except the polenta which i ate, and the few bites of bison snd greens that were in my belly. The biscuit was inedibly dry (and I mean that, I love bread and will even eat stale bread, this biscuit was burnt and heavily over salted... which is something a salt lover like me has never said). the bison cheek was cooked well in terms of doneness but the marinade was horrific. it was very sweet (I like a mix of sweet/meat so it isn't that i'm not adventurous), the greens were underseasoned and seemed old (maybe just overcooked). I had to cut the outsides of the bison off to at least try and eat the meat less affected by the sugar they must've marinaded it in, but.... it was too far in. It was permeated into the entire chunk of meat and that bummed me out because i was famished and had saved up for this meal. very hard to screw up bison for me, but they did. i ate the polenta (hard to screw up, and they didnt) that hadn't touched the sugar meat and that was basically my meal, plus a teaspoon meatball and an arancini."Well Ayla, why didn't you tell them at the restaurant instead of being an asshole on the inernet"Great question, Internet! The time between the first entree being dropped (mine) and the last (pasta) was almost 25 minutes, and the time between our appetizers being cleared and my entree being dropped was over 20 minutes as well. Now, we were in no rush as it's NYE, but we had sat and ordered by half 8 and were not out by 11, it was ridiculous. it was not even crowded and it is not the wait staff's fault. The expo or someone in the kitchen was being a stone cold disaster (I used to work on a kitchen line, you know when the mess ups is from front or back of house). Since it had been about 40 minutes between cleared apps and my friend getting her pasta, they should have refired the rest of our entrees or at least kept them warm. no, they dropped one plate, then dropped two pizzas, and the pasta with 5ish minutes or so between each of those things. It was baffling. the prospect of them firing up another shit meal for me after 40 minutes of not eating anything (rude to start eating until everyone has their plates when your party is only 4), i wasn't going to risk it i just wanted to dip ASAP and never return.It sucks too because the wait staff, ambiance, and the menu on paper are so awesome, and this place is like two blocks from where I live. further, the presentation is lways great, but the food underneath it absolutely blekh. I don't see myself hemorrhaging my hard earned cash on this place ever again. In a town with so, so many amazing culinary options i will never understand how the hell this place stays open in such a prime location. they need to elevate the quality of their food to justify the price, or hopefully they'll be gone by the end of the year. i've given it so many chances and Saturday was just the straw that broke the camel's back.
Don't hate on me, Yelpers, but I really wasn't satisfied with my visit to Bouchon when I went a couple of weeks ago. First of all, the wait was only supposed to take 20 minutes according to the hostess, but we waited outside for a good hour. This isn't some Asian restaurant where the host/hostess always says the wait will only take 20 minutes so that people will be fooled and stay longer because they already stayed for a long time. The good thing is that they provided us with some really good pastries while we were waiting. But then more bad things happen...They take 30 minutes to get our order.  And it takes about another 40 minutes to get our food. My friend didn't even get the diet coke he ordered at the beginning until after we already started eating. Was this special handmade diet coke? NO. It was from a freakin bottle. I know because he got the bottle with his glass. I ordered the croque madame expecting goodness considering we waited so long to eat there and it was ranked so highly on Yelp. I gotta say, I wasn't too fond of it. The taste was just meh. And the price I paid for that was disgusting ($19 before tax and tip). I also got to try the mussels, which were alright, but the taste was a bit overwhelming. I think I would have been sick of them after 5 mussels. I got to try the waffles from the chicken and waffles dish as well.  The waffles were disgusting. There are bacon bits inside the mushy waffles. Gross.Would I come back? With all the quality food available at Vegas with a much shorter wait, probably not.
I'm giving two stars and that is solely based on convenience and the fact that I like the food to begin with. When my family and I entered this location a couple girls entered after us that apparently knew one of the workers. While we were ordering the girl working behind the counter screams, runs, knocks over equipment behind the counter slams into the door and runs out to hug and greet her friends. She stayed out of the kitchen for a few minutes one manager watched her run out and went to get a second manager. The both of them proceeded to stare at the girl as she was with her friends but no one asked her to come back in. It wasn't until she went back behind the counter that one manager told her that she knocked over some equipment and all she had to say "oh well it's just ten dollars to replace." After this she went back into the kitchen with gloves on and ate some ice cream and without changing her gloves, started preparing food. Aside from the cashier, who was friendly and professional, the whole experience was just ridiculous and unnecessary. These people could learn some professionalism and proper work etiquette.
OH DEAR LORD! (and not in a good way) So I've been wanting to check this place out for over a year now. This past Saturday I finally convince the hubs to go with me. This is a place that takes donations from people who are renovating their homes, you can find anything home related as far as building materials and the like go. I was pumped on finding a bath vanity, people have reported that they have stuff there from high end homes. We must have been on a very very off day as everything there looked to be from the 80's mayyyybe 90's and older. Nothing current or that would even fly in a bath remodel these days. The appliances they offer there are old as hell as well, there wasn't anything worth looking at. And used toilets? EW!
Unbelievably noisy in the restaurant, we could barely talk amongst our group. I am not sure why but I suspect it is because of all the hard surfaces including the ceiling, it reflected all the sounds back. The food was just okay not good enough to make up for the noise. Crossed off the list of places to revisit.
I lived beside of Campus Deli last summer, so needless to say, we ended up there pretty frequently. The food is alright if you go during the day, but the quality of your order relies entirely on when you ordered it. Free delivery? Great, but expect soggy food.
It's a solid sushi place with a very convenient location on King Street West.  The service is what makes this place what it is and the people who work here are extremely friendly.  Maki My Way is meant for quick and efficient consumption if you are quickly on the go in my opinion and it is solid.  Used Ritual to order the Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll (8pcs) and the Korean Roll (8pcs).  The spicy salmon crunch roll was alright, nothing special and just the traditional roll you would find anywhere.  The Korean Roll was a bit more unique as it consisted of beef and kim chi to create a different type of taste.  I was expecting more from both rolls I bought, in taste and fulfillment factors.  All in all, the staff are wonderful and are extremely friendly.  Whilst, the food just makes you seem like you're missing something. Nothing special, small portion sizes with prices that don't match and quality that turns you towards another establishment.
So, let me just say something- this was my first time here and these sandwiches have NO MEAT. I ended up adding my own meat and cheese at home to taste something besides the bread. But, the broccoli cheddar soup was great, which was why I rated two stars. If you're wanting a fully loaded sandwich, this isn't the place to be.
Such a shame, could be outstanding but ends up flat. A great location cool old building with great bones. That's where it ends the music was extremely loud for a dinner time setting. The service was terrible we ordered cocktails 5 min before our dinner was ordered and our entrees came out before the drinks did. The Manhattan was average (coming from a former bartender that's being generous). As for the meal, my wife ordered the quesadilla and it was above average. I ordered the London broil which is one of my favorite dishes and was disappointed, the marinade was bland the meat was undercooked and cut incorrectly.   Overall we would not return which is a shame because we are in this area often for shows at the music factory.
Just ordered and holy smokes I've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed
I absolutely love Gabe's. However this location is not so great. They recently had their Grand opening at their new location....I being a loyal Gabe's customer attended. I was treated so poorly. Prestine was our sales associate at the checkout. He responded rudely to our request, kept us waiting while he assisted other employees without even acknowledging we were still in front of him. We had to get a greeter to ask him why he stopped checking us out mid checkout. The dressing room attendant we're rude. I find it sad that it's such a nice store and a great location; yet a rude and cold staff. Very disappointing
I was promised a room full of elbows, and the Elbow Room seriously under-delivered.Additionally, I was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection. When I asked our waiter what was on tap, he could not name a single choice. Its not a huge problem for me, but considering this place is somewhat of a pub, it would probably be wise to memorize a few choices. I had the Norman Rockwell Burger which was actually very good. The egg was perfectly fried and the burger was cooked precisely how I requested. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the crappy bun detracted from the burger as a whole, but overall I was happy. The fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course. My lady-friend's turkey-whatever sandwich was okay, nothing to get excited over.The food itself deserves 3 stars, but the overall environment felt strange to me, hence 2 stars.
Let me just start off my saying everytime my girlfriend and I go out together we always get the worst service possible. We came to this restaurant hoping to find good service in a more local restaurant (we both live near GVR). But needless to say we won't be going back. We sat in the lounge area so we could have wine and an app, and when we sat we were greeted almost immediately by a bartender. We ordered wine and a lobster & clam chowder which were both served promptly. This is where it goes downhill. We didn't like the soup (too much bacon), and waited for our server/bartender to check on us so we could send it back for something else. 20 minutes went by (I'm a restaurant manager and timed him), and he never came by. My friend even waved at him from across the room, he looked at her and kept working behind the bar. My friend then asked the hostess to get the manager. Once the manager came over everything was rectified with our food, and she got a different bartender to serve us. She even comped our food (we ordered mac and cheese and she gave us cheesecake), and took the time to listen to our complaint. The other part that sucked was that you pay an automatic 10% entertainment fee for a crappy piano player. Is there a fine dining place for locals, or do we always have to go to the strip??
The super market is ok.  I ordered bibimnengmyun at seoul korean food.  The portion isn't what I'm used to.  Very little for the price i paid.  The lady there wears gloves to handle cash then handles food.  I was so grossed out. I couldnt enjoy my food. I mean what's the point in wearing gloves then.  My egg looked like it was peeled by a noob.  Parts of the egg were missing... Ewwww and it tastes so bad.  Flavor was lacking. Spice was lacking.  I did get a side of kim chi. But... Not worth what i experienced.I'm sad. I want my money back.
I love that they have a drive through that serves real food. Who doesn't want a salad or soup without having to leave their car?I've been here once. I had a Coke Zero, which was truly terrible. Their mix is way off. This cost them half a star.I also had the Al Mondo salad. It was very good. Fresh ingredients with well trimmed chicken. No flabby bits. No weird seasoning blend (like Panera uses on their chicken).  I didn't want the sweet dressing, so I got ranch dressing instead. The salad came with bread and I chose country French. This is basically sourdough sandwich bread. Boo. They also didn't give me any butter. The bread was nothing to get excited about, which is too bad at a place called Kneaders. The service at the drive through was great, which I appreciate.Edited - I noticed that their ranch dressing is not that great and I got a couple of bites of flabby chicken. Their bacon has an artificial, chemical smoke flavor but it is otherwise good. I think it's really more deserving of a 2.5 star rating, not 2'
For a restaurant with the GHT's reputation - and prices - I expect a certain level of excellence to be built into the experience. Not sure if it was because we went at 8:30 on a Sunday, or if GHT us falling off it's game, but I was terribly disappointed.Took friends from out of town and we were seated at a window table in the cool little loft nook - intimate with a great view if the street. Great start.After the server provided the explanation of Firsts, Seconds, Thirds and Halves - we ordered what we thought was a good combination of appropriately sized choices. We got no insight from him to assist us in our choices, only a listing of what was depleted and the replacement items. Since he'd asked if this was our first visit - I was surprised he provided no insights into the choices, sourcing, etc.- something that has been a constant at other eateries that pride themselves on their sustainable menu.Devils on Horseback had great flavor, but arrived at the table lukewarm at best - almost starting to chill - which took away from a great combination of flavors. The Animal Fries were HUGE and should be shared or ordered as a meal themselves - but were listed as a Half on the menu - which is suggested as a Side. Sadly, our table of four also got an order of the regular Gravy Fries - to share and one  diner's meal also came with fries ... but, being the only person who was aware of the portion sizes, accompaniments, etc. - our server did not bring this overabundance of frites to our attention - so while they were great, the portions were way too big to allow us to really enjoy our Third courses. I would have expected the server to just mention it - the beauty of great service is that the server - through his knowledge - guides you around these possible pitfalls.The Gravy Fries were also served close to lukewarm ... The fries at the bottom were hot, but the top third had cooled significantly before it arrived at our table. Other choices - Ohio City Pasta and Ceasar were judged to be good - but not great.The Chicken Fried Lamb did not arrive at the table hot. The tastes were great - with the sharply acid slaw providing a superb accent for the rich lamb and savory gravy and mash. The Steak was ordered medium rare and arrived exceptionally rare -- almost just a sear on the meat. The diner did not send it back, but was clearly not overwhelmed by the dish (took 2/3 home - including the 'round 3' of fries). The Burger was judged OK - but not stellar. Overall - we were disappointed with the service and the food - after hearing so many raves about both. If the food had arrived at the table hot, it might have helped tremendously, but we'll never know. I'm sorry that this was our friends' only impression of an outstanding restaurant in Cleveland -- because GHT did not measure up to the buzz. We'll continue trying new places, but won't be back to GHT with so many other places getting everything right.
Their service was not good.  I came here to pick out brides maids dresses... They were not helpful at all and ignored our presence the whole time.  Granted, they were pretty busy, but I wish they scheduled us for another day.  We pretty much picked out our dresses ourselves.  Unfortunately, it seem like everyone goes here to pick out their bridal dresses....
Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper's Tale.You might say, "I've never heard of Rock Bottom, there's no way that they are a chain restaurant." Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you'll end up on the rock bottom.After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.
Stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar. The bar tender was quick to get me a beer (the 3 Pepper Ale which was really good) but after that I was totally ignored. Tried to get the attention of the two bartenders for about a half hour while nursing my beer. They seemed to be more interested in changing dollars for quarters and washing glasses. I got feed up, finished my beer, paid my tab and went to Uno's. Glad I did... Got great service and my meal came quickly.Verdict:  sit at the bar for a beer if that's what you want but if you're hungry and want dinner take your chances at a table.
I used to like this place until I tried Pepes Tacos. Robertos locations are always just sort of dirty inside, so the food can't be much different. Pepes on rainbow is much cleaner and nicer inside
Not disappointed but certainly underwhelmed.  The two women eating gushed about the place as I stool looking at the menu.It was fine.  Nothing special.  Quite bland.  And $10 is expensive for a sandwich at what is not much more than a street stall.  You pay extra for avocado but then the avocado is served as a side dish.Not sold on the product or concept.  Won't bother again.
The first review makes me wonder if the person was paid for it... because my experience was quite different. I really don't care much where my lunch money will be spent as long as I get a good meal so instead of rather regular Chipotle located next door I gave a try to Tony D's. I decided to try aforementioned French Dip sandwich which turned out to be thick, crusty and soft bread (true) with a few thick slices of tough and chewy roast beef. Come on Tony D... you can make it happen for $6.99. Just get a decent quality meat and slice it thin! But until then I'm definitely not interested in coming back there.
Went to see a band and have dinner. Sat in the back, in a corner where it was impossible to see the band. Had reservations and told there were no other seats, yet tables were open.On to the food. Ordered a chicken burger. It is not a chicken breast, but ground chicken and didn't taste of anything. Fries are pretty standard.  Being called Drums n'Flats, you would think the wings are where it's at, but no. I've ordered them a few times and find them very average. I asked for some hot sauce, and when I got the bill, I was charged $1.00 for it!!!!!They also charge a cover, even if you're eating, and arrived before the band starts. Overall, very mediocre food, and policies that are focused on getting a few extra bucks from everyone. I'll avoid this place in the future. Plenty of other options.
We stopped in for something light and a few cocktails. Our waiter, Saul, explained his favorites on the menu and gave us time to look over the menu since we've never been there before. We ordered drinks, then he proceeded to talk me out of my drink order. I gave-in to try something different and waited 20 min. Drinks came and this Ginger drink was horrible. I returned it to get my original order and waited another 20 min! We were also talked out of our food order!!! He told us if we don't like it, he gets to eat! It's a win-win situation. We said "we'll try the Quesadilla", he said "the Nachos?"If you like being up-sold by a car salesman and slow service then this is your place! As more people came in, the slower the service became. We had to call the water boy over to get service and the check. We became irritated with the Sauls scheme. Our $90 ticket for 4 drinks and Nachos could've gone a lot further for better service and authentic food elsewhere.
It's gross. Needs an update. Charged $30 to check in before 3pm. Pool has NO umbrellas. I think there are better places to stay in this price point. Location is great. Can walk to everywhere easily.
Since I have been to other Chart Houses, I expected more. This was the worse of all I have visited. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Lets mention the good first. The fish tank was beautiful and position of the restaurant in the Casino is excellent , close to a side entrance.  The service was good but average for this grade of restaurant.  Now the bad,  the entire restaurant is tiny and looks like an add on to what was a nice aquarium bar. Because of that, the seating is terrible, everyone is right on top of one another.  Some of the seating is right at the check out in the way of the entrance and exit of customer creeping by. The entrance is hard to find, really looks like you are going to the bar. Now the food, is C-, it would be an A if you were at McDonalds, but not for the prices they charge. The lamb chops were small and underccooked and not well seasoned.  My Chilian Sea Bass was good but small and not seasoned well. Sides were separate.  Worse yet I have often bragged of the excellent Caesar salad, hand made with anchovies at the Chart House. Well not at this one!. No anchovies, no hand made, no signature dish. There are so many excellent restaurants in Las Vegas, there is no need to drop several hundred dollars at this after thought.
Not impressed. Prices are high, which if the food is great, I'll pay the price. But this was not of the places... I got the non spicy fried egg, bacon, hash brown quesadilla-salty, super fried doesn't mean tasty, and even the bread was trying to be fancy. Again not impressed, won't be going back, even if it was a free.
Terrible service. I'm literally sitting here waiting for my food to be cooked. I know it's nice knowing my food is being cooked fresh, but for a fast food place to completely run out of the things I wanted is just bad. I'm now having to wait 15-20 min for a fast food place to cook my food is ridiculous. They should know that the popular food items that are running low should be made right away to replenish before it completely out. As I'm waiting another customer came back in to complain about his order being short; I think he was in the drive through. I feel bad for the people thinking the drive through would be any faster since they too had to wait for the items to be cooked. Also while sitting here waiting for them to cook the tables are all completly dirty with crumbs all over. I will still eat Panda Express in the future; it just wont be from this location.
I'm a first-timer at Chipotle (not just this location, but anywhere). I had high expectations because my nephews love it. Well, first of all the menu is very confusing and totally lacks explanation. The workers expected me to immediately know what I wanted, with no guidance or suggestions at all. The place wasn't even really busy, and yet I felt I was being rushed through the line by the person at each station like some auto assembly line. And I'm a decisive person...I don't linger in making my decisions. But this was ridiculous! Terrible service experience. I'll skip over to my critique of the actual food. Yuck! I got tacos, which sounded like a safe choice. To me, a taco should be a perfect mix of meat plus all of the lighter crispy stuff. Well these tacos were so loaded with meat up to the tops of the shells, they were only able to dot the top with a few measly lettuce shreds, tomato chunks, and a shred or two of cheese! Now I know some people love meat, but it was ridiculous! That to me does not a taco make. And the meat was horrible, although that was probably just my taste buds (I hate cumin and it was overpowering, and it was too spicy for me...again, I understand these are just my taste preferences). Finally, they were WAAAAY overpriced! Ten bucks for 3 tacos plus a drink...SHEESH! I could have stopped across the street and got one of Applebee's lovely Oriental Chicken Salads for the same price and been 100% happier. Bottom line is I will never be eating from there again. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it seemed clean to me and it's convenient. Whoopie.
Quite a selection of flavor choices!  That was probably the biggest positive.  Found the yogurt itself to have a funny aftertaste.  The quality of the yogurt was not nearly as good as Qoola or Tutti Frutti.  Toppings are the same at all the Fro-yo places so that was good.  Taste of the yogurt will probably keep me from returning.
My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!
So it was our first time here, it was pretty quiet...like  eerily quiet. We were seated right away, waitress was friendly. There were only a handful of customers and looked like 3 employees. The wait was long for our food, or to get refills it took forever to get her attention. In all honesty I think she was helping in the back because she would disappear for a long time and reappear with someone's food. It really seemed like the staff was missing. The food was just ok but the overall experience was just off and not good.
I am not a big fan of this shop. Came here to check it out but there wasn't anything I wanted here. All the things here are basically specialty items. Things you don't expect. Things are pricier here. For some reason the store looks really dull and it seems like the things inside are not fresh.
This location has been open several months now and all I can say is keep trying. The only thing they are consistent with is inconsistency. Some days the drive-thru is quick. Some days you can wait a half hour. Going inside is a joke. They hardly pay attention to you much less take your order. They have around 8 employees in the morning and 7 of them are handling the drive-thru only. The one handling the walk ins is trying to restock & start fresh pots of coffee. The day I went inside, I was met with a tons of attitude. For 6:20am and a $7 coffee, drop the attitude!
Really poor service-always understaffed.  I even called customer service to request someone help out and it took 20 minutes for someone to show up.  So disappointing!  I usually have better luck in Waxhaw.
What a disappointing experience. We had wanted to get into this place after experiencing their craft cocktails at a local festival. After always trying to get a reservation on open table but it showing it was booked we decided to call. As it turns out they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. We went and waited at the bar for a table. The cocktails were great although my drink was about 3 sips so not great for the price. At our table we were served one by one. My friends husbands meal came out first then my husbands came out cold and without chicken as requested then my friends came out steaming hot. My food came out so late everyone was nearly done with their food. My husband told them he was missing his chicken and he received it after finishing his meal. Our servers switched during the meal and when asking for our bill they asked us if we had a bottle of wine (which we didn't). They also took away our heat lamp during our meal for another table. We asked that we keep it as it was cold and they said they would bring another which they weren't able to light. It seemed as if they knew they missed the mark when we left but in no way offers to come anything (even the chicken my husband didn't eat because it came out so late). The service was really poor and the food was not amazing. Maybe it is an okay place for a drink but don't waste your time on a meal.
This place has the worst cafe food that I've ever eaten... worse than hospital food, which is pretty bad. Even the salad selection is horrible.Avoid anything with seafood. It's overcooked and dry. Avoid rice as well for the same reason.In fact, avoid this place altogether.The only reason why it gets a second star is because they bring in outside restaurants in the "Cultural Exchange" section, which has good food from places such as JohnnyBurrito.
My friends and I (6-10 people) have been coming here every Sunday for over three years.   We really enjoy sitting out back after a workout and catching up with each other.  Today they very rudely told us they would no longer serve us on the back patio and we would have to wait for our food to be prepared and then take it back ourselves.   The lack of hospitality really ruined the morning.   I guess next week we will give First Watch a try.  It seems the young ladies were far more interested in playing on their phones than serving us.
Normally, a car was has got to really stand out to get a review at all. Well, Superstar Car Wash stood out in a negative way for me. I took my brand new truck into their car wash, and it was damaged in the car wash. Fortunately, it was just the antenna. So, it's not the end of the world. But, it was a $60 antenna to replace. They do warn that some antennas may become damaged. But, BEFORE I took my truck into the car wash, I took the time to walk over and talk to their employees and I specifically asked them if my type of antenna could get damaged. They assured me it would be safe, at which time I entered the car wash. The car wash mangled it. After it was damaged, the responsible employee confessed it was his fault to the manager. So, I contacted the corporate office and I had a written acknowledgement from the manager that it was their fault. But, after I attempted to contact their corporate office, they just ignored me, and wouldn't return my attempts to contact them. So, this negative review is based on the company's attempts to pretend that the problem didn't exist after they were directly responsible for causing damage to my truck.
Just a few words to describe our recent visit. You'll be leaving this place hoping you never stepped foot inside. My first impressions were fantastic, that is, if I wanted to have an extra pretentious dinner...The service staff were about as friendly as a Waffle House in New Jersey, and if you're not from the shores, allowed me to explain....they're not. Food is definitely subpar. If there was a bar or some sort of standard of quality and taste, they definitely lowered it underground to allow such restaurant to remain in existence. Yelp should allow the ratings of negative stars in cases of such extreme substandards. This is one of those cases. Clever Koi...clever not to come out to this place maybe. Good atmosphere. Crappy service, except for the manager, maybe too much attention was paid to our party...oh well...that ship has sailed. Food could not be any worse. Enough said...Only rating 2 stars for the beautiful host!
As a preface to this review, I got food poisoning the only time I ate here--and I haven't garnered the courage to eat here again.  Yes, I know I should get back on the horse, but the painful memories of the Tet offensive being played out in my stomach are too fresh in my mind.  So, you can disregard my review or let it light your way as you navigate the various restaurants in the valley.  I have an affinity for those who will do the latter--but I'm very self involved.  Now, onto the review.I highly anticipated my meal at the Ocean Club.  I was fairly new to the valley and numerous people championed the dining experience for its great food, great ambiance and interesting clientele (*cough* cougars *cough**cough*).  Plus, I am a huge fan of seafood.Upon arrival, I was impressed by the interior and I was surprised that it was so crowded on a weekday night.  However, the best part was the clientele which made for some fantastic people watching.  My buddy and I settled in at a table in the bar area and were greeted by a very friendly and attentive waitress (the service at the Ocean Club is top notch).  Immediately to my left was a table with a manther (male cougar) and two attractive young women.  Needless to say, I was elated with our seating arrangement because I knew something interesting was going to happen that night.As I perused the menu, I kept one eye on the awkward May/December flirtations to my left.  Remember, I was still a newbie in this town and was not accustomed to this type of mating ritual.  Anyway, I ended up ordering a salad and the sea bass entree.  My salad was tasty and I was completely satisfied with my choice.  However, my contentment was tested when the manther's appetizer arrived.  The seafood tower, the Hummer of the appetizer kingdom, was placed at the table next to mine devoid of any pomp and circumstance.  Such regalia was not needed because the sheer size of this thing is a spectacle in and of itself.  I'm not going to lie, a sense of inadequacy started to envelop me as I gazed at this mountain of seafood goodness.  Luckily, that feeling was short-lived because I convinced myself that, much like the Hummer, the seafood tower was merely a cover-up for certain personal deficiencies.  At this point, I realized that my cynicism is really getting out of control and I probably needed to go to group.  Soon after I finished my salad, my entree arrived.  The presentation was very good and I was ready to taste the best seafood in the valley.  As I took my first bite, I noticed that the consistency of the sea bass was near perfect, however, it didn't really taste right.  It didn't taste bad, just not what I was expecting.  To my detriment, I chalked this up to fish being flown in and a myriad of other reasons why it didn't taste like the sea bass dishes I've had in the past.  At the end of my meal, I had high marks for the Ocean Club.  The food, the service and the people watching were great.  However, these positive reactions were soon discarded after I felt the first rumblings from my stomach later that evening.  The rest of the night was spent sleeping on the floor of my bathroom and questioning every choice I had made in life.  Ok, the last part is an exaggeration but you get the idea.One of these days, I will suck it up and give the Ocean Club one more try because this was more than likely an isolated incident.  Of course, I may wait until I reach manther status so I can order the seafood tower and not feel like a hypocrite.
Worst service in history at a hotel, the front desk fell asleep after I called at 4 am for a cab she had just woke up. After falling the front desk the operator the ballet and the bell desk nobody answered my call nor called us back. The casino is decent besides the waitresses. They won't come up to you unless you're the chosen one or you annoy the hell out of them. The hotel itself smells a little funky. Honestly this was the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. I've been to countless hotels and never received service like this.
So extremely disappointed.  I had been to the Hash House at the M back when it was still open there and the dinner was pretty good, especially the biscuit.  Fast-forward to this morning when a friend and I had breakfast at the HH on Stephanie to understand my disappointment.A place called Hash House should have actual hash, should it not?  When I ordered the corned beef "hash" today it showed up in what looks like a large cast-iron skillet, but it appeared to be just for show, because nothing in there was cooked in that skillet.  My corned beef "hash" was just a bunch of pulled corned beef with melted swiss on top, then just thrown on top of some breakfast potatoes.  The corned beef was decent, but what part of "hash" does the Hash House not understand?  On top of the disappointing breakfast my stomach was upset most of today, and that is not a common occurrence.  I hate to blame HH, but I'm pretty sure HH was the reason for today's discomfort.My friend got the biscuits and gravy and was extremely disappointed as well.  Although he said the sausage gravy was good, he also said the biscuits were like rock-hard paperweights.  For the prices we paid it should have been an above-average breakfast.  Unfortunately, it was one of the most disappointing breakfasts we could remember.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is due to the service.  The place was quiet, very clean, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  She was the only positive part of our breakfast.
I feel as though they should change their name. They're not very express and give you no chopsticks! The food isn't bad, but you can definitely get better in Tempe. I probably won't order from them again. Seriously, what's up with that astronomical delivery charge and no receipt?
The service was very slow and the waiters not really friendly. However the food was good but over priced comparing to what you can have in other restaurant around.
Large portions, average food, and bad management.  The atmosphere is kind of cheap looking compared to all the other fine restaurants on the strip.  The dishes ranged from $18 to $30.   I was not impressed with this place, and will not go back due to the way my girlfriend was treated.  While I would give this place 2 stars (based on food quality/taste/price), my girlfriend would definitely give them ZERO stars.  Her steak, ordered medium rare, came out fully cooked and dry.  We were in a party of 12, and it took about 45 minutes for the server to bring out a new steak for her.  That steak was cooked "well" which really upset my friend.  Not only was everyone done eating, her steak was still overcooked.  The final straw was that the manager still charged her for her portion even though she didn't eat the second steak and it was not prepared as ordered. While the server was nice, I think it was wrong of management to charge her for her $28 steak when it was clearly overcooked a second time.
Disappointing. First visit, the place was extremely busy so I overlooked the quality of the food. Second visit was fairly slow, but the quality was equally as poor. Ahi was overcooked, burger overcooked, fries too salty, onion rings too greasy.
Tried for the first time about a year ago and did not like the cupcakes. Figured enough time had passed and I'd give it another go while downtown Sat evening. Unfortunately, the results were the same. Just not very good cupcakes at all.  Nobody in our party of 4 wanted to finish them. A couple stomachs, including my own regretted getting them. Too dense... something just not right about the taste.  Two stars only because the girls working were pleasant.
The food was Terrible, everything seemed frozen and reheated in a microwave. I went for brunch so I tasted their breakfast it was disgusting and their lunch was the same. Not too much to choose from and what they have is not worth it not even the desserts were good. Don't waste your money here go to the one in Cesar palace is more expensive but it's so worth it you won't be sorry. This ones just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth
I took my 2 kids their for their biannual check and clean. The lobby is small and cramped. If they have more than like 8 people waiting it is crowded. I am not sure how the cleaning went because no one but the patient is allowed to go back even for young children. I am not sure why they would not allow parents to go back with their small kids. After the cleaning was done, I did not talk with the dentist or assistant, I talked to the lady that works up front to check you in. She passes along the information like third party.  We have found a different dentist for them. Do not plan on going back here.
In August, a group of 4 bridesmaids, bride, and mother of the bride all went in to get their hair done for the big day! Appointments were made months in advance, and the bride had already done her test appointment. About 2-3 days before the wedding, they called the bride and said they had some scheduling changes, so one of the bridesmaids had to move 45 minutes earlier, okay, no problem. We all went down together for the appointment. I had a good idea of what I wanted so I went first, and I really liked my stylist. At 8:30 am the brides hair was supposed to begin, unfortunately, her stylist was not at work yet.... 8:45, 8:55, 9:05... somewhere between 9:10-9:20 the stylist walks in (after a few phone calls from another stylist at the shop), can you imagine, your wedding day hair and the stylist shows up to work 45 minutes late??? Luckily the appointment went faster than expected, but still finished late. The brides hair was fantastic, I liked my hair, and the other girls were happy/slightly disappointed. They had to touch up their own hair 2 hours later before we headed to the ceremony. There was no offerings for the late show on their part. I think offering one bridesmaid free would have been nice since it was all the bride's treat, however they didn't attempt to do anything of the sort...
Awful food.  Dry chicken.  Rude staff.  All in all a write off.  I was looking forward to trying it.  It even took a while to get served as the staff were talking about their lives outside work.
The manager of this store must have changed recently.  I find that they never have enough cashiers....while i get that is a typical Walmart thing, this store seems to be getting worse as time goes on.
Atmosphere: so-so. Restaurant itself is good, but have to go through elevators and the Imperial palace atmosphere. :-/Food: is decent. Price: over priced. Highlight: pa-jun is goodWarning: tips are included in your bill for party of six or more. First time being in a Korean restaurant that does that. Others: not a place I would take my guests to.
$10 to see Ferraris!But they're all automatics. And almost all 458s. There was 1 each of the FF and California, and 2 F430s, one of which was relegated to photo duty (poor thing). Don't worry, there are a ton of Maserati Ghiblis strewn about to catch your attention for about 0.5 seconds each.Here's a list of what you may come to see, but they don't have:Enzo599F12612575456F50F40etc. (everything built before 2009)Terribly disappointing. I was here years ago and saw an FXX in the flesh.  They do have some interesting non-Ferraris (Z8, split window Vette, Penske's Indy 500 winner), but that's not what you're here for. Next time, I'll ask if they have anything remotely interesting before paying.
It surprises me what celebrity chefs are willing to put their name on. Riva is a poolside (all outdoor) restaurant at The Venetian. We went here for lunch and I was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. Really? This is what a celebrity chef comes up with? Sad.Very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. That's it. My daughter had the cheese pizza. I had the club sandwich, which came with fries. And I got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. I could have gotten that anywhere. Why on earth would that be what Wolfgang Puck offered up? Seems crazy to me.If you want to overspend on something you can get better at your local diner...come here.
We have had mixed reviews about Cabo but it has just gone downhill recently. Took a special friend there last night and liteally had to wave our hostess down every time we needed something. The cabo roll was good but my whitefish tacos were COLD! I mean like cold tortilla, cold slaw, cold fish that had been sitting out. Did not complain because they did not seem to give a rats ass!
The place is supposed to be known for tacos. But the tacos are average at best, and no better than what you could get your local Chili's or other commercialized Mexican joint (yes, I am aware that this is Latin American--not Mexican--food).  The biggest problem that I have is with the tortilla shell.  While most people like to fixate on the protein and the toppings (similar with sushi), it's the backbone of the dish (i.e. tortilla shell and sushi rice) that is most important. And, it is clear that the tortilla shells simply came from a bag from some commercial plant--bland, chewy, gummy, and sad. Once you've had a real, homemade tortilla shell, there is no going back. I expected better from a place that has "tacos" in its name.Moving on the toppings, which I can only assume was meant to be the star of the show. We tried 7 varieties: BBQ Pork, Rio Style Chicken, Chipotle Mushroom, Chicken Tinga, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo & Potato, and Lamb Barbacoa. Some things I noted: the pork had been cooked to death with inadequate seasoning (lathering on sauce is not a remedy as I'm sure we all know from a pot roast blunder or two); the slaw on the al pastor was extremely wet and I had a mushy, wet taco in my hands by the time I got to it; it was unclear whether the slaw on the al pastor or lime crema on the lamb barbacoa had been tasted by anyone and adjusted for seasoning before it was served because the sour element was overwhelming and not balanced whatsover.  We also had the chicken empanadas as an appetizer. First of all, they were not empanadas--the flaky half-moon pastries that we're all used too. The waitress was spot on with her description:  they tasted and had the consistency of essentially pizza rolls.  So if you like pizza rolls, I guess they are fine.Finally, the hostess was terrible.  I approached her to request a table for 2 on a Sunday around 2:30 P.M.  We then sat down at the high-top bar tables (where other people waiting for a seat were also sitting) at the spot closest to her and literally right in front of her.  We watched 4 other parties who had arrived after us be seated before we asked what was going on.  Turns out that she had crossed our names off the list because she thought we had gone to the bar.  No apology, just a blank stare.I didn't try any of the drinks and don't intend to. $8 for a Dark n' Stormy is amusing; that's halfway to an entire bottle of Gosling's rum, and then I could have endless Darn n' Stormys for a month.Authentic is definitely not the name of the game. At the end of the day, you're basically paying for the modern decor, hip music, cute font on the menus, and a "safe" place to eat with your co-workers. I'll stick with my $1-2 authentic tacos at Taco Bajaa Fresh over on Copley Drive on my own time though.
I used to be very pleased with the staff and Drs. but over the past few years not so much. The staff is always changing and they don't appear to like animals. When I used to go in the staff would make over my pets and make them feel special now they rarely address them. I always feel rushed and my questions are not answered. I do not feel they truly look out for the pets best interest. I stayed with them because of the history but after so many negative experiences I have changed vets and do not intend to go back.
GONE!This place is CLOSED!  I think the Owners retired!  I ate here one time right before they closed!  The food was so poor I did not want to write a review!
To keep it short:We didn't ask for check, still eating but the waitress brought us the check, she was rude because when we complain that why we have to wait 15 minutes to order she said there is nothing she can do.Food was goodDessert was goodFor such a low service the prices are too high.
Very Slow.The first time I visited, I went through the drive thru. There were a couple of cars ahead of me, and it took a while before I got to the speaker to order.  Then a while longer before I got to the window.  Then longer still before I got my food.  Over 20 minutes but the food was pretty good.The second time, I decided to go inside and get my order to go.  This was a mistake.  The line was not moving very fast to take the orders, but the worst part was waiting for the food.  Someone would put an item in a tray on the counter and then go work on some other order.  After a while, someone would put something else in the tray, and so on.  The result was over 30 minutes from the time I placed my order until I received it, and most of it was soggy and falling apart and cold.  Luke warm would be a generous description.  To be fair, the beans were hot.The food is basically the same as the 'bertos around town, but I won't be back due to the wait.
I wanna like this place more. Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. But the delivery times are sooo bad. Worst I've ever experienced anywhere. They are always and forever late. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up. Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? Fix it!
While the food is excellent and the drinks are what you can expect from a martini bar, the service is the worst in Cleveland. My wife and I stopped in after a Cavs game on a Friday night to get a couple martinis and maybe an appetizer. It literally took 32 minutes before we even got a water, at which point we proceeded to get up and leave. We will not be returning here and never recommending it to family or friends!!
I took my wife and the girls last night to happy hour at Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was very crowded and loud.  The waitress was not that friendly and started by asking for my i.d. along with my wife's.  I find this somewhat irritating since I am in my mid forties and it is obvious that I am not under age.  We service was good but not exceptional and it matched the food.  Nothing special!  I think if you look around you can find a better deal with better quality food.
I have eaten here a few times.  The food is always good.  Not great, good.  I usually hit TBones in Summerlin.  TBones is always right on.  Hank's can take a lesson from TBones.  I ordered the petite filet.  I ordered it medium rare.  The steak was served to me rare..borderline raw.  It was chewy.  I told my server and he politely and understandingly took it back for a little more fire.  The filet was returned....possibly a new piece if meat.  As I started into it, all was fine.  However, once I hit the center, it was raw....again.  The server cleaned plates and asked me how everything was.  Now, the remains of a raw piece of meat on my plate should be a red flag.  But it wasn't.  I told him that the center was raw and he.....apologized and asked if we wanted dessert.  No thanks!Here is my takeaway....  Stick with TBones.  Service at Hank's is ok, but the servers need a lesson on "plate clues".   If there is a raw piece of meat on the plate, figure something is up and don't just jump to dessert.  Offer a free dessert, offer to take the raw piece of meat off the bill.  Neither happened.  Stick to TBones!!!I
This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!
Any place that prices rolls at $20 and pawns off imitation crab is NOT cool in my book.  Very disappointed.  Great service, nice individualized bathrooms and booth seating.  Former China Grill location.  Seaweed salad and miso cod were overly sauced.  Two pieces of toro were $34 and not the best quality.  Haven't ordered or seen a lava cake at any new restaurant in years, so of course I had to order and it tasted like something I could make at home.  Not great.  Everything edible, just really mediocre compared to Yellowtail and everything else on the strip.  Skip!
1. Odd hours. 2. Small selection. 3. Very few seats. 4. Poor air circulation. 5. Lots of really earnest Midwesterners. 6. Helpful employees. 7. Great location. 8. Parking is available.
Ugh, I really wanted to like this place but it was just terrible.My friend and I came here for a light lunch and figured we would try it out since we always go to the same places. What a mistake! We were pretty hungry and everything looked pretty good but it was such a terrible disappointment. First of all, the place is so shabby. It looks like it used to be a really cute, clean, and chic spot but has since fell into disrepair and lazy keeping. When we went up to the counter to order, it was really disorganized and the girl behind the counter beckoned another customer forward, even though we were there first. When it was finally our turn to order, I asked the girl how much for the salads in the refrigerator case and she said in a very condescending way, "They're sold by weight"...A little unnecessary, but okay, maybe I overlooked something on the menu that said that. So I ordered a "small" beet salad, which looked really yummy with goat cheese and walnuts. My friend order something hot (I can't remember, quiche or pasta or something) which took 15+ minutes to arrive at our table. While waiting for her food, I started on my beet salad, which cost $8 or $9 and was a very small portion. The beets weren't even cooked all the way through! They were huge chunks which made it so difficult to eat, not to mention totally unappetizing. I was so disappointed to have spent the money on a tiny portion that was completely inedible. My friend even offered to take me to our usual lunch spot on Queen and pay for lunch there (bless her heart) but I just said forget it and tried to eat the rest of my salad. I normally don't like to send food back unless there is a major problem with it, and in this case I didn't, but I regret not asking for my money back as I just couldn't eat it. My friend's hot food finally came and she was kind enough to share a few bites with me. It was actually pretty good, from what I remember, so that's what earned this place an extra star...Although I probably would've only given it 1.5 at MOST. We left a short while later and I bought a chai latte from the Starbucks next door to supplement my meager meal. Boo. Thumbs all the way down.
Had lunch today.  Roast beef sandwich was poor at best...could not find the beef.  Huge buns but the beef was 1/8" thick!  Way too much yellow mustard and mayo.  Had long john  for dessert...tasted like the refrigerator.  Wont be coming back anytime soon.
I had my sons 3rd birthday party here and the kids enjoyed themselves but the woman owner made it very uncomfortable for everyone. I felt like we were being watched like hawks. And when the balls would come out of the play area she would pick it up to throw it back where it belonged and told the kids they needed to keep the balls in the play area. Its a playground for christ sake. I spoke with the other parents and they too felt very uncomfortable because of this woman owner and workers actions. They charged us $240 for 15 kids which is actually suppose to b for 20 kids but it's a flat rate so we could not get reimbursed for the 5 kids that we didn't have RSVP for. I will never ever go back to this place again. Id rather go to the park where my kids can play freely and I can feel very comfortable.
My parents have leased from them for years, so it wasn't surprising that I went with them when leasing my first car 4 years ago.  At the time, their customer service was fairly good and so were their deals - so it seemed like a good idea.How times have changed! My lease was coming to an end last week and the whole experience of wrapping everything up was a giant pain in the patootie.  When I first called about wrapping everything up several months ago, it was super difficult to extract any info...but I eventually gleaned it was too early to do anything.  So I went back last month, got everything sorted...which included having to really fight against "signing up" with them again.  I eventually just told them I was giving up cars and going TTC-only in order to stop the sales pitch...which isn't true, I'm just leasing from a dealership this time (whose customer service is the best I've ever seen...that review will get 5 stars!).The new guy handling my account was the quintessential slimy car salesman...he'd ask me questions to seem interested and then interrupt me to tell me something awesome about himself. He also kept trying to put me at ease "as a woman" (yes, he said that) which just made me more pissed off since he couldn't have been more condescending about it.  I know cars, I know business...who cares if I'm a woman or not...just answer my questions.  And somehow, every single decision or conversation topic always led back to a discussion of his golf game.  Good lord.Last week they were supposed to call me on Thursday to let me know the amount owing so I could wrap everything up.  I requested several times for them to call Thursday since I was out of town Friday.  So of course, no call from anyone until I was already out of town. So I called back first thing on Tuesday after the long weekend...to which I'm told I have to bring it in first thing next day or they'd make me pay for another month.  Um...so you can take your time getting things done but I have to jump immediately?  Delightful.  So I requested the exact amount owing, as the quick turnaround meant shuffling money around from account to account, etc. to make sure everything was copacetic. So today I went to give back the car, hand over the keys and give them the cheque for the difference I owed them. Turns out they'd given me the complete wrong amount owing and it was actually almost $150 more! Um...what? What if I hadn't brought any extra cheques?  Then I'd have to keep the car for an extra day and end up stuck paying for an extra month! No way!  The guy I was dealing with was very good about it when I pointed out you can't confirm an amount with someone and then change it without telling them (my account guy wasn't able to be there as he'd decided to go golfing that afternoon instead)...and he agreed to hold the extra amount they hadn't told me about until after I get paid this week as a kindness.  He at least proved to me that there are a few people there who know what customer service actually means...too bad he doesn't handle the day to day communication with customers!Having seen the quality customer service at other car dealerships, etc...I won't ever be going back to JPL again.
Went in to get a mani pedi (gel on the nail and regular polish on my toes). The experience started off fine until the guy started my manicure. I can't remember his name but he is on the second tow the first chair, closest to the aisle. He was very friendly but he did not do a very good job on my nails. He pushed my cuticles back extremely far to the point where it was painful and made me bleed 3 times, yes 3 times on 3 different fingers. Once he started to paint my nails I noticed that the gel polish was extremely thin, but after adding the second coat it seemed fine, WRONG! So, fast forward 2 days I notice that the skin at the bed of nails are peeling like crazy and on the fingers that he made bleed had started to scab. So of course I call and explain to the women my issue and she tells me she can't tell me anything until she sees my nails. So of course I go, even though it was on the other side of town. She acts as though she can't see the scab on my finger and I'm like seriously? But I also tell her how the gel polish is seeming to crack even though it's only been 3 days since I got them done. (And gel polish shouldn't crack but that's another story). They were nice about it and were willing to fix the messed up nail, which was fine and she said that the peeling was because of dead skin. Righttttt. So after she removes the polish off the nail she says ohhh now I see the scab and I'm like uhh yea I see it and feel it. She then proceeds to pick at the scab (painful btw) until she picks it off. After finishing they give me a cuticle oil for free which was nice of them. Now fast forward one more time, tonight. I'm just relaxing happen to look at my nails and more cracking (wasn't surprised) and then I look down at my toe and guess what I saw, yep you guessed it CRACK/CHIPPED!  It's literally been a week as of today, this makes no sense. You can look at the pics and see how thin the polish is. They were very friendly so if you want a fake smile in your face while getting a mediocre mani pedi then this is your spot. But if you want your moneys worth and actually want it to last I wouldn't go here. Ohhh btw when I came in that day the guy was there and he hid in the back the entire time, I saw him peeking around the corner never once came out to apologize or even try to fix what he messed up. They get 2 stars because they were nice but quality gets 1/2 Star.
I had such an awful experience. I've never been here before or had their food. I ordered through the phone for pick up. I was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before I could even ask for the total amount (since I don't know the total with tax). I went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. I tell this balding older man I'm here for a pick up. He asks, "The two pizzas?" I said yes with a salad. He then cuts me off mid sentence to say, "yeah yeah whatever." He goes to the back to get the salad so I look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, "move where I can see you." I will never come here again. This serve was down right awful and what made it worse, I was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. The pizza is not even that good!
Oh no, Joe! Here's the problem:1.  You need to do something about the ridiculous line out the door.  Yes, you are popular.  Yes it was dinner time (on a Thursday night.) So why was there only one person taking orders?  You have two registers. Heard numerous complaints during my 30 minute wait.2.  if someone orders the havarti pesto burger, please include the pesto.  even if the person orders it without the bun.  You could put it in a condiment cup.3.  When you're making kids food, please be aware that kids are some of the pickiest diners out there and unhappy kids = unhappy parents.  The kids grilled cheese came out with some red sauce on the cheese part.  not just a little.  Therefore kids refused to eat.  Perhaps it was pizza sauce?  BBQ sauce?  Whatever it was, it shouldn't have been there.  That's $10 down the drain.  Yes, two kids meals which were 1/2 a grilled cheese sandwich each were $5. And, mommy, who went out to avoid having to cook after a long day had to go home and prepare something.4.  What's the story with the flies?  Well, of course they are expected at an outdoor place, but our table was literally swarming with them.  I noticed that the tables under the trees did not have patrons vigorously swatting these pesky creatures away.  This isn't really a complaint, just a heads up to future guests to suss out the tables before you sit down.5.  What do you do best?  I want to give you one more chance as my mom's group loves to 'lunch' here, but I just haven't discovered the magical menu item.  My husband said he's come for the last time, so I'm on my own.  I've had the sandwiches and pizzas and nothing stands out.  A couple positives to end my review:When I went back in to get my pesto, the guy who got it for me was super friendly.Food comes out quickly once it's ordered.Cool bathroom.One final piece of advice - sit on the side away from the street.  We learned this the hard way as it was a nuisance to continuously walk around the building for drink refills, taking kids to the bathroom, utensils, condiments, picking up food, etc.
Well the waitress was really nice and was working hard.    But she had to do the place on her own.   Food came out cold.   :(
I really wanted to like this place. Born and raised in the country of NC I grew up on good bbq. I will say the bbq itself is good. Negatives: portions are smallNo hush puppies on the menu (that is a southern staple at a bbq joint) I would also recommend adding French fries. Service was horribly slow and there were two tables  seated that night . Our server had no idea about the menu. I asked him a question about a side and he looked at the menu himself to see. Also when I asked about beers (bc there is no list of beers) all I got was "sycamore beers" not being from Charlotte I had no idea what sycamore beers are . I can give them the benefit of the doubt being new, however being new- I would expect the service to be top notch. This place needs major work to keep them open. Maybe just stick to being a food truck .
I came here with high expectations, I love octopus and always order Octopus whenever I see it on the menu. The octopus tacos here are $18, it's two tacos but I must say, they are generous with their portions. They give 2 big tentacle pieces per taco, and one order is enough to fill someone up. The tacos themselves however, were not good. I felt the octopus tentacle were not very fresh. The tentacles themselves tasted burnt to me, it was not cooked well. The whole taco, and what they put in it didn't match to me as well, the whole thing just tasted like a lot of burnt. I didn't like it at all. I also got the seviche, which I thought was just ok as well, the fish didn't taste very fresh to me.
It was just a "meh" experience. The portion sizes were tiny.  A very small bowl of hummus with about 8 wedges of pita.  The fattoushe salad was sooo small. Side salad portion.  It was just lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, and pita. With dressing piled on top. And the shwarma  was barely filled.  We still dropped $24 for lunch + tip.  Disappointed.
We tried this place for the first time and it was just average in my opinion. The atmosphere is great and the decor is nice. The food...is very average. The fish taco and barbacoa were the only good ones. The carne asada meat was super fatty and super salty. The guacamole and chips were delicious as well. We got the jamica drink and it had no flavor what so ever. The lemonade drink was ok.
The workers don't greet you or even go up to you to ask if you need any help buying anything. The store is alright. Nothing special inside that really makes you want to keep coming here. Basically just mostly hype beast clothes. Nothing exclusive here at all.
I got the large chicken on rocks with extra garlic sauce and the bill came to $11.73 or something. I don't think it's too much for the quantity you get. It should satisfy 2 people. However, 75c for extra garlic sauce is bullshit. My 2 stars are not for extra change I had to pay for the sauce, but for the quality of food and how it tastes. The garlic sauce is god damn too sweet and the rice is bland as hell. I definitely won't be going back and I would recommend you the same.
My family and I have been here a handful of times, and everytime the food is so good, except today. The country potatoes were way to salty, everyone in my party who got them said the same thing.. we told the waitress, who then asked us to scrape a little on a plate so she could taste them,(like we were lying about how salty they were).. I got turkey sausage  and it was cold. My son got scrambled eggs and they were really runny.. The food is honestly better when the place is packed.  The 2 waitresses that work there, Lynn and the blonde haired lady are the most rudest people I have dealt with, unless you are one of their regulars, don't expect a "Hi, welcome to biscuits"..  They rush you, they roll their eyes if you ask to many questions, more so the blonde haired lady.. The friendliest one is the bus boy. He is always so nice!  We definitely will not be going back for a long time, if ever...
She was nice and had the alteration done promptly for a good price when no one else had time. It looked good enough, but I used to sew and did not consider the alteration to be done quite as professionally as I was hoping for, especially given that it was a designer dress for a special occasion.
Food was OK I had street tacos in the lot any seasoning I had a hard time telling between the Carnitas in the   Asada tacos. I think the most disappointing was the wait 20 minutes for for tacos and very unfriendly service.
We were seated and a mature lady gave us one menu and said she would get us another one. After around 10 minutes  she came back with menu and asked if we wanted a drink. She seemed irritated that we wanted Negra Modelo. Why? She brought it and water and we ordered. No smile again. Meanwhile  she chatted with other customers and took her time with them. Several nice helpers asked if we wanted more  salsa and chips. Our server walked by several times and never asked. By now all beer is gone and she did not ask if we wanted more. When she finally brought the food she just plopped it down and started to walk away.  My partner asked if he could have more beer. She looked at me and said with an air of annoyance, " and YOU too?" We won't return!
So terrible. Insanely packed and so many venders that ruin the experience. Get rid of the venders have a few hot cocoa stands and let people enjoy the Christmas lights without being distracted by venders and bounce houses.  I had to  focus the whole night on how to walk through the ridiculous crowd!
Use the coupon or else! Service was slow even in the low season of November ... I shutter to think how it would be in summer with the pool open and not half full of diners . I  have  had  better .
First off I have to start by stating there are two Maki Restaurants right next to each other.  There is Maki I (no teppanyaki) and Maki II (has teppanyaki).Maki I (the restaurant with no Teppanyaki) is absolutely terrible.  The food is awful and the restaurant smells like lake Ontario when it smells like fish.  It was really bad and I didn't want to eat there but did.Maki II (the restaurant with Teppanyaki) used to be really good when they first opened.  Then the restaurant just went downhill.  I tried it a few more times after my amazing experience and they always seemed to disappoint me.  The waiter would glare at you when you ordered more food (Ayce Sushi) and you could tell they didn't want you to really eat that much.  When I did Teppanyaki the last time they were out of all of the expensive fishes.  We could only order some of the inexpensive fish on the Teppanyaki menu which costs over $28.00 per person (I can't remember the actual price).  I definitely left unsatisfied and don't plan on going back.
I found the portions quite small for all the dishes we ordered.   Food is decent but not out of this world and when you factor the price ($15-$16 for the dishes we ordered), the good atmosphere and service could not make this one of my go to places.  However the place is quite busy so I'm sure many people may dispute me.  Not saying it's a bad place but found it expensive for the food/portion size.
Items not in stock. :( why advertise on shelf? And on sale!?!??!  Furthermore, the manager Sofia would not provide any customer relief to discount other items. I would call ahead if you want to buy any electronics or furniture. Items advertised may not be in store, but hey if you want pens and paper you got it.
I will give it a 2 for the horrible service I had at the bar. The bar guy didn't know s___ about beer or wine. It took him about 5 minutes to even say hi. I asked for "menus" and he gave me the drink menu... after 5 mins. He asked what I wanted... then I asked for the food menu... another 2 mins. then another 10 mins. 'till he asked me about the food. There were only 4 people at the bar an about 15 in the restaurant. Food - I really liked the food and think the $9 app. happy hour is well worth it. Try the Hot stones.
Got carry out from here on a road trip back from Cleveland. Had to wait 5 minutes after our burgers came out to receive our milkshakes... We were asked why we still sitting at the bar area when we already had our food. Server was annoyed when we explained we still needed the shakes. Manager fixed it but the server should have cared more since I had already tipped her on the to go order when I ordered.
I always saw pics from this place and it looked good so thought I would try it out tonight..unfortunately it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. The service was slow!!!!!! We got seated quickly because there were a lot of open tables. However it took them awhile to ask for our orders. Even when they took our orders, they forgot some of the items. We decided to do all you can eat and started off with bulgogi, short ribs, and beef brisket..they just brought out the bulgogi and forgot the rest. When we asked for the rest, the waitress said 'okay' and made it seem like we didn't order it from the beginning. We also asked for drinks but even after 15min, they didn't bring anything (not even water). The quality of the food wasn't all that great either. Didn't leave a good impression that I want to go back again.. Only good thing is parking! Since it's in a shopping complex there's tons of parking.
The food is alright, not that great. Chicken briyani is very dry. Just went there once.
Meh, Oriental Express doesn't do it for me. Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited and of that, they only have one dish with tofu.I gave it another go recently for lunch, ordering up the 2 time mushroom with fried tofu. The tofu isn't breaded or particularly interesting, just cooked and then slathered in some dark sauce with mushrooms and a few other veggies. It's an okay dish and will work in a pinch of you like mushrooms.The vegetable eggroll was just disappointing. Soggy exterior and not so great.I will probably go back, just to try out there veggie "sushi" rolls, but I'll be going elsewhere for regular ol chino-american food.
Much better buffets in this town so look around before him choose this one it's very average food
Disappointed with this Chipotle location. The employees are very skimpy with portions. If I'm going to pay you for a bowl, you should give me enough to fill the bowl! I understand that the employees are probably concerned about running out of food. This falls now on the cooks and management. Make more food to serve your paying customers and keep portion size consistent. If I wanted a kids meal I would have ordered one. Another thing, I got a bowl recently and it had hard pieces of idk what in it!!  Not cool or ok!!!!
Very slow service,  few people here. Pad Thai was ok had an after taste. Heard another customer ask if the place had changed owners. Egg rolls small and almost burned. Thai tea was good.
I've been here twice, once with my guy and once with my mom. They bring out really yummy hot bread with butter before the meal, and even as a bleu cheese hater, I stole some of my mom's dressing because it was homemade and delicious. So, 2 stars for salad and bread.I'm not picky about where I sit in a restaurant (I'm not that jerk who insists on a booth with my nose turned up when I walk in) but the tables in this place are super impersonal and small. I felt kind of... crunchy and exposed to the group of loud men sitting 7 inches away from my table at the next table.The first time I ate here I had a meatball sandwich. The second time, spaghetti with meat sauce (which turned out to be crumbled meatballs mixed in with the sauce.) both times it was good, but even as a garlic lover, the garlic is overwhelming. Seriously, guys, those meatballs are a nuclear threat if the imbiber utters an H word. Your date will be giving you the side face ALL NIGHT LONG. You will reek of garlic for a month. Go ahead, argue with me that this won't happen because you love garlic and eat heads of it as a snack. try the meatballs. I DARE YOU. I thought the meat sauce would not have the garlic permeation of the meatballs, but the crumpled meatballs threw me for a loop. So here I sit, in a cloud of garlic odor... :) not getting any kisses tonight.The service the first time I went in, was strange. Some guy was behind the counter and I told him I needed a second to order. So he sat 2 tables away watching me. Then asked 25 seconds later if I was ready. No. 20 seconds later, are you ready? jeez, I guess I'd better be... This time, the service was better although the server was having a hard time with a family who'd ordered 1 sandwich for 4 people and insisted on a free meal because the sandwich was "wrong." So she was flustered and unable to get to my table to check on us. which I understand.I just probably won't be back.
Well, I sure feel like I just took some money out of my wallet and lit it on fire.The quesadilla appetizer was decent (though a waste of duck confit), but it all went downhill from there.The chicken pot pie entree was undersized, bland, and worth perhaps half of the $16 asking price. My wife's ribeye special, ordered medium, arrived well done in most parts and was coated with a foul-tasting char. Also offensively priced at $30. The only saving graces were the excellent beer selection and the pleasant (though somewhat awkward) service from our waiter and hostess. The restaurant itself, housed inside a repurposed old movie theatre, is a great idea that deserves better food to go with it. It's a shame that the food is so weak, because the east side needs more strong restaurants. I hope that Fracas can work out its issues.Perhaps I was asking for trouble going to a restaurant marketed via Groupon.  Despite the discount, still paid a sum that could have gotten me a stellar meal at Greenhouse Tavern.
Prepare to be dissapointed! Ooh Vegas, you gotta stay away from this one, if you want to wait for your food, wait for your drinks, and keep waiting for service this is the place to be! One star for service, 2nd star earned because there's fun stuff to do after you're done waiting, lol. The place wasn't even as crowded as you would expect, I think because the word is out on the place already, and i got there at 8:50pm to eat, way past the dinner rush and the popular 6-7:30 dinner rush. One and a half hour meal and drinks could have been finished in about half that time, just spent too much time waiting. Me and Gary Z preordered our next drink because the first drink took half an hour to get the first one, lol. At least 35 min to even take our order for food. It's a 2.5 star establishment for a reason people! Don't get your hopes up just because they reopened.
This place stinks really bad D: the only nice part of the hotel is the mcdonalds. But I'm giving two stars to the two sweetest host in  front of the lobby have us tickets to an $80 show(;
If there is a way I could give them NEGATIVE stars I would! This was my first time there and it was one of my most awful experiences at a restaurant and I probably would of received better service at McDonalds. There was about 6 customers at 7PM on a Monday night, only taking up 3 stables and a seat at the bar, with two waitresses attending to the people at the tables. So they had no excuses for having such slow service! I ordered the Chicken Provolone Philly and it was as bland as card board. If you want good food with good service, don't go to DB's. Plus the babes aren't even good looking... They were probably from their 30's-50's.
It's not that it was bad, just that it was basic "Americanized" Chinese food.  We were there for lunch and specifically went because it appeared to locally get good reviews on Yelp.  Ambiance is dreary and bland.  Service was relatively quick.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Menu was basic and did not have uniquely authentic Chinese dishes.  Comparable to a Panda Express in our opinion.  Maybe there is just not a market for Chinese food here in Pittsburgh. Again, it was not that it was bad, but not sure we will go back.
I used to go to beauty schools to get my hair done when I lived in Idaho and was wanting to find a good one now that I live in Arizona. The Studio Academy of Beauty Salon and the right price for me and was available when I wanted to get my hair done for my birthday. Called and scheduled 2 partial colors and a cut. When i arrived they only had me down for 1 partial. I showed my stylist Laurynn what I wanted and explained that I wanted highlights to match my dark brown roots and also some carmel colored highlights. Back in February I had a full highlight of blonde done and was tired of having my dark roots showing with blonde ends. So I thought getting the dark highlights would help look more normal when my hair grew out and expressed this to Laurynn. She called over her instructor Soul and they discussed what needed to be done. I didn't really listen and soon they were swatch matching my roots, which I thought was to make sure to get the highlights close to that. Laurynn started working on my hair, and only put color on the roots, let that sit, and then went and did a partial. But when she was doing it she only went to where my hair turned blonde. I started questioning what she was doing and even asked her if the dark was going to go all way down and she assured me it was. She washes it out and starts to blow dry it and I know it is completely wrong. All that she did was "touch up" the blonde for my roots. The worst part is, is that the roots of my hair don't even match the ends. They are kind of a strawberry blonde, and you can see a faint line where she stopped the color. Laurynn told her instructor that it was wrong and she came and talked to with me about it. She wasn't apologetic at all, and said I would need to come back in to have it fixed. I was okay with that until I went to pay and it was $60 for a "touch up" and then they told me it would be more when I came back to have it fixed. I was mad and didn't want to cause a seen, so I paid and left. This happened 10/21, I called Monday 10/23 to speak to a manager and left a message. I called today 10/24 and left a voicemail, each time not receiving a call back. I don't know what I am going to do now. Every time I look in the mirror I get mad because this is not what I wanted and doesn't even look good. I spent all of the money I had and now don't know when I pay to make it look how I wanted in the first place, but definitely somewhere else.
I like the apartment and the community except for one thing: THE AIR CONDITIONING. Holy crap, this is the most poorly implemented AC system I've ever had in an apartment. The master bedroom is always 6-7 degrees warmer than the rest of the apartment. We've made multiple service requests but there is nothing they can do except put a makeshift vent between the living room and the master, which did absolutely nothing (and talk about a lack of privacy in the master once there is a vent that allows noise through). One side of the house is freezing and the other is a hot box. Apparently, this has been a problem for many residents in this complex (That accidentally slipped out when we had a discussion with management). It's difficult to live here for this reason, and we're definitely not going to renew.It's unfortunate they have such a poor AC setup- this is an otherwise fine apartment. But AC is crucial in Arizona, and it's hard to just BE in the master, let alone sleep there. I've had many nights on the couch.
We went here for soup, on a day when neither of us were feeling well. We ordered one chicken noodle and one loaded baked potato soup in bread bowls. We felt like it was a little less than a small cup of soup in each because none of the bread had been carved out. It was as if soup had just been poured on top of the bread minus the top which had been cut off. Other than the quantity issue the soups themselves were okay, but the chicken noodle seemed no better than something bought in the grocery store.
I wanted to like this place. Shanghai 1938? What happened then? What does it mean?As it turns out, it means I make judgements based on the superficial and that I deserve what I get. We were 7 minutes inside the restaurant before anyone acknowledged we were there. I interpreted the dismissive wave we got to mean "sit anywhere, stupid," so we did. It took about an hour to get our food once we ordered it. I didn't expect a kiss on the lips or anything, but a "can I get you anything else" was in order. The food was unremarkable (despite my remarks about it at this time), and pricey. The chicken was mostly dark meat, which I dislike, and should have been cheaper based on the cheap cut. Incidentally, there was a refugee flight TO Shanghai starting in 1938, as it turns out. Now would be a good time for me to make a crack about fleeing FROM Shanghai 1938 in 2014, but you get the picture.
Service usually much better here but has dropped off recently. Seems they will throw anything at you just to see if you will take it. Always fix it when brought to their attention but quality control should be better on the front end.
Went for quick breakfast solo at 8am.  Setting - Simple location, somewhat sterile and bordering on warm.  Nice bar seating a window tables.  Tucked in the west corner of Piedmont Row shops.  Parking was easy in the adjacent parking deck.Food - They have waffles.  The waffles, being pre-made earlier, don't really have that freshness.  The consistency goes slightly chewy.  But dang, the offering are a diabetics worst nightmare.  Maple, bacon, quadruple berry, chocolate everything.  I just wanted a waffle with some fruit, so I went with the berry.  It was kind of a compote, with really think syrup.  My teeth just itched.  And I don't need the dollop of whipped cream to be bigger than the waffle.  This was dessert, not breakfast.Coffee was alright.Service - It was empty, so I got prompt service, and received my food at the counter in about 4 minutes.  I wouldn't go so far as to see the employee was warm or engaging, but hey, they weren't rude.Price - $7.50 for a waffle the size of my hand and a cup of coffee.  Not outrageous.I'm glad I went to check it out, but I'll stick to Original Pancake House or Terrace Cafe.
1730 Room review: bed & pillows are TerribleBathroom super smallTV 29" very smallcarpet & paint needed to be updatedthe train very hour was NOT fun Workout room was closedLobby & food court was decentStuff was friendly
Old hotel despite their best efforts to keep it updated.  Crap blew out the vent went I turned the air on.   Paneling and tile in the bathroom is worn and outdated. Price was decent, beds were pretty  comfortable.  Loooooong corridors.
Not truly gelato (not in the real Italian sense of the word), but decent enough.They should add yummy toppings to their menu - only places with mouthwatering gelatos can get away with not having hot fudge, chocolate sauce, etc.
A year later and a lot of changes happened to this restaurant. Not all of them for the better.Place is bigger, able to accomodate more. They also hired a lot more servers although still as busy so service depends on when you dine.Most importantly, the taste of both their sushi rolls and ala carte specials such as yakisoba and baby squid salad changed.Went back couple of times to make sure but I can no longer reccommend their rolls as the go to sushi even their famous las vegas roll. There just wasnt enough taste for the price. As for their yakisoba, there was a lot less ingredients than before - might as well boil plain noodle with food dye and sprinkle a packet of microwaveable vegetables....yes it was that bare. As for my old favorite baby squid..Taste was spicier and definitely saltier although they did try to mask the difference by adding more fried squid...So disappointed....
I have had shoe leather easier to chew, the pie showed up barely warm and missing its salad. When the salad did arrive it was a sorry excuse and there was no fork. The only thing going for the order was the good amount of toppings.
Quick review:  Food:  delicious.  Service:  Poor.  SLOW.  Five of us tried Lucille today for lunch.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  But, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  Lunch should not take nearly two hours.  Patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  Our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  PLEASE train the staff before you open.Our party had both the Detroit panned pizza and the Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  We all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   Not quite to the standards of Pizza Brutta, but very good.   Pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  I know the place is new and I will try again.   But, service needs major improvement.  I really want to like this place.
Update: Alright. So even though Sakana has its days when it's super amazing. Sometime I shake my head and wonder wth is going on. Today I have officially been eating here consistently for over a year. I just met the third owner of Sakana and am wondering how is it that she co-owns this place and was puzzled when I asked for half rolls... the manager was in a panic the entire time and somehow we got someone else's roll, and jacob didn't get half of this order. Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn't been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back. -------I rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. $23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. As far as the quality of the sushi, it's not fantastic but pretty good. The only downside I would have to say is, don't experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, "the shit" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.You may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items
We had a menu shoved under our door. So we only thought to look at it. Wished we had looked at Yelp first. 1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. We ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. We received one sausage and one pepperoni. 2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. Nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. 3). We ordered fried mushrooms. These were pretty good. We received 11 in the order. 4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. 5) we ordered a 2 L of Diet Coke and a 6 pack. Saying "Diet Coke" each time. I even told the story about how this is a Pepsi town and we needed our Diet Coke. What arrived?  Off brand diet cola. ...We picked this place bc of the Diet Coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. Side note:  the menu says "under new management". I feel I can say this sucks under new management. Review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. It tasted like a 10$ pizza. So I'm ok w it. ...Just to prove I'm not crazy I'm going to post a pick of the words Diet Coke...So:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the Strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price.
This club is dirty, dated and could use a face lift. Men's locker room needs more attention. If you don't have a membership go elsewhere for less with newer facility. I'm looking into other gyms
There is a beautiful rotunda where you can casually have a cocktail and overlook the strip on couches.  However, there is a mandatory service charge for food/drink and the service was non-existant.  Thanks for bringing my lunch with no napkins and then taking 20 minutes to come back.  Like most pool parties, if you are not a big-spender they ignore you.
I really had high hopes for this casino.  Even upgraded the room to thier modern rooms.  Alas, the room was great, but the maids did not service the room.  And when they did service it, attention to detail was not at the top of the list.  No towels, no refill on conditioner and shampoo.  The good thing about this hotel is I was able to see where I will be staying next time.  Ceaser's..
Nothing exceptional about the Alehouse.The beer selection is good but they were out of two of the beers I ordered. The food was average at best. The service was terrible. Our waiter was slow and seemed not to care if we had drinks or if we needed anything to go with our food. It might be a fun place to watch a game at the bar but not really a place to bring the family to eat.
We were in the mood for steak so we decided to have some there! The food tastes amazing, however the service was awful. We found a hair in our food and although the manager stop to apologized they never offered replace the meal, he offered some free drinks that we never got and the waitress was MIA...never went back to refilled our drinks and ask if we needed anything else!
There was some miscommunication between Audrey and my scheduling.Audrey express how upset she was and cancelled my future appointment with he clinic. Rather telling me in person, she did it via text.How unprofessional!But if you do go, id recommend Shar any day of the week.
Another standard ayce Japanese near my in laws'. After going to other ayces where we placed our orders through an iPad, I was reminded of the pain it was to have to wave down our server to submit and check on our orders every single time at Matsuda. Although there were multiple staffs who brought out our foods, we were only allowed to order with our assigned server. She never volunteered her time to check on our table; we had to get the other staffs to find her for us. By the time our second order was served, there was a 30 minutes of sitting/waiting around in between. Foods - mediocre at best. All the shrimp items were heavily preserved with msg. The tempura and fried times were cold when served. Sushi and sashimi took at least an additional 30 minutes after all the hot foods were brought to us. The sweet shrimp sashimi were strangely dry and salty. The best item of the night coming from an ayce Japanese was unfortunately its ginger steamed milk. The ginger taste was distinct and the dessert for the majority of the time was served hot. Forget about mediocre sushi and sashimi, I chose to fill my stomach with multiple orders of this instead. Overall - save your money for a la carte restaurants instead. I can guarantee you that there are many greater options in GTA!
Came here quickly today to grab a burrito with a co worker. The food was okay for fast food type meal but the service wasn't. I ordered with a rude woman who sounded like we were in-convincing her. She verbally corrected everything I said with a rude undertone. Okay... I don't eat here and j don't know the technical names of the menu items but I know I want a burrito why does it matter..... We get to the window and we sit there for a few moments before being acknowledged. We paid she handed us the food and slammed the window. Maybe she was having a bad day.. Not sure. Gaiety is the ticket name on receipt. Won't come back no wonder food like this is cheap
First time I ate here I got food poisoning. I had a honey mustard chicken wrap. Thought it would be safe but I was in bed and the bathroom for two days. No bueno. Needless to say I'll be avoiding the food here for a while.
Scenery is very nice food not so nice ordered bacon wasnt fully cooked ordered toast wasnt toasted ordered sliced tomatoes w basil got a little cup with mostly juice and a few tomato cubes in a cup about 1 oz no basil and unseasoned eggs. maybe just an off day for the cook hopefully it will b bettet next time.
Dinner for three started out great.  A wonderful venue, open kitchen, quickly seated, and the food sounded good, but their timing was off, not once, but throughout the meal.  First, the wine was delayed.  Second, as we were enjoying our appetizers (not  1/2 done) of a wonderful meatball, naked mozzarella, and delicious bread along come the entrees.  I sent them back - there was no room for them on the table and secondly we were not going to rush. Then when ready, they came out again and clearly not the same items, but freshly prepared pastas Arrabiata, Bolognese and a Capri Salad - all delicious.  Next we order dessert, and wait, and wait, and wait.  Finally, I say forget it, just the bill.  Well, I am told we are just plating them.  I explain we've finished our coffee and need to move on.  At which point the manager arrives and offers us the desserts for free.  I decline because at that point we do not want them.  She was very gracious and offered to make it up to us.  The food was quite good.  The atmo was nice - although initially a bit loud with a raucous party nearby, but after they left, much better on that front. But, I cannot ignore the whole event and just speak to the food when rating them.  They need to work on their timing.  The practice of having multiple players look after you, may be efficient (wait staff, runners, etc.), but it really didn't work this time.
Friend and I came last week for sandwiches to be told that they didn't receive they're shipment and had no food to serve. Came back today and when I ordered I was told they're out of tomatoes. They're also out of straws. And after waiting for 10 minutes for my sandwich was also told that they're ALSO out of chicken... might want to rethink their suppliers and hire more to speed up their service!!
When will the food hype finally understand that BIG does not necessarily equate to GOOD? Primanti Bros was featured on TV for its enormous sandwiches, which in addition to a generous helping of meat also feature fries stuffed in between two slices of bread. That's what made them famous, that's what got them on national TV.The quality is above average, and as expected, the fries just add more bland carbohydrate-ish taste and additional calories to an already unnecessarily calorific sandwich. The meat itself is good quality, but also nothing to write home about.The short: overrated, nothing special, there are better sandwich shops to be had for the price.
I used to like this store, but I will shop anywhere but here now. The last straw was the seemingly endless renovation, which made it difficult to find basic things in the store (they didnt put up signs to let people know where things were). But before that, I have had to return chicken over three times, as it was bad when I got it home and opened it to repackage it for the freezer.  I finally figured out WHY the meat was bad - I went to the meat section to pick up chicken that was on sale, and it was in trays on skids waiting to be put out.  So I walked the store for about 30 minutes, came back, and the same meat was sitting there unattended, and no one had even made a dent in putting it out. There must have been 7 or 8 large trays stacked high, and I imagine it would have taken a good 30 minutes to put it into the refrigerated display cases. Which means the chicken was out of refrigeration for at least an hour. No wonder the poultry I buy is bad!And the bagging thing - that is another irritant. When it is busy on a Saturday, would it hurt to have a few baggers on hand to help out?
Ché was good, i ordered #1 . Girl was not very helpful, she just greeted us but did not say anything else .( we were the only customers ) Did not asked us if we need help or know the concept??It was my 1. time there so had no clue what i get.Anyway my dring was good, not sweet at all (which i like and ordered) I wish I would ordered it with coconut milk would tasted better I think.Mister did not liked it at all. He ordeeed #4?I think the ladies there should be a lil bit more helpful or at least ask if they can help to choose the Perfect drink as there are so many options to choose from.
my dad & his wife wanted 2 go 2 this place 4 dinner so i took them. they seems 2 rave about this place but i wasnt impressed at all. my dad & i both had 2 fish rolled up tacos & a shrimp burrito. i like my fish tacos better grilled & in a soft corn shell, not fried. the shrimp burrito didnt have that much flavor 2 it. it was just 2 much tortilla & i dont like that at all. my dads wife had some beef tacos & she seemed 2 like them. ive  definitely had better mexican food than this!
The food was just ok.  Had a salad and onion rings.......we did order spinach dip for the group and that was solid. Service was really bad tho........our server was too busy paying attention to others.......he screwed up a few times.....but the big one was when I told him no cucumber since I am allergic.
I am not a fan of this location. I'd rate the location at Town Square at about a four after many visits, but my visits to this location have amounted to a two star. Maybe I'm in the minority here because their parking lot is jam packed every time I drive by here. I'm thinking the appeal may be strictly related to alcohol and TV. The food I've had here just hasn't been good, mediocre at best. I wouldn't say the food on the standard menu is expensive, but it's overpriced for the quality. On one of my visits I came here for Happy Hour with coworkers and the food for that was acceptable, but not great. It was cheap at least. This spot just isn't my type of place. I'm more of a Yard House gal if I'm going to a sports bar.
The cookies were hard and came out while we still had our food. Refills took forever and just really didn't care for the wait staff.
Mediocre tacos. The tortillas were cold and so was the meat. I ordered beans and the beans taste as if they were straight out of a can. Overpriced for the tacos but they did have a decent salsa bar but I wished the salsa was actually spicy.
I've never been a big buffet guy but decided to try this for lunch with some coworkers. I was very disappointed, with both the food and the service. The waitresses were up my ass the entire time, as soon as I drank half of my water, they were ready to refill it.        I wasn't able to even hold a five minute conversation without being rudely interrupted. As for the food, the chicken was a bit dry as well as the pizza. Food seemed like it had been sitting all day.    Only positive I came out with was the decor of the restaurant, authentic Chinese designs and bridge lead you into the dining room. Also live fish also fill the pond in the restaurant. Overall disappointing food, unless you're going here to take snapshots, which I doubt then you should probably stay away.
Ugh...really wanted to like this place, but the food is overpriced for the substandard quality.We met my niece and her fiancée for dinner as they live in the area...and we opted to dine out on the patio, which consisted of wooden picnic tables on a street level patio.When we arrived, we were seated and our waiter was over shortly thereafter.  I asked if they had lemonade or iced tea. Was told no. Asked if they had diet coke..was told yes. Waiter came back and said they only had coke and sprite. One of my dining companions asked what type of juice they had...and the waiter responded "orange/mango, or strawberry lemonade". Um...didn't I ask if they had lemonade? Anyways, it was $4 for something which I drank in about 4 gulps.We were then told that wine was half price...so one of us ordered a white Pinot. A small glass of white Pinot...half off...came to $8/glass. So normally it would be $16? If that's the case, it's highway robbery.On to the food.Person one ordered the "new" burger...as its new to the menu. The person who had this said it was ok...but not worth the price. He said the fries were excellent.Person 2 ordered the fish and chips...it came with coleslaw (according to the menu, their famous coleslaw). The fish was not identified on the menu but he believes it was haddock, a much cheaper cut of fish. The person who had this said it was over battered. 2 of us had the pasta of the day.....lemon/bacon/onion in a cream sauce. It came with kernels of corn, which I opted not to have and my niece asked for on the side.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a pasta dish in my life. The bacon, while having a nice smokey flavour, was mostly fat, so it was inedible. I could barely taste any hint of lemon....and the portion size was far too small for a $16 price point. The pasta. Fresh though.Dinner for 4, with the above food items, with 3 glasses of wine (half off), 1 juice, 1 sprite, 6 beers, tax, tip, came to over $160. Completely not worth it. All 4 of us, while walking back to our car, agreed we would not be returning.
Kevin did my nails and I totally adored them but it seemed like he rushed and left a lot of bubbles in my nails. I paid $44 for a mani pedi and my nails are for prom like cmon now. My nails should be spotless.
I go there because it is open 24 hours however there is an issue with homeless people sleeping in the group rooms, handicap bathroom, men's locker room and even in chairs in open areas of the gym. Since LA Fitness took over from 24 Hour Fitness the club is not as clean.  Not sure if they are all open 24 hours or not.
I use to love this place but the last few times I have been there they completely fell off. They served me a meal I always get that was missing 4 out of 5 veggies. They never notified me they were missing items, I had to figure it out on my own. I had to ask them to rectify the situation with some other items which they did but the dish did not taste the same. If they are out of things they should just tell people before they order it. Another situation I ordered an appetizer that never came, turns out they did not have anymore of it. Once again just notify the customer so they aren't expecting their food to come.
I really wanted to like this place because I live within walking distance and I love sushi. One problem: there were little bones in my sushi roll. If I'm paying $14 for a roll, I feel like there shouldn't be bones in it, call me crazy. Otherwise it was ok, a little pricey and the service was nothing special. Won't be coming back unless someone else really wants to.
We came with a party of 12 for a birthday dinner buffet on a Thursday night.  I don't know what is going on and why sushi buffets are so insanely busy on weeknights now?  The restaurant is pretty big but it was a full house with people waiting to be seated in the wait area.  We used to dine here when it was Tako Sushi but haven't been since it switched to Matsuda.  We were seated right away which was nice.  They put us in a room near the front....which I thought was nice at first.  But no one was looking after this area.  Literally no one came in to check on us and take our orders.  I had to run out to the main restaurant and drag a server into the room to take our order after sitting there for 30 mins.  Then because we had a large group and a large order, I think the kitchen and sushi chefs pushed out all the small orders first.  It was another 30 mins before our food trickled out when smaller tables that arrived after us were eating way before us.  We were all starving by that point so polished off the food in like 5 mins.  We put in another order.  I of course had to run outside and drag the waiter into the room again.  We made a bigger order this time since we were still starving and it takes so long between orders.  We waited another 30 mins and they brought out 3 bowls of mussels with 4 mussels in each bowl which worked out to 1 mussel each person.  Then another 15 mins later....another small order comes out.  By that time we were all tired and cranky so didn't feel like eating anymore.  We asked them to cancel the majority of our order.  We then asked for dessert.  Had to wait another 20 mins to bring out ice cream.  Wtf? We figured it was pre scooped! By that time the restaurant cleared out.  We were the last ones there.  I think 2 seatings ate and left.  We all left tired and still hungry after a 4 hour marathon of a weeknight meal.  Wasn't cheap either for about $30 a person.  The food that we did eat was good which is the only reason for the 2 stars.  Sushi and sashimi was fresh.  The service was just incredibly slow and they didn't even make an effort to check in on us at all.  It was really annoying having to run around the restaurant to drag people in to take our orders, refill our water and tea because we were parched and the orders took forever and didn't come out right.  They need more of a first in first out system rather than big tables last.  I complained but it fell on deaf ears.  My uncle and aunt tried it out, just the two of them and it was fine.  Just don't go with a large group.
Set me out Brunt food left real bad taste in my mouth.i would think they would take some pride in their cooking!
This place was much better when Tony was in charge! Not sure what happened, but now it's run by a bunch of inexperienced kids.
I had a Chicken Shorba Lunch Plate it was 8.99 ..pita bread and Chicken was Super Dry ...fries were soaked in salad whey got to me .. i will not recommend to any one
The spaghetti  i ordered was just like a kid meal, even though as afternoon tea meal cheaper than regular order, still not acceptaible.
First time at this venue. When I walked in I was pretty impressed! It looks great! Then we get to the vending. $15 for a beer and $20 for a cocktail is pretty ridiculous. Then we get to the concert. The band was amazing but the acoustics were awful. I understand that lawn tickets are cheaper because you're not going to get as good of an experience, but when I can hear everyone around me talking while the band is playing, the music isn't loud enough!!! There were speakers in the lawn area that didn't even sound like they were turned on. I was super stoked for the concert but left kinda disappointed because of the venue. I could've even overlooked the overpriced drinks if the sound was better.
This is a relaxing pool to go to. Girls are free per usual. Guys are only 10 bucks. If you check in on yelp you can get a free admission pass. I went with four girls and one guy, Daniel, so I made him use the yelp offer. Daniel had already paid the ten bucks so I told him to get a refund. When Daniel went to the man in the front, the man was giving so much attitude. This man told Daniel that he had never seen this yelp offer and that he could not honor it... I was watching all this unfold from a distance. So I went up to the worker and told him that the yelp offer should be valid. I mean at this point we didn't care about the admission cost, we were being taken advantage of. So Daniel asked for a manager. The same worker said the manger didn't pick up. We told him we would wait. Finally, the manger came down and he instantly honored the yelp offer. They manager just took down my yelp user id and that was that. The manager was so professional and didn't make a fuss like the other employee. The manager was nonchalant about the mix up and gave us three free drink vouchers.
Great food and smoothies but horrible customer service. Everyone working still speaks as if they are in high school and being forced to talk to you when taking our order. They used to be 24 hour drive thru but recently changed it to close at 2am. Tonight me and another car in front of me arrived at the same time, 1:30, after the car in front of me sat there for five minutes he pulled off it was then my turn. No one ever greeted me through the intercom I repeatedly said hello? Hello? Only to never be answered and follow he car in front of me by leaving. As I left I knocked on the window and still no one came it was only as I slowly drove off in he parking lot could I see someone emerge from the back where they were hiding. Very disappointing that they have employees like that. Wanted a good healthy meal at 1am but this poor employee stopped thy from happening. Really wish this employee would suffer some type of disciplinary actions. Other than the service I really do like their food and smoothies.
We tried a lot of items on The Brunch Menu. I would not recommend The Shakshuka or The French Toast. The Shakshuka was terribly seasoned and The French Toast had this off taste my daughter took 2 bites and was done. I would possibly go back to try their normal menu. I've heard good things about the vegan options. But brunch ... no. DJ was awesome food was not.
I am a very frequent customer here since before the remodel and today I was so disappointed. I go in for a pedicure and a dip manicure. The pedicure was okay. Good massage but she seemed very inexperienced. The design I wanted to get, she didn't want to do it so I had to settle for a big snowflake. It wasn't even done with a good job just kind of lazily put on. The dip manicure is what really got under my skin. She didn't even know how to do it. She had to keep stopping and asking questions and taking it off and redoing it. I asked for a French tip with a Christmas tree design. The tips aren't even. The line is shaky. And for the design, It was terrible. I asked her to take it off and she got all pissed off and finished the manicure just like that. I'm so disappointed with the service today.
Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better.
We went there cuz was recommended on one of the food shows.  Aside from alot of food, I was really not impressed.  Was just so much and flavor got all mixed together.  Very good service.  But will also cause a heart attack if go too often.  And we also got a mango drink.  Was in this hug glass.  But too sweet for my taste bud.
SO DISAPPOINTED!  I had been a regular at this restaurant because of the delicious food and the servers.  I went back today after a couple months away to find that they have changed owners, changed personnel, and CHANGED THEIR FOOD!  First of all, the took the professional looking menus and changed them into printed ones with spelling mistakes.  Then, they raised the prices.  The food was not as flavorful and did not have the same taste.  They got rid of my favorite mustard sauce and replaced it with shrimp sauce...not nearly as good.  Service was S..L..O..W..I almost got up and left.  The server was nice enough, but new and didn't know much..I didn't see any of the servers that used to be there.  The only plus is that they now have happy hour until 10pm throughout the restaurant...For the cost and the raised prices, I can definitely do better.  And that makes me sad.
I'm actually very disappointed to have to leave a negative review. I ordered takeout consisting of steamed dumplings and pineapple fried rice. The dumplings were not the traditional ones, but were actually shu mai. This is not a big deal because I like both, but there were only four in the order (for $6) and the sauce was not good. I couldn't quite put my finger on it so I had my husband taste it and he agreed that something wasn't right. Although the pineapple fried rice portion was generous (as it should be for the higher prices compared to other local Thai restaurants), it basically just seemed like the standard ingredients doused in soy sauce. Again, no great flavor and even something that just tasted a little off. I was also a bit put off by being charged a good bit more than the prices listed on an online menu that I had checked beforehand. I didn't make a stink about it and was hopeful that the food would be worth the extra money, but it wasn't. Lastly, when I went to pick up my order I was immediately smacked in the face by the odor of raw fish when opening the door and waiting for the hostess. There were about 4 people dining inside and I can't imagine how this did not ruin their experience. There are so many other great Thai restaurants in the area and even right up/down the street in Squirrel Hill that there's no need to waste your time on this one.
I have to be fair and say that the operations manager contacted me. We are working on a resolution. This counts for something. Will update upon resolution...
This place sucks.  If you're going to pay over 10 bucks for a meal consisting of a sandwich, fries, and a drink, it better have actual table service.  This place is a cafeteria style establishment which serves inferior versions of all your favorite deli sandwiches.  I've eaten at this place for lack of alternatives within walking distance of where I worked, but eventually decided that as far as overpriced sandwiches are concerned, Duck and Decanter across the street is a notch above this.
I will never go back to the DMV unless I have to. The DMV has a text messaging service that will text you on your cell phone to tell you how long and how many people are head of you. With this service you are able to leave and know exactly how much time you have. I had to wait 4 hours to be get service. Try to accomplish what you need from the DMV online.
This hotel doesnt provide tooth brush and paste. What a suprise! The lady at the front desk was rolling her eyes all the time when we checked in.
This is a brand new Five Guys in Gastonia and not one of the better ones I've visited. After visiting other Five Guys, I knew what to expect and this location definitely let me down. I was very disappointed with the hamburgers they served for my family. The fries were tasty and well cooked. The burgers where dry and somewhat overcooked, definitely not the standard of the Five Guys I've been to such as the one at North Lake Mall. You can pass this one up because it's not what you'd expect or deserve.
Will not be returning.  The dimsum was sub par but the service was good.  However.... without the food being good, good service makes no difference.  Save your money - its worth the trip down to c-fu and needing to pay a little more...
Menu is a scam. Mediocre taste. Next time I'd visit Ramen Bar right across the street.
Possibly the most overhyped establishment in Allegheny County. If you're not a regular, you will be ignored by those who're tending bar. Beer selection is okay, the prices are good and the service is terrible. I would go here, but only if it was someone else's idea.
I had a couple of gripes about this place, that left me unimpressed. For one, it took them 20 mins to finish our order...this seemed long for a sandwich place with ~4 lady's working. But, my major issue was when I got home I saw they had switched up our order too, totally wrong sandwich for me and they put mayo on mine despite my specific request to not have it. I know mistakes happen so...I called them about it and the worker who answered the phone had no phone etiquette. After hearing my complaint she shouts to her coworkers "who made the firehouse sub? You messed up, ya, you give her the wrong sandwich. (Loud sigh) let me talk to my manager, hey this lady is calling cause we gave her the wrong sub, ya I know it was ___ she knows she messed up." SO Awkward. I decided to not go back after that weird interaction even though they offered to replace it.
The concept is awesome .Its $60 an hour. So it will be pricey if you think this is a date night kind of place. I guess limited space they need a deeper surcharge. I went on week night and they don't have any half an hour rate or weekday special to play the foot pool. So we decided to sit at the bar and eat. Drink menu was reasonable but we were hungry. Thought we would start with an appetizer- and that's where we stopped. Our Margarita pizza looked atrocious and tasted even worse. Raw basil on cheap cheese on a wet pizza dough that didn't look like it was cooked.I didn't mean to be rude- but when the waitress asked me how the food was, I honestly responded "Trash". I am sorry but I get cranky when I am hungry and having to eat that made it worse. Luckily there are other food places around and that solved it because that app gave me a good impression of the rest of the menu.I apologize for being rude as the servers and all the staff were genuinely helpful and very friendly.I might be back with a larger group and have drinks and rent the foot pool area.Food is bad- eat before you come!!
From started the outside of this place looks like it's run down and there's two separate entrances but only one works but the other one doesn't have like any sign or anything Came in on a Sunday around 3pm with my dad and we kind of expected it to be busy and it wasn't. In fact, Us and another table were the only ones there and his place is huge. As we walked in there was a really nice waitress who showed up our seats and was really helpful but The service was VERY SLOW.  even though it was basically empty. the food was good. I got the chilaquiles verdes and my dad got a cocktail 7 mares which he said he wished there was more than just 4 shrimps but it was good. I didn't like is that they aren't consistent on how you pay your check, The other table had the waitress drop off and pick up the check and we were told to go to the front cashier which I don't mind but I just don't understand why would be different.
The only plus to this place was that the bartenders are on their game, otherwise leave it for the Jersey Shore wannabes and slooters that get turned on by extra extra medium Tap Out t-shirts.
As my Valentine night is coming to an end after a fabulous dinner in downtown Tempe we decide to stop at MWC for the first time on our way home at about 10:30.As we get our drinks in front of us, the music stops and the packed Cellar starts to file out the door. Wait....What?  The place is packed on a Saturday night and you close at 11pm? Ummm......ok.  We get our bill......$19.27 for a beer and a glass of house pinot?  Where am I? Thanks but no thanks, I doubt I'll be back. I really wanted to like this place too.
I dined at the bar during my stay here at Caesar's. I had to wait for just a few minutes for a seat to open. I got their white peach margarita to start. The margarita was made strong and well. I couldn't taste the white peach but it was very good nonetheless.I ordered my appetizer and entree based on the recommendation of the bartender. The blue corn pancake with duck for appetizer and the ancho chile honey glazed salmon for entree. The blue corn pancake was more like a crepe which paired perfectly with the BBQ duck. This dish was very good! The salmon was cooked well but unfortunately it was too salty to eat. The first few bites were delicious - smokey flavors with a sweetness - but once I was working towards the middle of the filet, it became just salt. Then I found a big bone in my salmon as well. I left the rest of the fish untouched - at this point, it was inedible.I rarely send back a plate and I did not send it back this time either. The bartender noticed and asked so I told him what was wrong with the dish. He offered the kitchen to remake it for me, which I appreciated, but it was late and I was already thrown off by the dish.I was disappointed by my experience with the entree at Mesa. I wished it was edible.
I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011.  I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience.  On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.  I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.  Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.
I have a blast evertime I go to Dos. The ONLY downfall for me is the DJ plays the same music everytime! Seriously has the same playlist and ive asked him to play certain songs and he says he will.....buuuut doesnt .I know alot of people who go there and say the same! So listen up owners.......add more music!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe a suggestion box or ballot forms ? We buy a drink, we get to pick a song! just a thought
Really disappointed by the Pad Thai here, the standard non Thai style red sauced Pad Thai with absolutely no tamarind flavour. Just red sauce and chilli. I don't understand why they would label it Authentic Pad Thai on their menu, this is just insulting... The mushroom tom kha soup was ok, but mostly broth and only a few mushrooms. The avocado peanut stir fry was the best thing I ordered. I probably won't reorder.
Lawry's is an old school restaurant.  Proper attire and etiquette are still observed here.  This is all good and well, except that they also seem to hold onto the addage that kids should not be at the table.I have come here before a couple of times, and have always enjoyed my food and the pomp and circumstance.  I had however, never brought a child with me.  Now that I have a grandson, we do take him everywhere and expose him to as much as we can.  (it's what I did with my kids too).  I really didn't think it was going to be an issue.  We made reservations early, we were there at opening.  The hostess was happy and very accommodating.  She asked if he was allowed to color, and I said yes, but he doesn't understand the concept of paper and would draw on your tablecloth.  She responded with that is quite alright.  We don't do the laundry ourselves, anyways.  I thought WOW, they are really accommodating.  She brought my grandson, the crayons and the paper.  We had been introduced to our server, I believe a Mrs. Bender.  She was all business and IMMEDIATELY corrected my grandson for drawing on the tablecloth and took away his crayons.  With a tisk tisk.  Between her and another server, there was a lot of eye rolling going on.  They were not happy that a child was at THEIR table.  I was very offended by all this, but because we were someone else's guest and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet.Lawry's you get a ZERO for service this night.  You have no patience for your younger guests.  Your food was good, but with the competition you have in Vegas now, I won't be rushing to your doorstep anytime soon.
I have been there. I believe more than once. I was not in awe by this gallery.It was Ok.I thought it would be bigger and have more art, and flair.I guess not.I am glad it exists, I guess its good to have a touch of historical fine art in a casino, since the city of Las Vegas has very few fine art museums.
My girlfriend and I just finished having lunch at Clever Koi Phoenix. The food was delicious but took a long time to come out. Guests who had arrived and were seated 5-10 min after we ordered, received their meals before we did. That could have been overlooked but the service we received was absolutely awful. It seemed like a battle to get more water while we were waiting for our food. The bartender filled up our waters half way and then never returned to fill them back up. It's hot outside and water should be the one thing that never stays empty at a table. Overall the food was decent but the service is what will keep us away.
Does anybody work here anymore? I went here for Christmas shopping and wanted to buy a watch. There were about three other customers all ready to buy a watch but couldnt find anybody working that could help us out.
Disappointed that the restaurant's success has lead management to drop the complimentary chips. The explanation by our server as to waste made a little sense -to a point, since one bowl could still be offered gratis upon request (they promote consumption of good but higher margin cocktails!)That said the rating still would have managed 5 stars had we not been overcharged $2 each for the shrimp burritos we enjoyed. While the menu clearly indicated that they were under the flat taco / burrito price in the banner for the group- as only whitefish and pork belly carried a premium- our waitperson still challenged us and had to bring in the manager. The manager did make the adjustment but only after serving up a lame and nonsensical excuse / explanation about "new" menus - while only the ones that we ordered from matter  While we enjoyed our meal, we had the sense that we were not appreciated and will be faced with unsupported rising prices at on future visits.
We came here after discovering Pho Kim Long had a 1.5 hr wait. We really didn't care where we ate, as long as we got some pho before heading home back to LA. This restaurant is really the epitome of: sit, order, eat, pay, leave. I had to hold my menu up and repeatedly ask for service before someone came to take our order. And even then they were in some sort of rush that they got two of our orders wrong. After that I didn't even bother to ask for anything else. The bill is paid at the front 'cause apparently nobody there got time to help you out. The food is your typical pho place food. Nothing spectacular and nothing horrible either.
It's OK.  The food is pretty good, but not great by any means.  The prices are expensive, too.  $13 for some veggies, LOTS of sauce and a few tiny pieces of chicken?  Not so much.
Once upon a time, before i started yelping, I loved hanabi because you get your bang for your buck and I thought It was amazing ..that was before I knew better.Coming back to reminisce my high school memories, I was utterly disappointed. Yelp had turned my taste palate into a diva ! Once seated and ordered, we were brought a dozen of starters like soup, salad, congee (random, I know!), fried salmon, tofu and edamame beans. Once my food came I understood why they gave away so much free apps.On the menu, Order J looked like it had everything I craved: assorted sushi, sashimi, tempura , and maki rolls..... But what came on my plate was 8 pieces of pre frozen salmon, 4 pieces of California roll, and a hand roll. My friend ordered something completely different and he got the exact same stuff. Nothing on my plate even remotely looked like the food I thought I ordered. The tempura was definitely the worse I've ever had. There was zero panko batter. Just a small piece of fried shrimp.You'd spend 12$ here ... Why not spend the extra 5$ to get yourself some quality sushi ?I'd give one star... But because it is so damn cheap, I guess that's one thing you have to sacrifice : quality.
Very clean hotel.jacuzzi is very huge,shower and bathroom are huge and clean.view was nice although it was the back of the hotel.lobby was nice and valet was great.now the bad.tv kept freezing every few hours for several minutes at a time.we were on the 55th floor and heard the train EVERY night all thruout the night loud and clearly.im a freight train engineer for u.p. and thats the last thing i want waking me up away from work,so that makes 6 nights of broken sleep all night,never good.i would not stay here again as we all know in vegas most people are in their hotel only to sleep.
I don't understand what people see in this place. I can honestly say that I was not blown away by anything I ate there (nor were any of the other people I came here with). The ribs were bland and had no discernible smoke ring. The brisket was not freshly cut and was very dry with no smokey flavor. I was not impressed by their BBQ sauce or any of the sides.  When I hear people talk about the food here, they say, "The BBQ is good for Pittsburgh..." People should not use the location of a restaurant as a justification for it not being as good as other places. There are plenty of great restaurants in Pittsburgh that stand on their own and can go toe-to-toe with places all over the nation. Don't settle.
Walked in here on a Sat evening and saw a pretty packed house. Great vibes, loved the interior, and hostess was quick to find us a place to sit. Once we sat down, we realized this was a really trendy place. Honestly the menu was hard to understand and nothing really stood out. Waiter barely knew English so we had to repeatedly ask twice for the same thing. Overall portions are quite small but tasty. This is a place more for starters and to have a beer. Would not recommend this place for dinner.
Maybe. Don't go off lunch hours because you're gonna get old food. Maybe it would be better during peak times.
Food was just ok. This is your typical "Foody" "hip" "pub".. So if this describes you, you will love it. Definitely not a "family" restaurant & over priced for me.
Not helpful when it comes to Memberships and problems with add-on services. Dont hang out at Gates to help customers with problems
We arrived about 1:30 for the Saturday lunch buffet.  We paid our $14.99 plus tax and expected to have a great "lunch" with lots of selection.  We had seen nothing advertising this as a "brunch" because had we realized it was more of a brunch than lunch, we would not have gone.  Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed to see have the lunch food really breakfast food.  There were very few vegetables offered.  What we did have was very good but return trips to the buffet were just repeats of what we had previously because of limited lunch choices.  There were just too many breakfast options for someone thinking they were there for lunch. There was a huge selection of desserts.  So, the pastry chef must have been at work.We didn't find the staff very friendly.  It started with the cashier who interrupted our conversation when we were paying to address another individual.  We thought we were polite with meat carver with our "thank yous' but never once did he acknowledge or return a comment.  We thought him rude.  Sever became friendly the closer it got to tip time. Pastry counter server was the friendliest.This was quite disappointing. We'd recommend Golden Corral as a better lunch alternative.
The $10 (and above) burger is commonplace in brew pubs and concept restaurants these days.That doesn't mean the burger should be 10 bucks or eaters should put up with 'em. HopDaddy is the latest, clearest example.We went on a Wednesday night, right before the rush of diners. I ordered the prime time, the missus the s'hroom burger. I was told the PT is served medium rare and was asked if I'm OK with it. Great. What came out was a soggy, well-done burger -- did they keep the patty in a steamer, like some fast-food joint? -- that was flavorless.The missus' burger was better but also overcooked.The bun is just not right -- it's way too soft and weak -- for a burger.The fries and beers are the best thing about our visit, although you have to wonder about $5 for a side of fries and $6 for draft beer served in a margarita glass (well short of a pint).Lastly, and it's not a small point, the concept of HopDaddy seems like an afterthought. It's poorly thought out and executed: you ordered on your own, then once seated, get "full wait service"? The wait staff provides no insight or service, save asking whether we needed anything else with our naked fries (yes, ketchup is upon request and served in small paper thimbles, just like McDonald's) and bringing the check.One might drop in for a brew if shopping in the area. Else there are many more options for a better burger experience.
Avoid this place! I ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! Ridiculous. No one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. I started off with a $7.99 pizza! How in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! Workers are all incompetent. I was shocked when I received my total. I told the cashier that ALL the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. The cashier's response was uhhhhh I just moved here from out of state. He looked like a deer in the headlights. I told him I'm never coming back. No offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.To be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. Go to MOD or Pieology instead.
This place is a dump and the only good thing in there is the carve steakhouse. The buffet is disgusting and nasty. The clientele are lowlifes. The staff is terrible and so is the gaming. Avoid this place!!
I did not think the food or service was good at all.  I left half my lunch on the plate.
I have heard great things about this place, and even though I work in South Chandler, I decided to travel the 20 miles one way up to Phoenix to try this place. The quality of the food was good, I ordered the Bogey. But, it did not have tomatoes on it. I only discovered this after I drove the 20 miles back down to Chandler. I was extremely disappointed. I called to let them know (it's all about word of mouth these days ) and the lady was quite helpful and assured me I'd get a cookie next time I come in. But I won't come in again. I just won't take time to babysit and quality check sandwiches after I get them from here. 'Ain't no one got time for that.'So I won't go again. I still believe the quality of the food is good, just make sure you check your order to ensure what you asked for is what you got.
As a first-time customer to the establishment, I was looking forward to celebrating my boyfriend's birthday by taking him to watch the UFC fight, which they were featuring on pay per view.  My boyfriend and his buddy arrived early (about an hour before I did), just so he could be sure that we would have good seats (the ONLY thing he wanted for his birthday was to see this fight).  I made sure to let the server know that we were celebrating his birthday (discreetly, I wanted him to be surprised).  We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers; shortly thereafter two more friends joined us at our table.  After finishing our appetizers and a second round of drinks, we were approached by a different female server (or hostess), who asked us if we were staying to watch the fight and if so, we would have to pay $9 each.  We were startled because we were not informed of this (none of us, even though we arrived separately), but we obliged and asked that it be added to our checks.  About 5 minutes later, another staff member approached us and asked us if  we had paid to watch the fight (we told her yes and showed her our wristbands).  5 minutes later, yet a third staff member interrupted to ask if we had paid to watch.  At this point, we were beginning to get a bit ruffled because their tone was almost accusatory and we were paying customers.  The real kicker occurred when a security guard approached the table immediately after to inform us that our table had been reserved and that unfortunately we would have to move.  We were completely taken aback (we had ordered 2 rounds of drinks at this point, 2 appetizers, and were deciding on entrees--we were essentially mid-meal).  There were no "Reserved" signs on our table when we were seated (in fact, the table the security guy moved us to had the Reserved sign posted on it).  I found it ironic that they requested us to pay for our tickets multiple times AND THEN made sure to inform us that we would have to then move.  In all fairness, the table they moved us to wasn't in a terrible spot, but the one we had initially claimed was much better for viewing purposes (no craning our necks) and it was a roomier booth for the 4 of us.  That and the fact that I was trying to make it special for my boyfriend's birthday and thus far, the customer service had been less than stellar (no issues on the food side, however, the food was fantastic!).  It was more the lack of consideration/communication that detracted from what would have been an otherwise enjoyable experience.  We changed tables; at which point the servers cleared our waters (and two of the gals' soft drinks), after which we had to request more (when, in an ideal world, they should have been replenished immediately--I never did receive my water until after we had ordered our entrees and completely finished them (maybe I should have spoken up and said something sooner, but it's merely an observation, since I had already ordered a water to accompany my rounds of beer).  Same with the silverware and napkins--the staff cleared ours and when they made us change tables, then proceeded to serve us our meals with no utensils or napkins ( my boyfriend asked the runner, "May we please have some silverware?"  and she literally grabbed one set, placed it next to him and took off before he could explain that we all needed silverware).  Our female server was very sweet and asked us multiple times if there was anything else we needed, but my point is that due to the inconvenience of changing tables, we should not have to request the basic necessities for a second time when they were already on our table the first time around--it really took away from the experience.  At the end of the night, the tab for just my boyfriend and I totaled over $100 (there were 4 in our party, and the others spent a good deal on drinks and entrees as well).  The bottom line is that although this restaurant has excellent American-style food, we did not feel that our business was appreciated here and we would rather spend our time and money elsewhere.  As a side note,  they apparently don't do anything for birthdays as most establishments do--or they forgot--because it was never acknowledged by the staff, not even a "Happy Birthday!"  :-(
Trying to sell jewelry in Las Vegas is more difficult than it seems. This was my 3rd stop and from what I read I was excited to see what he had to say. After contacting this business and many attempts Nothing worked out. The price ended up bieng much lower than expected and I felt something was not right
Strawberry Mojito: If they hadn't packed a half of a pint glass with crushed ice (instead of the cubed ice they put into their glasses of soda or water) it might've been fine. It watered the whole thing down. My opening cocktail was a minty lime water.Appetizer of West Indies beef patty was delicious. You could probably buy them in bulk at Costco. The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)Chicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.Our server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.It's a chain restaurant, meaning not truly ethnic. Can someone recommend a sweet hole-in-the-wall?
Was told this place was the best Italian in Henderson by mt step-daughter so though the wife and I would try it out last Friday night.Overall impression was it's a cozy little place with great decor, decent appetizers (we had the sampler with calamari, cheese sticks and fried ravioli), and it was pretty good.I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and the wife ordered the Chicken Parm.Thumbs up on the Chicken ParmThumbs down on the Alfredo.... Fettuccini noodles were cooked probably 2-3 minutes under cooked so they were very, very chewy. I had to put quite a bit of tooth to them to get them chewed up. I probably only 3 bites and left the rest.As the waiter came by at the end of the meal to collect our plates and ask if we needed 2 boxes to take the rest home, I said I didn't need one due to the undercooked noodles. The server/hostess was apologetic but neglected to even offer us a refund or take any price off the final bill.Don't think we'll be back to this place, even though it's close to home.2 of 5 Stars rewarded.
8:30a on a Saturday.  Expected a crowd., but it's fairly empty. Seated immediately and waitress was attentive and brought beverages quickly. We ordered eggs over and fried chicken and my wife got eggs and bacon.  We waited 15 minutes for the food. My fried chicken need some additional time in the fryer. It was soggy. Eggs were cold. :(   My wife's order for crispy bacon didn't work, but her eggs were warm. We weren't impressed with the texture and taste of their super biscuits either. If it wasn't for our excellent waitress, I'd have given this place one star.  We won't be back for pricey and poor food.
Can't speak to the quality of services they provide as I could not get a return phone call after leaving the owner a detailed message and my contact information (all information was repeated twice for clarity sake). I trust they are very busy (like everyone else) but its rather unprofessional not to acknowledge or return customer phone calls.
Pitts-burger is a frozen beef patty with fries and coleslaw.  I originally asked for the burger well done.  I was told they can't do that since the patties are ready made and just heated up.  That should have been hint enough for me to change my choice. It has a weird old meat taste and the texture doesn't even resemble burger meat. I ate two bites, took out the meat and ate the bread and coleslaw. Unsure of how the menu claims its the #2 seller. Service was friendly but skip the burger and opt for a regular sandwich.
This review is strictly for the happy hour at Chima.I love meat.  That's all there is to it.  And I don't eat meat very often at all, so when I go out, I like to order it to my heart's content and that's why we stopped by Chima for happy hour on a Friday (plus points).  I believe it lasts from 5-8PM, but i'm not quite sure, so don't quote me on that.The happy hour is only at the bar which is located up the stairs from the hostess table.But not everything on the menu is apart of the happy hour, so look for the *** that shows which are not.My two friends and I ordered drinks, regular priced because they did not have many drink specials.  (minus points, but I know that it is partially due to Charlotte's insanely stupid happy hour laws, who even has time to legislate happy hour laws!?!?)  anywho, we ordered 3 drinks, I got something with mango or strawberry and I did not even finish it, it was too sweet and not very good.  The others seemed to think their drinks were okay, one got a martini and the other ordered the latin mixed drink that starts with a C, I cannot recall the name.The food, we ordered carpaccio, which i really enjoyed, and some skewers.  One of them was filet with bacon, not that great and the other, which I cannot remember was not great either.So three drinks and three apps came out to $60.Not the best happy hour i've been to.  Bad drinks, mediocre food and slow service, try your time somewhere else.
Very pricey and the items aren't that good. Their customer service is ok but needs improvement as well as their snacks quality.
Maybe it was an off day, but I thought the food today was not very good at all. The BF and I each got a 'k sadilla,' I got the steak and he got the chicken. Maybe this item isn't the best thing to get here... I don't know. It was soggy and had waaaay too much cheese. The steak was chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as 'cajun.' The k sadilla had cabbage in it.... but the cabbage wasn't cut at all... there were huge pieces of it in this thing. Overall, the flavor was off putting (and I like Cajun food), it was greasy, and the whole thing fell apart while trying to eat it. I would not get this again, not when there are 3 other very good choices in the same parking lot (the bbq, the hot dogs, and the grilled cheese).
5 for services; 1 for food! We ordered fried rice, Pho, and ramen. I could not believe they used instant noodle for Ramen. However, Waitresses were very nice, I wish food is a bit better. the "chef" should take some cooking courses on YouTube, it will help the business a lot since you already have good service
The ambiance and decor was really nice here....I wish I could say the same for the food. The salsa and chips were good but everything else was pretty awful. If my review was based on the food alone, I'd give it 1-star. It gets the extra star for the good service and atmosphere.
Don't come if you don't have time to wait. Slowest car wash I have ever been to. They do an OK job but for the length of time you wait it should be immaculate.
For some reason, I liked the place better before the overhaul. It used to have a home-y feel and the previous waitress was a lot friendlier and more attentive. Ever since the change, they have been messing up my take-out orders and I just don't enjoy the experience as much anymore. It's convenient for lunch because it is close to my work but it is also extremely over-priced. $11+tax for a portion of perogies (and they forgot the sour cream) is not reasonable in my opinion. Probably won't be returning for a while, if ever.
Service has been steadily declining since it first opened. The menu changes have gone from great to bad to good as well. Definitely hope Deagans can return to be a premiere lakewood spot.
Yuck!! We go often and this time was the worst.  The service was aweful and I had my 7 year olds free birthday coupon.  It was a Sunday and when I tried to use it they informed me they only use them Mon-Thurs.  but that is not written on the coupon.  The waitress was so rude!!
What in the world is going on here. Friday night busy crowd and only 1 worker in entire store.  Took forever to get our order and it was burnt because she was trying to do cash and cook.  Never washed her hands after touching the money.  I feel bad for her she was trying her best but the management is at fault here.  She had so many orders she had to complete she wasn't even able to take new orders for over 15 mins; customers were just sitting and waiting for her to be free again.  On the plus side the worker was friendly and tried her best to serve you.  On to the food, nothing much to rave about, got the Chicken/Beef mixed Boss box and it was mostly salad and lack of meat. It could be she was running out so she made the portion smaller.  Not too impress with the meat quality so it was dry and rubbery for the beef.  Chicken was decent but they ran out so I only got a few pieces.
Nothing special and way over-priced.There was nothing wrong with China Grill but there was nothing right about it either. For the quality of food, I found it quite over-priced. For example, we have a quite small pepper-encrusted ahi plate for $42. The night before we ate at Delmonico and for the exact same price I had three times the fish and more importantly, it was significantly better.The service was pretty poor at China Grill also. We got there right when in open and despite only have four tables seated and at least three waiters plus busboys, the service was annoyingly slow.
Visited here on 10-22-16, a busy Saturday night at Westgate.  We were seated almost immediately.  Server was fine.  My disappointment was with the margherita pizza, usually one of our favorites.  I've never had a margherita pizza like this.  Instead of thin, succulent slices of red tomatoes, halves of cherry tomatoes were dropped on the pie!  And not too many of those, either.  Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice.  I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite.  The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste.  The crust was okay.  Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars.
Dr Nasim McDermott, Internist was fine, but office and her staff need help. I prepped for colonoscopy and then got word the wrong insurance was filed from my insurance company., Had to cancel procedure.  Also Dr. requested prior copies of colonoscopies.  I located them, but could not get office to respond to send a cover letter and fax to request them. Gave up after 2 weeks of unreturned phone calls.  I had to make a visit to see the office staff to reschedule colonoscopy because they do not answer phones.  Never respond!!!! POOR POOR SERVICE.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE.  By the way, I was told by procedure/surgical center this is a common complaint with this office.
This will be a short and bitter review. We arrived at Museum Tavern at 9.30pm on a Thursday night, we were greeted by a nice man who seated us on the patio. We were served by a very nice girl who maybe wasn't trained very well.We ordered the Steak Tartare to share and the wife ordered a Salad and I ordered the prime rib dip. The tartare never got to the table, just the mains were brought, shame I was looking forward to it. Mains were good, the food was really nice. Server didn't check back on us, so I had no beer for my entree.We ordered the shortcake for dessert and it was like a desert DRY. Take it off the menu!!Paid the bill and left Food 7/10Service 4/10Drinks 7/10
I had been dying to try this restaurant since it opened, and finally decided to check it out for Sunday morning brunch. It was extremely crowded, there were no tables, and the line took forever. But, okay, that's fine, I'm a patient person. I was ordering for three people- I got two biscuits- add fried eggs for $1 each, a fancy drink for me, and oatmeal plus a biscuit with jam for my husband. So we finally get to sit down and the waitress comes out and says they are out of oatmeal and asked my husband to pick something else. He gets grits and they came out first. We wait a bit and our biscuit sandwiches come out but no biscuit for him. The guy asks if we have everything and we let him know the biscuit is missing. He says he'll go get one but then he never came back. I start to eat and realize there's no egg on my sandwich. My mom says she didn't get her egg either. So we grab the waitress and tell her we still don't have my husband's biscuit and neither of us got eggs. I say it's no big deal, just bring the biscuit and can I just get my money back for the eggs. She goes "it's only $2 dollars plus tax. Do you really care about getting $2 back?"  Ummm, yes, I do. I say that I would like my $2 back, it may only be $2 but I paid for something I didn't get. She says "I don't think $2 is a big deal but I can get it for you, it's fine." Hello, Rude. So she walks away and at this point I realize I'm thirsty- I never got my drink!" So I just go inside and say I never got my drink. The cashier tells me I should have gotten it when I ordered. Okay, well I didn't, no one offered it to me or told me I needed to wait for it. So I FINALLY get my drink and I asked her for my money for the eggs, and I see the waitress coming out of the back with my husband's biscuit. She asked me to take it to him, lol. The service was terrible but the food was pretty good. I doubt I'll be back, though.
New ownership has changed the flavor profile of some of the dishes. We have been back three times and we've given up - the food flavors are no longer true to the Thai concepts that were developed and served here. The original owners have left and the so have the original chefs. The Pad Thai that we were last served was not edible - it was red in color (?) and the flavor was definitely off. So, we find the menu is hit-and miss, at best.
Like most people who have visited Charbar I was really impressed by the room. Beautifully decorated,  definitely one of the more esthetically pleasing restaurants in the city. The view from the patio is also gorgeous. As with most new restaurants it needs to iron out a few wrinkles. There's a sign near the entrance that  says the main floor hostess will help seat you for the patio so we checked in with them. After about a five minute wait (a headscratcher because there were plenty of vacant and unreserved tables) we were taken upstairs Interestingly enough there's another hostess at the top of the stairs who seemed to be seating people who just walked right in. The patio menu is great if you're there just for a drink but very limited if you're hungry, offering only a few dishes from their main menu. Perplexing, as we could've had dinner there but felt compelled to leave in search of more options for food. We did order an appy (tripe chips) just to be able to say we are there. While tasty, it was a little high on the salty side. The accompanying sauce was quite overpowering and probably unnecessary. We also ordered some cocktails, one of which came with the kind of ice you see in McDonald's soft drinks (not a huge concern in the big picture but definitely not acceptable if you're a cocktail snob!). I'll come back in a few months to try the menu properly and to see if time and experience helps smooth things out.
Not listening to a fellow Yelp'r (Tiffany N.) I took it upon myself to try this place out hoping for the best.  But....it fell flat.  First off, I prefer the do it yourself style of TCBY and a few other places.  Also, there were only like 5-6 flavors?  Meh.  Another no-no for me was that this is another fro yo place that is based on the tart style yogurt that I am not a fan of.  All things being equal I have to say the salty caramel flavor I tried wasn't half bad but it was like choosing the lesser of two evils.I will say I do like this location though, nice fountain outside to sit and enjoy your yogurt at the end of the day.
The pros...the menu is unique and portions are large.The cons...the hostess and seating crew were a mess. The wait was nearly an hour, despite the 20 minute they suggested it would be. The people around us eating ... were complaining about being cold/not correct/etc. Management came to a couple tables to check on things. Seemed a little unorganized.  Final result: If you have a lot of time and patience...try the chicken pot pie. Its enormous and quite good. I didn't see why all the hype however.
Perhaps the breakfast is why people have given this place such high reviews, but today we showed up at 11:30 and we were told breakfast stops at 11. Which is fine, since this is a diner and should have some good burgers and sandwiches, but we were wrong. I had the Scotty, which was okay but way too much sauce that made the bread mushy, my son's hot dog buns were semi cold, the same for my daughters cheeseburger. The fries though plentiful weren't anything to write home about...Yelp yes, but not home. :)Food took quite a while to come out, server was friendly and seemed to know many people that were in the cramped areas. I had to move to another table because the person behind me wouldn't be able to get out unless my son and I got up during our meals and let them out. I go out of my way to eat and mom and pop places, but this time we were all let down.
Ehhhhhh....when I walked in..it smelt like a mix of a sewer smell and pho...red flag. I ordered steak and meatball pho...and the noodles were so hard! Broth was whatever...overall I think it could of been cleaner..I had to look at all my spoons and little dish to see if they were dirty..which yes they were...won't be coming back. The meat also was way too thick and dry.
Meh.I was hankering for some kielbasa, as I had just purchased some pierogies and holubchi from another vendor on the same level in the St Lawrence Market.It was okay. Nothing special, especially for the price I paid (almost $10 Canadian).I've had way better in the East Village in New York City, so maybe I'm spoiled that way......
I'm really sad that I had such a bad experience here. The waitress really lacked quality and was devoid of personality. She had a bad case of RBF. We ordered egg rolls which came out quickly, but were cold. They tasted fine, like freezer or Panda Express quality. The cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table. I ordered a 3 (on a 5 scale) and it was ridiculously hot. To the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit. I found it to be strange and thought I just got a bad bite, but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor. I was not impressed.I give this place two stars because the fried banana at the other table did look quite good.The other waitress who helped us was very kind at least.I feel like this place is incredibly hit or miss, unfortunately for us, we had a miss.
This place had high hopes. The meat in my sandwhich Tasted and smelled bad. My family and I all got sick after eating here.
I was a fan of this place before they moved but the new location is very tiny and they've done away with a lot of the tasty sugar free treats I used to love. Now there's only a tiny section of pre-made and packaged SF sweets. I went in a couple of days ago and left. Nothing very appealing. A huge bummer!
This was one of the first salons I had gone to when I was new to the nail game. In the beginning I thought they did a good job, but after leaving and trying new places I realized they didn't. Looking back my nails were crooked and sometimes different lengths. I had asked for a marble nails design once and it looked like zebra instead. I would try another place for the amount of money they charge and the quality of work they provide.
No complementary chips or salsa, waiter was overly friendly and made us all uncomfortable, and the food was ok. Go to your local, hole in the wall Mexican place -- this place is for the birds
While in Vegas, we tried this new (new for us) Gastropub. It was close to our hotel and was a nice change from the buffets.  It was odd to order and pay for the meal before being seated. It was equally odd that no one was really available to describe the menu.  So, we ordered the deviled eggs, tempura beans, and sushi du jour.  The eggs had a dried crust on the top which looked as if they had been sitting under the heat lamp. Additionally, there was a glob of mustard under each piece (to keep from sliding) that sort or "shocked" the taste buds (didn't like it). The beans were good, but I think serving the chipotle mayo on the side would be better to allow customers to 'dip' as needed; however, I repeat, the beans were done nicely.  The sushi was presented nicely, but no chopsticks to eat with; when asked if chopsticks were available, the server seemed confused with my question.  We may go back to try other items next time we visit but we were a bit nonplussed by our first experience. Oh yeah, please ask if we are done eating BEFORE pulling the plate and utensils from us.  Thank you.
I got a 30 minutes reflexology, the massage itself was okay. I did like the fact that the place was clean. When paying I noticed a list on the wall, it says a tip of $5 means you're "sad". Wow, for a $20 massage $5 tip is pretty good! But they expect $15 and up! Maybe their workers are not paid well and count on making a living with a significant portion of their income being from tips. But that's not right! The owner should pay them what they are entitled to.
So we decided to try this place for Taco Tuesday. It was busy as expected , waited in line about 20 minutes until we got to order. This was fine and then they put the orders together like chipotle or subway telling them what you want on down the line. Price was good and with their app we got another $5 off the total price. The tacos however IMO we not all that good. The chicken and beef were very bland and not a lot of meat to boot. The pork one had some flavor but again very little meat. Staff was nice but due to the taste or lack of taste of the food we won't be back.
Every so often, I have a conference that is hosted at the Las Vegas Hotel (formally the Las Vegas Hilton).  It's way down at the end of the Strip, which makes the location terrible.  It's probably one of the hotels that are in most need of a face lift.You know that feeling you get when you walk into a Pizza Hut? That heavy, dense greasy smell that punches you in the face?  That's what it's like walking into this hotel.  Mostly because there's a Pizza Hut RIGHT at the entrance.  There's also a fitness center that is strangely located towards the entrance, but no enclosed in an actual room.  You can walk right by someone who is on a stationary bike, and I guess that's totally normal there.I've never stayed here, but one of the absolute biggest annoyances of mine with this place is how low the ceilings in the casino are.  The lower the ceiling, the lower the smoke is trapped.  I'm not a fan of that burning sensation in my eyes and throat from cigarette smoke, and it is painfully abundant here.  Bleh.
With so many far better Mexican options within walking distance, and with a history so rich, Hussong's need to step up its game.The food just wasn't great.  Barely good.  Passable, more or less.  The margarita was good but not great.  The chips tasted stale and store bought.It was a wasted Vegas food opportunity for us.Hussong's, get better!
the place is very dirty the edge of the tables have grease on them the food portions were really small everyone on the staff was unhappy. there was no real good service there's no real good food that stood out very pricey. Place needs to be remodeled big time and updated
Went for dinner tonight w/ co-worker. Ordered dinner, side salad and a glass of wine. Waitress comes back and apologizes- apparently she delayed putting in the order so the meal would be properly spaced but in doing so they sold out of my dinner option. Uhm, it's 6:30 on a Wednesday night with a full restaurant, how do you sell out of a regular pasta option at an Italian restaurant? Fine. I choose something else.Pasta arrived & after a bite or two it was clear that half the pasta wasn't cooked. Sent it back. Floor manager comes to the table, introduces himself, apologizes & says we will have a new plate out ASAP personally delivered by him. 25 minutes later I caught our waitress and asked to have it "to go" as my dinner companion had dragged out eating her meal as long as possible & is now finished. Alex, the manager comes by and says "I was just on my way to deliver your meal when the waitress said you wanted it to go" and apologizes again.  Considering I could see him delivering food and chatting with other patrons, he wasn't anywhere near my food, but okay & we ask for the bills. I opened the container to ensure it was my meal and took a bite - the pasta is so over cooked it is mush and its lukewarm, like it had been sitting for an extended period of time waiting to be served. Alex shows up at the table again with 2 glasses of prosecco without confirming we would like a glass (which neither of us do) ... he then comps the $5 wine special for both myself and my dinner companion & offers a free dessert for NEXT time I come in ... pretty sure there won't be a next time.  He said my meal was on the house as it wasn't right ... except the bill shows up and there is my lonely salad listed and requiring payment. Really?! As we are leaving (ie coats on and about to walk away from the table) a 3rd waitress shows up with a bowl of pasta and looks at me like I'm crazy when I say i already have my meal but would gladly exchange my take away container if the pasta she was holding was cooked and hot. Complete disorganization and will more than likely not be back. Mushy pasta went straight to the bin on the way home. Thank goodness my dinner companion was entertained ...
Moved to the area recently and was looking for good, local pizza. Tried this place out. Family owned, which I like, but the service seemed to lack enthusiasm. The single large pizza I ordered was prepared in a reasonable amount of time and I took it home. It was plenty hot when I returned home, and that's great. The problem is.. it wasn't very good. The sauce was dull, the crust struck me as generic, and the quality of toppings didn't blow my mind. I'd put it on par with Papa John's, and  that's not necessarily a compliment.
The food was alright for the price we paid, however the service was absolutely horrible. It doesn't take 2 hours to serve two bowls of pasta. Additionally, they had my order wrong. This place doesn't deserve a 4 star rating.
I've dined here twice and both times the food was incredibly tasteless. The first time I dined at this establishment I had the whole squid. It was so tough and chewy, I had to send it back!The second time, I thought I'd give them another chance and  I ordered the spring rolls and whatever they've in it that's crunchy tasted old and spoiled , like it's been cooked for days, then I had the oxtail loco moco and too much onions in it.The basil that was brought out for the pho was dried and not fresh.I suggest you hire a new cook and come out with fresh ingredients.But on the positive note, I think the service was exceptional!
I would have given more stars, because the patio is really cool and the fact that it definitely kid friendly make it awesome.  My problems with this place lie in the fact that they do not have servers at the table and charge $14 for a burger and $10 for a salad.  I don't mind whatsoever paying that price but I would appreciate service.
I had this place bookmarked and thought we would try it out.  Sadly, disappointed. Service was very very friendly but the food we ordered not so great.  I ordered some Hawaiian pork with a side of macaroni salad.  The pork was overdone and crispy like it had been cooked before.  The mac salad was very salty. The hubby ordered a noodle bowl and said the noodles were not cooked and it was just okay.  Prices are not "cheap" for the value. We spent $30 and it wasn't worth it especially for the small servings.  There were lots of flies buzzing around, they did have some fans but it didn't help.  It's located in a rundown dirty strip mall-it could use a face lift.You do get some assorted Korean appetizers but none of them were for my liking.  I usually get my Hawaiian fix at other local chains with huge fresh helpings and I just didn't feel mine was fresh or tasty.  The place was very busy with many locals but this was just not my cup of tea:(
Admittedly, my boyfriend and I are slight sushi snobs--we think Ginko in Tremont is hands down the best Sushi in greater cleveland, although we will go eat at cheaper places, like Sushi 86 downtown. So, after reading reviews for Nobu Tei, we decided to make the drive down to Solon. The sushi was awful--I got a sweetheart roll, one of their specialties, and while the tuna on top of the roll was pretty good, the spicy tuna on the inside was flavorless--other than a taste like wet dog. I also got a philadelphia roll and an alaskan roll, and each one was full of salmon with a ton of chewy connective tissue. The salmon in my alaskan roll also tasted really off. The avocado in my rolls was completely brown, which is still fine to eat but not appetizing. I couldn't finish any of it, which has never happened before. My boyfriend got a shrimp tempura roll, which was moderately okay. he also got a softshell crab roll, and the crab was burnt. He also got a yellowtail roll, and it was inedible because the yellowtail was freezer burnt. Sushi-grade fish should never be frozen, let alone freezer burnt, so he couldn't finish his stuff either. We were both afraid of getting sick.We got their pork gyoza, fried dumplings, and they were stellar, hence the 2-star rating over a 1-star. Perhaps their hibachi is alright, but I don't know. Their service is a bit lackluster as well, with one server in charge of the entire restaurant, which is sizeable. If anything, just don't get the sushi.
Cloud 9.  When you are inside, you literally feel like you're in the sky.  The interior decor is gorgeous!  I love the white metal artsy walls.  It is definitely very unique!  The only thing I don't like is the gold fishes.  When I first saw this place, the gold fishes freaked me out because there were too many.  I honestly would never had came in here if it wasn't for my fiance.  I'm sure glad that we made reservations here because the interior decor alone was all worth just being in there.  So, 1 star goes to the interiorSo, we came here for a family dinner on Christmas day.  There were 18 of us.  They split the group into two.  We had no trouble with getting seated.  They have plenty of tables to accommodate to anyone.The second star goes to some of the food that I ate.  The food was not as impressive and was a little bland.  I also expected the food to be better since it is in the Caesar's Hotel.  My family ordered 1 small and 1 large Pork Noodle Bowls, 2 plates of Duck, 1 Braised Beef, 3 plates of dumplings, Fried Rice, Chinese Broccoli, and some other cold dishes.  The total all came out to be over $250.   All the dishes range from $15-30 dollars.  Again, nothing really wowed me, especially considering the price of each dish.  I was super excited to try the Pork Noodles Bowl because I heard that they Handmade their noodles, but I was disappointed.  The noodles were good, but the flavor was bland.  However, the only thing I really liked out of all the dishes was the Pork Noodle Bowl (small $15, Large $25), which says a lot.  The dumplings were okay too, not the best that I have ever tried.  I was especially sad when I ate the duck.  Duck is my favorite meat and it just tasted too clean.  Normally, chinese duck is full of yummilicious oily greasy flavor, but not this one.   The portion for each dish is small, so we had to order multiples of each dish to feed a family of 9.The service was decent.  Our waiter was really nice, but put down the Small for our dishes even though we explicitly told him that we were eating family style.  Due to this mishap, our family had to order more and the large dishes of all the small dishes that we got, which came out to more $$.  Overall, sadly to say.. I would not come here again for chinese food, especially when considering the price, portion, and flavor.  Not the best that I have tried.
I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. Just don't keep your expectations high.We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn't want to leave. We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren't hungry. So, in that sense, it served its purpose.We got the 5.99 "special" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like "Michaelina" type "pizza" you would buy in a grocery store. I mean..I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn't that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?If you insist on eating here, just know what you're getting into...2 stars.
Unfortunately the long wait to talk to a human continues....I have had the mid fortune to have to call them 3 or 4 times over the past few days...and the wait time was upwards of 30 minutes each time which is almost as bad as calling Social Security!!!! When I mention it, they say that the call volumes are heavy.... same answer as I received last year... management .... hello... help your people! I wonder how the managers or owners would like to be on hold for that long when they needed assistance from another provider ???
Apparently this is s place many people like quite a bit.  I did not think it was that great. The food was ok, shakes are better elsewhere and spent as much as I would have at a full serve restaurant.
Disappointing. This AYCE sushi place used to be the go to restaurant. Quality has gone done significantly in the last years.Our last visit there with friends was highly disappointing, sushi wasn't fresh. Beef sashimi was frozen. Service was slow.
I'd give this place 4 stars for food, but the service is just that bad. The owners grand- daughter is a grumpy b***h on the best days. The owners friend (french woman) is friendly but usually behind the grill. The owner herself is sweet as can be.The food is very good for the price. Be prepared to more or less have your food thrown on the table (once she knocked the creamer bowl off the table). For a local greasy spoon, it lacks the family-feel of a local cafe. Sad, because it's so damn convenient. Sad, because it could be so much better with just a smile.They don't take credit cards, so beware. There isn't an ATM anywhere close, either.While you're there, visit SandyAleksander across the street. You'll realise the difference between sh** and sweet customer service.
So I have been to Sambuca 3x. First time, got the prix fixe me and my girl. Food was delicious. A dude waited on us and he was lovely as well. Second experience was good too, portions are pretty big. Very good deal. Food is not amazing but its not shitty either. The mussels are the highlight of my meal. My girl got a steak, nothing phenomenal. 3rd visit was TERRIBLE. Food was cool. The asian lady who was waiting on us was RUDE. Basically it was one of those, I am slightly broke but I want to go out to dinner, so let me go here for the prix fixe. So tab was around 50$ and we dropped 3$ for tip( I know cheap but one those days broke times). She came to our table and said "hey guys, was the service bad or something?" , I was so shocked. We responded with so much embarrassment and said no service was ok. she was then slamming our dishes as she was picking them up....huffing and puffing all angry.Terrible
Nothing like the food at Tapas 24 in Barcelona.We were at tapas 24 yesterday for Barcelona chef Carles Abellan.Service: Very poor. No water. The sommelier removed our glass of wine when empty without even offering another glass or bottle...(We had planned for another bottle but when we were able to talk to someone, we were done eating)Seems like the staff was inexperienced.Entire service was rushed as if they wanted us out for a specific time.(2nd service)Food: ok but expensive for what we had. Nothing fabulous. Paella extremely saltyAtmosphere: good! Nice restaurant.
The most underwelming Adonis. Short hours, small selection, limited sales. Some staff are nice, some staff are hostile.
First of all, Paradise RV Resort is not a RV resort; it is a mobile home development. Of the roughly 950 spaces, only about 150 are for transient RVs. I suspect these will disappear as they are sold to permanent residents.The remaining 800 spaces are occupied by permanent single-wide mobile homes.What does this mean?- Very dense living- No green space in the RV spaces- No picnic table on the site- Only a single central building with showers and toilets and few of them- No cable TV for RVs- WiFi is very spotty. I think I am now using a permanent resident's unsecured WiFi connection. Thanks.Otherwise- The staff is helpful and friendly- There is a large pool, several excellent tennis courts, saunas, a computer room, library and many other amenities.- Over the air television is excellent- There are many scheduled events- Age 55 and over; no childrenJust know you won't be among fellow RVers.
You're in Vegas go anywhere else we ordered 3 meals and they were all pretty bleh you do get a lot of food but they are a bit expensive. The lady working there was nice though!
If you like Asian fusion, you can easily find  better place to go then Fugu. Food is way expensive and ok at best. But the biggest let down is the service. WOW! The server almost dropped the plate in our table and didn't crack a smile. We had to ask twice for a fork and no one even came back after delivering the food. Not worth the money neither it's a friendly place.
We'll start with no smoking, no gambling, and no restaurants in this hotel.Do you still want to proceed?VALET was full. Another large bummer!  This means you have to go park on the 3rd floor of the Miracle Mile shops then drag your luggage almost clear across the mall and through the hotel to get to your dang room. NO BUENO.Let's go to the "no restaurants" part.  You are in Vegas, might I remind you, you are going to want to eat at some point, maybe?  They have room service till 10 pm at night, but if you want something to eat, you better put your walking shoes on b/c you have to go into the Miracle Mile Shops.  They do; however, have a small kitchen in each room with a fridge and a microwave so that's helpful.  Ice machine only on 2 floors--5th floor and the 50th so I heard, real pain in the arse to go get ice. Like I didn't go get ice b/c it was such a pain. NO BUENOThey also make you swipe your card every time before you even get close to the elevator bank, that's annoying. NO BUENOSeating downstairs is limited when you are waiting for your party to arrive at a meeting point in the lobby so you can go out together. My friend was sitting on the small table that looked like a stool and was rudely told not to sit on the furniture by one of the security guards like she was some kind of heathen... NO BUENOnot my favorite--go w/ the trump or the hotel
My guess is I would have had a better experience if I had eaten in the bar as the other reviewer did.  The overcooked steaks I saw served to others in our party would have been acceptable if on a bun.  The stuffed pork tenderloin I ordered seemingly spent a couple hours on a steam table and the "fresh" cranberry applesauce seemed to have lived the same fate.While our waitress was gracious and accommodating, the rest of the staff was awful.  I painfully watched the bus staff running through the restaurant like bulls with their only priority being their tasks and no awareness of customers.  Pepper for one of our parties entrée, and bolting when they noticed a table needing bussed.  Same went for service on getting water or the hostess moving through the restaurant.  Oh, and then the topper, a bussed plate from another table ends up in my lap.  I get a quick "Sorry" but no offer of assistance to deal with my now gravy stained shirt as they bolt off to the kitchen.  While I was tempted to give the restaurant a single star review, there is really all the ingredients to make it a great dining experience with better customer focus.  Considerable effort needs to be made in the kitchen on providing entrees that are truly fresh and made to order.  The non-wait staff needs to realize that they are an integral part of the customer experience not just the schleppers of dirty dishes.  The warm and inviting tones of the dark woods and fireplaces certainly could lend to this being a great venue, just need to get over the other hurdles to get things on track.
This is not a bad gym nor is it in a bad area. So props on that... My id we signed up yesterday. We were supposed to have a personal trainer show us what we need cause me and my mom are both larger. And the appointment was at 10. The guy said 10 minutes he is finishing up with someone that .. Its now 12:14pm and he has yet to come back to us to show us what to do. Now he is helping some other woman... So my issue is if you're going to offer a personal trainer. Try to have them actually help us with our problem areas. Rather than just ignoring us all together. Bullshit...
This place is confused. It wants to be a sports bar, restaurant and dance club and as a result, it does none of them very well.The food (I had the $3 tacos during happy hour) was decent, but nothing remarkable or earth shattering. The $3 beers were a hit with our group, but to a person (there were six of us), no one had anything nice to say about their food. Just sorta good, but not great.Other than having some TV's which you can't hear over their music, I don't see how they can call themselves a sports bar...that doesn't even make sense. Maybe it changes during football season, but it isn't anything like a sports bar at the moment.As for a dance club, we didn't stay to see it, but there is a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place and a DJ station at one end. I guess the dance floor would be between the DJ and the end of the bar which is not a large space. They were preparing for bottle service while we were there, and the wait staff was preoccupied. Overall, I think this place needs a manager who cares about customer service enough to impart that to the employees, because it feels like they believe that you should be grateful to be there and not the other way around.
Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and as Crudo fans, we were hoping for awesome.  Unfortunately, it fell significantly short of awesome.  It was HOT in there and I really wanted to order a drink and pull up a chair for our server (who was sweet, kind, attentive and practically melting on her feet).  She said the AC hadn't been functioning well for weeks but management wasn't seeing it and customers weren't complaining.  (I saw at least five patrons including myself fanning themselves with menus.)    It was also extremely loud.  The acoustics are such that everything echos and it turned into Husband and I speaking loudly to each other.  Me: "Happy Anniversary!"Him: "We can't afford a new car."  The drinks were outstanding.  The food was...  meh.  I loved the hush puppies and goat cheese combo but Husband made the point that you shouldn't rely on condiments to make the meal.  He's right.  The little buggers were pretty dry.  I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and was underwhelmed.  I hate to say this but they were reminiscent of Sloppy Joes.  Husband had the pulled pork and as a BBQ fan, he was wasn't thrilled with it.  We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert.
I really wanted to like Booyah, especially because it's like David fighting Dutch Dreams (Goliath) in the ice cream war just a couple doors down.Perhaps I just had my bar set high with my TO favourites like Red Bench, Bakerbots, Moo Milk Bar and Bang Bang... But Booyah really failed to deliver any wow factor in its ice cream sandwiches. I ordered a half sandwich of milk and white chocolate chip cookie and Moose Tracks ice cream.  The cookies were thin and flat, with average flavour and the ice creams are not made on premise but rather are sourced from Kawartha Dairies. Ice cream sandwiches are 4.65 for a half (one cookie, two scoops) and 7.10 for a full (two cookies, four scoops), the value for which I expected better. The interiors however are very clean and modern, and the service was friendly. There are two benches outside its door (similar to Bakerbots) for seating.For a shop that's super specialized, Booyah under-delivered. It's good for when the Dutch Dreams line is impossibly long and you have an ice cream craving that won't go away, but otherwise I would patiently wait a few doors down.
We've been to the Tempe location twice before, long time ago, and we loved their food. However, today's take out was a disappointment. The curry dish was RELATIVELY good (though it had few veggies in it), but the spicy rice noodles were very not good. They tasted somewhat old and lacked flavor, and there were 4 pieces of broccoli, a few pieces of meat, and 3 slices of carrot. This made me not want to come back to this location any more. I'm sorry, I don't like leaving a bad review, but it is not alright to serve something like this to customers.
Went for lunch right after they opened. Cold food, had to ask for utensils. I hope it's better other times off day.  Not impressed.
We are locals that frequent M Resort. Decided to try Pasta Bar for our anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly and we were served water and 1 roll each on our bread plates. No butter was served but we used oil and vinegar that was on the table. 15 minutes later (place was not crowded), our waiter, Pedro, came to take our order. We had not even been offered a cocktail or any other drink. He was very disinterested and even had a toothpick in his mouth! Hubby had veal Osso bucco and I had veal piccata. Food was OK, but service was just awful! When we declined ordering dessert, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away! Needless to say, we will not return.
We went to this place thinking it looked pretty cool. There were plenty of TVs,  would be nice place to watch sports here.  the appetizers absolutely sucked. Ordered Cowboy Caviar nachos and pretzels. The caviar were dry beans the nachos hardly had anything on them . will not return for eating
As a self-declared salad aficionado, I was pretty excited when we decided to go Crisp for lunch.  However the experience and salads were slightly underwhelming.  The menu options were good and the restaurant very clean (which is a plus since they make the salads right on the spot in front of you).  The ingredients looked fresh and the portions huge.  Yet anything else worth mentioning stops there.  I picked the create your own salad, which allows you to pick the norm: green type, protein type, and then a variety of different ingredients and dressing.  The particular guy making mine didn't exactly look thrilled to be there.  While I'm not expecting a song, dance, and 1000 watt smile...pleasantries are always nice in terms of food preparation and service.  I asked for a recommendation on one of the vinaigrettes (they have a ton...which is a plus) and he very apathetically remarked he did not know which one he liked the best because there were like 12.  A huge deal breaker? No. Something a new patron wants to hear from a place specializing in salads? Not really.  They also provided lemonade, unsweetened tea, and sweet tea in self-service containers.  It looked really pretty but tasted pretty generic. We sat outside on the patio because of how nice it was outside and the set-up really is lovely.  Great seating options and good for people watching.  While I would not make a concerted effort to avoid Crisp, there's nothing remarkable that stood out to separate it from some of the other great spots in Charlotte.
Uh, it's slightly cheaper than your average nail salon. But you get what you pay for I guess. First off, they save on a/c because it was hot in there! The sugar scrub was both legs at the same time and she was done with it in less than a minute. The sugar scrub is my favorite part, so that was disappointing. Also, I asked for the additional callous removal because I definitely need that each time. She was thorough, which I appreciated, but I didnt appreciate her commenting, shaking her head, and pointing to the resulting dead skin! Was she trying to shame me? Probably not a good idea to do to a paying customer. I dont live on this side of town anyway, but I would stay away, and I'm not that picky. At least they used a liner in the tub...
Good flavor but very expensive. Shrimp tacos had 1 piece of shrimp cut into three pieces in each taco(2) in the order.for $11. Chips and salsa and guacamole are the price of 1 meal.
I used to take the monorail here just to visit Star Trek:  The Experience.  Since they've shut that down, I really have no reason to return here.    Nothing else about the place really appealed to me at all.  Everytime I've checked their room rates online, they've been quite expensive for a hotel that's not actually on the strip.
So everybody is pretty much well aware that this Vons isn't located in the best location. That we can deal with. We can secure our things and make sure that we don't leave our valuables unattended and visible in the car. But there's a point that dissuades you from shopping here when almost every time, someone would approach you either on the way to the store or on the way to ask for some change. I understand that sometimes situations happen and you might need cash for gas but after hearing that same story in the same parking lot over five times, I'm pretty sure it's time for either people to add gas before heading grocery shopping OR it's time for Vons to instill some better security in their parking lot.Service, I mean, eh. They try their best. They accommodate long lines by opening another line when it gets too long. They assist you in finding your items. The typical. Items-wise, they pretty much have the basics of what you need (food, drinks, healthy & beauty, cleaning, and alcohol). However, I would suggest just going to the one on Twain.
Really want to like this hotel... but struggle to truly enjoy it.  First the good:- we booked a loft room.  It was quite spacious although calling it a loft isn't that fair.  It really just has a sitting area to the side... we didn't even use it. - it's in an excellent location.  Close to shopping, old Montreal, etc.  You can really get almost places within a 10-15 minute walk. Now the bad:- we found the hotel extremely dirty.  It's not what we saw that worries me (dust everywhere, dirty sheets, toothpaste on the side of the bed, sticky hairdryer, etc) but what we didn't see that really scares me. - I have no idea what it was but there was a foul smell in the room and many hallways.  Might have been chemicals but it was tough to smell. - the hallways and rooms were extremely dark and depressing.  They were painted black... a coat of white paint could have made things way brighter. Not sure that I would stay here again...
Advice:  don't buy a Restaurant.com coupon for Café Maria's - not a good deal!  Most give you twice the value of the voucher (pay $10 for $20 value).  There's was different; must spend $20 before the $10 discount, which cost $5.  Kind of deceptive but I should have read the small print as this is not the normal type voucher.  The breakfast was good - not large portions, nothing special.  Prices are fair but most likely will go to other cafes in Sun City.
Great food, HORRIBLE service. I've been coming here for a while and I love their rolls! However, the last few times I've come it's taken close to 30 minutes to get seated and hours to receive our order... overall really disorganized and hectic. Doesn't seem like the staff communicates...
This diner has some promise. I think you experience here may depend on the dishes you get. We got the chicken pot pie, the Greek salad, chicken fingers and meatloaf. The Greek salad was disappointing. It was pretty much a pile of iceberg lettuce with a dusting of feta cheese, three cherry tomatoes, boxed croutons and not much else. The chicken pot pie was way too salty. The chicken fingers were cold. The meatloaf was the best of what we had but nothing special. I know they are really popular but with all the great options in Vegas, I'd skip this place.
Went here for the first time because they had an awesome Groupon special. I won't be returning. The guy that actually did the oil change was nice and got my car in right away but the man in the office didn't greet me when I walked in, his first words were "groupon code please" (I had made an appt so they knew I had groupon). And then had me sign a receipt and it'd be about 10 minutes. He then walks to the back. We wait in the small but clean area, he then walks back in and says "everything looks good so $4.00". Didn't explain what the $4 was for but the receipt said oil filter- that's fine... But it wouldn't hurt to say more than two words to a customer. Oil change took longer than most places, and the lack of customer service is why I won't be returning.
The only reason I gave this place more than one star is because of their mozzarella. Everything else including their service sucks. Food is tasteless and it's not even close to italian food. Food was 45 minutes late and the appetizers came with our main dish. The server did not even fill our glasses with water and avoided eye contact the whole time. My dad even had to go to the bar to ask for water. They keep their kitchen open because they don't know they need chefs and servers to keep the place running. Go to Reds instead!
Have taken my dog here once before to Holly (my neighbor referred me to her). Holly did an excellent job and I rescheduled with her. Had to change my appt and was put with someone else that was available on the day I needed. I called to double-check the appointment time only to find out my appointment was never moved to the new day and that now I couldn't get in. HUGE inconvenience because my doggie is getting surgery and that's why I moved the date up. I realize errors will be made but come on! And when I reminded the scheduler about our original conversation and guessed that he just "forgot" to make the switch, he put me on hold and someone else got back on with a lame excuse. Poor customer service...I won't go back, even as good as Holly is.
Ordered two pizzas Sunday about 1:20.  They told my wife it would be 45 min. After almost 2 hrs. the pizza showed up. We had called about 2:30 and asked where our pizza was. They told us it was in it's way and they would credit the money back to our card. Pizza was cold and kids were starving. Not calling them again.
Plenty of chain restaurants and bars to keep people entertained for pre- or post- fun when going to the Jobing.com Arena or UoP Stadium. There is a spot on the west side of the City Center where all the scalpers hang out, off the sidewalk by the parking lot. We've gotten some good tickets pretty cheap from them.I like hanging out at one of the restaurants or bars after a game and wait out the traffic. The nearby Yardhouse is my personal fav for the selection of beers, don't expect any place in that area to have cheap drinks on a game day. I'm not sure about other days though.
Unfortunately This place was a huge disappointment, from the lack of flavor to the additional $1.00 they want to charge for a refill to the extremely high prices of each item of food, I will not return, there are many more places within a 5-10 mile radius that offer much more flavor and better quality food at a much more reasonable price. I absolutely hate to dismiss a "family" owned business however if the service was at least half decent I would have let it be.
Food was average at best. Friendly bar staff. But not worth the cost.
I really like their food here, but their service is just not good. I stood in line and was ignored while others were greeted and then, when I finally got my order taken, I was told to find a seat and a server would be with me. There were no seats. I stood there for 5 minutes until a spot at a area opened up and waited another 10 minutes before I finally flagged down a "server" to actually get some help. As I write this. I'm still waiting on my food. I get that it's a busy Sunday lunch, but this is just bad service. Maybe add a hostess at the door for crowd control on a busy Sunday. Still no food yet.
The service was fast. Great pizza. However, as someone with a shellfish allergy, I find it frustrating that this is yet another restaurant where cross-contamination is apparently an issue to the point where everything is grilled together, fried together, and so on.
Social media hyped this place up too much, because District One was a total let down. We tried the oxtail pho and the oxtail fried rice, and we were very underwhelmed by both. $16 for a bowl of pho? I don't care if it contains unicorn meat; at that price, I could get TWO bowls of pho from a traditional Vietnamese place that tastes infinitely better. The oxtail fried rice (also $16) was too greasy and contained shreds of meat so small, I wouldn't be able to tell it was oxtail unless you told me.Sadly, they were out of coconut shells for their coconut ice cream that day, which was odd considering we were there on a Monday afternoon. Disappointed by the food and general lack of empathy from the staff, we decided to save our money and get dessert elsewhere.Did we arrive on an off day? Who knows, but I don't see myself coming back to find out anytime soon.
So I understand this was one of the first hotels in Vegas. But our 5 day trip was awful. The first night we arrived we went up to our room it was the evening so my boyfriend and I got in bed and notice a big old spot in the middle of the sheets and realized it BLOOD! Are you kidding me! It also seem liked they tried to hide it too because it was in between two different blankets. I didn't get mad I just kindly asked for a new blanket which I got but they left the nasty blanket in our room. On top of that The transformer exploded and didn't have air or tv for 3hrs. lastly never use VALET!!! I even saw warning videos too I should have listened but they brought out our car with a dead battery!!!! Didn't even care just said we will jump you and you can be on your way. Note we live about 5 1/2hrs away.. not worth the price
Le Gourmand is okaaaay.  The coffee is pretty good, and yes - those chocolate chip cookies are delicious and a meal in itself.But, the service totally sucks.  I went in for a coffee and a sandwich as my office is right around the corner.  First I ordered the avocado and tomato sandwich, which they rang up for me but didn't have.  No biggie.THEN,I asked for the vegetarian sandwich (as I am a vegetarian).  They toast it up or whatever, I bite into it - and there is MEAT IN MY VEGETARIAN SANDWICH!  Ahhhhhhhh! (no offense to the meat eaters, but that is...ugh - not okay!!!).I take it back to them saying "hello, there is meat in my VEGETARIAN sandwich and I am a VEGETARIAN!!!"  I got a very minimal, blase response from the girl at the counter.  She didn't seem to care much, gave me an obligatory apology, and poked around to find an actual vegetarian sandwich.  Poor customer service. What if I had a food allergy? What if that was a religious problem for me?  They just don't care.Aside from that, this place is just a little too faux for me.  It's a cute decor, but they try way too hard.  I'd hit the Dark Horse up the street instead.  Much cooler.
Nordstrom the brand gets five stars, but this location's selection and organization is sad enough to knock it down to a two.  When in Scottsdale, might as well go to Nordstrom Rack.Let me say that my previous Nordstrom is a marvelously organized HUGE expanse of shopping with shoe sections that would fill up the entire downstairs of this one.  The clothes are beautifully arranged with niches designed more like fashion show rooms than department store space.No attention has been given to this Nordstrom in terms of layout, which causes a circling pattern in a small space.  The clothes aren't awful, but as other reviewers have said, there is not as much variety as I have seen at other Nordstroms.I usually rate highly based on the service & availability in the shoe department.  Other than salon shoes, I only saw one or two pairs of cute shoes, which was a huge disappointment, so I didn't even bother to test the customer service in the department.Scottsdale marks the only time I actually have walked THROUGH Nordstrom to get to the mall.  The makeup department is still great, but the store size ruins the entire experience.
*This is a review of an experience at Meatballz  on 1.8.10 and also my first time there.I was going out to lunch with a couple of work buddies and meeting up with another friend who suggested we go to Meatballz for lunch. He had been raving about the food for some time and I figured, it's a Friday and I have not yet tried it, so I will give it a shot.  We met at about noon and there was a total of six of us. I was very excited looking over the large menu of various heroes and pastas. For those that have never been here, you order at the counter and then the food is brought out to you.  I was the fifth out of six of us to order. 4 people ordered meatball heroes, one person a tuna hero (yes at a place called Meatballz) and I ordered the chicken parm hero and a small drink for $9.12 after the guy at the counter taking the order recommended it over the heroes I was considering. Not the cheapest lunch out there, but for a fresh foot long hero and a drink with free refills it is completely par for the course.  The six of us were lucky enough to find a table we could all sit at inside . It looks like they may be able to sit about 30 or so folks and there is some seating outside as well.  About 5 to 10 minutes after the last person had ordered, all of the heroes started to come out, except for one. For 5 points can you guess which one? If you said Tuna, you get no points. For those of you that guessed Chicken parm, give yourselves the points. About 30 minutes later and still no sandwich I decided to hit the counter up for an explanation. I was told that there was a fresh sandwich coming out of the oven and that it would be out in a moment. By that point I had waited about a half hour, the other five folks I was with had finished or were in the final stretch of finishing their sandwiches so I just asked for my money back.  Thankfully the guy behind the counter (who is the reason this review has any stars attached to it) was extremely customer service oriented and apologized for the mistake and gave me back my money. Just as I was getting the money back a sandwich did come out from the back but it was too late and I didn't have time to eat nor the desire. I was happy that there was no fuss on returning my cash and let the cashier know that it wasn't his fault that there was a mix up.  A few moments later the same guy came around the counter and told me he had spoken to his boss and they felt bad. They gave me a 10 dollar gift certificate to come back and try the place again and I appreciate that, but it may be some time before I take them up on the offer. There are a ton of places looking for lunch time business and this one is a bit out of the way for me at this point. With restaurants closing in the valley all the time I am sure having unhappy or unsatisfied customers is not something anyone wants. While I do appreciate the attempt at getting me back in, I am going to have to let the bad taste of nothingness leave my mouth first  It is possible at some point I may go back in there, but until that day comes I am going to have to leave this review at a 2 star.
Just sayin'...I use the "..." quite often. I like it.But, Saturday night we finally visited the new Park Rd. Shpg. Ctr. (Charlotte) located business,  ... (Dot, dot, dot.) We had paid our membership months ago (only $10!) and had patiently awaited the opening of this private establishment that billed itself as a sort of "Speakeasy" atmosphere specializing in classic mixed drinks and tapa-like dishes.Our excitement was extinguished as we were first told that we would have a 20-30 minute wait (outside), but were then escorted inside immediately to find an extremely LOUD atmosphere. There were 4 of us, so we tried different "Classic" drinks. Overpriced for the quality, some were good, but a couple were really bad! (That is their specialty?) We ordered almost every item on the food menu: Arrancini, Tempura veggies, Pork skewers, Charcuterie and Shrimp. Quantities were very small (and we KNOW tapas) and just average flavors. I WILL say that they did a good job with the decor; rich colors, nice lamps, pretty bar and attractive ceiling and wall designs, but our corner booth was too warm and the noise overwhelming. I was expecting white tablecloths, candles, "Crooner" music and good food/drinks....Been there, done that, won't be back!P.S. Dessert at nearby Amelie's...Excellent!!!
I have been coming the Horseshow since it open and I play a fair amount every week(700.00). I am seeing the casino getting progressively worst from odds, comps and lack of pit bosses entering you into the system . I played Texas Holden last week and had a terrible experience.  There were so many shuffle master red lights and dealer switches it was a total distuption in play. I had to worry I played long enough to park, or I would have to pay. I think I played for 5.5 hours and my comp was but 1 buffet and get 1 free.  I was there alone so bring a friend to eat late Friday night was not an option. I was a Platimun member under the old system and could valet park, but the new system has me as a A with no benefits.  I think the lost focus is that a casino is a service provider and I see very rude dealers, poor service of beverage servers and the wait to cash out at the tables.  Please wait and let me chip up, or we are waiting on a pit boss to verify a 220.00 buy in.  I eat in the buffet and it was terrible with what looked like old food with long wait times to get in. I really need to see better service to continue to come here.
Went on a Monday night for trivia night. Had the burger and pint special. The burger was not great, pretty basic. The fries were good. There was about 6 groups for trivia night. Unfortunately the MC was disappointing. She didn't seem to understand the material and by the end, she was rushing through it like she had somewhere else to be. I expected better. She didn't really seem to get the vibe of trivia night.
Cornbread was very good. Had the BBQ chicken which was good but small leg and thigh. Wasn't anything special. Sides were the cabbage, red peas, and sweet potato mash. Have to say the cabbage was the best thing. Everything else was bland with no seasoning. I would not go back here
Hmm, not sure if its just this time that I wasn't impressed, but this is a cafe I don't regularly come to. Gotta say, it was an underwhelming experience. First off, the wait on a Saturday was a bit long for a cafe like that, but at the same time, not surprising considering the location. Upon sitting down, they moved us to another table. A bit annoying, but okay since we moved to a more comfortable table.We ordered the BBQ Pork and Curry Beef Tendons, but both were a bit off. The BBQ was all overcooked, making the meat a bit tough. I personally like my BBQ pork tender with some fat on it, so it was a bit hard to eat. The curry was too sweet, as the balance of flavours was off. With too much sweetness and not even saltiness/spice, it made the curry unbearable. Thankfully, the Milk Tea was quite good, making it the best part of the meal. Service wasn't all that great either. I understand working quickly/efficiently to have a faster turnover rate of customers, but you can also be a little nicer. One server was just kinda bitchy when she took our orders. Not the best cafe I've been to, and don't plan on going back anytime soon. Ended up here on a secondary option, so it's not an ideal situation anyways.
Everything was too much.  Theresa was too much sauce on my pulled pork sandwich.  There was too much bread on the sandwich.  The soups were like eating a salt lick.  I tried 4 different types and they were all too salty.  I'm usually over salting dishes when I east them.
Let me put it like this... if i was caught in the middle of the ocean on a deserted island and the only place to eat at was this restaurant.... i would most likely starve! :) simply put I've had better... Now! don't get me wrong; the restaurant as a whole is nice and the music that they play is very soothing an great!!! but the food not so much :(
Yummy Margartia, good service, but the food wasn't anything special.  We came in for a quick, light lunch during our stay at Mandalay Bay.  Our server came by right away and took our drink order.  I ordered a Pepino Margarita and he asked if I could handle the heat and I said yes.  It was really good and spicy, but not necessarily hot to me.  We ordered tres tacos, which our server upgraded to 4 (2 steak and 2 chicken) and a chicken quesadilla to share.  Our server mentioned these were small plates, but we didn't want to eat much.Overall, the food was on the bland side I thought.
Beef was overcooked and dry. Chicken was basically the same, virtually no flavor. Waited almost 45 minutes for overcooked meat. Disappointed.
We were so looking forward to eating here. Heard good things about it. Our waiter was outstanding and that it is the only thing that I can say that was up to par tonight. Oh & the wine. My husband ordered the pig ears to be adventuresome..favorable but way too many.for an appetizer. I ordered the market fish... Alaskan Halibut, was to be 8oz according to our waiter, could not have been 4oz. No peas with it as mentioned in the menu, but instead one-sliced radish & 4 roasted asparagus, some greens & 5 of the chewiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. Good broth but for about $37 way overpriced. My hubby had a NY Strip with a big piece of gristle in it. French Fries were very good. But at $34 again the cut of meat was not up to par. Will we go back not sure, there are so many other excellent restaurants to chose from.
I've only been here for lunch and after work drinks / snacks. I work in the area and went to Jump for a business lunch recently. The food was not good.  It was like they had the dishes ready and sitting under a heat lamp, waiting to be served. Our food came out very quickly after ordering, was rubbery in texture and didn't taste all that great.  I don't think anyone at our table of 6 finished their meal.  Really disappointing. There are much better restaurants in the area...
Look don't get me wrong for giving them onlyb2 stars... Maybe I should have given them only one start. Here's why, the food was delicious, I ordered the chicken best teriyaki with noodle. I enjoy the food was delicious, however the 2 star is because the lady at the counter doesn't make you feel welcoming to this place. She was not rude but she was not nice. No smile, no hi, no thank you.... I'm my book this is a no no.... Will I go to this place again??? Maybe.... Maybe not.
Ok this was my third try and the last.  The first two times I went for pho at lunch.  Both times the service was abysmal (nobody is going to convince me I should have to wait 20 min for pho) and my pho ga was MEH (I believe that was beef broth in my ga-LAZY).  This time I got crispy rolls and BBQ pork vermicelli and the service was markedly improved.  The crispy rolls were the best I have ever had and I loved the fresh fixings that came with them.  I love spicy food but found it odd that their fish sauce is spicy.  I've eaten at lots of Vietnamese places in silicon valley and the fish sauce was always sweet.  The pork was severely overcooked.  Most pieces were the consistency of jerky; some were so hard I couldn't tear them in half with my fingers. If this is authentic Vietnamese, I'll take the Americanized version where my fish sauce is sweet and the meats are tender and juicy, thank you very much!
As an O&B restaurant chain, I expected a lot more. I went here for brunch, the service was terrible. The waitresses were unfriendly and unattentive, you would have to call them three-four times before you can get their attention. I ordered the eggs bannodict and my boyfriend ordered the croissant French toast. Both were sub-par. Nothing out of the ordinary. If you are looking for overpriced and bland brunch. This is the spot. Will not be coming back.
Horrible service! Won't come here again. Food was ok nothing special.
I ordered my Bleu cheese burger medium. It was way overdone, dry & chewy. The flavor was ok, but nothing great. The tomatoes were half green & mealy. I sat in the bar are for a late lunch. The older bartender was nice enough, but he never came back to check on me once the food was delivered. He did bring me another iced tea after awhile. I was definitely not impressed. At least the steak fries were good.
Overpriced and neglected rooms make this place a dump on prime real estate. The service is great and the rooms are large but questionable red stains in my room carpet and cabinet doors on broken hinges make me wonder what has happened in this room. On a good note is that the rooms are fairly clean other than the possible blood stains.
When we walked in the boy at the front just stared at us like he was lost. Then the young hostess girl gave us a dirty look like she didn't want to seat us. Then she was walking around the eating area fixing her hair and scratching her head. Gross. The only reason I gave it two stars was our server was amazing. He was apologetic for our ten minute wait to even be greeted once we sat down. Luckily I'm not from here so I won't be back.
Food was not that great and service matched. Kids mac and cheese had funny taste... Not bad just different like a smoky sweet cheddar. Scrambled eggs were dry and had unappealing texture. Also the server forgot my soup even after a reminder. Salads were large and good though (grilled and buff chicken). Thats the main reason they get the 2nd star. Its pretty hard to mess up salad though. I ll be goin to eatn park from now on. Shoulda never changed it up today.
We chose this venue for our wedding because of the discounted rate. On the day of the wedding the place looked great, but there is no professional service whatsoever. The "coordinator" was no where to be found and guests were actually wandering the building and coming to the bridal suite to say hi instead of being ushered to their seats! It was a free-for-all and no one was in charge. Careful with this place too because they started my 2 hours of open bar BEFORE THE CEREMONY! Therefore, a good half an hour of open bar is thrown away since guests are watching the ceremony, not waiting at the bar. I thought that was really shady. If you are a control freak, RUN AWAY! Gloria is scatter brained and none of the process goes as she says it will.
I have been here a few times already. The only reason why I end up coming back is because of out of town friends who want to eat here. The Anime character decor is cute and the waitresses are unique with their outfits, but those are the only good things going for this place.The food needs a lot of work. I have tried:-Shoyu and Miso Ramen: The broth was very bland and the noodles were too hard. You know it's bad when you feel like you can make a tastier bowl of instant ramen at home. -Gyoza: tasted like one of the frozen brands that you can buy at the grocery store. -California Roll: it was okay. I mean, it's hard to screw up a California Roll right?-Furikake Fries: interesting concept, but the furikake does not stay on the fries. They might as well just serve regular fries only. -Honey Toast with Ice Cream: probably their best menu item. Nice presentation, tasty and not too sweet. The service also needs a lot of work. Other than our very first visit, the servers have been horrible. We either always have to ask for drink refills or we get nothing at all. On our last visit I had to ask for napkins because they forgot to give us some. There were 9 of us at the table. Really?! Also, don't even think about ordering sliders because for some reason, they take forever to come out of the kitchen. Parking? Nonexistent. If you really are curious about this place, I would say go once to see what its about. If you are looking for a decent place to eat, don't waste your money here!
Now I understand why there are so many negative reviews. I came here today to get my discounted car wash and it might just be the worst car wash I've ever had.My rear and front windows had smudges all my over and they didn't properly clean the console area.The Armorall on the dash board was only half way distributed, which means when I get home I'll have to wipe it down evenly with a rag.In all honesty I'll most likely not come back and start looking for another oil change/car wash place.This joint needs to get their act together. I don't recommend this place at all.
Like most of the skuzzy strip clubs along Highland Drive, Foxy Girls reflects the kind of place you'd find in a town that's embarrassed to have a business where men pay to watch women take their clothes off [which is odd, because Vegas revels in skin].  It's hidden away in the industrial area, it's small, the dancers are run down and the drinks are overpriced.  That said, at least the place serves alcohol.  And when we were there, the dancers were good conversationalists and didn't immediately treat the customers like ATMs (that came later).
Awkward place no music, just really quiet, and empty. I give 2 stars because the lady was really nice and other wise would of gave it no stars
Meat and two place. Pretty decent food. Great service. Divey.
We stayed here when we got married. First of all we walked in and neither of us were not impressed. The casino was so not pretty.
2 strikes. Enjoy the fact that there are other options in the area like Dukes but our last couple visits have been very disappointing. Hate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I've ordered the past 2 visits. I can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost. Last visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today. I felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I'm not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I'm not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining. Decent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren't very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar? At least say something/acknowledge the customer that has been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink.
Their fees are astronomical.  Insanely high!!!  Even with the Yelp discount they extended I believe it was way too high.The billing department added some ambiguity to the bill by not being on top of it immediately.  Over 1.5 months later I received a call asking if they can charge my credit card for additional services (they feel was left off the first time).   I hate confrontation... I disagree with them completely... I agreed they could charge my card.  DISCUSS PRICING in detail before services...I give them two stars for their prompt service...  They arrived on time...They completed the job. I will NEVER use them again...
First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service.
Higher prices that some of the other locations.  Awkward layout.  You pay and go through the wash, exit and get wiped down by one guy, then get directed to a garage, exit the vehicle, walk down a small hill, wait at a table outside, and the vacuum person drives your car around to the other side of the convenience store.  WEIRD!  The car cleaning was okay, nothing special, still dust in corners inside and smear marks on the outside with tons of lint left by the dirty rags.
Pitiful...please see my photo of my bruschetta. The picture doesnt really show the end pieces, well imagine just bread and no topping on the rest of piece. Quality definitely has gone down hill since RA purchased Sauce. I use to use Sauce for catering all the time, I will not use them now because they are skimping on portions.
One of the few places in town you can view work from renowned artists and this place charges like its the Met. Maybe that's a bit much. But then again so is $19 for a two room exhibition no bigger than your local Starbucks. That's like paying $50 to go to Coachella to see ONE band play ONE song. It's bullshit, right? It is not worth the admission for most of the exhibitions they show. If you're a local, $10 on Wednesdays is a bit more reasonable... but discounts are only 5-8pm which doesn't really make much sense.
Ten minutes minimum in the drive through. Constantly have to hand them back the tater tots (I patiently waited for) because they are old and cold. I gave it an extra star because I feel the management is trying. I hate to complain but they are understanding and eager to correct the mistake. I hope this location gets better because it's close to my house and I do like the food when it's hot.
Hey Sauce! I heard some friends talking about how great your pizza was so I took the wife out to your restaurant last night to give it a try. I thought I'd provide you with our feedback as I have a feeling many other people may be feeling the same way we did about our experience. Lets start off with the good, the pizza was really good, our server was really good, the price of the food was decent, but that's kind of where it ends. Our first real impression of the place was when we were handed our menu's, both our menu's were beyond greasy and dirty and had food stuck to them, they were dingy/had bent corners and some of the paper had ripped off both of the menus this is a sign that nobody cares to wipe down the menus, and if nobody cares to even wipe down the menus it makes me wonder what else do they not wipe down regularly. When sitting around and taking in the whole atmosphere of the place, we felt it was a little dark and the restaurant as a whole needed to be wiped down. The garlic knots were really good, I still have mixed feelings about them, because most places that sell garlic knots dust them in parmesan cheese powder and some sort of garlic powder, and that's what I was kind of expecting here, but here I got fresh parmesan cheese and fresh chunks of garlic on top, don't get me wrong fresh is great but it was an ongoing battle to keep the garlic chucks and parmesan on top of the knot while eating it, where as if it were the parmesan powder I feel it would have stuck better and not have been so much work. The sauce that came with the garlic knots was amazing. Normally I like my garlic knots dipped in ranch, but I definitely liked your sauce over ranch last night. As far as your pizza goes it's really good. Let me start by saying I haven't found a place in the Vegas area that does pizza like yours, the thickness of the dough etc. We are transplants from California a little over a year ago and we've been on the hunt for a pizza with a crust like that. That's how 90% of all pizza places are in Southern California do it so that's what we've grown to like. Everything we have tried out here has seemed to try to spin off of New York thin style crust, so thank you for being a breath of fresh air for that. The pizza was hot when it came out as it should have, but for the life of me every slice I ate all the toppings would slide right off the crust, i felt like i might as well be eating a pizza casserole lol I thought that maybe everything was just too hot, but from the time I ate my first slice to the time I ate the last one, a good 15 minutes had passed and still the same situation. In regards to your soda glasses, you are using Samuel Adams pint glasses I think they were, these things were very frustrating, first of all not everyone likes beer and if you want to attract more families to your restaurant having every soda glass be a beer pint isn't very family friendly, but the most annoying part is every time I had a refill (at least 3 times) the ice was stuck in that center section and would drop to the bottom of the glass, just something to think about. Over all I liked the food, but all the other issues combined really make me want to rate you as 2 out of 5 stars. I was really hoping your restaurant would be added as a "usual place" for my wife and I but I think it's going to be in the once in a blue moon category. I hope business continues to grow for you guys and that you can dial down these little things and thrive as a business. Thanks again for the good food last night and good luck!
Small Korean Diner in Summerlin area of Las Vegas. New and clean. Serves plenty of bunchan (appetizers) before the meal. Bunchan are underwhelming and alcohol prices too expensive. I just got back from Seoul so once the entree arrives will have more to compare. Dinner salad was plain without much taste. 3 meals ordered were bibimbap, pork katsu and dynamite chicken. My wife said the food was okay, which translates from Korean "this sucks". If it were not for the sauce I could not have finished the katsu. My kid who is normally an eating machine never got out of first gear.I think the star of the show would have to be the the TVs with the Kpop music! If you want good Korean food, save your $$ and drive to Spring Mountain area.I will say the staff is very attentive and open to suggestions. Hopefully, the quality of the food will improve in the future?
Asked them to turn on the baseball playoff game and was told that the owner took the remote control to his home.I then asked them for the password to the WiFi and was told that the owner doesn't want anybody using it but himself ...To the owner:  Please enjoy the $10 that I spent at your restaurant as it will be the last money that I will ever spend at your business.  You need to get with the program as it is very common for patrons to ask for the TV channel to be changed (especially when it is playoff season) and so you know any business that doesn't offer WiFi to its customers is definitely the exception to the current way of operating a business.  Anyways, good luck to you and your outdated way to conduct business in the year 2015
Not for me- I like Wonton Soup and many people seem to like this place but my soup tasted like the water used to boil the noodles in - no flavour..... For the price no thank you, I can go anywhere else for more soup with more wonton and less noodles and more flavour.My veggies were hard the meat didn't taste fresh kind of ... Dusty almost, the wontons themselves we're fine but I didn't see much value in the soup at all. Sorry Wonton King ... I tried.
I waited 30mins just for my pork bone soup and pancake and the food is not even average, honestly I can make better one. The servants just kept us there and didn't  even have time to get us hot tea. I rly don't understand how the 4.5 stars came. Worst experience I have with a korean restaurant. This restaurant is on my blacklist.
Chicken Satay was good. Enjoyed what sushi we tried. My Pad Thai came with red onions, which is not displayed on the menu description of the dish.  Given that I am allergic this was a problem. The service was atrocious. There were four young people standing around in whatever they had fallen out of bed in, playing on their phones ignoring customers. Not that the head waitress wasn't trying; she was great and made an honest effort to pick up the slack. The air conditioning was off. Given that it was a 90 degree day outside you could understand the discomfort. I would try eating there again, I just wouldn't expect much of the service.
It's not good. I ordered the pork tacos, and while the pork was delicious and tender, it was advertised on the menu as being "street style" but what arrived were flour tortillas. It was my mistake for not reading more closely, and they tasted fine, but the problem was the "street style" referred to them coming with onions and cilantro on the side. They did come on the side, of a plate so hot that I almost had a facial. The plate had spent time in an oven, then had fresh lettuce, onions, and cilantro plunked down... so it was almost like a fajita! Except that I didn't want cooked onions and cilantro. It also came with a lime. Fresh lime squirted on tacos is delicious. I managed to finally squeeze one drop from the shriveled lime I received. When I questioned the manager about the tacos and the hot plate he was very considerate and offered to replace the food, which was very nice.My daughter ordered tea and received water.We will never return. LaUnica is less than 7 miles away, and much much better for authentic street tacos.
Honestly, their cakes are great, but the rest is lacking. I tried to make a special cake ahead of time and they were not very cooperative about it over the phone. The few times I bought the pastries, the cream had an odd taste to it...
I was super excited to go to this place because I saw it on the news and also saw there was one in the valley. The place is beautiful. My daughter and I received a super nice warm greeting when you entered. I thought alright this would be a good experience and a new place to go to. But afterwards I think maybe not. I will probably try again for maybe lunch or see if they do lunch but if not much better than breakfast probably go elsewhere. Our waitress was not warm at all in fact I would maybe say a tad salty like the food here. I don't know if it was a bad day though it was still early but it just felt pushy and not warm at all. The best part of the meal was the jam they give you for the toast. I heard from someone walking in they had good coffee I was disappointed with it as my mother who likes coffee as well. I had their biscuits and gravy and it was salty and also the sausage chucks were too much awesome they included that but way to big for my taste(I had other food but it was okay just okay though). I had a bite of my moms chicken fried steak and that was actually quite good. But I would love to say this place was amazing because I had such high hopes but nope maybe try again and try another breakfast meal maybe I got one that wasn't the best but other than that I have gotten better food from little greasy diners.
I really wish i could say more good things about perch but unfortunately I can't. I had such high hopes for this places based on reviews but was disappointed on multiple levels. First the host seemed like it was his first day bc he only wanted to offer me bar seating. However I was wearing a dress and meeting a girlfriend so that was not an option. Ultimately he spoke to another employee who told him to split up some of the other tables and seat us. Upside was the next service employee we dealt with (our server) was nice and fairly attentive. She provided us with recommendations when asked since it was our first time eating at Perch. However she gave so many options we still had a hard time narrowing things down. Now on to the food... This is the reason that score is so low. Its was mediocre unfortunately. I had the infamous Perch burger and it was not that fabulous. I felt it was somewhat bland to have a fried green tomato on it. Overall, the ambiance of the location is cute and very fresh. I think if i came back it would be for appetizers and drink perhaps. Wish i could say more good things but thats all folks!
First of all, I would like to start with the service which deserves more than 2 stars as it was the best part. The calamari and prawn appetizers were good, as was the wine. The main course which was the special for the night the Filet was horrible! I had to send my "medium well" back as the blood was pouring out as soon as I cut into it and they were two different sizes and I believe two cuts (which were not filet) it was tough, grainy and lacked flavour. I would not recommend the Steak. My husband also had the Filet and also had two different cuts ,one was over cooked and one was under cooked. The Chef needs to learn how to cook a steak. The veggies were old and soggy not crisp and fresh. Best part of the meal was the potatoes. Pretty bad for a $30.00 plus meal. I would say if I do return, I would try a pasta dish as this is probably their speciality.
I really wanted to like this salon. When I moved here I was trying all the area nail salons to find the best fit. The pedicure chairs seemed to be a little bit older and not well cared for. Many women were offered beverages, but I think they forgot my friend and I so we had to ask. The positive - we were able to walk in on a Sunday and get appointments immediately. The salon folks were very nice, but my nails chipped quickly.
I would have rated this resort 5 stars had there been better ventilation in the casino. The cigarette smoke was overwhelming and very poorly ventilated. I would expect similar air-quality at a 2 or 3 star hotel but I feel it is unacceptable at a 4 1/2 star resort! The management staff were only able to offer me an apology. If you intend to use the casino for entertainment or dining, I would not recommend this resort.
I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right. I went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.I mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers. The waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.So we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)My mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!My mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs. So they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.The french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.They are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time. If you want a free mediocre meal, come here.
Very slow service and depressing atmosphere. If you're in a rush and aren't willing to wait a while, it isn't the place. However, the Dosa was delicious and had great flavour to it. Additionally, the mango lassie was very refreshing and tasted amazing as well. We also ordered the chicken and mutton Koththu of which the mutton Koththu was highly unsatisfactory. I do not recommend getting it.
We have seen Dr. DeLucca since 2013 and he is absolutely wonderful. However, we will be switching pediatricians because the office staff is impossible to work with. Very rude each time we come, and there is typically some issue with records that she blames on me. Last time I somehow didn't have insurance anymore and they said I couldn't see the doctor until I paid 65$ up front. I asked if she had called my insurance, she said yes and they had said I am not covered. I called my insurance right there and within a minute of being on the phone was able to verify my insurance. Today I went for my daughter's well visit and the same girl said I didn't have an appointment. She said my appointment was last Thursday, which is possible but unlikely that I would schedule an appointment during a day that I work. Regardless of the error, she didn't not offer to work me in, and didn't try to reschedule the appointment. She said you don't have an appointment and that was it. I am very sad to have to see a new pediatrician but I can't handle the stress from the office staff any longer.
I had a disappointing experience, but the food was good enough for me to try again.FOOD:I had the eggs benedict and was thoroughly satisfied.  The fresh biscuit the eggs were placed on were the perfect texture and the hollandaise had a great twist of cinnamon that made the whole dish come together.  The menu is small, so check before hand if you want to make sure they have something you like. ATMOSPHEREThe restaurant is small, but takes reservations via Open Table which is a god-send for me.  The restaurant had a smell to it.  It could have been the frog legs, I have never smelt them, but the smell was like mildew or a wet towel.  It came in waves and permeated the room.SERVICE:Unfortunately, the service was slow and not much attention was paid to us.  Though when we caught there attention they were responsive.  I saw people that ordered after me get their meal before me, which never feels good.OVERALL:As mentioned above, these few bumps I experienced that day were over-shadowed by the food, as I am craving those eggs benedict again and will probably make a reservation soon.
Ordered take out to be delivered to my hotel after a conference I am attending.  The only reason that they get two stars instead of one, is that the salad was fresh and just fine and the garlic bread was okay.  However, the eggplant parmesan was HORRIBLE.  Overcooked, completely soggy, with soggy overcooked spaghetti.  I had ordered it in order to save half to take on the airplane for lunch on my trip home-- and instead, I threw it in the garbage.
I'm not too sure about this place. I might have to go back and try again. But here's what I am sure about. Service - very good, the redeemer of this place. Drinks - all of their signature cocktails were just sugar bombs with not of lot of depth. Cheap tasting stuff. Food - I got the coconut fried shrimp as a appetizer, and it was really tasty and well done. I ordered the fruit and chicken Caribbean salad and it was ok. The chicken was of the same quality you get in those giant frozen bags at Sams club, and it was just gross, it really felt like fake chicken, like they boiled it, idk. Don't order any of their chicken dishes. The salad was overdressed but was yummy at first. It's a very pretty dish. Someone at my table got key lime pie and really like it. The prices here are reasonable, if you don't expect above Chili's level cuisine. I will go here again and update this review after trying more of their "signature" dishes. 2 stars for now.
Poor service! I went with a group of friends after work one night and we saw our server maybe 3 times. The food was okay. We would have had another drink if we had a chance to order it. Overall not impressed. I will sit at the bar for drinks next time!
Paid $8 for a veggie sandwich which I thought was a bit much.  It was not fresh tasting and all my toppings were falling off.  My husband got a grilled chicken sandwich and they put so much mayo and the grilled chicken looked like it was microwaved over all was not very good. Friendly employees though.
Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. First, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. For lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). Finally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.
I hauled @$$ after a long day at work to get here before closing, and maybe it was because I came so late in the day, but the selection was limited. The already limited selection was further limited for me, because almost every item had some sort of edible glitter! Am I the only one who is reminded of metal shavings when there is shiny stuff on my food? Perhaps. In any case, I got a slice of cake that was described to me as a cake version of a "cannoli," and a macaron. The cake itself was nice and moist, but all together, it was overly sweet - too much frosting, not enough cake.  Also, the slab of sugar (frosting) separated from the layer of cake when I was "knifing" it with the side of my fork for a bite, which kind of turned me off - that typically happens when the cake is dry, and has been left out for a while, which it didn't seem to be.I didn't finish the slice, and didn't bother trying the macaron at that point - I think my roommate may have helped himself to it. The person behind the counter said A Bakeshop is known more for its cookies, so maybe I just didn't have the right expectations going in as I was jonesing for a decadent, cakey treat. However, I likely will not be back, especially because getting in and out of that center can be very stressful. Not only are spots limited because of TexAZ patrons, it's almost impossible to exit west on Bethany home on the  south side, or make a left going southbound on 16th street during rush hour.
After checking into the Hard Rock, and making our way to the pool area.  We thought, lets grab a bite, so we made our way back into the Pink Taco.We waited to get sat in the outside area connected to the pool,  After about 10 minutes we were sat (there were several tables open out there, and I hate when you have to wait to be seated when there are plenty of open tables.)  We decided on the appetizer platter for the two of us, and it had a couple of things to snack on, to hold us over for dinner.Sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole.  The guacamole was a very small portion.  The cheese quesadillas had NO FLAVOR.  The chicken skewers were over seasoned and dry.  The sweet corn tamales were good, and something I really enjoyed.  The taquitos were ok.  Overall I would say pass on this place after the meal we had.  You get free chips and 3 types of salsa when you get seated, and that was the best part of the meal for both my wife and myself.The service was OK, but I would never expect that much from a chain place like that.Overall, I would have rather ate at Taco Bell.  It is way cheaper, and has better overall food, in my opinion.
The first time I went I thought this place was very good, however, the second time was not as good.  The food is sort of bland, missing spices and just blah.  The portions are also a bit small when compared to other Thai restaurants.  I don't plan to go back.
As a salesman, I buy a lot of donuts for my customers. I like to spread the business around, especially to local and small businesses but I really can't recommend this place for its donuts. I ordered three dozen donuts for early morning pickup and everyone complained they were stale! I will not jeopardize business relationships again with this "day old" donut place.
I really try to give a chance, but their organic produce is disgusting.. The soups were empty and old.  The hard salami was brown..not red...gave several packages back to deli guy ...other things like frozen foods and some breads and stuff ok..but not enough for me to go often...I'll stick to WF's.
DVFM DOES NOT ANSWER THEIR PHONES. If they cared about their PATIENTS, not customers, but healthcare patients, in need of serious medical attention, they would address this too common complaint with their office. I have been suffering from bronchitis and possible pneumonia (per Cheryl Luchsinger) for a week. I have a nagging, itchy cough, body aches, cold chills, profuse sweating, loss of appetite and headache. I CHOSE to drive 40 minutes from my home in San tan valley, AZ in lieu of going to an urgent care facility closer to my home, for treatment because I thought that since DVFM had my medical history, I would receive more PERSONAL and adaptive care. PFFF!I felt very hopeful when Cheryl said she would treat it like a pneumonia, not just a bronchitis, to be safe. She seemed concerned and I felt at ease. She even made me laugh. I was prescribed an inhaler and antibiotics. I got the inhaler but unfortunately the antibiotics required a PRIOR AUTHORIZATION from my insurance. Walgreens sent the fax at 1:30 pm while I was standing there picking up my inhaler. I have been waiting for DVFM to respond to this request. STILL NO RESPONSE. Walgreens keeps saying to "contact your physician so they can change it or they can call your insurance"... What more can I do if DVFM won't even answer the phone???? Way to put patients first DVFM. Way to go.I have been going here for a year and a half. My pcp is dr. Lauber. I have just spent the last 24 hours awake with a nasty cough because I cannot sleep. I'm waiting a for Cheryl L the pA to respond to a prior authorization request sent from the Walgreens pharmacy at 1:30 yesterday. Really? Do you or your MA's check the fax machine on a regular basis?? This is not a matter of convenience it IS a matter of wellness for patients. Operations and policies need to change at DVFM before patients start reporting to the BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. ANSWER YOUR PHONES, CHECK YOUR FAX MACHINES. PUT PATIENTS FIRST. Isn't that why you opened your doors?
I've been a customer of their service center for the past 4 years. I've always enjoyed working with my service adviser and felt as though I was taken care of, even if there were mistakes made. During a recent call to schedule my regular oil change I was informed that they opened a new "quick service" center at the dealership for such services. Great! Or so I thought. Upon arrival I met my 'new' service adviser for these services. Sat for over an hour and half waiting to get my oil changed?!? When my service adviser came back in to get me...nope, he was just coming to tell me all of the other things they wanted to service on the car. I had already listened to this same talk with 2 other customers sitting in the waiting area. They had not even completed my oil change yet. I understand that there is recommended maintenance work based on mileage & age of a vehicle, but why aren't they letting people know up front that these are recommendations?! Waiting for 90 minutes (when I had a scheduled appointment) to find out the items, like air filters, transmission flush, etc is recommended as well, is pretty ridiculous and poor customer service.One of the items recommended was a 'transmission flush' which I decided was worthy of coming back for to have completed. I emailed my service adviser multiple times about the service and cost to make sure that they would be doing an actual flush and NOT just a fluid change. He assured me that it would be a flush. When I pulled up to have the service completed he informed me that this was a flush and not a service. So, just the fluids would be changed. ARGH....Seriously? This is common industry terminology folks. A fluid change and a flush are not terms that are used interchangeably. They are NOT the same service and the cost that Henry Brown Buick, GMC wanted for the actual work of a flush was no where near comparable to what other automotive centers charge. I drove away. Not only has my service adviser (Scott Usher) been replaced, but they have brought on new people that aren't even that well versed in their own industry. Disappointing on so many levels. I like my Buick just fine, but without the option of a different dealership, located within in a reasonable distance, to work on it for warranty and basic service needs, I don't think I'll be keeping this vehicle anymore. Although they may think they are adding value to the customer by having this quick lube center, it has added nothing positive to my experience with this dealership's service center.
Hmmm... I'm conflicted and a bit perplexed by this one.  First, let me admit that I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place and accidentally let it expire on Sept 3rd.  Knowing this, I called the restaurant and spoke with Jerry the manager.  After I told him the deal expired, he told me, "Don't worry about it, we will still take it." He was extremely pleasant on the phone and I presumed that he meant that the full deal would still be honored. On the same day that I called and spoke with Jerry the manager, I went over to Garcia's.  After sitting down at my table, the server told me that she can only accept the "paid value" for the deal (which is the amount that I already paid) and that it will be deducted from my bill.  I explained that this was not my understanding after talking to Jerry the manager, but she said that she, "just talked to Jerry about it."  While I did not ask for Jerry (because sometimes I just don't feel like fighting), I am very displeased at the miscommunication that took place here.  I am deducting four stars for this whole debacle.  With all of that said, the pollo fundido was very good (even though my spellcheck keeps changing it to "pool funded")... and the house margarita helped to turn my frown upside down... but the crowning moment of this visit was the fried ice cream.  Took me back to my childhood and all was good again.  For Garcia's Mexican Restaurant, this means I added a star back.I'd go back because of the food and fried ice cream, but not the service.
For the most part, you'll find me in casinos on the Strip battling it out but when I want to play for FUN and not put serious $$money on the tables, I find myself relegating to small local casinos not far from the Strip and this one is very close, about a mile away. Although, I have decided not to come here any longer.I have mixed views about this place. For one thing, a lot of people who frequent this casino just don't have any sense of fashion. Second of all, and this is a big complaint, at the Sportsbook, you can't have a seat and catch a game without feeling that you're sitting besides a homeless person who hasn't showered in a month. For some strange reason, it appears sports bettors are not given priority in being able to sit first. I'm very social and I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but come on, the lack of personal hygiene of your fellow man can be repulsive.Now there are positives. The dealers are pretty cool, the pit bosses are very welcoming and some even greet you with a smile. The buffet and restaurant cafe are found upstairs, and I would not recommend eating at the cafe at all, it just takes too LONG for them to take your order and bring your food, totally not worth it. The casino floor is well laid out and small to navigate so for the few cuties that stop in once in a while in high heels, it shouldn't be an issue. There is plenty of parking close by so step out, grab your ride and go to your next spot.The atmosphere is local, the attitude is local so keep that in mind if you're coming to Silver Sevens from out of town. I have never stayed here for the night so I can't speak for their rooms and their amenities it includes.
Service was ok. Got charged extra for beer cheese that came with Pretzel bites and charged for a video game that we didnt play.
I've just moved to Phoenix and I attempted to use my chef's table birthday certificate that is a yearly tradition for me. This year, I was unable to use it because I was dining alone and apparently I needed to order 2 entrees to use my certificate. The certificate does not clearly state that 2 meals need to be purchased. So not only did I have to pay for my meal (which I didnt expect), but i left my entire entree at the restaurant because I had to get to work. They offered to hold it for me, but i didnt have time to get back there. So basically I paid $35 for an entree I did not receive. So frustrating. Guess I will have to find a new tradition. On a happier note our chef, Kyle, was fantastic. It was the best show I'd seen yet. Thanks Kyle!
The name was changed from York to Cho but layout is pretty much the same. Overall I thought York was better with respect to the sushi (more fish & better selection), buffet was OK but I liked the York version better, used to love that u could get some interesting ice cream flavors out of the buckets and now they have middle school cups. Service has always been good and price has remained reasonable. I will probably NOT go back.
I am not surprised about the reviews on here as Armenian Kitchen is pretty inconsistent. If I am in the area I might go there for lunch; I have tried them many times over a span of 10 years.I have been to Armenian Kitchen when they served me fresh-made food and it was wonderful.   However, there has been times when it wasn't as good and one time I went there and they served me falafel out of a tupperware that was re-heated in the microwave.  But it wasn't the usual guy that cooks there that did that.Hopefully, they will work things out so they could be good all of the time.I agree with one of the comments on here.   There's a waitress there who is a total ditz.
Sigh...I used to eat here 3 times a week. It is no longer great food; it's not even good anymore. The flavors are different. The food doesn't seem freshly cooked, just reheated. The food is more grey/brown in color.  I'm not sure if it went downhill do to the Persis competition a block over from here or if it's new management. They don't even bother to give you diced onions anymore; they are just huge wedges now. I'd pass on the naan. The other reviewer also mentioned the sweet korma. It's quite off putting. The mango lassi is bright orange, clearly not fresh and the samosa was so unappealing as to be inedible. RIP.
Dirty,dirty,dirty, staff was all young and immature. Dinning room was flithy food on all tables. And my burger was half done and bun was cold..yes really cold! Dont bother this location..sucks
Ordered Cali and octopus bowls, I don't know why people like to eat this. Two bowls taste the same, no difference. The octopus is really hard to chew, it took me 5 minutes to chew only 1 piece. My temples are going to explode. Salmon is just OK. Rice is too hard and raw.I will not go back.
Meh.  Pretty forgettable subs.  Jimmy John's and Milio's are better options for delivery.
I heard about this great restaurant, serving Rustic French Country cuisine, by a good friend of mine. He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark. So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out. Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront.  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike. We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights. It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day. We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting. Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best...did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us. The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada. Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head.The menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch. I really like when restaurants give you options. By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation. Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche. Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items."French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?" Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter. His response blew us away. "Well, they're really different. One is sweet and the other savory." The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing...no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation. Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners. We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend. An hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food. Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay. Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing. The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, "nothing special" and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best. Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable. We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day. Mr. poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy.  The service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good...what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip. Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips. I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said "This is the worst service I've ever experienced!" I really felt compelled to say something about our experience. We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed. So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?
Damn the pizza is good! Bring it with pepperoni and ricotta, a couple of side salads and boneless wings and I'm good. It's about once a week for delivery.UPDATE: The food is becoming more erratic from Caliente. The wings arrived tough. Again. The broccoli puffs got you the extra star.
I road my motorcycle to the theater and after buying a ticket, I was informed that I had to leave my helmet and gear at guest services.  According to the representative,"My helmet is a safety hazard to other viewers".  I can't fathom the logic and I wasn't about to leave my prized gear behind.  Luckily I was able to get my money back.  Looks like I will need to find a theater with some common sense.
I need to lower my rating. My love for how tasty and consistent St. Louis wings are has not changed. It's the service that truly needs help.The staff there are friendly. We were a group of roughly twenty folks saying goodbye to a fellow colleague last Tuesday. His manager booked a reservation for us.Our software development team comes here often. Service at this establishment as of late has been bad.It was Tuesday, meaning that you can get wings for half price. I ordered two pounds of wings. I chose honey garlic and sweet chili as my sauces. It came with fries. I also ordered a Diet Pepsi. I ate half my wings and packed the rest home when I finally got my order.I placed my order at around noon. Our server was jotting down everyone's names. I thought that things were getting better service-wise. Nope. So wrong.In our group, I was the last person to get my order. A fellow colleague came in later than I did (12:35 pm) and got her food first before everyone else!I was the last person to get my food, waiting for over an hour. I thought that I was going to die. Luckily, I have enough fat stored around my belly that I snapped out of hangry mode! As soon as I heard my Brazilian developer say that his wings weren't what he had ordered, I knew that he was munching on my lunch order. Yep, she, my server, had given him my order. Ugh!I finally got my order. My software development manager advised me to not give a tip. I rarely don't tip, but I had to. It was just not right.(187)
Not takeout friendly unless you enjoy cutting your own noodles.  Beef broth for pho was pretty good, but the ramen is totally worth skipping.  The wangs were totally underwhelming - save yourself some money and toss some wings in oil at home, then dump on some sweet and sour once crispy.  Garlic rice had no garlic.  Can't recommend.
Mediocre at best. Previous reviewers must have been confused that they were somewhere good.  Hong Kong noodle soup with duck was a decently cooked portion of duck with a brick of egg noodles. The noodles were so over cooked or reheated that they wouldn't come apart and gave up after of few minutes of fighting them.Fried rice was decent, egg flower soup was decent but I think most people prefer it a bit thicker and not watery.   Sweet and sour pork was good but the dinner combo only has five pieces.  Chicken chow me in was alright, just wish they didn't use so much MSG you can taste it more than the protein in the dish.Might go back if I was stranded in the hood with no where else to go during a civil uprising.
Four stars average on Yelp, REALLY??? We dined here because it's Thomas Keller's establishment.  Alas, it proved that the negative rumors of his restaurants are true.  Bouchon fell short. Croque madame: seriously the BEST croque madame?? More like average to decent.  Eggs Benedict: again, way average.  For that price tag, it fell BELOW average. So my conclusion is Las Vegas dining does not compare to other places in its class (Chicago, NY, SF Bay Area).  Oh and service was atrocious!  We had to serve our own water because our glasses never got filled. The server scolded us for serving our own water.  I had to walk up to ask for a spoon.  We have to ask for bread, and it was just tossed on the table.  The server rolled her eyes when she dropped a spoon.  Is it because people don't expect good food and service from Las Vegas???  Whatever the reasoning, skip Bouchon.
The drinks are decent, the environment its ok the place is nice it just needs more people cuz it was dead, the guacamole was bland and black meaning its old or the avocados were bad when they made the guacamole.  I don't think I'm going back
I had this place as a 5 star spot. That's because I only did breakfast here. I went in 3 times at dinner before I updated the review. I just found out one of the worst servers I've ever had is the manager. Ashley I think her name is (stocky girl who sets at bar alot doing nothing, with dark hair) is the worst server. The word serve is in server and she is more of a setter. She and the bearded bar tender were last night actually bragging while I was there to hear it about the lack of effect they put in because the owner doesn't care. Well then I seen the comment cards and I gave a few opinions. 2 girls who work there mostly mornings (tall black hair gal, and I believe her name is Amanda with dirty blonde hair and a cute smile) are only people I'd keep and fire the rest! I've owned places and managed others. This place has awesome food, beef up the staff guys!!!
Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The "Jimmy the Attorney" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the "food safe" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks.
The first rule of pie making must be to have perfected crust.  It should be flaky, delicate, sweet and tempt you to eat the entire perimeter [to really piss off your family].  Whatever the dry, flavorless stuff was that held this thing together might as well have been cardboard.    I got an apple pie, which should be the benchmark.  if you can't make an amazing apple pie, you should go into the cupcake business.  The apples were wafer thin and under-cooked, the spice was too strong, too much allspice or clove, over-powering.  Seasoning should be subtle and delicate with nice chunks of soft baked apples simmering a a delicious almost caramelized sauce....something to really blend in with Ice Cream if you go a la mode.  The most telling sign has to be this.  My two kids ate two bites and left theirs untouched on the counter and a day later I have half the pie left.  Even the crappiest $5 pie from Fry's I pick at until it's long gone within 2-4 hours tops.  Today I brought the leftover to office, those vultures will eat packets of taco bell hot sauce.   Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a $20 artisan pie.  My palate doesn't give two shits about anything but taste and texture, period.  I can't will myself to hanker for this.  Now my quest for a decent apple pie that I don;t have to bake myself continues. Thanks Pie Hole for reminding me my Grandma is dead and I can't go home again.
Waited over 30 minutes to be seated. Ordered steaks. Not very good. Tough and chewy. Salad and bread were the best part of the meal. Will not be back.
I love the pizza, but I've had just 1 good experience here when the weather was gorgeous in the evening on the patio. The first time patio experience was bad because fruit flys (I think) were pretty bad. I had a fine in experience 2 weeks ago. It was cold so we decided to eat inside. The smell inside is like a dirty drain and flys again, but not as bad. The pizza was good, but I don't think I'll be going back.
The gym is always crowded, always. In my opinion way oversold.  Early Saturday and Sunday mornings are the only chance you have at getting a workout done in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been a member since opening and it's only gotten worse not better.  I'm looking for a new gym now.  My wife enjoys the classes so she will keep her membership here.  And my son meets friends here so he'll keep his membership.  But I just want to be able to get through a workout without having to wait for anything to be available or constantly changing what I'm trying to do.The other thing that really bothers me about EOS is that I'm paying for a premium membership which is supposed to include access to additional areas like the cinema room, the tiny basketball court and the swimming pool, but there's no restrictions on who can use these areas.  Anyone can walk in.  So unless you want to access other EOS clubs, there's no reason to purchase anything but the basic membership.I would love this gym, but it's too crowded.  Would rather pay more and be able to complete a workout in a reasonable amount of time.
Good sushi but the "all you can eat" option has draconian rules. If there's a single piece left on your plate it costs a dollar extra(1 for maki, 2 for sushi). They'll actually watch over you like a hawk to see you eat it. Their menu is confusing to where it can cost you far too much for what you get if you're not careful.
Ditto what an earlier reviewer stated: " I really wanted to love this place but I ended up just sort of liking it."It is just a few doors down from a salon I go to so I thought it would be convenient; however the food just isn't that great.  I have tried several varieties of the empanadas as well as the tamales, but none of them were that "special".   The second time I came home with some tamales, my husband didn't even want to try them because they were so dry the first time (even steaming them to properly reheat).   I also tried a lunch plate that was an enchilada with beans and rice.  Actually it was a rather strange version of an enchilada--more like a folded over triaguilar tortilla with minimal fillings.  This place doesn't seem to know what it is--a take out restaurant, sit-down restaurant or caterer.  Most businesses are better if they try to excel at one thing rather than be everything.  I'd be a bit surprised if this place makes for another year or two with the current business plan it has going.
I give this place only two stars. The gyros are  the kabobs are good. The problem is the time you have to wait. If I call ahead and I get there 15 minutes later I expect my food to be ready not to wait an extra 25 minutes when I get there.
I've been to this Zinburger a few times now. On opening weekend we went and I honestly had the best burger experience of my life. Every time I've been back it's been truly lackluster. My burgers always undercooked and under-seasoned. The service is continually poor, with a lot of staff standing around looking like they've never been trained before and have no manager. My appetizers always take ages to come out. In-N-Out is a cheaper and more reliable alternative.
The food was pretty good, but the weird looking blonde guy behind the bar was quite strange. He was in the parking lot, smoking, when we arrived and he starred at my fiance and as we entered, he then followed us in. We sat on the sushi bar side, this guy was the bartender. He continued to stare at me, very noticeable by myself and my wife. He also made it a point to walk past our table several times, for no apparent reason. When we were finished and leaving, he followed us out, got in his car and left.
No expense spared meal. Service from Lilly the sever and our sommelier was very good but the food was downright terrible for this price point ($250 pp). I've eaten at the top places in Vegas in comparison (eg, roubouchon, Savoy, etc). Avoid unless it's free.
Supposedly the "premier" dining venue of the Arizona Biltmore, the "premier" part was missing. The waiter was a bit too casual in his style in this type of venue and was never around when you needed a new drink or had a question. Their version of Onion Soup was a slice of cheese in the middle of a large shallow bowl containing a fairly bland broth. The lamb sirloin on black garlic risotto was tough and tasteless. The risotto was undercooked. The halibut Oscar did not have much flavor. We don't mind paying for a really nice meal. This was not a really nice meal and was therefore way overpriced.
Corned beef croissant was ok. I had to ask for my donut three times then the guy questioned that I had already paid for my donut. Donut was stale. Only good thing was the coffee.
Food was good and the hibachi guy was awesome! However, we had a 7pm reservation and we didn't leave until after 10pm. We also got seated in the basement and it was super hot down there. The service was slow and it's hard to wait until 8:30 to get food. They kept saying "the hibachi chefs will be down shortly because it's really busy upstairs". When we asked for our checks, he came really quick than disappeared. Our friend had to go upstairs to take our checks up to the front desk to get them taken care of. Once our friend had given the hostess our checks, her response was "oh your waiter is busy". What?! I don't think I'll be returning here. The service wasn't what I expected for an establishment in the location it is in & for the prices I paid. Feel free to come eat here if you want to spend 3-4 hours of your life waiting on dinner.
Customer service needs improvement . Lots of seating inside. You can get refills on your tea and iced coffee while you are there .
So we got a room Wed for Fri the 17th. Less than 50 bucks after tax and all. Get there check in is pretty quick. Ended up having to go to back of casino take the elevator to the fifth floor walk across an Open Sky Way and stay in room that was more like a motel room. Didn't even know this part of the hotel existed. Have to say the Linens were clean the towels are clean the pillows were in good shape the tile was clean the furniture was a little bit dated unfortunately the heat was broken for the whole row and we nearly froze to death, they brought us extra blankets at 2 in the morning or were going to move us it was a huge pain in the ass and freezing. If the ice machine hadnt been broken and the heat had worked in our room it would have been fine but otherwise it was kind of a drag.
Food was ok, not the best just ok. Service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots... They brought out everything and forgot the wings! And never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and Knots before the wings even came! We where told that they forgot to put them in! BS! And the manager never even came over to apologize.... Horrible customer service!
The service at this Roberto's keeps getting worse. If you do eat here make sure they get your order right. Since they don't repeat back what you ordered if they missed ringing something up or they ring it up wrong they look at you like it's your fault.
I had some business dowtown (not court or jail) so I thought I would give this a try.  Stopped by at about 12:30 and the parking lot was full.  This place is a in a tiny little run down building.  I loved the sign on the door that said "to open push hard."  We are not in summerlin anymore...So after pushing hard on the door to get in - the place was packed!  One table left, now I can see why the guy that pulled in behind us practically ran us over to get in here first!  He wanted to get a table!It is a tiny square dining room, with maybe 30 people in  it.  There is no atmosphere here - and with out the advice from Yelpers I would probably not stop in.  Sometimes I can't tell if the restaurant is a quaint mom and pop joint with some charm or if the owners are too cheap to update the place???The food was about average.  Shredded beef enchilada and a chili rellano.  The only thing that stood out was the sauce - everything else was ok.A friend had a beef burrito with green chili as a combo.  The burrito was sorta small with a dash of green chili sauce.  Disappointing for a $13 lunch special.I saw a taco on the plate of another customer and it was a store bought taco bell like taco shell.  Not impressed.Overall - food was okay.  The service was okay.  The place is a dump.2 lunch specials for $28.50...hmmmm.  I would rather eat at Roberto's and spend less money.
We entered the store super happy, we left really sad we tried to make conversation with our cashier but she cut us right away with the "your total is" jeezz I guess she was super annoyed ...who knows , there was only two persons behind me.  She look friendly so diss appointment
Nothing spectacular. Just convenient depending on location. Not enough of salmon on the Supernova sandwich for its over priced. Very stingy. Employees were very rude overall.
I've worked at Oliver & bonocinis. I know what is expected of a visit to any of the O&B restaurants. Honestly .. if this place keeps up with the terrible service that I experienced tonight, in such a prime location, Oliver and bonocinis will eventually lose their good reputation. My friends and I waited for over ten minutes - no menus. No water. No server. No SERVICE. and it's really not that busy. The server in the section looked absolutely miserable and didn't acknowledge us once until after the manager came over (35 mins after already sitting there and ordering drinks off a bus boy - who forgot and I ended up just ordering from the bar) The manager then forgot our second round of drinks - remembering once we waved him down. The food ... not up to O&B standard .. calamari tasted like frozen calamari .. the tacos were (in lack of better terms) slop. And the wings and crab cakes .. they were "alright".  This review is slightly harsh however I expected much more from this restaurant and was slightly embarrassed as I told my friends from out of town how great it was.
Took forever to get our food; almost an hour. Then the food we got was bad BBQ. Ribs were really fatty. Beans tasted odd. Not like make it in Texas, that's for sure. Combine that with inattentive service, and it's enough to never come here again.
This is NOT the place to come if you're looking for a spot to throw. During my last trip out to sin city, some friends and I were looking for a chill lil dive bar to grab a drink and throw some steel tip darts. This was one of the spots that came up in conversation w a local bar hopper as well as on a Yelp search. We thought we'd give this spot a chance. Hmm, this place was very UNDERwhelming.The waitresses here aren't the most helpful. They don't seem too knowledgeable when it comes to knowing whether or not they have certain brews on draught or if they have ginger beer, etc. They also take too long to ask if you need help. Poor service!!!There also seemed to be some odd "rules" here about where they could and couldn't serve alcoholic beverages. They said it had something to do with their liquor license but it sounded like some BS to us. Having been the DD, I decided to order a soda. Yuck!!!! The syrup was not only gone but it tasted old and spoiled almost. That was disgusting. I sent that back and just had water. We threw a few games of cricket and called it quits. The score boards weren't at all in good shape. The boards were super beat up too. The bull line was real worn out. I knew this spot was dicey but this was pretty bad. I doubt I'll be back.
I've been here 2-3 times now and the only reason I would go back is because they carried Donna Salazar papers that I haven't found anywhere else. Their clearance really is all the junk no one wants. The clearance at other stores at least normally has a few good finds, but not here. Sadly, I had the same experience with employees that many other people had. They would be off in areas that customers are obviously not supposed to be in. I like to be generally left alone when shopping, but appreciate a greeting and being asked at least once if I am looking for anything in particular. Everything was at Full MSRP and a lot of what they offered was old school scrapbooking that I'm totally not into. You guys badly need to get some products from the cutting edge scrapbooking companies.
The lightbulb was definitely the reason why I wanted to check this place out. Was disappointed that only 2 of their drinks came in a lightbulb: their regular milk tea and matcha milk tea. Nothing too special about the tea and the tapioca was soggy and stuck together. And no, you don't get to keep the lightbulb, unless you forfeit your $20 deposit.
I had take out from here yesterday.  The chicken was strange - I had sesame chicken, and it was surprisingly salty and had the flavor of Worcestershire sauce in it.  It wasn't sweet.  It simply tasted odd.I gave up after about a quarter of the meal.  I won't be going back.
Server and service were good, but the food sucked bad. Hush puppies were rock hard and dry and tasted a few days old. Ribs seemed like they may have come from a microwavable frozen entree. Pulled pork and mac and cheese were edible, but not good (think cafeteria or cheap buffet quality). No need to ever come here with so many other options available close by.
Decided to try Garcia's for the first time. We were seated right away for a Friday evening then it went south from there. The waitress (Alex) was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. When I told her we weren't ready she basically stormed off. We asked for more salsa when our cheese crisp arrived and chips and she ignored us. A waiter brought out our main course and asked him for the salsa and he brought it but basically dropped it on our table. We will never go  there again. I would rather go to  Taco Bell and get better service.
There is truly nothing special about this "smoothie" shop. The ingredients do not seem fresh, the prices are high (typical airport pricing), but the shelves are rather sparse and oddly stocked. I only stopped here because the line was nearly empty with only 2 people ahead of me. A smart water was around $5. And the naked smoothie close to $6.
Been coming here since they opened , over the last year or so this place has slowly declined in cleanliness,customer service, and overall movie experience . The prices are super high for what you get which unless you ask for light ice is a cup full of ice with a shot of your favorite soft drink.  These people really need to step up to the plate and work on customer service skills, and instead of texting while working clean the place !!!
Ok, honestly, I really wanted to like this place. The location was promising as most of the best Mexican food is found in hole in the wall strip malls. The ambiance inside was promising, with string lights hung from the ceiling and authentic tables and chairs. As soon as we walked in, what seemed to be one of the two owners mentioned in previous reviews sat us at a booth amidst large crowds of other patrons. Then we wait... and wait... and wait. It literally took us flagging down our hostess to get drinks, chips, and salsa. We received our drinks and two salsas, a red and a verde. Ten minutes later, we ordered. Two of us got a wet burrito. One with beef and another with chorizo, served with rice and beans. One got the carnitas. Cue the 45 minute wait for our food (the party of 15 behind us didn't help, I'm understanding). So we get our plates and the "wet burrito" is sitting in a grease flavored red liquid... don't recommend. Carnita pork slab was DRY. The rice was hardly authentic, I'm talking like plain Jane rice. So much for my hopes and dreams of delicious Mexican food
Food was sub par but cool atmosphere. Well if you are looking for great stakes go somewhere else. If you hare looking for atmosphere that it is cool, nice and relaxing around Monte Carlo this is a good place. As someone who host clients I eat a lot of high end stake and this is not the place. But the décor, location and service keep this from being 2 star and if you are going for drinks and aps I would give it 4.
I like Salsarita's but unfortunately this location seems to have gone downhill recently. We generally get take-out but lately we get home to find burnt quesadillas, quesadillas with no cheese on half of it, or a bag of broken "bottom of the barrel" chips. We usually go there because our kids like the place but even they don't like it anymore. Most of our order last night went straight in the trash can.
I have a personal rule whenever I visit a restaurant - everything deserves a second try. On my first visit to Kickstand, I went with a friend and we sat outside on the little patio area. The food was decent but not exceptional. The burger itself was pretty plain, but the toppings and bun made up for it. I had sweet potato fries and they were a decent compliment, if not a bit squishy. They were served with a thick sludgy brown sugar syrup that was more sweet than flavorful. Decent service balanced it out, and I was ready to give it a second shot.On my second trip, the service was beyond great. The wait staff turned our in-booth TV to the Virginia Tech football game because they saw us wearing our school colors. The food on the second trip was... Well, again, mediocre. I got the Hungover Cyclist which is a variant on my personal holy grail of burgers - the grilled-cheese buns hamburger. I've had it in several places that all put their spin on this cheesy miracle. I really hate to say it, but the one in my neighborhood did the worst. The grilled cheeses were enormous Texas toast slices that drowned out any flavor of cheese or burger with gummy bread. In addition, the only topping on the burger was tomato - even though I asked for some lettuce for balance, I didn't get it. Just a meat patty and a tomato slice between two incredibly awkward grilled cheeses.So I gave it a third shot as a rubber match. I went solo and sat at the bar and left Kickstand completely frustrated. I happened to be there at the same time as another customer that came separately and sat down shortly after. The entire time I was there, the bartender never addressed us individually - he took our orders together, brought our food together, checked in on us at the same time, and brought our checks together. He spent the rest of the time leaning against the bar watching the news. In a complete class-act moment while watching a report about Obama in Indonesia, he remarked that Obama said "It's great to be back in my birth country of Indonesia once again." I'm not a political person, I don't care what your side is, but if you're going to make completely idiotic and aggressive statements then we're done. I've got better things to do with my time than eat a mediocre burger served by a mediocre staff.
A group of friends and I went here to watch an MMA fight. I knew that it was going to be crowded, but I didn't expect that they would keep letting people in AFTER they told us that they have to let 24 people out to be compliant with fire safety. We were sitting in the bar area and there were so many people, we ended up watching the last of the fights at the front by the main doors. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come take our order, but our food arrived shortly after, and it was alright. Nothing too special, but it wasn't horrible. Do not expect anything but typical bar food. It's also kind of on the more expensive side - given the quality & quantity of it. Overall, it seems like an alright spot to watch games and fights (clean, a ton of TV's) but they need to become aware of how many people they are letting in versus going out - it's a huge safety hazard. I understand that they are trying to make money, but it's alright to tell people that the restaurant is full. It made myself and many people around me extremely uncomfortable to not even be able to move around at our table without bumping into people.
This place is quick, just like any other Starbucks. Although, I order a hot drink on the mobile app and when I arrive to pick it up it was iced. I did let them know and they fixed it and I went on my way.  I decided to give them a second try the next day and the same issue occurred. This time I did not want to even bother and ask for my drink to be remade because I was in my way to work. I did double check my orders both days thinking I could have order iced instead of hot, but I didn't.
I'm not too sure about this Petsmart anymore. Especially the lady who helped me in the aquatics section today. She was on the y'all side, skinny with light brown hair and looked to be Caucasian. First of all, when I was originally going to ask for help, she was the first in sight, but she immediately ducked away and avoided eye contact, so I went to the cashier and asked for help with pick out the goldfish that I wanted. Well guess who came to my help... the First Lady... She looked totally unwilling and was even having arguments on her headset and laughing. This isn't so much the part I'm upset about. What irked me was the way she handled the fish. MY FISH. She scooped out the first fantailed goldfish in a fast swoop, then when she got to the second (a black moor) she ended up pinning him between the net and glass, pinching the left side of his tail fin. Now it has a sag... which it didn't have before. Roughly tossed them in the bad and was sloshing them around when writing the sku. I kept quiet the whole time as the fish were still in her hands and not yet my fish. Fancy goldfish are slow swimmers. The fins in fish are also a bit delicate. None of this was needed. I wish I knew her name. I'm so glad I got these guys out of there, but can only imagine how else they've been treated. That person is bringing down the rep of the store. I've had better experiences than that in the exact same store. I'm disappointed tbh
I normally take complaints about service with a grain of salt, but the folks at the cafe seethe with hatred for customers and don't seem to care about much at all.  The rest of the theater is fine although it seems to generally play the same Hollywood stuff you'd get at a Marcus for a little extra money.
Here are my pros about this place:- There is plenty of parking- I love that their Butcher counter is from Pavao meats, which I previously reviewed and really enjoy going toCons:- Their seafood counter is a little bit abysmal- It's in Dufferin Mall, I don't like this mall- Their fruit and vegetable selection never seems to be enough, you walk round and round and you put nothing in your basket- Their entrances are like teeny tiny, the one from the above ground parking lot and the one from the mallSo back to this butcher shop which I'd say is the only saving grace of this place. They serve great meats, reasonable prices and this time I got to try some more tasty sausages that are fantastic, one of the big reasons I go to the real shop on Dundas.And this is just for No Frills in general, I wish they took Visa or AX. Only Mastercard because of PC.
I have been to American Pub with the same friend about seven times, five of those seven times have just been terrible experiences yet kept coming back because I would always find an excuse to give them another chance. Whether it be for the delicious french fries and carolina burger or I understand as a fellow server and having worked in customer service since I was 16. I know what it's like to get busy and to have a 40 minutes ticket wait or to have the waitress not tell you when you get sat. However, almost every time my friend and I come in our server takes at least 5 minutes to come greet our table in an empty restaurant (There is a server rule: thirty seconds to get to your table and greet them) and once they got our orders they would check on us about twice before dropping the check. One time we stood at the entrance waiting for someone to greet us or at least tell us to have a seat where ever and they'd have someone to us shortly, without even a passing by bartender saying anything to us we finally left. My same friend and I visited tonight for a quick meal and were surprised to see it almost empty with no more than 30 guests in the restaurant. The hostesses were sweet and inviting and of course had not a problem sitting us, the problems started after we sat down. We sat there for a little over five minutes before a nice red headed girl dressed as a Teenaged mutant ninja approached us and asked if anyone has been with us yet, we said no and she got us waters and let us know our server will be there shortly. Well it wasn't shortly. It took quite a while for her to come and take our appetizer/entrée orders. We waited about 30 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant for our appetizer alone. I'm unsure if the Buffalo Shrimp come served cold, if so that's a stupid idea with it being breaded and spicy, if not our shrimp and bottom of the plate were cold. The edge of the plate was warm so it's like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. I'm guessing our server forgot and the cooks didn't let anyone else know to run the food....which is not how it has been done in any restaurant I have worked at. A completed order in the window gets ran with notice to the tables server, that's that. We had them take away the shrimp and our server didn't approach us at all about the situation but once to drop off our burgers. She didn't ask if there was anything she could do, however another server in a leopard jumpsuit did and was extremely apologetic for a mistake that wasn't hers and another girl took away our buffalo shrimp while she walked pass. The GM John came and spoke with us, he handled it well and even paid for our food as we let him know that my friend is a restaurant cook and I am a server so we know how it works and this wasn't working. By that time we no longer wanted to waste time there and left. I have zero excuses now, my tables get snatched if I don't take them within 2 minutes and mine along with my fellow servers asses would be chewed if we just left food in the expo window without asking for a table to go to or the server to run it. It's unacceptable and I wish their service wasn't shitty because I love the food.
Went with a party of 8 on a Friday night.  Two wanted bone in rib eye and we told at 8 pm they were out.  Huh?  It's a steak house.  Manager less than sympathetic.  Also one NY strip came out well done instead of medium.  Very slow delivery of entrees as well.  A very expensive and poor experience.
Entered restaurant and it was 60 percent full for a small restaurant.  Waitresses seem disorganized. Tables were gritty.  Food took a long time to come out.  Boneless wings were Refried and had to be sent back. Nacho app, poutine, and loaded potato skins came after wings were long finished.  They forgot my son's hot dog order too.  Things have really changed.  Seems like they just took over this restaurant.
I came here for an early dinner by myself monday on a work trip.  I always find it telling when the hostess won't seat you at a table despite the place being empty.  I was fine sitting in the bar area but had to ask for a menu etc.  The service wasn't great and the food was average.  They do have really good complimentary bread that you have to request as it's never offered.  The Mac n cheese is a delicious side and the sirloin was pretty average.  The menu looks like there is a decent happy hour with some salivating apps listed at $9 vs the regular prices of 15-20.  I also thought it was strange that the waitress asked for my name and id, not the room number that I wanted to charge the meal to.  I felt uncomfortable with the service and hence 2 stars- 1 for service, 3.5 for food, and pretty average on overall feel and atmosphere for a nice steakhouse on the strip.  I'd recommended going elsewhere.
Location, location, location. This bar has location and then some. Dreadful beer selection and passable food but the crowds keep on coming for the convenience, especially during the winter when you have direct Path access and/or easy access to Union.When suggested by a work group I drag my feet there and plead for another option. If the ugly cow giveth loads of cash why pretty it up.
Oh, Calgary Transit. Where do I begin? I guess I'll start with the LRT, as it is my main mode of transportation to and from work every day from 7am - 8am & 4:30pm - 5pm (and these days 6pm!).Summers: Besides being overly crowded during rush hour, the summers are usually ok. Oh, well except when the heat is blaring and I have to move my legs from the vents so they don't get burnt. Ouch! Winters: x2 on the overly crowded during rush hour. Firstly, who designed the train stations? No heat? No major enclosures (Shawnessy, 39th Ave and every single new downtown platform that was just built within the last year specifically)? What were you guys thinking? It looks pretty?! Second, BUR, you must've used all the heat up during the summer because now my mornings are met with extremely cold train rides to work! I'm even bundled up for the weather, but no heat can be felt coming from the heaters now! Next up: Bus Routes. Oh, # 15. I mostly take you when the weather is not it's best. You're never on time, you never stay a few minutes to wait for me to run to your doors.  The worst part about you is getting to the train station in the evenings and having to wait 40 minutes for you to show up. I see about 3 of every other bus that comes to the station. My question is, if it costs more to run a full sized bus, and you're never full, and you only come every 30 minutes (or more??) maybe, just a thought, you should get two #15 shuttle buses that come every 15 minutes? A girl can dream. Bus passes are going up! $90 dollars at the beginning of January 2011. Your services are getting worse, and I'm paying more?! Does.Not.Compute.
Wish you could give ZERO stars. Ordered online for delivery. Over an hour later with still no food I called. The guy said they tried calling me three times to say something was wrong with my card but no one had called me! Total lie. The online order went through and there's nothing wrong with card!Ok. Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things.
Terrible car service! They will leave you! I spoke to the driver and told him I'll be out in 5 mins. 5mins later he's gone! Smh! Almost missed my flight! The guy on the phone referred me to a better cab service tho. Only reason why I gave 2 stars!
Went to Embury back in June and was severely let down.  I sincerely appreciate the owners/managers creating this place. This is exactly what Pittsburgh needs, world-class cocktails made by people who are passionate about it. The fact is probably the majority of bars around here still feature egregious, free-pouring, 1980's-style junk (think cloying sweet-and-sour mix with an unmeasured slosh of bottom-shelf "bourbon" for a whiskey sour). So I'm thrilled that Embury exists and obviously has the talent and vision to produce great stuff. Unfortunately on our visit the service was simply appalling.  I definitely don't mind waiting for a drink, good drinks take time and that's no problem.  Where I have a problem is when one of the bartenders is flirting out in the hallway with a girl, and the other is nowhere to be seen.  Now, as much as "self-service cocktail lounge" appeals to me for many reasons, I don't think that's what they were going for. A final nitpick: I actually thought the atmosphere had a lot going for it but please get rid of the corporate office-style glass door.  I don't think 1920's speakeasies featured fully transparent doors to let the US Marshals take a free peek inside at the prohibition-be-damned party.
On my last 2 visits for dimsum the food has been a bit disappointing, especially the siu mai (pork dumpling). Service was not great either.
Ugh the snow is ruining my social lifeWOW... Pittsburgh has sooo many mini bridges...((Smithfield Street Bridge)))-Total length 1,184 feet-10 minutes to walk across the bridge - a few more minutes longer if you stop to admire the Views....
This is a white person's Indian restaurant. It caters to King and Front street crowds. The prices are decent ($12 or so for the buffet) and the food isn't offensive, but its not the remarkable experience you expect when going to an Indian restaurant. The flavors are subdued, the spiciness is at best a  suggestion not a feature, and overall the food is just...there. you eat it, you see full, and you go back to work. If you're expecting Indian food like you're used to in Little India you will be disappointed. If you're going with a bunch of work friends to ear together and need something inoffensive and not very threatening, go here.
I was pretty excited to try The Crepe's gluten free option but when the waitress told me the batter was buckwheat I decided against it. Buckwheat ins't what I would be using to make a crepe. If they try Gluten free Bisquick or use cup 4 cup maybe I'll return. Luckily for me the farmers market was going on so I was able to get a fresh smoothie from one of the vendors.  My mom and sister however tried two of the breakfast crepes. They took a little while to come out and both left saying their crepes were.... "interesting" and dont think they will be returning anytime soon. My Mom had the FRANCE - ham, eggs, farm cheese, scallions, chopped parsley, tomatoes topped with béchamel sauce. Her crepe was swimming in the bechamel which had no taste at all. My Sister on the other hand had the CANADA - Canadian bacon, egg, potato hush and maple syrup topped with toasted oats crunch. Her's was swimming in maple syrup.I really hope this place makes it but based on what I saw on Saturday, It doesn't look to promising.
Fries get soggy very fast and is not pleasant to eat after a while. It's not crispy like other fries I've had. Cook was very accommodating. I got the philly steak pouting but with all the extra toppings on the side. Wanted to see if it would be less soggy but that didn't help. Poutines are ok it if I'm going to spend that much on a poutine I'd rather get it at an actual restaurant.
Way too bland.  For an airport it might be a good place but if it wasn't for the captive audience this place is pretty weak.  Expensive, probably because of the location but it's just not that good. The regular Chelsea's kitchen is fine but the airport just seems to be phoning it in.  By not being a fast food chain it stands out, but I don't think anyone would come to the airport just to have lunch here.
Just like everything else, prices go up, quality goes down.  This place is definately not the Matta's I grew up with.
Service is ridiculous, the ladies behind the counter were rude and seemed annoyed to have to perform their duties. My friend asked for the green salad without dressing, the employee grabbed the oiled lettuce. My friend says again that she's like the non-oily salad. The woman acted offended and put out. Then I stood and watched her dump part of the food that my friend didn't want back into the buffet style bar, huffing and puffing with anger. My friend asks for cucumbers on her salad, the lady ignores her and slides the plate to the next employee, then my friend again says to her she's like cucumbers. I thought the employee was going to flip out. She threw some cucumbers on top of her salad.The food was overly salted in my opinion, nothing special at all. Wouldn't return.
The beds are hard as a rock and the del Mar deli is ridiculous. Come on. 15 dollars for chicken strips fries and a drinks and the employees can't smile at one guest and have a good night....dont ask for ranch the give a bad attitude oh and the manager Javier can give a rats ass you yoh complain. "Oh we are busy." You have 4 people in line seriously you are busy??? It take 2 seconds instead of saying here you go how about thank you have a good night with a smile. Is it that hard....really smile....these people are beating their hard earned money the least you can do is smile and say have a good night. Mediocre food high prices with bad attitudes......
I dont know how this place stayed open. The last thing I ordered was horrible it was something simple that I figured couldn't be messed up: Chicken Fried Rice... the chicken was dark and hard, the taste was horrible. I tried the place again hoping for a better visit... not impressed.
Been here 6 times, but am not a stranger to the area since I live in it. The place is nice, prices expensive for what you get, and service is poor. 4 of the 6 times I received the wrong order, takes forever to get service at the bar, and tons of staff just standing around while you wait.Want a better experience and better happy hour, head over to Saddle  Ranch at Westgate... way cheaper and A+ service.
Nanny connections was recommended to me by several friends and co-workers and, at first, things seemed to go well.  While the service is pricey, I appreciate the idea that candidates would be pre-screened, working legally, and had completed background checks.  Initially, Tiffanie sent us several good candidates but it wasn't clear how much "pre-screening" they really had outside of filling out Nanny Connection's online application.   However, after contacting our candidates references, we went ahead and hired what seemed like the perfect candidate.  Nanny Connections drew up the initial offer contact and coordinated the offer.  The contract was quite basic and did not include a clause about giving notice before quitting. It also didn't mention the need to be a U.S. Citizen or have a legal work permit.  We found out that both of those things mattered when our new Nanny quit via email in the middle of the night and gave us no notice.  Nanny Connections did offer some "back-up" Nanny help but the candidates they sent had varying levels of experience with infants.  The service was also suppose to help us find a new Nanny since the first quit w/in 90 days.  While Tiffanie did send a few more candidates and helped us find a new Nanny, I found her to be much less responsive the second time around -after I'd already paid the full fee.  In sum, this service did help us find a Nanny but I'm overall quite disappointed in the service and the overall experience.
Panchero's is a low quality version of Chipotle, but with similar prices. The burritos are also smaller than Chipotle's. The employees are friendly, but I don't like their food. The meat is often overcooked, the rice is mushy, the beans are dry. The guacamole is bland and not worth the extra cost. The queso is slimy and generic. Overall, there is nothing worthwhile about the food. The only time I eat it is when it is getting late and I need to grab something quick, because there is a Panchero's right near my house and they are open until 11pm. It is only ever a choice I make out of convenience.
This place is your run of the mill older / outskirt large casino. Comparable to a Coast casino or something like that if you are picking up what I'm throwing down.It's great for a cheap game of craps and a way to spend some time with old folks. After my experience I'm not sure if I'd throw anymore money at the food here, but at least they've got a theater to burn some time at too.
Great buffet, but super tight slot machines. Spent $800. On slot machines in less than an hour. I wouldn't mind loosing this money but I wasn't expecting this amount to last less than an hour.
The brisket was just okay. It was very greasy, the bottom of my to go box was full of oil. I got the southwestern corn(veggie of the day) there was nothing southwestern about it at all. The mac and cheese was okay, nothing to sing about. Don't get me wrong it wasn't horrible, just not a place I would frequent.
I had a great experience the first time I came here. They helped me choose the right printer and helped me get everything I needed for it. Staff was very friendly!So I decided to come back today to pick up some supplies for my office and was treated really bad. An employee asked me if I needed help and I said yes, but as soon as he saw my service dog, he blurted out that he couldn't help me because of the dog. He didn't even point me in the right direction or get someone else to help me. I almost left right then, but I really needed these supplies and they were about to close, so I got my stuff and left. It's pretty messed up that I couldn't get help because I have a service dog. She's trained and was right next to me the entire time I was in the store. I'm definitely not coming back.
My brother wanted to try a new fish and chips place so while passing we decided to go in. The lady behind the counter and the cook were both really nice and friensly. But while it's named after its fish and chips, there is way more Chinese food on the menu than anything which was a bit of a red flag for me. We ordered 2 Halibut and chips and an order of BBQ wings. The wings were pretty good, crispy and aaucy but not oily. The fish on the other hand tasted frozen and was really oily, while the fries were okay. I don't think I'll be back but the service was great.
Nothing to wait on line for. Was a more expensive version of In and Out and the fries were not as good. The burger was tasty, but chicken was so-so. Liked the fact we could have a beer and Sonoma Coutrer. If this was the only game in town that's one thing, but Old Town Scottsdale has so many options. Just a few doors down  the Z burger @ Z Tejas would be my burger choice @ the mall.
I went to Olive Garden for the first time in a long time. I was very disappointed that they didn't remind me of the advertised special they have going on - a two for one entree special.  Conveniently they "forget" to mention that when you are preparing to order. Very disingenuous of them. Almost like a bait and switch scam.
I'm a cattle rancher from Nebraska, and these folks do NOT know steak! Overpriced for small servings of beef that is definitely not grading Prime!
This was our second try. The first resulted in a token gift card to inspire us to return and try again. The service was excellent this time. Despite her broken foot our waitress returned several times before and during our meal to check on us.  The refried beans are great. The pork torta was delicious though cool compared to everything else on the plate. Sweetpotato stuffed pepper is a great idea but the sauces on top were a distraction from the yummy potato-pepper combo. The open faced tamale was bland and a waste of calories. My mom ordered teh enchalada plate. She expected the same dish she ordered a few months ago- a nice cheesy plate of enchaladas with red sauce. She instead recieved a little skillet with a layer of green sauce on the bottom, 3 cheese enchaladas ontop of that, then a bit more cheese melted on top. so much of the corn tortillas were dry. My daughter ordered a cheese crisp of the kid menu. I thougth it was delicious but she did not care for the addition of mexican cheese to the traditional cojack. The cucumber margarita was excellent again. That may be what brings us back for a third try. I recommend if you go here to ask specifically about anything on the menu that is not clarified. the menu is unclear and sometimes misleading in it's description of certain dishes. And try the cucumber margarita. It's delicious.
I don't know who is running this place but this is the slowest chipotle I've ever been to and today is the third time I've come and they don't have food prepared. I wanted steak and they were out. The last time, they were out of fajita veggies and the time before that they were out of rice. What gives? I love chipotle so two stars but this location leaves much to be desired.
Using a Groupon as an excuse to cheat on my go-to spa, I thought it would be a opportunity to try a new spa out since it is so close to my home.The spa was clean, the services were mediocre, they spend most of your time there trying to sell you products, but it is the staff's attitude really put me off. The receptionist was rude and condescending when I called to confirm the time for my appointment, which quickly gave me a bad impression.Moreover, when I decided to pay with cash as I was leaving, he told me he had no change, slapped the inadequate change on the counter and turned away, assuming that the rest could be treated as tip and that the conversation/transaction was over. I thought coupons were a marketing tool a business would use to attract new customers, and grow your clientele, but if you are going to treat your customers badly just because they are using a coupon, they will not return, and tell all their friends never to go there.
I Had been at Bouchon a few Times But last one (May 17) Made me think that this place does not worth it the prices for brunch are Ridiculous, 2 eggs benedict $27 I didnt like the experience because there are a lot fabulous places in Vegas that Bouchon for me Bouchon is famous but not Amazing anymore
Look, it's Mastro's, we all know that it's expensive going in but when you want good oysters you don't want to skimp.We ordered a dozen assorted that were on special.  4 kumamotos, 4 fanny bay and 4 blue points.Of the 6 oysters I ate, only 1 was good.  The others were fishy and mealy.  Just not fresh.  Very disappointing for the price.2 stars for the very nice and accommodating bar tender.
Food is subpar. Service is good. Ambiance and decor is nice. Unfortunately when I go out to eat I can care less in regards to how much was spent making the place look cool, I'm more concerned on how mind blowing their food is. I ordered the diablo shrimp tacos and they were just ok. I've had better. Nothing to make me want to come back.
I've been to Nails with Love once before and it was a good pedicure. I've read such good reviews especially about Anthony and Jenny and even had a friend who's had a pedicure by Anthony tell me to request him. I'm currently 9 months pregnant. Due in about 3 weeks. I have an 18 month old at home too so I was really looking forward to a really good pedicure and just to relax for an hour! I scheduled my appointment for 4:15 specifically with Anthony. When I get there Anthony is sitting in the waiting section chairs and a nice girl checked me in. She asked me 2-3 times if I specifically wanted Anthony. I said yes. Then Anthony gets up and asked me a couple times himself if I specifically wanted him. Again I said I was referred by someone and preferred him. At this point I'm uncomfortable. He then asks AGAIN if I would mind getting the pedicure by someone else. At that point I don't care anymore. I felt very uncomfortable that he didn't want to give me the pedicure. I said that's fine and was given the first nice little girl that greeted me. She must be new or something and probably didn't have many services for the day and maybe that's why they wanted her to do the pedicure. That's fine but when I'm asked repeatedly 5 times and all times I said I preferred Anthony, they still made me uncomfortable. And then Anthony just sat in the front waiting section on his phone the whole time! But The girl did an ok job. Never buffed my nails or anything after filing them and then when she was about to paint them noticed I still had old polish on my toe and had to go back and take it off.. Which should have been done in the beginning or when she buffed my nails? And then she dinged my big toe putting on my sandals and tried fixing it and it's still Jacked but I don't think I'm comfortable enough to go back in there and tell them.  Not sure I'll be back. I have lots of people I've sent here from 2 mommy Facebook pages I'm on and after this I probably won't refer anyone else. Very unprofessional in my opinion.
Been here a few times and as much as I like the ice cream, they rip you off. The past three times I went there, they barely fill my cup with ice cream... if I'm paying $8 for a small ice cream, I'd hope the cup was a real scoop.. really frustrating.
My wife enjoyed her meal, but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before, YC's in particular. After being seated, we grabbed our bowls and headed towards the food line. There were three rows of food and condiments. The third row was a little difficult to get to. None of the employees were paying attention to the food. You could see where people had gotten something and it spilled onto the edge of another container of food. The setup was totally inefficient. The selections were so-so. I was surprised that we could only order our noodles or rice at the end. For noodles, they used soba noodles which are a lot thicker than YC's and THEY control the portion. WHERE's THE NOODLES!! And that is one reason out of several, why I won't be back.
I've been going there a while now with no issues, great food and service until yesterday-I ordered $55 worth of food, General Tso chicken, orange chicken, shrimp egg foo young, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls etc..I got there early, a few minutes before they opened and they were kind enough to let me in to order for a Playoff party however, the chicken both Tso & Orange tasted old, recooked, dried out and the worse thing is many of us ended up with very bad diarrhea.I'm so disappointed because every time I go there I always spend $40 and up and to have people getting sick (including me) was so embarrassing and to waste my money by having to throw food out was hard because all my pennies count. Whoever cooked yesterday 16 January 2016 at noon should be ashamed for serving tainted food.You have let a good paying/tipping customer down on what should have been a great NFL Playoff party. :(
Well i appreciate that the atomsphere was lovely and the waitress was nice.The prices were a little high for the quality of  the food.Seems to be like a cool place but i didnt like the sushi.I ordered the bagel,and usually it has cream cheese? Theirs did not,and it was mainly fried rice and no salmon,just wasnt made that good,the california roll tasted old,real dry and not too good.Seemed to me as if a bunch of amateurs were rolling the sushi/running this spot. The waitress wasnt too helpful,she had informed me on my saki sampler on each taste of each one & she was completely wrong! None of them tasted the way she explained.Behind the bar was a worker that was on the telephone placing orders for more alcohol,i was sitting right beside the bar and over hear her ENTIRE convo,it was extremely rude..make a list and take that into the office please. I believe that they could use a little help over all,and to me it doesnt seem like it could last long in this location.Would go here to grab drinks only maybe,or i may never go back.
Had the sugar skull drink with a pineapple and rum drink. Too strong! Nonetheless I drank it after adding more pineapple in it. My daughter had the French toast. It was delicious with French baguettes and caramelized bananas and yummy cinnamon syrup sauce. I ordered the Steak Tomahawk platter with grilled veggies and guacamole. We were very excited but it was too rare and half the steak was pure fat and gristle. NOT HAPPY. We were too starved to send it back to cook a bit  more. Not worth the $80.00. The service was very slow. We loved the restaurant itself. It's beautiful and very artistic with the beautiful Mexican inspired murals. My daughter and I really enjoyed it.
They burned my quesdaillas, which I wasn't mad about. I waited 20 minutes for them to remake it and when I checked on it they told me they haven't remade it yet. Never again.
Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'y retourne encore autre que pour leur brownie au caramel salé qui pourtant, n'était pas aussi bon qu'à l'habitude la dernière fois. Chaque fois que j'y vais, le service est plus que lent et il arrive toujours des choses désagréables desquelles je ris, mais tout de même! Des exemples? Une fois, j'ai reçu mon verre de lait (commandé 45 minutes plus tôt) une fois ma facture payée (sur laquelle j'avais, bien sûr, fait retirer le verre de lait en question). Ce qui s'est passé à ma dernière visite (lundi dernier)? 2 des personnes avec qui j'étais ont dû se lever pour laisser passer deux des employés qui sortaient de gros sacs de poubelles en accrochant tout sur leur passage 3 heures avant la fermeture du restaurant... Plutôt déplaisant.Bref, on y va quand on a nulle part où aller, mais la qualité des produits est inégale et le service est terrible.
This was my first time visiting this salon and my experience was great!! Mr. Martin was amazing! I sat down in the chair in less than 15 mins and i did not even have to tell him how to shape my nails. The service I received was SNS on my natural nails. I will definitely be going back to visit this Updating my review as of 1/21/18I visited this salon today around 11:40a before they opened at 12pm, when i walked in i was the first client (so I thought) after a lady who was getting a pedicure and a manicure by two nail techs. I signed in and requested Martin who had done my nails before. Around 12pm when the salon officially opened for business other women started to come in and sign in. No other workers were there to service us even after the salon opened. At 12:15p, in walks another nail tech who sits by the check-in counter; she ask who is next and it was me however because I requested someone I allowed another lady to go in front of me. After still waiting on the person I requested to finish up, i am told at 12:30 that he has an appointment at 12:30 so I will have to wait longer. There are still only 3 nail techs to 5 women in the salon waiting to be serviced. Another nail tech walks in and takes me, because I am getting SNS i have to take off the precious color so they begin wrapping my nails. After he wraps my nails, he is told to start a pedicure on someone who came in way after me. Now i have been in the salon a hour and have YET to be serviced. I waited a hour and 15 mins to only leave with not getting serviced. The lady at the check-in counter was very rude and did not once apologize for how long I had to wait and did not even try to accommodate me. For this, I am updating my review and giving them 2 stars for the service I received today.
Waiter: Can I get you something to drink?Me: Yes, I would like a Modelo Especial with a lime. Waiter: I'm sorry but I think we are out of limes.Me: Out of limes? I thought this was a Mexican Restaurant?Waiter: Limes coming up from Mexico are very expensive right now. Me: I could run across the street and pick a few limes off my neighbor's lime tree.Waiter: (Unimpressed)Me: (Unimpressed)
The last time I was at hot rocks, I had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  If i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  Oddly, I hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   This time I ordered the Macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  The salad was unique... but not good at all. It was waaayyy  overdressed. It tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. I couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before I gave up. The pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. There was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. The dish was swimming in oil. I'm not kidding. It was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  I'm was supremely disappointed.  But I will say the service was excellent. The server did come by and asked how everything was but I didn't have the courage to send my food back... Not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe I came on a bad night..  but I would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad.
There is no way this is a 5 or 4 stars place. I order a sausage and egg breakfast. The potatoes were soggy and the sausage was not well done. The waitress act friendly but I can tell she is just trying to be. I work with people everyday so I can tell who is sincere or not. The cook was actually friendly then her. I don't think I would come again.
Walked in to great looking pastries and small menu. Decided what we wanted only problem was there was no one to take order. One staff member seemed to be running the whole show ( I think her name was Stacy give her a raise). Poor girl was doing dining room, drive trough, cash, while another competent cashier was assembling baskets and management no where to be seen. She finally Managed to catch her breath long enough to take our order, walked out, coffee empty as well as half and half, pet peeves to have to ask someone to fill them they should be full! Food decent, nothing special, longer I sat there chatting with my breakfast company the more I could see other customers getting irritated that there was no one to take orders when they came in, one guy even yelled to someone who appeared to be a baker, "hey is there anyone who can take my order!?" Management get a clue, come support your staff!
I used to love their food. Until one time I got a bee in my salad. Granted, I understand that fresh produce has the potential to be exposed to such things, but when I called and talked to the manager- she could have cared less. She said she could have them remake my salad - which would be nice if I had dined in or lived close. I live 20 mins away and myself and 2 other people couldn't stomach to try to eat our takeout meals. So $35+ meal down the drain. And no compensation. We refuse to go back.
If you are sharing a suite where one of your friends must sleep on the pull-out sofabed, you won't be friends for long.  They will only be able to sleep with massive springs jamming into their soft tissue if they are passed out from drink.  Non-smoking room reeked of smoke, with maid service having to come spray twice daily.  Great kitchenette, too bad there isn't a place to buy groceries nearby.  Off the strip, not far, but makes for a creepy walk back in the dark.
I have been twice and was not impressed with the food, but its 24 hours so its a plys when you want some  random food.
Overall, the food was okay, but definitely not value for money. Two stars is officially described as "Meh" by Yelp, and that sums up our experience perfectly...Run of the mill fine cuisine dishes, served with sweet glazed sauces straight from a stuffy 1980's restaurant. They're focusing like so many places these days on local ingredients, but at the expense of originality. There was nothing here that we couldn't make at home. The drink menu reads: beer, wine, "highballs".  - No mixologist here...There are better spots in town to drop a lot of coin...on the plus side, there's tons of parking in a reserved lot on 15th avenue.
This was too bad, it looked nice and the food looked good.  Other than continually being referred to as "Boss" by the server, he got my very simple order wrong several times.  The cook came from the kitchen and asked "What's wrong?"  When there was really nothing wrong.  Nobody had even complained.  They took part of the meal off--which was cool.  It just could have been a better experience overall for the price paid.
Bleh.Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive.I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time.
Poutine had a sweet and very processed taste to it. Definitely not fresh cut fries. The amount of cheese was generous though. I didn't try the burgers so I can't review them.
If you love PF changs, or Americanized chinese food then this is the place for you. Flavors were okay nothing amazing. Not sure how we ended up here but left this place still asking for more. Food was mediocre, not for me though Im asian, I should've known better :P
I went out to Matadors with my friend Sara on a Sunday night. Walking into Matadors is like walking into a super Wal-Mart at 2am; empty, Large and impressive. There was more staff standing around than patrons. We sat at the bar and I whipped my computer out to start my meeting and ordered an ala Carte seafood burrito and a bottle of beer. Sara's attempt to sober up with water is acknowledged and ridiculed for a few seconds I get into my meeting and the food comes. The seafood inside of the burrito was not really seafood at all. Sara describes the mash inside the wrapped tortilla as consuming half cooked sea monkeys. The only saving grace on this boring tasteless plate was the refried beans. Soft and cheesy, the beans saved the day. I order another dos equis lager and put my attention back to my online meeting. From the corner of my ear I hear the twinkling keys of the old time piano in the corner. I look up to see Sara stroking the ivories in the dark corner of the bar. She is on the phone with her mother excited she can remember a tune played when she was a child. We leave Matadors with... "Let's blow this taco stand"... The bill was less than $30 bucks.
Very unimpressed. The eel and tuna were very fishy tasting. They even forgot the sauce for one of the rolls. The hot mess roll was meh. Not worth the price and the quality is sub par. Fake crab on a $21 roll. Really?  Shishito peppers were delicious. Skip this place. There are far better places to eat at Mandalay Bay and far better sushi in Vegas.
Nearly every delivery time is not met.  Drivers come an hour or so late.  Some call, some don't call to let one know they are not going to deliver the groceries.  Nearly every order has 10 percent of the times not delivered, but those items are in the store when one goes there to pickup items not delivered because you need them for the recipe.  I would drop this internet grocery delivery service in a heart beat if there were some competition.
Folks. Just an edible bagel with an inner sweetness. Price is good, but the taste, puffiness or chewiness isn't there. It cannot even compare to a New York or any Jewish bagels. Really disappointed by the hype. I thought it should at least taste fresh and moist?  Both lacking.
While looking for a new barber in my neighborhood (usually I drive to Scottsdale and it's worth it but ran out of time today) and I stumbled into this place. I meant to go the place near it, but thought since I was here I'd stay. Talk about slow service. Got in a little before six, and didn't leave until 8pm... My haircut was very generic and wasn't what I asked for. Not bad, but  not good. Won't be going back there again, but not too upset or anything because it'll grow back. Seemed kinda amateur skill in the shop compared to places like the Local Barber on 7th and far from par when comparing to the Dapper Devil in Scottsdale
The employees here are super nice, friendly and helpful. However, the vendors are basically storing there stuff there for you to look at. Things are way too overpriced. You can't throw a postcard in a cheap walmart frame and ask $9 for it. Its a great store to see history, things that are no longer in use, but if the vendors are truly wanting people to leave with items and spread the beauty of antiques they need to lower the prices and make things a little more affordable.
Wouldn't go back do to a lack of service and blandness of food. Teenage waiter lacked hustle and basic costumer service skills. Didn't even offer or bring any bread or parmesano for the meals. Thankfully I wasn't paying the bill because he wouldn't have gotten a cent for his lazy, unorganized, and unapologetic performance. Not one person in our four person party was wowed by their meal. We asked for a manager at one point and he /she never showed. At $18 a meal and so many good reviews I expected much more.
Bartender was ill-informed. A friend asked about a hoppy IPA. He had little knowledge because he didn't like IPAS. Failed to even identify the only double IPA on tap. Personal preference is not bartending. He was playing games on his phone instead of taking care of our checks. Not friendly or even conversational. No"How are you" or "welcome." The bar was empty - may my friends and I feel good. I walked into the women's restroom- and was greeted by a MAN and two women who were "talking." They should have been thrown out. I shouldn't have to ask a man to leave to I may use the women's restroom. On a plus, he did card us and he did wipe down bottles and the bar. But!! Left the bucket sanitizer under the taps where it easily could have been mixed into my beer.
I had high hopes for this place but it looks like I expected too much. I went for the teppanyaki dinner menu and it was an okay experience. The chef was entertaining and cooked the food well but service for other food was slow. Slow and wrong.... I also got a seat under the vent which was freezing so I couldn't enjoy the experience at all. I just wanted to eat and leave but there were constantly no servers around. We totally got skipped during the second teppanyaki orders too. Food was nothing special in my opinion. Typical ayce sushi items. Waited 20 mins without food for the cheque and it never came. I had to put on my jacket and go to the front to pay. I will never come back here.
Worst Victoria Secret I've ever been to. I say that having visited several since in this county and others in different cities and states. Selection is limited which is expected given the location so doesn't bother me. It's the customer service that's abysmal.  I'm am avid VS shopper or was...and have vsisited this location several times. Now the service here has never been great with maybe 1 or 2 staff who knew what good customer service was. They appear to have hired new staff however who are clueless about their sales and promotions, terrified about theft so are pretty offensive in their practices. One in particular requires me to practice quite a bit of restraint. I would highly recommend you not come here.
I wanted to like this place, but it has a LONG way to go to live up to it's potential.  Location: The location is awesome, if you sit outside on the deck overlooking the strip.  Unfortunately, that is about all it has going for it right now.  Food:  The chips and salsa were mediocre, at best.  My buddy and I both had fish tacos that were just so-so.  Drinks:  The margaritas were ok but too sugary.  Staff:  The staff seemed to consist primarily of bored and indifferent teenagers.Prices:  I expect to pay a bit of a premium when eating in a resort area, but the prices here seemed out of line.Come to think of it, Sammy's place at the Kaanapali airport sucks, too.  Overpriced and lousy service.  Coinkidink?  You be the judge.  "Is this what you wanted, Sammy Hagar?Sammy Hagar, is this what you wanted, man?Dave lost his hairline but you lost your cool buddyCan't drive 55I'll never buy your lousy records againAgain, again, again, never again"  -- Nerf Herder.
Their food is ok, but I'm used to having more authentic Vietnamese food coming from San Diego. The reason for such a low score is their service. Our waitress actually stopped mid service and went outside to talk on the phone and have a cigarette. No one picked up her tables and no one helped at all. Unfortunately we've been twice and it wasn't any better the second time. I did wait to see if perhaps it was only one instance, but they just aren't interested in good service I guess. My daughter liked their boba however, so not all was lost.
Tried the Hero Burger and their Signature Burger it was just okay. You will be paying about 8-9 bucks for a combo. i would rather go elsewhere for my burger and fries like McDonalds or Wendys
The security and ticket lady were Uppity ASSHOLES. All three (three? Is that necessary? It wasnt a fokkin Slayer show goin on in there it was some local bands at a bar in the corner of an unnamed shopping center) were unnecessarily rude. I just moved here and stopped by, seeing there was a line. (I was out for my husbands bday lookin for something to do) Curious, went to check it out.  Oh sweet is there somethin goin on tonight? I asked one of the dudes out front. "Uhhh-yeah" he responded and looked at me like I was an idiot. "A show" and he looked to his coworkers so they could join in the pretentious face-making. Sorry 3ft tall 40-something bald guy. Didnt know how prolific and awesome this bar was in all its majesty. Im new here. I ended up saying fuck it and going home since  i wanted to drink (imagine that, at a bar?) my ID is the wrong shape and apparently theres a new law in az (i just moved here from SD) protecting bouncers who can't read dates. Im 23. A vertical state ID will not change that.
Terrible, flavorless hamburgers on stale buns with mediocre fries.  Save your money.  Salads are premade & refrigerated.
The service is nice and the outdoor seating is comfortable with overhead heating during the winter. (The outdoor seating is much better than the indoor seating.) They have a kid's menu that comes with temporary tattoos.The food is bland and underwhelming.  I've been invited to family dinner here several times. I don't know what the point is of paying $20-$30 for premium fish/seafood that just comes out tasting like "eh." The food is really underwhelming.This restaurant is ideal if you plan on inviting guests who are greatly impressed by the sight of an expensive and varied seafood menu but don't necessarily care about the taste of the food they're eating. Because while the food is totally edible/passable, it's just not particularly delicious or even memorable. At all.The only thing I would consider recommending is the oysters.
If you're looking for CHEAP, I guess this is the place.  They serve all of the pizza and salad you can eat for $5.49 (soft drinks are $1.79, or free for seniors).  There's a temporary lunch special for $4.99 including drink.The two types of salads were fresh tasting and good.  They had a variety of pizza to choose from.  While the pizza LOOKED really good, the taste didn't match the appearance.  It really tasted like inexpensive frozen pizza that you'd get from a grocery store (I didn't see them making it, but I wouldn't doubt that it was made in a factory somewhere and shipped frozen) and the crust tasted like cardboard.The place really isn't meant for "Pizza Snobs" to enjoy a quality pie.  It's meant to be a cheap alternative to McDonalds, and it seems as though it's marketed that way (photos of kids and teens eating pizza hanging all over the walls, arcade in the back, "Macaroni and Cheese Pizza" as one of the types).There were teens and families with small children everywhere.  I was the only person not there with someone under 18.
Decided to give this place a second try after really poor service the first time.  Service was greatly improved this time, server was very friendly and attentive.  Decor was lacking, the place needs a redecorate.  Food was really good but I found hair in all the four dishes we ordered.  Figured the first one was mine as it was the same colour (I'm blonde) but then kept finding them, it was gross and I've never had that experience before.  I probably won't go back as now I'll always think of it as that "hair" place
I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and, even though it's not the closest, I thought I would give it a try. It's probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses I've been in. And for the first several visits, I didn't have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, I've heard that happens a lot, if they've ever worked.This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old person's eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showing's credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, would've been welcome, if just for some light. Well, that's why God made cell phones.Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up should've been quick so you can continue your discussion about who's ID you'd use to go out that night.But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the world's slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, it's understandable as no one could see anything.Question, and I've always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know they're not - I'm a former AMC employee and I wasn't. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, it's already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know that's how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. "Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!" Heaven.Really, movies are still relevant, even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. I'm sure the one guy at the box office would've appreciated that.
My boyfriend and I are locals and made plans last minute to do a staycation for the weekend. We called the Wynn and was told that Jardin was the place that could accommodate our reservation time. The waiter was polite and efficient. Everything we ordered came out fast (almost too fast). The food was average at best. I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend
First time trying this place. Service was prompt and fast but food was below average. The grill salmon was too dry and the steak was not that appealing either. Sushi was only ok, not amazing but not so bad that you'll get sick from it. Most dishes I ordered from the kitchen were a bit on the bland side; stir fried noodles kind of reminded me of the lacklustre attempt of my university's cafeteria. Maybe I caught them on an off day, and it seems like this is a new location so perhaps they are still working out the kinks, but reality is, I most likely won't go back again.
The Service i will not say rude but is so pushy.  i only come back here when I am really craving Korean BBQ but I don't have choice to go anywhere else for those places have to wait in the line for table. But here you got to seat right away so that's why I gave 2 stars. Food not bad but they allowed you order only 3items per 1time. Inside it looks clean and the rest of it just OK for my experiences.
This is price to value type of thing - it cost a lot but in return you receive salty food, ok service, and underwhelming deserts. Overpriced coffee shop. Oyster selection was good though.
Terrible terrible food. I mean, how can you possibly screw up nachos and cheese??? Even in trying to give Red Room credit for what it tries to be, (the hip, easy Spadina joint) I am clearly reminded of numerous better choices nearby.No it is not reminiscent of Green Room and there should definitely be a health inspection in the near future.
First, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. Then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) Our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. We waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. Our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. Overall not a good experience. Go to a different grimaldi's
I always use brake master for their clean and efficient service. I have always gone to the Scottsdale and Shea location but decided to stop by this location as I was going to be in this part of town for a couple hours. Got my oil changed and a permanent black stain on my passenger seat. I had just washed my truck the day prior and am very meticulous about cleaning my truck multiple times a week. I have tried wiping and shampooing my seats to no success. Good service but now I have this ugly stain to look at every day.
I went to this place expecting it to be amazing since it was top rated in vegas but when my fiance and i went there on our recent vaction it soo was not what we expected the waiter didnt tell us any of the specials they had he gave us horrible food suggestions! for a place so "upscale" you would the food would be out of this world im very disappointed i went there the night before i went to CUT inside the PALAZZO/VENETIAN and that was the BEST place ever! it was also top rated in vegas.
We were planning on going to Southside Pittsburgh today, so being the good organizer that I am, I  decided to research restaurants in the area.  I pinpointed a few great places to eat through Yelp.  Then my wife  decided to ask a merchant in the area good places to eat nearby.  That's when  everything went awry.Marios is a mediocre bar at best.  It is not very appealing as bars go.  It looks like it has been around forever and has never been updated.  They had good prices on beer, and meal prices were good.  The food was good but certainly not great.  Our waitress was pleasant and probably saved me from going over the edge.Although it was the the worse place I have eaten, I won't be returning...even if my wife insists.
Tried it the first time looking for a quick lunch after class! There were no prices so I ordered a chicken sandwich with Brie with a bottle of water. The sandwich was average and the overall price was 18$ which is a little excessive and overrated for a simple sandwich and a water. Can find better!
Went there yesterday,  for lunch, I should have went too an fast food place instead, would have saved money. They only two things that were good was, the ribs, and the pop. They must have been cutting back on help. They had an pop, coffee, Ice tea machines. You server yourself. For the amount of money you pay, you expect an bigger selection of food. Not here.
I remember when this mall first opened, and there was pretty much nothing inside.I also remember when they were planning to do Splendid China Tower #2, but backed out because nobody comes here.Yesterday was the first time I visited Splendid China Tower in about 5 years. Quite frankly, not a lot has changed. Most of the second floor is still vacant, and the food court has even less choices than when it first opened. However the first floor is now relatively occupied, which is nice to see. There's also a couple of restaurants added, and I have noticed an increase in foot traffic.Aside from events that Chinese radio stations love hosting here due to the abundance of space, there still really isn't anything that attracts me from coming here.
Their lunch special is pretty affordable, yet they are not the best Thai food I have ever had. Not going back to that place ever. I got the BBQ-pork with sticky rice and papaya salad. The sticky rice is so not well cooked and I felt like getting grain. Papaya salad too spicy and doesn't taste too good. ( I requested MILD, and I am a spicy eater)Overall, not very happy.
Fast no wait seating on a Saturday night ...but be prepared to pay for substandard food!
Waited 45 minutes on a Monday night for a table on the patio for 7 people. I can't imagine what the wait is on a weekend night. We were able to get some drinks and sit at the bar while we waited for our table, but it still took foreeeverrrr. The frozen margarita I got was a little too sweet and gave me a headache so I barely drank half of it :( As for food, I got the carne asada tacos which comes with 3 tacos and rice and beans. The carne asada was sooooo salty and the beans were not good. Definitely not worth the ~$15 cost. I would rather have Del Taco!
I came in with high hopes just to find out that this is another oily, junk food that One can make at home. Not sure what the hype was about. All of us didn't like what we ate.
My fiancé and I went to celebrate a promotion in April 2011, so we were excited to try a new restaurant for the occasion. Unfortunately, it was overpriced and mediocre at best. The only dish worth any attention was the "Poppers" which featured raw ahi and hamachi on crispy potato cakes with tobiko. It was delicious, however, did not justify the 22 dollar price tag. I also tried the king salmon, scalloped potatoes and roasted artichoke (who drowns a small dish of chopped up artichoke hearts in overpowering goat cheese, and for 15 dollars?) and mini donuts; all of which only deserve a shrug. The service was substandard; we felt ignored. My fiancé is nowhere near as pretentious and particular as I am, however, he was equally disappointed with our meal and experience. Their filet mignon may have been exceptional, but you need more than just a good steak in a town where there are competing steakhouses within feet of each other.
I'm probably not a fast food kinda person - still I was excited about US Fries.  I love fries! Security question "what is your favorite food" my answer is always french fries.  I suppose I should have asked if the french fries were hand cut fresh on site before going.  Still I'm thinking if your name is US FRIES you should be the master of all things fries. I suspect the fries are made from frozen product bought in bulk. Fresh or frozen the fries are almost tasteless. I went with a friend from Canada who is always asking for brown gravy, she misses the poutine of her youth. I couldn't wait to take her to US Fries. She was over the moon with her meal. This is the first time I've witnessed her eating all of her food.  She really liked it. She also likes Denny's, Golden Corral Buffet and processed cheese food. She loves meat and more meat. I'm a vegetarian who has hosted french fry bars, fresh hand cut potatoes fried to a gold brown with soft creamy centers, so yummy! (Points of reference to gauge how your palate might relate.)Bottom line would I go back? Maybe to accompany a friend, otherwise no way.
Would have been good, but something seemed to be missing............ flavor! Service was quick and the staff was friendly
I really enjoy the taste of matcha. I've been here only a few times and I think it's not as great as other people said.The goods: Really nice matcha taste and the interior is very pleasant with a lot of tea/Japanese decor. The staff is very friendly as well ( :The bads: I wish the flavour of matcha was stronger in the Tsujiri latte. It just tasted like plain milk to me. In addition, I think the portions for the soft-serve is very small for the price. They don't fill the insides of the cup/cone (as in they swirl the soft-serve towards the edges so it looks bigger than it is) and the middle was always empty which was disappointing ) : Maybe it was just the times I went but our soft-serves were never as big as the ones from everyone's pictures.Overall, you should try out this place at least once and enjoy the cosy environment.
I wanted so much to love this place as my new local bar. Beer prices are decent and good tvs and atmosphere. The food is disgusting and so overpriced. Like they're trying to be trendy and hip. And the staff is bad too. Small girl bartender may want to smile once in a while. Its a shame...nice place, close, but trying to be something its not when it would be great if it had good basic food.
I ordered delivery from Hanabi through Yelp; I've never been to the restaurant.Generally, I don't think that sushi lends itself well to grocery stores or delivery. Take out is only minimally better. Sushi is not just about the food, it's about the experience.I also learned to appreciate sushi in Japan, where I lived for 17 years. It follows that I'm unfamiliar with what has become sushi in America. All the different rolls, the decidedly un-sushi flavors, like jalapeño, confuse me! So we only ordered traditional nigiri, no rolls or specialties.That said, one expects a restaurant to do its best to overcome the inherent difficulties in offering sushi for delivery. Presentation is important, maybe not for showy spider rolls, but for traditional sushi. Ours arrived in typical styro boxes, with no garnish or decoration, no eye to arrangement. Our order looked so unappetizing, I was tempted to throw the whole thing away.So, on to the actual product. Sushi is not about fish. Although fish plays an important role, undeniably, there are many varieties of sushi that have no fish at all. Sushi is about the rice. It should be very sticky, slightly sweet, shiny, and just about room temperature; neither too hot nor too cool.The rice that Hanabi served seemed to be nothing more than steamed white rice. It had no cohesion, so the pieces were difficult to pick up. Chopsticks, fork, and bare hands were equally ineffective. And the rice was tasteless.Any "itamae" worth his ginger will tell you that he spent upwards of ten years perfecting his knife skills, and still practices regularly. The slivers of fish we received were poorly cut with ragged edges that made us wonder if the chef's knife maybe needed sharpening. I am by no means a sushi chef, but I could probably have done better with a sharp chef's knife.Finally, the order came out wrong. Sushi I ordered wasn't there, and sushi I didn't order was.For the price, which was not in the realm of "inexpensive," this restaurant disappointed with its delivery. But I must again state that this review is for delivery only, and in-house quality may be vastly different. Based on the other reviews here, I may visit the restaurant, but I won't be ordering delivery from them again.
I haven't been to a lot of robertos. But I can't imagine many being much worseNo soap in bathroom. No lock on stall door. No napkins on tables. No plastic utensils to pick from. No water cups. Clientele  leaves a lot to be desired. Shame cause food was good and taco shells were soft
Lobby and casino look good.  But this hotel is old and in need of much upgrades.  The hallway on my room floor looks/feels like an old parking garage.  The room was big and clean. But the bathroom super small and cramped   Vanity cracked with a terrible paint job.  No fridge/coffee pot. Walls too thin. So much potential here. In need of major renovations. In the end, you get what you pay for.  So treat yourself better.
All the details of our reservation were incorrect. We did the "Pais for Lovers" couples massage. They had the following details wrong.... name, phone number, time of massage, and gender preference.
The wait time is ridiculous! Took forever to be seated, and even longer till we even ordered a drink. The waiter (probably the owner) went to take an order to a table that had arrived 15 minutes after us. This is my first time here and honestly by the time our food arrived I knew this would be my last.
Had dinner here the other evening.  None of our party were impressed.  It wasn't horrible, it was edible for sure, but good?  No.I had the Squid Salad (Yum Pla Muk) and it had a really strange flavour, and the calamari (squid) was very very rubbery.  I also had the Coconut Chicken Soup and it was very watery and a very thin consistency (although the flavour was ok).Really wouldn't go here again - too many other dining options at Yonge & Eg, and if I want Thai, I'd go elsewhere.
I've done business here before with no issues, but I recently had to replace a phone and I also bought a tempered glass screen protector for my new Galaxy S8. Service was good, phone is great, but the screen protector was $50 and fell off after a week. I did some research after the fact and discovered that this screen protector was grossly over priced at the Sprint store, $35 - $40 over priced! I took it back for a refund and they would ONLY give me an exchange. There are better screen protectors available and I'm not going to put this one on my phone. Don't buy any accessories from this place without doing some research first, they will rip you off...
The wait is ridiculous even for being busy. There was an hour before our pizza even went into oven. No pizza is really that worth it. I've had better.
The Great Greek used to be my favorite place for lunch or pick up. But that changed today, last time I picked up the food was just okay. Salad with mushy tomatoes. So I figured maybe an off day.   Today I ordered the same as always 2 salads with two med rare steak skewers. When I got home with my food once again mushy tomatoes but this time the steak was so well done I could not eat it Two salads both with charred steak skewers.  Not sure what happened in the last couple of months but I I'll not be back.
Breakfast was just okay.  Weird bowl of fruit though. Really small cut on the fruit and it had a weird taste. Service was also slow today. It took 45 minutes to get eggs, toast and fruit?They have good dinners here but I'm going back to MiMi's or Black Bear Diner for breakfast.
This is my first night here... Room is not as bad as i thought it would be. The service is slow but gets done. I was gambling at the blackjack tables and the dealers were nice. This is the only con i encountered but needs to be addressed. I ordered Johnnie walker black and the lady brought me something else.  I asked it to be changed nicely and was brought back the same exact drink and she said she said she saw the tender pour the correct drink.Now... im not a fool and i have been drinking the same drink for 5+ years.  I was thoroughly dissapointed when i asked the drink to be changed and was brought back the same exact one i was given,  the one i gave back to her. This is one of the lowest customer service experiences ive encountered for a while.  Shame on you flamingo employee for having such lousy service.
Nice atmosphere and service was good. BUT... food was very basic and bland. Also portion sizes are so so small. My mom and daughter decided to split raviolis. Mom even asked the waiter if it would be enough food. The waiter said of course! The entire order consisted of five ravioli. When you split that it's 2.5 ravioli. We told the waiter we were disappointed that he said it would be enough. He said he usually eats 2 or 3 and is full. Setiously!!! Who eats 2 ravioli and is full? Atmosphere and service definitely not enough to save a restaurant, you need to have good food too.
We just moved here from Arizona and popped in here last Saturday.  We were greeted nicely at the bar. But when my friend asked the bartender if they served tamales... And she said no, "but we have jalapeños"... We should have known better and left.  We both ordered fajitas... And for $17 per person... It was a pretty sad entree.  Plus no rice or beans or sides for that price?  Disappointing.  Decent margaritas though.
The dessert was wonderful - some rhubarb thing with ice-cream.  The food :-|
Yesterday morning was our third visit at this location and most likely our last, although we might try other locations in Vegas if the opportunity present itself. While the service was just fine, the food is really lacking on so many levels. I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict and the eggs were simply cooked in a pan overmedium style and while I expected the salmon to be the kind you find in a bagel lox and cream cheese, it was chunks of plain steamed salmon. Just to make it worse neither my dish or my husband's were hot AND they came separately. For a $50 breakfast (with tip) We should of went across the street. Very disappointing for the money...
My first time at Georges Brasserie was for Restaurant Week, so you already know it isn't going to be as great as it may be every other day out of the year. With that being said, my expectations were not met. Considering they have a limited menu for the week, it should be a lot easier for them to crank out the meals, yet our reservation took almost 4 hours! Getting anything was very difficult and we waited for a good 40 minutes just to pay. Now the food was very good but it wasn't great. I did appreciate that I was able to get oysters as an appetizer during restaurant week! I would be interested to give them another try but their prices are high so it might be awhile...
Not really what I expected when I booked a hotel under the Hilton name. Sure they use the same bath products, but I've stayed at other Hiltons and the Las Vegas Hilton really needs a facelift. Checking in was easy -- and actually, I enjoyed it lot. The front desk attendant was courteous, talkative and very helpful. Turns out you have to pay a daily fee to enjoy to gym amenities, but since I'm a Hilton Honors member, we was able to get the fee waved. The rooms are just old -- that's the bottom line. The varnish on my bathtub is peeling and the room had a musky smell. Beds are comfortable, but nothing extraordinary. My TV was also not working, and I called to the front desk to send up someone, but they never showed up. After a follow-up call two hours later, the TV technician arrived and said the outlet was blown, and fixed it in two seconds. Restaurant selection is minimal in the hotel -- you have to go to the strip if you want real food and shopping. I had a shrimp and pasta salad from their wine bar in the main lobby - avoid getting it at all costs. The shrimp looked microwaved (multiple times) and there was so much pasta, I started feeling sick after a few bites. Overall, definitely not the WORST hotel I've stayed at, but compared to others in the area, nothing that would make me want to recommend this place.
Okay this was my second trip to Global --the first being 3 years ago and the last tonight. We were greeted by a uppity hostess ..who acted like we could not be seated or taken care of..I understand --we DID NOT have a reservation, but it was a Tuesday Night and it was 6 PM and No one was there....no one other than myself and the waiters. She did say she would try and I went to the restroom and came back out and she ..said..POSSIBLY we could sit at the bar...So we took it..a party of three...and we were happy to be there--it just sets the mood when the people that own the restaurant where YOU are going to spend YOUR MONEY and they act indifferent to you..We started out with a bottle of BOOM BOOM Sirah..it was good. We ordered 3 appetizers...the Mediterranean Lamb, the Berkshire Pork Belly, and Butternut Squash  Soup.   Soup was good..Pork Belly can do no wrong..EVER and the Lamb...not quite good and way to tough and well done.We then ordered the Sea Bass and the Open Raviolio. The Open Raviolio had way to much canned tomatoes, zucchini and wet veggies...not really there. The Sea Bass looked beautiful..the top 1/2 inch was edible the rest..was a tough gelatinous piece of sea carcass. NOT able to cut or eat. They did take it off the menu..The waiter ( Chris) was very good ...he was the bright light of the restaurant...The restaurant..was ALMOST GOOD..Not quite..not worth another trip back..Oh yea and it was very high priced for a Not Great place....
I've been a weekly regular since they opened years ago and have never had a problem with delivery till tonight. For whatever reason this weekend, their excuse was that they decided to do all you can eat sushi (which is usually just a Sunday through Thursday thing) and they didn't anticipate a crowd?  It's Saturday night!  It's always busy!  So the results were it took over an hour and a half to get our food when it usually takes 20 min and when it finally arrived, they forgot half of the sushi order!  I've been to other excellent sushi places where they will put as many chefs behind the sushi counter as necessary to keep up with demand... But not with katana.  I've had dine in issues before at katana where they are slammed on a Wednesday and only have one guy to do all the sushi.  Now it's affecting the weekend orders as well?  Completely unacceptable for as place open as long as they have and really makes me feel like they are choosing profits over customer satisfaction.  If you are going to offer all you can eat sushi for dine in, open up that pocket book and HIRE some more chefs!
One of my favorites has now gone by the gutter.  Lack of attention to detail regarding reservation and celebrating a special occasion, lame excuse for credit system not handling chase visas and overall an unappetizing experience.   As a frequent customer to Mastro's I'm annoyed by the way management is handling us as consumers due to a fraud alert on our credit card.  Very impersonal, humiliating and overall disgusting.  We did enjoy the meal but don't feel I'll ever return to any Mastro's in the near or far future.  They even told us after trying to pay that chase visas have been an issue.  AFTER eating that is....BTW the credit was fine and all resolved but treated as lepers as we leave.  HORRIBLE
My friends and I decided to come here b/c of their happy hour. It was in our hotel as well so we figured, why not? This place is not terrible, the chips and salsa were good. I had one of the burritos and it was not good at all. It was chicken, rice, black beans wrapped in a tortilla smothered in red sauce cheese and sour cream. Believe it or not, it was gross. I also had a Cadillac Margarita, all sour mix. We didn't receive happy hour prices b/c we were not sat in the bar area, which is fine. Our waitress was awesome. The service is prompt and friendly.p.s. Where I come from you get complimentary tortillas with your meal, they charged us $1 for each tort and didn't let us know they charged for them.
Not impressed with this place at all!I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  I would pass on this one.
We came here at 9:30 on a Saturday, and although the food was well executed the atmosphere and service made the experience an overall negative one. Almost everyone that worked there seemed exhausted and overwhelmed which is understandable given how dark, loud, and impossible to get around it was. We waited for about 15 mins to be asked about our drinks, and were able to order everything then. As I said, all of the food was very good as we had expected, but they need to make some overall adjustments to make this a pleasant dining experience.
This is a two star experience today.  The hostess to the sever, terrible. THANK YOU KITCHEN STAFF, FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! The server, never told us his name, never replied when asking his name. We waited 30minutes for a patio table while looking at 5available patio tables and an available dining room with multiple tables. We watched our server cater to other guest multiple times before acknowledging us. I would love to tell you his name but hever told us. The receipt says his name is John C but we cannot count on this to be true. He has short dark hair. Anyway,  the buzzers were malfunctioning so we were buzzed without having a table infuriating when me plus ant 10 orher guest are looking at open tables and being told nothings available. I've been here multiple times the food is pretty consistent but the service however is not.  Be prepared to wait and only be acknowledged at their availability.
On our way cross country we decided to stop and get one of our favorites ~ a 23 Skidoo. We have been stopping into the Sugar Bowl for YEARS on our travels to the Scottsdale area. We were sooooo disappointed. It is not the same. The restaurant itself was dirty, paper on the floor, customers standing around without anyone greeting them.A 23 Skidoo is (was) one of my all time favorite ice cream treats. The wonderful chocolate coffee syrup was nothing like it was. in fact, it was like coffee had simply been poured in the middle with one scoop of ice cream on the bottom and one scoop above the coffee (see my picture of the 23 skidoo). The glass was sticky from where ice cream hands had handled it. When I asked about why the difference, our waitress responded with, "we have knew people we're training and everyone makes it different." I ask our waitress to bring me some chocolate syrup ~ it never came. She said she asked another wait staff to bring it over. Umm, if you are a waitress waiting on a customer you respond directly and then follow up with our customers. Perhaps more customer service training is needed. I also ordered the tea sandwiches which is a combination of 3 triangle tea sandwiches; egg salad, tuna salad and corn beef salad. The bread was dry as if the sandwich had been made up and left out until someone else ordered the same sandwiches. This restaurant is in a prime location in Old Scottsdale ~ it is incredibly sad to watch this '50 style diner show they do not care about their customers/restaurant like it use to.
I started seeing the new family doctor. Dr Grewal. She is amazing and I am happy I found such a great doctor. But the receptionist service are POOR. Every time , i call I, they put me on hold for long time and most of the time they forgot. sometimes I gave up and hung on after 7-8 mins but it is always like that. I am so unhappy of front desk services.
Other than the fact that this plaza contains horrendous drivers and no sense of direction, the Metro here isn't any different. This place is crowded, cramped and items hard to find. I just felt claustrophobic in here, and happy that we only had come in to buy one thing.However, they did have an extensive fish and bulk shrimp collection (which I haven't seen at any other grocery, but I don't peruse Metros that much either). Also lots of potted plants in the front to buy that last minute gift before you see your in-laws (yes, I have done this).
Paid for 6 sessions of the brazilian laser (plus went at least 6 more x0- after two years its still growing back. They also raised there touch up prices. I won't be going back.
We ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. We got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. We usually go to Little Joe's Pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. On the phone, we ordered the family special. One large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. One we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14". Little Joe's pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of Pizza Huts pizza. The bread sticks were good. I liked their marinara dipping sauce. I didn't mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. The pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. I'm only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. For the same amount of money at Little Joe's Pizza I could have fed 2 more people so I don't feel I got the best bang for my buck.
Warning - don't come on a busy weekday if you are in a hurry.  We came in right at noon and were seated immediately.  The server brought our drinks, chips and salsa pretty quickly.  Good start.  However, after we placed our orders, we waited and waited and waited... 40 minutes later, and still no entrees in sight! Jeez, this is standard Tex-Mex fare, not a 7 course gourmet meal people! So, when we finally got our food, we had less than 15 minutes to scarf down our food, pay our bill and get back to our meeting down the street.  Not exactly an enjoyable lunch - we had to gobble our food down so quickly, I can't remember if I even enjoyed it.
Very disappointing... the service was slow if not to say non-existing... the only reason they are getting 2 Stars: when I asked our waiter if i could please have my drink I ordered 30 minutes ago (only one out of party of 3 sitting and waiting)... he smiled, apologized and comped the drink...
The sushi was meh, tempura was okay, and sashimi was a little sketch to me (butterfish was sour, but the tuna and salmon were not bad, surf clam was rubbery!)I'm still on a quest for cheap good sushi in Toronto!!The best part was the free ice cream :P
While the gym offers all you would want our need, it is small and therefore gets quite busy/cramped. Also I HATE that the cardio equipment faces the weights, making it a spectator sport for both areas.
Too crowded for me. Some may think it's ok, but I hate it. Should be at least 50% bigger. Awesome people work there, so it's not a 1. Good equipment selection. Great location, but too many people make it hard to work out without conflict, or use the equipment I want. Too small with too many people who don't realize that timeliness and using one piece of equipment at a time is fair in such a crowded place.
If you look up the definition of hospitality in the dictionary the Flamingo is definitely not mentioned.  Terrible front desk service.  I usually don't mention people in specific but Emilio who "helped" deserves dishonorable mention for being one of the least help people I have ever experienced. I booked my room through booking.com and clearly my confirmation stated I had reserved two rooms . Upon check in I was told they only showed I had one room reserved.  I was told I would have to take the one room get out of line and figure it out on my own.   Not until I got a supervisor involved was I able to resolve the issue.  Never once did Emilio apologize to me or tell me anything about the amenities they hotel had to offer like the front desk associates around him.  I will not stay at Flamingo again.
Not sure what first caught my eye about this place, but something did.  I'd been wanting to go to this place for awhile now.   I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.  However, seeing as this seems to be a fairly new place, I'm willing to get them a second try when I'm feeling 100%, rather than just 90%.
First of all, this is not a Chinese restaurant.  It is a buffet restaurant that also has a Chinese session.  There are sushi, roast beef cut station, dessert bar, ice cream bar, and soup bar.For a buffet restaurant, it is pretty good.  Foods are kept fresh and generally well-prepared.  Of course they are all heavy on sauce and many deep fried.  What would you expect from a glorified Panda Express?The surprise was the roast beef.  Well made, tender, and tasty.The beer selection was disappointing for a northern city.  I ended with Tiger beer.
I have been coming here for years the food is good but the service sucks today was my last time if I wanted to be treated like shit I would stay home
Food 1/5 stars. Service was good so they earned another.. the best thing on the table was the coconut juice. BBH (bun bo hue) lacked some major lemongrass action. Their banh canh cha ca was unexpectedly spicy from the cha ca. Broth was so basic with their not soft enough banh canh. Banh Beo needed more meat than just a tiny bit of shrimp. Not to mention the ga roti, chicken was not flavored enough. The safest thing to order was bun thit nuong here.
Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the good quality dumplings you can buy at Chinese grocery store, ormaybe it's because I've had better dumpling for less in Chinatown and regular chinese restaurents, and most definitely because I've read all the raving reviews on yelp before trying out this place, but but Quing Hua was rather a let down for me.Choice: Many choices of dumpings, I have only try the old classic of dumplings, porc and chives.Quality: The dough is not particularly chewy or delicately textured, it is more akin to the factory-made/bought-at-minimal-price-at-your-local-grocery than hand-made. They probably did not made it themselves.  The porc and chive filling itself is rather bland, all I could taste is porc, which suggest that A) not enough chive and other spices and B) chives is really not fresh. The portion of filling is not generous either.Portion:The overall portion isn't great compare to other cheap eat in the area, especially for its price.Service:PoorWhen I went there, it was 3:30pm on a week day and I was the only customer, nonetheless it took a good 20 minutes for my food to arrive, and the waitress was exceedingly busy chatting with her colleagues in the kitchen to bother with basic waitressing. Price:About 15 small-medium size dumplings for 10+ bucks is a tad bit pricey for it's cheap-eat quality and service.Overall: There are just so many more restaurants in the Concordia area with higher (quality+service)/price quotient than Qing Hua...
This place was such a let down!I had high hopes for our dinner here (all you can eat meat - who wouldn't?) but while walking out of the restaurant after our party of 6 finished dinner, we all had the same sentiments...meh....waste of money...Having never been to Copacabana before, we relied on the instruction of our server, who sent us to the salad buffet first, before any of the meat came. We brought our plates back to the table, and about 30 minutes after chowing down on salad the meat started to come. It almost seemed as if they were waiting for us to fill up on salads so we would be full by the time the meat came. The meat then came in HORDES....all at once! - but this was short lived. The servers with skewers of meat were at our table one after another, with no time to eat the piece already on our plates. They also failed to describe the meat they had (super loud in there and when asked to repeat they just ignored - they need to have signs or something..). After we told a few of them to come back in a bit so we could tackle the meat already on our plates they completely ignored our table for the remainder of the night, even when summoned. We also asked four different staff for more salmon (the one hit of the night + the grilled pineapple) and all said sure! no problem! ....and then it never came -____-'The meat was super super salty and I have a feeling its intentional as they keep coming with bottles of water for the table - maybe hoping you will keep chugging and get filled up?Basically the night was rushed, loud, poor service, salty meat, and with tax/tip/no drinks came to $45 per person (it was sumerlicious mind you, so it's probably even more expensive on normal days). For that price we could have gone to the Keg and had a great slab of steak with proper sides and better service. Save your money.Would I return? - No. Parking? - Street parking on side street and on Yonge, Green P's around, Eglinton subway station right besideValue for $? - Not greatSpace? - Medium sized/limited waiting area (they will take your number and text you when the table is ready). Inside is pretty big. Ventilation? - So so (aka you will smell a bit like food after)Service? - Poor
I've pretty much liked most of the places in NoDa that I've been to, but this place missed the mark. I felt that the waiter was not very attentive at all. There were only 3 other people in the bar area where we were seated. Also there is a little window where you able to see into the kitchen and I noticed that the staff where eating out of this big bowl of fries with their hands. I thought that maybe that was just for the staff when their hungry or swinging by to pick up food. But clearly that is not the case it's the same bowl they serve customers out of, how gross! This was a first and last overall the food was ok.
Food was great, service and concept had major hiccups.My friend and I decided to try out this new Hopdoddy location for lunch. It was about 11:45 on a Thursday, and we only had about 45 minutes for lunch before we had to travel back to work. Unfortunately, it ended up being the slowest service, unprofessional servers, and most frustrating dining experience I've had in a while. It took a total of an hour and fifteen minutes to get out of there, after we waited for over 45 minutes to get our food.  Generally, the concept just wasn't working efficiency-wise from the moment we walked in. We walked in & two minutes later an employee taps us on the back and says "OH where did you come from I didn't see you walk in" and hands us more menus, even though we had already grabbed some while we were waiting in line.After ordering, they place us at an unfavorable 2-top table by the line & Soda machine. I think in restaurant setting like that you should be able to have a say in where you sit, but the choose for you. We asked if we could switch our table to a friendlier one, given half of the tables were empty at the time. They gladly let us move to another one. 35 Minutes later, we still don't have any food or milkshakes. We asked numerous workers if they knew where our food or milkshakes were, they all said they don't know and the "bar handles that".  10 minutes later, it appeared no one had looked into anything, and we had to ask another server who had an unfriendly response of, "you didn't order through the cashier because we don't see your order. Are you sure you ordered. and are you sure you ordered milkshakes?" instead of an apology or appropriate response of trying to figure it out.10 minutes after that, we received our food, which was actually GREAT. We ordered the spinach salad and Thunderbird burger. Both were very tasty. 15 minutes later we still had no milkshakes. Finally we received a milkshake, and then it took another 20 minutes and numerous times of asking servers to get our check. I understand it's a new opening, and therefore I would wait a few months to try it again. Their food was great and I'm sure this was not a normal experience.
Mediocre food. Nothing great. I've had better. Ordered take out 2 times and both times didn't come with cutlery. Didn't know we had to eat wonton soup without a spoon. The noodles were soggy in the centre of the bowl but the edges were still raw. Clearly were not fried noodles. Don't think I'll return
Sadly, the last three times I've been here, the curry has been extraordinarily watery and tasteless. I feel like maybe they are phoning it in due to their great lunch-time location...
We sat at the bar and the hostess wrapped silverware through our entire meal next to us at the bar. The sound of the silverware clanking around in the metal container was atrocious to listen to while dining. Food was good but won't be back.
I went to here for the first time. My bf got out from hospital. We want to get something to eat. We decided to go here because the food looks so good but it actually not good at all. I was really disappointed and i give them a chance once i ordered rice with steak and eggs for to go. When i arrived home to open it. There was not steak in it and the food smell bad! I CAN'T BELIVE IT!
I was excited to have fish and chips when I drove by Chippy's but unfortunately it wasn't what I thought it would be.I got the cod and chips and it was OK.   The fries were good but the fish batter was somewhat to hard/crunchy to bite into. The fish portions were good but that's all. The tartar sauce is homemade but it wasn't tart enough it still tasted more like mayo.
We got a newly renovated room, I mean broom closet. There was seriously a foot around the bed to walk. That's it. In the bathroom, the dust hanging off the vent looked like a scary horror movie. In the 18 hours we spent at the Flamingo, a neighboring room's room service tray of used dishes never moved or was picked up. Gross. I've stayed at the Flamingo quite a few times and this last visit makes me never want to return.
I found many of the dishes not to be spicy enough. It was a lunch buffet so maybe the a lar carte dishes may taste better. The spices I love when getting Indian food just weren't there.
Why is it that you have a coupon for a $5 oil and filter change upon check in on Yelp but won't honor that price?
My 3rd dim sum visit since opening... and I'm still not impressed with the food and the service. Maybe I had over expected the quality and taste of the food... since Yu Seafood presented themselves as this 'luxurious' and 'high class' restaurant but their dim sum did not meet this standard. They have limited dim sum - only one column (half side) of the sheet was dim sum and the other side was dessert, fried rice/noodles and entrees (like rack of lambs). Here are things I DIDN'T ENJOY: - Lobster seafood steam bun (L): This was extremely overpriced for 3 steam buns since the filling inside hardly had any lobster meat or even taste to it. - Fresh fruit napoleon (L): It looked pretty, and it came in approximately 3 layers of puff pastry with cream, mini strawberries and sliced kiwi. However, the puff pastry was STALE which is the biggest turnover for this type of dessert (and I even wondered if it was fresh... perhaps a day old?). - Scallops, egg white, king oyster fried noodles ($18): This is the worst Chinese fried noodles I've ever had! Although the scallops were a good/decent size, it didn't taste fresh with an almost frozen after taste.The noodles have absolutely NO TASTE and should be avoided. It definitely did not match the high price they charged. Here are things I ENJOYED: - Special BBQ pork bun (M): This was essentially 3 mini pineapple buns with BBQ pork inside. Overall, the bread was very soft, and it was very unique. - Steam pork ribs with pumpkin (M): Pork ribs was plentiful! They definitely did not cheap out on the portion, and every pork rib had soft meat. So there weren't pieces that were just bone or fat. As for service, for my most recent experience, the server did not engage us or even respond to us. When we asked for toothpicks for a table of 5, he gave us only 2 packets of toothpicks. Furthermore, when we ordered the big plate of fried noodles, the servers did not give us bowls to share which is very uncommon for Chinese restaurants. I tried getting someone but no one came, and in the end, I had to get up myself to grab bowls they had on the side. All in all, my most recent experience was a big disappointment and will make me avoid Yu Seafood for a while...
We stayed at the Sofitel towards the end of August, 2014. We booked in the Sofitel as opposed to the other leading hotels we had on our list due to the raving reviews we saw here on Yelp and TripAdvisor about how wonderful this place was to stay.Our stay, however,  turned out to be one with never ending bloopers from beginning to end. One would've thought we were being punked or something!!! We had 2 rooms booked. A week or so prior, we contacted the hotel to give them a heads up..part of the party were arriving early and ask for early check-in. At which point, we were advised it would't be guarranteed but that they would do their best and  it was likely that they would be able let us check in early.We arrived at the hotel  at about 11:30am on a Thursday.  The door man was very friendly, the lobby area looked immaculate, warm greeting at the front desk... impressed so far.  We spoke with Peter at the front desk, who was very nice and professional, no complaint!  Asked for my ID and a credit card to be attached to our rooms for "incidentals".Just to  make sure, I confirmed this was just for incidentals and that both  room charges should be charged to the CC that was used at reservation. Peter confirmed- "Yes the card we already have on file will be charged, this is just for incidentals, but that the amount they would place on hold on my card would be the total price for each rooms plus $100.00/day for incidentals" -- which he said would come up to about $2600.00!!! Wait what??  If it is just for incidentals, why so high? Shouldn't it just be the $100/day for each room?  Anyway, we went round and round and apparently it is their policy.   I provided him with my card after confirming again that the card is NOT going to be hard charged unless we tell them otherwise at the end of the stay--(I didn't want my card to be charge since we as a group have already agreed to have all the hotel charges on the other girl's card to avoid any unneccessary INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION CHARGES).  He confirmed that they will charge whicever credit card we instruct them to charge, for this purpose it will just be a hold.  OK, so after all that, he told us  our rooms weren't ready yet, which we understood.  Suggested a lunch spot for u s to try while we wait and asked  for us to come back maybe around 2:30sh, as he thinks the rooms should be ready by then. Walked us to concierge to have our luggage held for us.We came back about 10 til 3:00pm.  A diff gentleman was there, our rooms weren't ready yet. Directed us to the waiting area. 3:30pm, the rep came to us with apologies, offered for us to wait at the bar and that they would BUY us our drinks as our rooms are still being cleaned.  He brings us to the bar and introduces us to the bar tender, again, extends his apologies and hands us a card and said someone would come and get us when our room is ready. Thanked him for being kind. Sat down and Whoa!! the drinks at that bar were all average $20 bucks each pop!!!  Anyway, we order our drinks, I take a sip of mine.. take a closer look  and it had something EXTRA swimming on it!!  Wow, really???????  There was a fly or a bug of some sort on my drink!!!! GEEZ!!  At this point, I was really starting to dread having to stay at this hotel-- it was one thing after another!!!! Approached our server to change out my drink. so we sit around..it is 4:30sh at this point, I go back to the front desk-- Different reps are there,  I walk up and politely asked about our room to which she responds "Ah yes, madame, your rooms aren't ready yet, but you are at the bar waiting correct? They are still cleaning your room, Pls go back to the bar and enjoy your drinks and we will come and get you" ..5:30 still no room, not even just ONE of the rooms!!  6:00pm, I go to the front desk again.. still no room available!! 6:15 the front desk rep comes to the bar to let us know ONE of our rooms are ready. So we get ready to leave and we were told we had to close out our tabs.. it turns out they were comping our first drink.. and the second one we  were responsible for..Over 2 hours wait!!! At this point, we just wanted to go up to our room and freshen up as we've had a long day. Our fligth left FL at 5:00am, so you can just imagine. Nightmare didn't end there.. they weren't able to give us our second room until AFTER 7:00 pm... they ended up charging our rooms to 2 seperate cards after we had explicitly asked them at time of check-in and then again at check-out to charge the one designated CC.  So many other issues that came up during the stay.  Disspointed with this hotel, as contrary to the good reputation they have, there didn't seem to be any initiative on their party to resolve the issues that kept coming up.  For the price you pay, you can find a much better place elsewhere with more reliable service.
Since it is new and we are always looking for good Chinese food, we tried Chef Panda.  Sorry we did!  It is obviously set up for take out, as they only 4 combination meals to eat in, if you wish to.  We ordered their House Chicken; it was served in a styrofoam take out container.  Admittedly it was full of fried rice and chicken (maybe enough to serve two), but both were essentially tasteless!  The kitchen looked like organized chaos!  We will NOT be returning!
Husband was going to take me to a pricy French restaurant for date night.  I didn't like the menu choices so I made a reservation at Mariner's Inn.  I've heard soooo many rave reviews, and how fabulous the seafood is. We were extremely  disappointed.  First, the decor is very dated and dirty.  The wait staff was pleasant. Appetizer was the stuffed seafood mushrooms and they were better then they looked.  However, my steak and lobster was way over priced, had no taste almost like it wasn't seasoned at all and the "famous" hash browns sat in a pool of grease.  We will not be back and unless they revamp the whole place, chef included I don't see how the will stay open.
Instead of writing a review, I'm going to post a video of me wringing out a measurable amount of oil from a donut from TBC.
Great Location, Great Neighbors. Close to the strip but not ghetto, you get what you pay for here.  Unless I leave Vegas or Buy a House here I will not be moving out!Only Issue Is having guests over can be a hassle, getting in the gate can be long but, it does make the place safe.We rent from a Tenant and we are lucky to have a very helpful and attentive one at that.  I have heard of many bad stories tho.24hr Pool, BBQ, GYM, Hot Tub just Feet from my Place, and I can see the Cosmo and Palazzo from my couch as well as the Hot Tub.
it was just... okwe got a pitcher (14 bucks on thursdays) of mill street which was great. for food we got hot burgers and spanish paella. the beer was good, the sweet potato fries were yum, and the food were fairly cheap... that's it. the burger was served with what tasted like day-old bread that's thick as a brick.. kind of killed the whole burger cuz all we tasted was the bread. the paella was just not.. anything special. it tasted of chicken, rice, tomato, and a bit of salt - I had much better flavored paellas in the past, this was not super impressive. maybe a good spot for drinks and fries. food you can skip.
I hate to give 2 stars, specially when the food was good and the ambiance was great. But the service... Even though we had reservations for 20h15, we had to wait until 20h45 to get a table. It took +20 min to get the menus. My friends ordered ceviche and aztec soups and got their food in 10min. Another friend and I ordered mole and tacos and they didn't bring them with the rest because they were "main dishes" (???) even though we ordered only one dish... My friends had finished eating when I got my plate. It was 22h10 when I started eating! Being very familiar with how a restaurant should work, this is ridiculous.
As a spectator this race I wanted to get me family on video attempting these obstacles. With the amount of real estate soooo close to stands, the obstacles could have been laid out better too allow family to enjoy the race too. Very disappointed.
I've been here many times and don't know why I have reviewed this place yet. It's a cool dive bar if you don't mind the nonexistent/terrible service.
If you're stuck at this part of the Old Port and you have nowhere else to go, ok. Otherwise, there are bunch of other places in Montreal with 10 times better service. The food is ok, nothing special. But I think they don't think their customers as returning customers they don't really care about the service that much. If you're a tourist in Montreal, it means that you have the time to take the cab or the metro to go places. Spend 20 more minutes and go to Lawrence, Manitoba or VORO. Eat better, experience a nicer place. At the end, that's why you're visiting Montreal!If you're a local, I'm pretty sure you won't go here anyways, unless your friends are like "Oh, we found this place but don't remember the name. Let's go there." then you end up here.
Its Indian-American fusion restaurant.... Naans are good, chettinad chicken is just ok.. Dessert and appetizers are over prized ....
A little past it's prime it seems SadI think that I've had my last meal here Too noisy and not worth it in the food departmentSome people seem to disagree with my review but this was my experience and perhaps yours will be different but please refrain from the insulting language - life's too short to call people names over a review on yelp!
Just finished a rather disappointing experience after having high hopes for a good meal based on the reviews.The good, apps.  The cornbread was delicious.  The cauliflower appetizer was mostly good, minus the black eyed peas.  The black eyed peas were listed as fried, but to us they were overcooked, very grainy and chalky.  My big boy old fashioned was decent. Her unicorn tears was ok, light on flavor.The bad, the main courses.  She ordered a half order of brisket, I ordered a half order of chopped pork and we shared baked beans.  We're not sure the intent on the brisket, but it seemed to be precooked, sliced into 'steaks' and then grilled.  This resulted in the driest brisket we've ever eaten.  It was near jerky.  But, the pickles were good.As I recall, the menu didn't include a description of the chopped pork... I probably should've asked for detail.  What came to the table was so over sauced I couldn't taste the pork, and I could not tell you if the meat was smoked or roasted.  There just wasn't any smoke flavor.  There were 3 sauces on the table, but I couldn't try them... the meat was already drowning in a sweet sauce.  Again, I probably should've asked, but I expected a well smoked pork that I could use their sauces on.  Especially since they had a mustard sauce which I really like on smoked pork.The side order of baked beans... beans were cooked well.  But, there just wasn't any seasoning.  We had a few bites, and it just wasn't worth it.  There was no salt on the table, and by this point we weren't inclined to flag someone down to ask for salt.We did inform the waiter of our disappointment, who brought the manager out.  We were offered a free dessert, which we declined.  After several disappointing dishes, dessert wouldn't have resolved the preceding experience.We had hoped for a good bbq meal with some 'elevation' of flavors based on the menu, that's not what we were served.  Here's hoping they can improve, a good nearby bbq meal would be much appreciated.
Friday night in Summerlin is often a challenge. There are many choices but it seems that Friday is when the entire population tries to get a table at the same time. I have started to use Open Table for reservations with varying degrees of success. the first time I booked here, I received a phone call shortly afterwards to tell me they could not seat us. This time I tried again, I waited for my phone call to cancel me but it didn't come. Good! Off we go.We arrive on time and are seated immediately. Nice.We order some drinks and some wings for an appetizer. Wings were a little crispy, I am not sure if that was the intent. OK, only OK.Wifee, myself and teenager ordered Burgers. I took the one with lobster, $5 extra for a tiny piece of crustacean and sauce. Hum? Wifee had Turkey and teen built his own. The burgers were good, cooked medium and a good size. But it's $5 extra for fries. Burgers , in my opinion, should be served with fries NOT soggy potato chips. I believe it is complete gouging to charge 50% of the burger price for the fries.Smaller son had kids chicken fingers and fries and it was ok but the portion was small.So 3 burgers, 1 kids meals 2 wine, 2 beer and 2 sodas $100 . Too much, food was ok but I can spend $100 on better.Bye.
I took my folks here last weekend for dinner on a Saturday night.  They were busy but didn't seem to be at full capacity.  The service we received was absolutely awful, and it really disappointed me.They seemed to be out of glasses, so we were served two of the four waters we requested in plastic cups.  Drinks took forever.  Everything took forever.The food, which is usually good, was cold.  Rather than arriving sizzling, my fajitas arrived dead and cold.If any of the management reads this, I assure you this is a fair review.  Terrible service  and cold food.  I will not be returning until you shape up.
I've visited twice, and both times weren't exactly positive experiences.In terms of food, everything tasted okay by all means, but everything was a little on the bland side--flavours didn't really pop (and weirdly enough all the food looks... kind of pale?), but for fair-priced sushi and appetizers, I was honestly satisfied with what I paid for.My real issue was with the service.  Maybe during both trips the staff were just having bad days, but I was astounded by how blunt the servers were--the worst of it was on my second visit.  My group was welcomed in politely and halfway through eating, were asked if everything was okay, which so far it was, but when it came time to pay everything became so much more confusing than it needed to be.  The server seemed irritated that we wanted to split the bill according to what we'd each ordered and bluntly asked us how we wanted to round our payments--as someone on the shyer side, I was almost intimidated by her attitude.  We all ended up getting confused and pooled the money in a mess, which left them a bigger tip than we realized--which, after the fact, we had decided was hardly deserved.  I believe in the system of speaking with your wallet--anytime I have a bad experience, I still thank staff and leave quietly, and then promise myself not to come back, as was unfortunately the case here.
I found myself in possession of a gift card to Best Buy resulting from an errant purchase, so I was forced into shopping here. I came in knowing exactly what I wanted: a blue tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone. I thought this should be a simple purchase, but I underestimated the lack of competence of the Best Buy staff.Things started well enough. I walked in, asked for Blue Tooth keyboards and was directed to a certain section of the store. In this section, computer keyboards greeted me, and although some were wireless, it wasn't what I had asked for. I proceeded to search around for several minutes on my own, but then decided to heed the voice of my husband in my head and ask for help. Dramatic interpretation of events that followed. "Hi, I am looking for a Blue Tooth keyboard to use with an iPhone."Best Busy Associate: "I don't think they make those.""Yes, they do. I have owned one in the past."Best Buy Associate: "Why would you want a keyboard with your iPhone? The screen is so small.""I want one. I know they exist. Can you just tell me whether or not you have them?"Best Buy Associate: "Um... let me get on the computer and do some searches. What is it exactly you need again?"  [Aimless searching on computer commences.]Best Buy Associate: "Maybe he can help you?" [points to someone else]"Can you help me find a Blue Tooth keyboard?"[Blank stare from second associate. Aimless computer search continues. I just walk away.]I eventually find the best option for what I need, which is really the only option they carried. My previous keyboard, which was better, came from Radio Shack. I never thought the thought "Radio Shack has a better selection," would run through my mind, but it did. The combination of rather unhelpful, uneducated staff and limited inventory left me one frustrated consumer.
The rooms are clean and modern and overall the staff is very helpful.  The problems are the carpets in the hall way are old and dirty. They are tapped together.  Bugsy would be very disappointed. The elevators are brown vs brass on the inside.  There are 8 -10 elevators up to the rooms. Each one make its own set of weird noises. Some beep, some light up, some are bumpy. In all of them you just hope you  get to your floor.
The practice changed their name from Scottsdale Primary Care, and so the review I wrote previously did not carry over. I am actually LOWERING my rating for them based on continued experience with this office. I will copy my original review below, then add an update."I followed my doctor to this office when he relocated. At first I was really impressed, but by my third visit, not so much. The doctors and nurses are great, but the office support staff needs work. It is very hard to get through on the phone, and I have been put on hold more than once, and eventually hung up after extra ordinarily long wait times on hold.Again, the doctor and nursing care I have received there has been top notch, so if you can stand the rest, this is a great office that offers same day appointments, though no weekend hours. However, for one appointment, the receptionist forgot I was there (She freely admitted that she got distracted and forgot--I was one of THREE people in the waiting area) and so I didn't get called in for my appointment until twenty minutes after my appointment time, and then I was treated as if the lady who forgot to check me in was doing me a favor by 'fitting me in'. This week, I needed a prescription refill and called on a Thursday, and while it was foolish of me to wait until I was completely out of meds, the receptionist assured me that it would be faxed to the Pharmacy that day. A trip to the pharmacy that evening proved that to be false, and by the time I was able to check into it on Friday, the office was closed and the order had still not been faxed to the pharmacy. I will have to go five days with my meds, assuming that this all gets fixed by some point on Monday.The reception desk always seems to be seriously understaffed or under trained...I am not sure which or if it is both, but it seriously hurting their reputation to have errors like this made as often as it does."Now for my update...I have been out of my meds for a week because they will not do a refill request over the phone and NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE. It is picked up by an automated service and I get treated to a recording about how they changed their name and whatnot and how very important my call is to them and someone will be with me shortly. Except it's not true. I have called them four times in the past week trying to get an appointment and have sat on hold for over 40 minutes without ever speaking to a real person. I have given up and am now planning to drive there in person to get an appointment and voice my frustration to both the office manager and my doctor. This is ridiculous! After this, I will very seriously consider seeking a new PCP even though I have been seeing this doctor for over twenty years. SO disappointed!
Not your normal dining experience. If you are looking for an evening out to enjoy a great bottle of wine, you can get that bottle, you just can't enjoy it. Disappointed with the tasting only service. You will find yourself waiting too long for your next taste. Definitely a local favorite. Not someplace you would go out of your way for. Average food at best.
Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he "got lost."  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was "eh."  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.
Swiss Chalet got nothing on Portuguese Chicken! It's been about nine years since my last visit here and now I remember why it's taken me this long to go back. The last time I was here I remember it being so ghetto kinda like a cafeteria setting almost and now it looks more like a food court setting you'd see at a mall. My little beef with the seating arrangement is that you are so close to other people that it kinda ruins your meal a little. For one I'm not one to ease drop on someone elses conversation or do I like hearing other peoples conversation but it's impossible not to ignore it b/c you are that damn close to other people. Besides the seating arrangement the interior looked very nice and clean. The bar area adds a nice touch to it with sports, mostly soccer, playing on the screens. I wanna come back here just to see what it is like during the World Cup! I betcha this place would be crazy during that time. The one item that stands out here is the BBQ chicken. The chicken is very well done, cooked properly and the flavour was nice. But when you add that hot sauce that they supply it makes the chicken so much sweeter. The white meat on the chicken was very good not dry at all like almost every other place I've been to. The one item not to get is the sausage. Presentation wise it's served on a pig that's on fire, very wonderful site to see where it gets everyones attention. There is alot of meat in that sausage but the flavour wasn't the greatest and it was very dry that we didn't even finish half of it. I don't know when the next time I'll come back here maybe another 9 years but who knows if I happen to be craving Portuguese chicken and I happen to be around the area I'll grab some for take out. Items to definitely get: - BBQ Chicken
I am a little biased on this, as I was completely unnerved by a creepy by-stander. But anyways. I was meeting someone here and I personally hate coming to the signal hill/westhill area, especially on a week day during the day. No offence to stay at home moms, good for you, but you drive me insane. You are slow moving, have no care in the world and live in your own bubble. First off having to walk through the Chapters is annoying, it is full of people and screaming children (I thought places with books meant quiet time?), there is hardly any seats and the place is a zoo. Chai latte was a chai latte, tastes the same as usual. And then I as mentioned before was entirely creeped out by a patron. My whole experience here was terrible. I hope I never have to go back.
no very impressed. Bar tenders were beyond rude, and inisting you tip, hounding you to tip. Really not cool.
This is a Mexican restaurant for people who don't like Mexican food. With so many options in Phoenix, it boggles my mind that this place has a line. It tastes like my old college cafeteria's attempt at Mexican. 2 stars because the drink selection is pretty great.
I generally enjoy this restaurant and tonight's visit seem to be going well. Waiter was great and drinks were delicious. We ordered calamari, crab cakes and mussels to share.  The crab cakes were delicious and so was the calamari, however. half way through we found a hair in the dish.  Obviously not on of our own because it was caked in the calamari batter.  We all know this can happen and when we told the waiter he promptly took the plate saying he would show the manager.  Our mussels were brought out later and they were yummy, as well.  The issue came when we received our check with the calamari on it.  Not only did we find the hair but the waiter took away half of the order once we found it.  Absolutely no reason why it should have been on our bill.  Very disappointed about this.
Hi, T-Mobile S Rainbow! Let me give you a quick customer service 101.HERE IS HOW YOU PROPERLY GREET AND ASSIST A CUSTOMER: "Hello, my name is __________. How may I assist you today?"I dropped by T-Mobile during my lunch break as a ten-year AT&T customer hoping to make the big switch. They had this huge promo going on "switch from a carrier and get a free iPhone 7 (when you trade in your current iPhone)". Upon every transaction, sales associates should 1) assume customers are there for the promo or 2) at least talk about the promo.Imelda assisted me without proper above-said greeting, so she missed the whole point of why I was there and our time including a lot of backtracking and waste. I tell her I want to make the big switch, so she proceeds to activate a new line, makes me pay for a $25 SIM card, then looks at me - "So you already have a phone for this SIM card?" "No, I wanted to do the free iPhone promo." "Oh. I saw you had two phones so I just assumed you already had a phone for me. If I knew you wanted to do the promo, I wouldn't have charged you $25 because under the promo, activating a line is free." Huh?? Maybe if you fully questioned my needs without jumping the gun...She then had to void the $25 transaction which for some reason she was reluctant to do. Her whole manner was rushed and lacked genuine concern when explaining things to me. When going over details of the promo, she rambled in her jargon that only phone courier sales associates who have to talk about it 100x a day would understand. She sees I do not get it, emits an exasperated sigh, then condescendingly writes on a sticky note what my options are. I have questions, and she responds to them in a nope-you-can't-do-that tone.Ugh, the whole ordeal was so stupid. I made up in my mind that I wanted to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile and she changed that buying power in an instant. I stopped the transaction saying I'd think about my options and return after work. She said she's working there until 8pm. Hell no was I returning to her. I took my business to their Silverado location where THEIR T-Mobile associates absolutely redeemed their company's name and went above and beyond for me. Off to leave a five-star review on their site.
Well...Chipotle u have disappointed me for the last time. You used to be such a money spot for me for years. I see why your losing 10 percent of your sales every year now. Why so chincy on the portions? Why cold food? Is it really that hard? The only reason why your not getting one star instead of two is I still like the taste. I spent almost 12 bucks on a cold burrito and chips and guacamole.  I could have went to red lobster! Lol never again
Very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but I make it better. The first time I went to this place, I felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well. So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat. While enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat. Our waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. "How about desert right now" I remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm. Food = 4 stars Service = 0 stars
Decided to try this place out of recommendation.  Not impressed.  A bit too noisy, waiters/waitresses sang nicely but they need to turn it down a few notches.  Food was ok I've had better.  Waitress was friendly.  I wouldn't return.  Only plus while visiting Stratosphere was winning some money.  :)
Average food on the edge of expensive for dim sum, $5 per order Pork dumplings with fish roe, average (frozen?)Pork short ribs boiled? Then a spoon full of black beans put on top ughBeef flank stewed with bok choy and a lump of noodles I had to cut with a spoon
I was extremely let down by our trip to David's. We make an appointment and didnt get called back for 20 minutes after my scheduled time. All the while the lady at the desk said it was to finish the bride the stylist was working with from before. Well apparently she wasnt done. So instead of having all attention on me we split her time. Which would have been ok if it was even. There was a point I searched out the seamstress to take off the dress that I had been in for 20 minutes to use the bathroom. In the time we were there the other bride was in 10 dresses in the time I was in 2. After my appointment where the seamstress took over because my whole group was starting to be irritated we went to my bridesmaids. The stylist came back The dress that we picked didnt come in the right color so I picked out 4 different ones. 2 of the dresses brought over weren't even the correct ones. Insulted one of my bridesmaids who is a 4 or a 6 with bringing her a 14 saying she will get the idea anyway... After I said the last dress wasnt the correct one the lady said well you have basically seen everything so you will prlly need to look somewhere else for your bridesmaids. I had no limit to my dress budget left buying my dress which is why I gave up an extra star because it was beautiful. My daughter is in my wedding and when I stated she would like to have something similar to me, she stated they were on the other that I could look myself if I wanted to... Shes 7 and left crying because I had no clue what I was doing. very very disappointed in a day that should have been nothing more then smiles and happiness!
Read so many good reviews I went in with high expectations.  Alas, service was very slow, and the food was really nothing spectacular,  Not in a hurry to return.
Great deal if........All the games worked also a lot of outdated older machines made it disappointed. Need to step up game because food and games are better at Dave and Busters.Sorry Gameworks but thought I should know
I had enormous expectations for this place - with word of mouth and almost 5 star Yelp rating.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed on my first visit here.  I had the combo plate with 3 meats - burnt ends, ribs and pork belly.  I don't understand the allure of these burnt ends - most of mine were nearly inedible.  It's like reverse Russian roulette - 5 bad bites to each good bite.   The ribs were tasty, but not the best I've ever had.  The pork belly was scraps of dried out meat laced with chunks of fat - pork belly should never ever be dry.  For the sauces, I had the vinegar sauce - hey, it's just vinegar - what up with that?  The mustard sauce was delicious.  On the brighter side, the sweet potato fries were good as were the beans.Hype is scary, scary thing.
Extremely mediocre. Disappointing. The setting is a beautiful old farm house. Let's start with the positives. The Caeser salad is hands down one of the best in Toronto. Made fresh at your table. It was a classic dressing with the egg white, anchovies, mustard and garlic.  The garlic bread also was delicious and came out fresh, hot  and tasty. I had the rib eye and it arrived at the table warm. It was warm borderline cool. I mean come on guys. Who likes to eat a steak warm?  My guess is that they don't heat their plates in an oven like a Morton's or Ruth Chris. Also the travel time from the kitchen to table could be lengthy due to the size of the place (duh maybe use something to cover the plates). Also when the plates do reach the area of a table it can sit for a few minutes on a tray waiting for a server. The steak was pretty burnt out the outside and the inside was fine. It's a classic case of using to much heat. This IMHO a rookie mistake. I ended up only eating 1/2 because it simply wasn't any good. Service was extremely poor. Waiter made several mistakes on the order and had a stuck up attitude. Waiter was not attentive. Near the end of the meal we had to go look for our own milk and brown sugar because our waiter was nowhere to be found. The scary thing was the night we went was quiet. If our service and food was so poor on a slow night, can you even fathom a busy night?The reason I gave my rating two stars is because the steak was piss poor.  Also for a "fine dining" venue the service is a complete fail.
I came to McDonalds to try the Grand Big Mac.Frankly, it tastes like a bigger Big Mac. Sadly, it carried on with the burgers that tasted microwaved from a precooked batch. The fries were fresh and very good. Also, they make you order from a new Kiosk. I didn't care for that and needed help twice. They need to keep a worker ready to help those of us who appreciate old fashioned counter service. It just hurts to think I could go to Shake Shack for a couple bucks more and have an awesome experience.You and I both know McDonalds. Nothing new to report.
We used to enjoy coming here for weekend brunch. The latest visits we didn't have pleasant experiences for two reasons: 1)  Food was taking a REALLY long time to arrive. 2) This place does not have AC (which is fine as it's an old diner) but they should have extra fans running. It was so unbearably hot in there, I could not enjoy my meal. Food took 20+min to arrive. I was too nauseous from the heat to eat then. Don't think I will be returning
We scheduled an appointment for an estimate to replace 2 broken windows. They were on time. The 2 guys that showed up were extremely unprofessional.  I should not even have let them in the house. They looked like the company picked them up off the corner. No uniform no ID tags, sloppy looking. When I said they either need booties to go on the carpet or remove shoes, they weren't prepared. One had to return to truck for the booties, and the other removed shoes, no socks. While they were checking out the windows, their tools, the drill bits, were not organized and took some time to find the correct one even had to return to truck. I will not even consider them for any job that I have. I received another estimate from someone else, and the were  $220 less, and came dressed professionally.
Heist has very good beer. The only reason I gave them 2 stars. Went for a double date there over the weekend and the wait was a hour and 20 minutes. So we decided to wait and have a few beers before we were sat. (Wild Bois is my favorite.) We finally got sat and our server was okay. They were pretty busy so we were forgiving for the lengthy periods of not coming to our table. We ordered 4 appetizers to share..they all came out at different times. The wings arrived first and were ice cold. Next we received the fried macaroni and cheese balls but they had no flavor..though the sauce they serve with it on the side was good. 20 minutes later we received the pork belly tacos..the flavor was good but the pork was so dry it made it hard to chew. Lastly we had the edamame, no complaints there, they're pretty tasty! I'll return for a beer or two but definitely not for the food.
Just be aware that this management company will charge you extra on your move out bill. I used to love this place.... It was quiet, nice staff, and the apartment had a great view. I lived there for three years and recently moved out. I got a move out bill from them where they charged me for an extra day after I already moved out and returned the key...  They also charged me extra for a carpet cleaning and special treatment. When I called to ask about the two charges I was told the carpet company determined that the carpet needed it due to some light test and that in order for the 30 days to be filled I needed to be charged an extra day however my 30 days was already fulfilled because I gave them the notice on the first and that month has 30 days in it....
Stayed at LVH for a convention - it is Okay at best.  Room was clean, TV channel quality was poor and food was good.  Would only recommend if you want to stay close to the convention center.  Staff was friendly, but nothing stands out at this hotel except for the proximity to the convention center.  Must be why it is no longer a Hilton
The customer service kills the experience for this place. I am very understanding that people have a bad day but you are here to earn a paycheck and earn my tip so leave the negative "get out of my restaurant" attitude at home. Otherwise it's a nice looking place with good sushi. Normal sushi prices. You can buy chopsticks here and eat with them right away. I believe you can eat from an AYCE menu, and outside says it's conveyor belt sushi but I did not see such a thing inside, tho I did not go to the back. I would come again but the customer service experience was not one I want to go thru again.
While I like this Milestone's more than the John&Richmond location thanks to a neat first floor bar and cool bartenders, it still gives me the same though: "dude, there's got to be a better place to eat/chill/drink nearby, this is a busy spot". Hence, this is yet another, "we don't know what we want, so let's just choose the most standard spot nearby" kind of spot, and frankly Toronto has a few too many.If you want more details, check the reviews for the other Milestone's location, it is almost a clone.
I have been a Barro's consumer since 1990 in high school and have visited and become loyal to many locations throughout the valley since then.  I have to say I am extremely disappointed in this location, its management and staff.  I have ordered from here 4-5 times since they have opened.  Every time I request verbally over the phone for parmesan cheese and red peppers and guess what never arrives or I have to ask for again at in store pickup, yep cheese and peppers.  I understand that this is a small complaint as the food is always good but it is the small stuff that even when confronted to a manager they shrug off and say we will add to your account and blame the staff, this is not acceptable.  Again I can raddle off about 7 locations off the top of my head I eat or have eaten at for years and this is the only location that I can guarantee 100% before we order and request verbally we will never receive. There comes a point that where I either go back to make sure I go to a location I can get on the way home or drive back to or cut my ties in general.  I prefer none of the above and hope this location reads this, learns from it, and moves forward to make sure this does not continue to happen.
Note:  Limited Gourmet Food/Housewares section.  No furniture here. TJX (Winners, Marshalls, HomeSense) company has really seemed to have exploded downtown.  In every block, there seemed to be 1 of their stores.  However, I think something is happening where the company is really trying to make distinctions between all their brands.I used to like coming here, but last night, their upstairs Gourmet Food/Housewares section was a complete disappointment.  It looks as though they're trying to shrink those 2 sections and maybe put them more into HomeSense??  As someone with a retail background, this is just my theory.Soo much wasted space upstairs, near the windows.  Not a fan of this change as I think both those sections are good sellers!Honestly didn't check out the clothes or shoes because I don't need anything.
I had high hopes for this place based on the ambiance and decor of the inside. It was very pretty and had a great feel, I was impressed when I walked in. However, I ordered two California Rolls to-go and I was not impressed food wise. It look good in presentation, but it just wasn't the greatest sushi I've ever had. I wouldn't order it again. I'm willing to give them a second change, try something different on the menu, but as of right now I have experienced better.
Food was good. Not complaining about the tacos. They were good. Got the guacamole as an app. It was good too. We were convinced by the server to add beans, candied jalapeños, bacon and goat cheese. Sounds yummy, right? It was. Except we got 1 candied jalapeño. That's right 1 ring. For $.50.  Ok. 5 pieces of bacon for $1.00.  I'm talking bacon bits. Like you took a 1x1 inch piece of bacon and cut it into 5 pieces. And the $1.00 of goat cheese - maybe 1 teaspoon. Probably more like 1/2 teaspoon. Long story short, don't get the guac add ons. You'll be disappointed.
The Only good thing to eat here is their spam an eggs for breakfast an teriyaki cheeseburger and fries. For their shrimp tempura an jus my luck store brought and it was hard as a rock, their kalua pig and cabbage was sooooo salty I don't want to try anything else..
Reviewing for the Halloween event, bonnie screams. A little pricey at $25 dollars. It's not really scary at all. You'd think with all the money they're pulling in, it'd be a lot better.
So so place to go. I'm new to Huntersville and I picked a placed that was open and had good reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. I was in and out with a classic shellac mani and pedi within an hour, which always takes at least 1.5 hours anywhere else. The attention to detail is less than par. The colors you are allowed to choose from don't match the bottles they bring you. The customer service and personalities are dull. For the price, I won't be back... NOT WORTH IT!
Food is great. Service is the opposite. We went with no reservations. The hostess was rude and dismissive when we told her this. Let us know we can go to the bar which is fine, but a kinder attitude would have been appreciated. One of our meals never came and the forgot a drink too. No apologies and nothing done to correct it. If the food wasn't so good this review would have 0 stars. Shame too because the restaurant has a great atmosphere overall.
It has everything you need so it'll get stars but don't bother asking an employee to do a job he/she isn't assigned to always long lines while employees sit on computers because your need isn't their job so they figure they don't need to help. Always takes forever to get anything accomplished in here.
I just noticed this place popped up the other day and was interested to try. There are no good yogurt places in my area and I can't say that has changed after trying Yo Fresh.I only got a small amount of yogurt and with some fresh fruit and nuts and my fella got the same. Grand total you might ask? $9.13!?! Yikes. 39 cents an ounce adds up fast, I guess. I've never spent this much at any of the other Yogurt places around town unless I overloaded my cup with gummy bears and circus cookies. Too overpriced, not a lot of flavor options and not as many fresh ingredients as I would like. A lot of the toppings looked like they'd been picked over quite a bit and were either mooshy or messy looking. I probably won't be back.
Service was good. The place was clean, open, and inviting. I liked the decor a lot. However, the food was so basic. No flavour, no sauces were given with the spanokopita I purchased. They forgot to give me the bread it comes with. Got a side of rice and potatoes. All was underwhelming. Also, it's on the pricier side - cost me $16. Not going back.
I did get my money back via PalPay like I was promised but I'm still not happy with the way everything went down. If they get ride of the "cashless" system I may consider going next year.
I was really excited to try this new place since it's walking distance from home and there isn't a whole lot to choose from in the Tramonto community! I was sooo disappointed especially for the prices! My rice was chewy on the outside and crunchy in the middle. When I called and complained they didn't offer to refund my meal or even give me some sort of freebie or discount! For a new business I found this strange.They seem like the type of place that will close within the 1st year and re-open with a new name.
Best thing about this place - it was convenient to the shopping I needed to do at the Arboretum!Food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry.  Onion rings were awful - crunchy on the outside but mushy and wet (actually had onion "juice" or water run out after biting in to one) on the inside.Service was ok.  My only complaint is that the server left the check on the table before asking for dessert orders.  If it was a.) busy and b.) we appeared to be a business lunch (not likely - me and the parents) I would understand that move.  But the restaurant wasn't busy - worrysome at 12:30 pm on a Friday - and we obviously were not a business group.Thought it was overpriced too - almost $9 for a dry tasteless burger with a side of onion rings and $5 for a chocolate malt?  Would not rate it a great value.Fake 50's decor and kitsch - primary reasons for visiting here.  Need more really GOOD casual (not fast food) eateries near the Arboretum.
Went here after realizing that Kangchen is closed on Mondays, and was curious to try the "new" Indian restaurant for their lunch buffet.  Bottom line is that there's nothing new here that you won't find at any other buffet in town, and although it's a self-perpetuating problem, the lack of customers meant that the food was mostly sitting out rather than being refreshed and looked old and was not terribly warm.  So... is it bad?  No.  Would choose to go here for lunch buffet again?  No.
Went here on a Friday night, wasn't too packed that it was hard to move around or find a seat. Just the right amount of people! Didn't come for food, just some good ol'fashioned drinking which I found to be quite expensive. Typical stocked bar and nothing extra special on tap, unless your totally in love with Irish beers.In my opinion this place isn't anything special, especially being located on the square. Better off just bypassing.
My husband, mother, two young children, and myself ate here for lunch on Saturday. When we arrived, the restaurant was empty and nobody there to seat us. After waiting awhile I went in the back to see if we had accidentally gone in during a time when the restaurant was closed. The waiter I came across seemed annoyed that we were there, but he did seat us. I ordered the sashimi tuna salad. My mother ordered a Reuben, and my husband ordered the filet with crab. For being the only people in the restaurant it took nearly 30 min to get our food. Mine was inedible. The salad costs 16.95 and had 4 slices of cold seared tuna. The tuna tasted off to me and was slimy. The asparagus and peppers were from a jar. I took a few bites and stopped. Our server was obviously disinterested and instead of asking me how the salad was safe pretended not to notice until I said something to her. My mothers sandwich was mediocre. The bread was charred on the outside and there was only two slices of turkey on it. Her French fries were burned. She immediately asked the server for unburned fries and our server acted like she was unaware of the burned fries until my mother pointed it out. My husbands steak was cooked well and he said the crab on top tasted good. It was the best looking plate of the three. Overall we wouldn't recommend. The price is not worth the quality of food.
this is the place to go when you are low on change in your pockets and just looking to get full on mediocre food. buffet style food, nothing super spectacular. food is what you would expect, beans, rice, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, taquitos, tamales etc. salad bar was far from a salad bar, and decided to stay away from that area, did not look to appealing so dont think i missed out on anything there.they do have servers walking around to get you things you need once you are seated which is nice. the dessert was better than the actual food. So yes i got full here but dont think i will be craving this place anytime soon and begging to go back.
This place is hit or miss. It'll depends on who is in the kitchen, I think, and whether or not management feels like taking the job seriously.  I've had good meals here, and I've had really bad ones. I've had enough bad ones that I try not to go here unless there's no other choice.  I got a piece of fish once that you could drive a nail with. The Rubens are always stringy and it's impossible to take a bite out of the sandwich without dragging all the meat out in one big glob. And I don't think I've seen the same waitstaff here more than once. Big turnover. There's no pride in the service or the food at all.  This place is never been truly "good", things just seem to keep getting worse.
Very Disappointed! Not only was the bread somewhat stale, the crackers were past the expiration date.  Brought out the salad with no dressing on it or on the side.  The Shrimp/Vegetable pasta dish had a weird taste and way too much sauce and consisted most of Broccoli and mushrooms with about 6 Shrimp.  All for $24.00!! What a rip off.  Will not have dinner there again.  Way too expensive for the quality of food.
Ugh. For a restaurant to have won accolades as "Best Chinese Restaurant" from the Phoenix New Times, I expected way more from this place than what it offered. You walk in and you feel you're more in a sports bar/English pub than a Chinese restaurant. The hostess seats you and then you're not served for 10 minutes. Eventually a server comes by and takes your order. I got the hot & sour soup and the eggplant w/chicken. I then proceeded to wait for 15 minutes before the soup arrived. The waitress was a little frenzied when she brought the soup and then disappeared again before I could ask her for some hot sauce.  I flagged down a busser for it instead, and he seemed pretty annoyed that I asked him to do something beyond wiping off tabletops. The soup was decent but it wasn't nearly the best that I've had.I then waited another 15 minutes before got my entree. The eggplant tasted alright, but the ground chicken it was mixed with was downright disgusting. Smelled and tasted completely rotten. After four spoonfuls I decided I couldn't eat it anymore. But my waitress was nowhere to be found. I then spotted her from across the way and gave the "I'd like my check" hand signal. I then waited for 15 more minutes. I didn't see my waitress anywhere. I walked up to the hostess and ask for my check. She gave me my bill and asked if I want to pack the food for home, to which I declined. I pay and leave the place, and see that my waitress is hanging out at the bus stop. Apparently her shift was over and she was going home, but I was left sitting there at the booth with a plate of smelly ground chicken and a mood of anger something large.I'm really hoping this isn't the "best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix" because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it. If there aren't any excellent Chinese restaurants in Phoenix, then I'm going to forlorn. Very forlorn. And that's not a good thing.
We liked blue nile when it was here and based on these reviews, we were excited to try this new place. When I called in our order, I asked for the injera to be boxed separately, but the woman's English was so poor, she couldn't understand me. When we got there, we saw the cute ambiance was now horrible, the tables are pushed to the front with gathering areas in the back, a horrible highlighter yellow paint on the wall. Kenny G was playing. It's true it isn't expensive and portions are generous, but some of the spices were off. I loved the cabbage, potato, carrot side, but the dark red spicy lentils tasted medicinal. They wrapped everything up inside the injera so it was soggy by the time we got home. There was only one other roll of injera per box. We likely won't return.
If you like seafood that doesn't taste like anything, but costs lots, go here. I think people go here for a drink, to meet up, to hang out. I don't think anyone really goes here for the food. If you want great seafood, go two doors down to Aristotle Steak and Seafood...
Food was marginal at best, service was awful. Was expecting a decent meal, and got Airport-quality Chinese food.
The food is delicious here but be prepared for extreme crowds not being able to get through to place a to go order and a snotty bartender. We do take out to avoid the crowds but have had multiple issues with the phone sending us to voicemail making it so doordash or grubhub could not even get through to do a to go order. Then there was the time I put in a to go order to pick up myself and one of the bartenders informed me that if its been over an hour, they throw out your food and then have to remake it when you get there because the cold stuff sat out too long. Don't they have refridgerators that keep that cold stuff until its time for pick up. BTW they quoted me it would be ready in 15-20 min and I got there right at the 50 min mark for pick up, not over an hour.
Fancy Buca di Beppo
Date night disaster. Stale popcorn, very dirty theater and a hole in screen 12. Chatty child right behind us during the movie (Jurassic world) did not help. Why a child this age was at this particular movie is beyond me. Parents of toddlers: do everyone a favor and leave your children at home with a sitter if you can't keep them quiet during the movie! Also, seats too small.
I know this is a small family owned business, so I was reluctant to provide this low of a review. However, I have been there several times, and one server in particular is extremely rude. He is a short dude with plastic rimmed glasses and spiked up hair. I don't know his name, but here are some examples of what he has said or done:1) Starts taking away your food and wiping your table without asking you if you're done and there is visibly still food on the plate in an attempt to get you to pay your bill. Mind you, I am one of those ideal diners who is considerate when others are waiting and will eat my meal reasonably fast.  I know they are trying to get people in and out.2) Throws sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle attitude at you.3) Disciplined my brother (who has special needs) for occasionally kicking the bottom of the bench.Food is decent, but because of this one server, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.  I pay good money to have a decent dining experience, not to have some stranger throw attitude at me and my family.   I hope the owners read this review and take into consideration that your employee needs some lessons on how to interact with other human beings.
Bland. Tiny portions especially the sides for $4.50. The guy couldn't remember our order for the life of him and made the smallest salad and gave me the smallest amount of kale salad. The prices for the smoothies aren't posted on the board either. One side, one salad, one iced tea and a smoothie came out to be $21 and we were both hungry afterwards. Eat elsewhere !
Definitely a nice space. Open. Well appointed. Tried it for lunch. Two of sat at bar. Crowded but we got there at 12:30 after the rush. Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. Beer came. Very short pour.  When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left. Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back. Nice, but seems pretentious, over priced and under managed.
They have interesting and quality fitness gear, that's for sure. But they need obviously more "hot or not" staff. The guys there yesterday were more interested in two hot girls, and not in the tiny geek who wanted more info on fitting small running shoes. Basically, I was told "yeah, wear thick socks or go to New Balance".  I went to Running Room TO GET HELP BECAUSE I HAVE SMALL FEET, and people who are supposedly experienced tell me to go somewhere else? I will, I am sure. TL;DR: I wear size 5-ish, they hate me.
I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars.
I'm not a fan of a company that leaves the flowers at a neighbors house and leaves a sign on the door to go 5 doors down. We never got the flowers....
I frequently come here for my coffee and a bagel. I've also had a couple of their sandwiches but I am not a big fan. They are usually too oily, too bland. The only thing I would get on occasion is the Thai Chicken Salad, but it's quite pricey for what you actually get.This particular store is so close to my home and that is the only reason for me to come back. Staff is very unfriendly and so terribly slow. Also, I have ordered bagels for meetings and they couldn't be bothered putting them in smaller paper bags, but threw 30 bagels in one big giant bag and threw the cream-cheese on top of it. I had to stop somewhere else to buy a couple of paper plates so it wouldn't look too bad at the meeting. I've recently asked if I could have 10 paper cups for coffee (while buying 30-40 bagels plus cream cheese) and it was not an option at all. Very poor service.
Ordered pad Thai and it wasn't very good, it didn't seem fresh. We ordered chicken but tofu was mixed in as well. I'd be willing to try other dishes here but will not be getting pad Thai from here again. A little disappointing.
Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, disappointing food. I had the salmon, which was well well done (they didn't ask for a temp). Came with 4 beet chunks and a spoonful of parsnip purée. Way under seasoned, and no salt on the table. Other entrees were also meh, with the exception of the steak melt sandwich, which got rave reviews from my slightly drunk gma. Server was excellent, but the kitchen just wasn't on their game.
Ridiculously expensive bagels (7$ for a bagel? Come on!), but if you forget about the price and the fact that for that price they are extremely small, these bagels taste good. Let's face it: just across the border, bagels are bigger, tastier and MUCH cheaper, esp. taking into account the current exchange rate.And it's cash only. Very bad.
115 for 1st offenders... Talking and driving. Good thing it wasn't me LOLOH just a heads up. The law enforcement people near the x-ray area are not very nice people
Mediocre.We came here to see Darrell (who was the manager at the King West location...has since moved to the York Street location) he always makes the dining experience exceptional. Sadly he was not in... maybe he would have saved the evening!On to dinner: The server was relatively quick on the drink orders. And because we were regulars we know our orders relatively quickly. No real connection was made...but Melanie did her job well enough off the hop. I did have to ask another server to send her our way. And the couple next to us who arrived prior to us received their mains as we left. I over heard them say "well I guess we have nothing else to do tonight" My food: quite lacking! Sadly. I only ordered the tuna tartar (my usual). The fried wontons were cold and stale. I told our server who said a manager would bring out the replacement...I'd imagine to do a table touch...this didn't happen. One of the line cooks did. Fine. There was a visible difference in appearance between the two. Obviously the first set were older/possibly refrigerated. I was satisfied with the replacement wontons. THEN I BIT INTO THE HARD BIT OF THE END OF AN AVOCADO! like the stem circle bit. I didn't even complain about it. I just quit eating. My husband said the filet mignon was good. Standard keg.
Came for the first time for a friends's bachelorette party and I'm slightly disappointed. I've heard nothing but good things about arrogant, but as of right now I don't really see what the hype is about.Spent 9$ on a drink (the pink drink) that could have fit in a shot glass. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, didn't even seem like it had alcohol it it.And too top it all off there is a total of ONE vegetarian entree. I get that they're called the arrogant butcher, but come on...At least I can say the service was good.
Skip this place. I don't know what it is about it that rubbed me wrong - maybe the sausage fest of douchey looking guys and ridiculously watered down drinks - but this place is one to skip. The music was decent but really the crowd was hella sketchy.
Eaten here twice. Always gotta give a place a second chance. Both times I have been underwhelmed, especially after receiving such favourable reviews both on yelp and by friends. The meals are average quality with somewhat stale ingredients. The biggest kicker for me is it is relatively expensive for the underwhelming food. Don't get me wrong nothing wrong with value and I can appreciate a place that charges according to what they serve. This place needs to re-evaluate somewhat.
When Tzatziki first opened service was amazing and the portions were huge. After a few months, the portion sizes shrunk dramatically and the service declined.I went in for takeout and it wasn't busy in the restaurant. I stood in front of the cash for 10 minutes and I was never greeted by any staff. The older woman that works there looked at me and then ignored me. I stood there for 10 minutes and then waited around another 5 minutes before I gave up and left.The food is average but nothing special. I've seen many people with frustrated faces as I've walked by many times. Expect bad service if you're going to eat here.
The food is decent but the servers are not personable and there is not rhyme or reason for a theme to the place. It's kind of a strange atmosphere.  It looks very clinical from the outside. I wish there was something to draw me to it more.
The restaurant seemed a little dirty to me but bathrooms were clean.  Service was ok. The food just wasn't good.  Although I do have to say my sister liked her enchiladas.  My daughter and I felt sick later in the day. Don't think we'll be back.   Especially since there's a new Mexican restaurant in Avondale I really like.
everyone is blinded by the tofu, for a place that is considered "the best chinese food place is uiuc area" I wondered: "would it be possible to have crummy dishes?" When I went my first (and only) time to this place. I ordered meatless udon pan-fried noodles w/mushrooms and Satay tofu. When I ordered I assumed "what could go wrong?", everyone has had good things to say about this shack; so anything/everything should be good.. Well, let me tell you...I was Wrong!The pan fried noodles were at most sauteed, but definitely not pan fried; for they were slimy and were practically tasteless (besides the stinky mushrooms that shaped the horrid taste-- and to think i thought i loved mushrooms) The satay tofu was bland and mainly tasted like an orifice or a dirty mouth (it had such a weird/nasty taste to it). The only way I could barely eat half of what I ordered was by drowning it in Eel Sauce I had in my refrigerator.Maybe this is my fault from ordering from the translated menu? Maybe it's my fault for being an American? All i know is that, if that is what authentic chinese food tastes like thheeen...WT eff??? THEN I will gladly stick with the American aspect of chinese food, because I totally wasted $20 (on a bulk load of crap)...It was really bad, possibly some of the worst food I ever had in my life (and it's not like I ordered pig tongue! I ordered totally basic items!). All i know is that it's pretty sad when the only good thing i had in my order was the steamed white rice.After this experience I  really hope I just managed to order the two crappiest dishes from this place; if not, that was a sad excuse for food and I was a sure sucker for paying $20 for it.
Shot the M4 here, my first full-auto. They explained everything thoroughly; the store and range area were clean and well maintained. My complaint is that the firearm kept jamming, so I wasn't able to dish out as many rounds at once as I wanted to. I followed all of the instructions, and yet the M4 still jammed four times in one magazine; the range instructor could not determine the problem, but whenever it jammed he just cleared it and handed it back to me. I came here to shoot full-auto, and I could have done semi-auto in Canada, where I'm from. As a result, this was a waste of my money. They should have compensated me, or at least given me a different firearm after it jammed the first or second time.
Make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when Papa Johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to Johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between HERE & THERE added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a CASH tip too.... I finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  Papa Johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm NO..... a 5 year customer has been LOST ....and Hungry Howies has gained a NEW customer !
$20.00 for burger, soda, and fries? - mm no! - it was not that good! I don't mind to pay more if food is amazing. But all things considered, not worth it. Disappointed.
If you are just looking for entertainment and don't care about food, prices, and overall quality, this is your place.  Food portions are tiny, plain tasting, and way over priced. But at least you have a guy that looks like Jesus with costume make-up singing to you.
Food is good but portions size is vwry small i asked for salad and kabobs but the salad was a mini quater plate for 13 its really a small portion but yes the kabobs were fresh
2.25 starsfrom the outside this place looks ghetto... especially since there is a 168 attached to it ... some sort of ghetto pool hall downstairs with wanksters and a tiny convenient store to the right...  its located upstairs inbetween both of these places... once up the stairs,  its not as bad as i thought it would be..  service was poor, the tea throughout my stay remained empty.  i saw endless amount of people try to pour tea but was never refilled.  luckily i sat next to all the food.. i saw when the "good stuff" came out.. such as lobster.. but guess what.. it rarely ever gets filled and they put the nastiest garbage pieces.. im talking pure shell and no meat pieces at all.. no exaggeration.. they put the head and just shells... i dont know if that is because people want the flavor for their broth .. or people like to eat boiled lobster shells... maybe its just for looks.all the meats were really frozen to the point its in one big clump.  and i see this old guy who keeps bringing things to the back.. and bringing it back out with maybe one or two more items added to the bin.. which makes me think they are recycling the food..   wilted vegetables.. and they kept advertising icecream all over the walls and flyers.. but guess what.. NO ICECREAM.. in fact no dessert.. only dessert you will get is a sour orange if you want.i had to chase for service... beef had 0 fat .... 0% marbling.. therefore it was chewy.. stick to the lamb.  18.99 on reg day dinners and extra 2 dollars for weekend ... i rather go sushi ayce
I was not impressed.  I have to wonder how their food was deemed to be one of the best burgers in Toronto.  The bun was fresh but way too much bread for a burger. I didn't find the list of toppings to stray too far from any other burger place.  I had the hand made onion rings.  Awful with way too much batter on the onions.  In a few rings the batter was three times the thickness of the onion.  The chocolate milkshake was decent but not epic like Mr. Greenjeans (a la Eaton's Center).  I left feeling very under whelmed especially given the price which is similar to Five Guys.
Stopped in while walking though the Junction recently, but I can't say that I was impressed. I had a cappuccino and a scone, and can only say they were okay. Unfortunately, okay is not good enough for the cost of $7. There were quite a few people there, both inside and on the patio where I sat, so others must like it. But then I'm not really a fancy coffee person, regular coffee with a donut is more my style.
It has been awhile since I was here last and the place has changed for the worse. The rolls are good but the rest was not good. I ordered chicken parmigiana. It was just fair. The risotto was inedible. The rice was so over cooked you couldn't tell there was rice in it. It was all mushy. My wife got a steak and it was so undercooked we had to send it back. The salad had sugared almonds that had way too much sugar on them. The food took more than 30 minutes to come out. I won't  be back.
Their are two older women that work the deli at times they always seem to be having a bad day
I ate here a couple weekends ago while staying at HR, and had heard lots of good stuff about it. Maybe Im weird... but this place was awful.Soup was cold, tacos were soggy, hot sauce was watery. Gross.Even the coffee was shit.The service was horrible too.. Waitress was slow, forgot a bunch of stuff, never brought us silverware, or refilled water.I didnt have any alcohol here, but the food was shit, and I wont go back. I'd rather wait in a line for something else.
Be careful if you have food allergies. My food allergies were clearly stated to the staff, and they still served me a salad containing my allergens. The manager was nice and offered to refund me, but it doesn't fix the fact that I now am having an allergic reaction because of their lack of care. I'll never be back, and I hope others with food allergies never have to deal with this.
I've been to this business several times, food and service was always good. Tonight was no exception. I ordered the lobster mac which had a really good taste. But as i was wrapping up i mentioned to the bartender that it didn't really seem to have the lobster there, only in one bite. I was sort of given a cold shoulder about this. Which was weird, i didn't ask for a manager or a comp. Just let him know what i thought which is why i gave them 2 stars. Always address a concern no matter how big or small. I also noticed the gentleman next to me consumed less than half of his large plate and declined to take a bag with him but didn't voice any concern so i did when i thought it was questionable. However the glass of wine and cocktail was Great. I'll definitely go back.
At first sight this is a great dealership. However, after you have discussed a plan to buy a new car and you think all is going to be great... it's not. I decided to not buy that day. Give myself a few days to think. When I called to schedule an appointment to buy the car they told me they did the math wrong. They can't give me the car for the price discussed. Needless to say I didn't buy the car and they could care less that they lost a customer. It was a very disappointing experience.
I was in Toronto for a concert with my mother and a few girl friends, and we desperately wanted a nice lake front patio with some seafood.Pier 4 seemed to be the only place that fit the bill, so we ventured inside.   To get to the patio you have to walk through kitschy, dank smelling pirate and ocean knickknacks.   I would not want to eat inside, it smelled terrible.The patio was lovely, and the server although a bit strange, was polite and did his job with relative aptitude.Why anyone wouldn't order seafood at a seafood place is just ridiculous, so of course I ordered the catch of the day - and it was delicious, not memorable, but a good bite to eat,   My friend ordered crab cakes, and they were mediocre.Overall, the patio was exactly what I wanted, but the food was nothing special.
My OG Ryan B and I had a date for a little foodie crawl and we decided to check out 28GO, we arrived and were disappointed to find out that they were closed until later in the week. Thwarted, we decided to head across town, during rush hour no less to check out another spot he had been wanting to check out in Chinatown. We walked in and I was already not feeling it. The theme is cute, but not executed as well as it could be. The atmosphere just left a lot to be desired, so I was having misgivings before I even ordered. Looking at the menu, nothing really sparked much interest in me, so I decided to order the spicy Tom yum with udon and tofu, thinking it was a relatively safe bet. Ryan B ordered the beef fried rice and a tempura appetizer. Our meals came out and there was an odd smell emanating from the bowl. Almost a little dirty smelling?I let it sit for a while so I could build up enough courage to take a bite. I kept trying and trying and even took two bites before I totally gave up. The flavor and smell were so off. I'm not one to send food back, so I was reluctant to do it. I finally decided to let them know that I really didn't like my dish and asked our waitress to return it to the kitchen. Our server was very kind and apologetic, quickly removed the dish and told me she would remove it from our check. I really appreciated the service and how friendly they were about it. I really didn't want to send my dish back, so I was glad that they weren't too offended. While I watched Ryan eat, I tried a piece of the tempura had ordered and it wasn't great. A little over battered and seemed like the frozen kind you buy prepackaged at the store. Just not fresh and lacked flavor. He seemed to enjoy his fried rice. The only saving grace for this restaurant was the friendly service, but I won't be back.
We were looking for a good steakhouse, came here based on reviews. They were out of the filet  we ordered rib eye.. It was OK but definitely not worth the price. Won't be coming back or recommending.
I have just been to this Irish Pub with 3 friends for breakfast and it was an underwhelming experience. The server was slow and forgot parts of our order which meant one of us was waiting while the others were eating.The food:Eggs ordered over easy were cracked with the yolk leakingHash browns were mixed with overpowering onion'Irish' sausages were unimpressive (here's a tip Murphy's Law, buy your bangers from Sprouts)Perhaps it's because it's a new business but the basics of a decent breakfast shouldn't be that hard to master. I actually like the look and feel of the bar and will probably be back for a few pints and a Shepherds Pie but I would suggest you go elsewhere for breakfast .
Will I go again? Nope.Wish I'd taken advantage of the Summerliciois menu so I wouldn't be out $100 from my pocket.Order: lobster octopus salad: mayo much?Black scabbered (white fish with black speckles- I probably ordered it for the weird factor) with saffron pea risotto- seriously making rice yellow is not the art of risotto. Appropriately creamy, but totally tasteless like the fish.Chocolate mousse- too decadent, nearly cake like. Loved the ambience, white linens, attentiveness. But if I wanted a memorable Portuguese fresh seafood dinner, this was not the place.
Nice people. Very friendly.  Provided some free garlic sticks while I waited for my pizza.  I took advantage of some website coupon deal to get a large pepperoni pizza for around $10 (dine in only).    While the pizza was worth $10, I would've felt a little ripped off had I paid the normal price (closer to $18 I believe).  The dough is very good (which is supposedly what they are known for), but the sauce, cheese and pepperoni toppings -- I found them all to be similar to what you would get from a made fresh  pizza you get at a grocery store or one of the wholesale club places.  While there is no such thing as bad pizza, there is pizza that is just "so-so" such that I don't really have any desire to go back and order it again on a regular basis.  Such is the case here.
My husband and I just moved to the area and were scouting out a new vet.  Our first visit here happened when our dog got a decent sized cut on his chin.  Our neighbors suggested the SHAH over the Castle Shannon VCA simply because the VCA charges double of everywhere else.The building is older so it appears dirty and dated, but it wasn't bad at all.  The staff seemed friendly and attentive while we were in the waiting room, which wasn't long b/c we were the only people there.  We were escorted back to a room, and the vet came in shortly.  She barely looked at his face before telling me she was going to clean it with hydrogen peroxide.  On more than one occasion, I have been told that HP is too abrasive for pets, so I voiced my concern and explained we've been keeping it clean with saline.  She kind of shrugged her shoulders and said she's been using HP for 40 years and has never had a problem.  Before I could regain my composure from her shrug-off, she had produced a syringe, went into a schpeal about getting him dewormed (to which I explained he didn't have worms.  She said, "Well, he can get them when he goes outside and eats grass and dirt" to which I explained that he doesn't eat grass and dirt), and before I could ask what she was giving him (I thought she was trying to give him a deworming shot!), she gave him a shot and walked out.  I was dumbfounded. I stood around for a little bit before someone stuck their head in the door and said that we were done and could come pay.  I walked out to the counter were they gave me antibiotics (that they didn't explain how to administer), and I had to read through his discharge papers to find out what kind of shot she had given him.  The vet had AWFUL bedside manner, especially for a new patient, and didn't take the time to get to know my dog and his medical history.Needless to say, we're still looking for a vet.
Came here on a Sunday expecting to have a decent breakfast. Twice baked croissant was soggy and texture was not right. Espresso drinks were not hot and there was a bunch of sweet syrupy stuff in the bottom of the cup that left a bad aftertaste in the mouth and throat. Waitress couldn't find our table since we sat outside and food never came. I expected more from the uptown Amelie's. I've been to all there locations and enjoyed the noda spot the most, however I think it's time to stop frequenting this chain. Still liking mama's in pineville for good coffee and sandwiches.
Went there for the first time for happy hour , we live in the neighborhood, ordered the shrimp cocktail, very overcooked shrimp, hard as a rock, ordered the pork sliders, they were okay, ordered the kettle chips thinking they were home made, they ripped open a bag of chips threw some pieces of pork on there and threw barbecue sauce and there you have, it we will never go back there, very disappointed!
Went to the Salty Senorita for after dinner drinks.  I was with my wife and a friend. We waited for about 10 minutes for a waitress and decided to order our drinks from the bartender. The drinks were great. Excellent Margaritas. Waitress did finally come by and asked if we wanted food and we declined. Never saw her again. We did end up having to go back to the bartender for another round. It leaves no imagination as to why there were so many empty tables there on a Saturday evening. I guess everyone else knew what I no know. You go there for the drinks and you will not be disappointed as long as you do not expect much service. I'll bet the waitress doesn't understand why her tips are so low!
First of all, after waiting almost 20 minutes, I had to leave my table to ask for a glass of water. I ordered crab fried rice with no egg extra garlic. I also explained, I have a allergy to egg. When the plate arrived, it had lots of egg. I explained to Ann, the order was incorrect. Ann was so unbelievably rude. She tried to convince me that the egg needed to be in the plate even after I explained for the second time, I have an allergy to egg. Even after correcting my order, I waited  20 minutes after I was done eating for  the check  to arrive to my table.  Not once did they come by to pick up my plates so I just put it in the table next to me. Jump is the name of another employee there and honestly he was very professional and apologized then tried to encourage  me to come back. Unfortunately, first time impressions last forever and I will never come back. Becomes of the nice guy named Jump I  gave a two star instead of one.
The only good things about this place are the atmosphere and the bartenders. They've got some cool, friendly bartenders. My food is always wrong, undercooked, or incredibly slow. How does that happen every time?
We got take out from here the other day and wAs not impressed at all. The chicken was so dry it was inedible. Green beans had a weird flavor and were mushy. Rice had no flavor. It was around 5:30pm, so I hate to see what the late diners were served. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my husband liked the empanadas. Won't be back.
The girl who did my gellac was really rude. My nail had broken just the day before, you could still see the blood. When she applied the solution it hurt like crazy,  I told her this she gave me the dirtiest look as if I had inconvenienced her a big deal. She said ' There  is no other way to do it' Her colleague suggested to use a lot of oil and it was perfectly fine with that. The second I got my coffee it was cold and undrinkable. I felt really uncomfortable around her. Even though its right around the corner for me, I wouldn't go here again.
had a groupon for this place and came here for lunch with my parents.. MISTAKE LOL I guess it was for lunch so it was ok but this is definitely a party bar and so i should have expected the food to not be on par....The portions are huge but everything was too salty - we ordered some type of pasta dish i dont even remember. Even their coffee which was was suppose to hawaiian authentic was watered down according to my parents. yeah i wouldn't go here for food - just for drinks which was buy one get one free with the yelp check in deal. That is the only thing worth it!
They do have some excellent sandwiches, soup and bakery goods.  This particular location always seems to have problems.  Today there was no ice in the ice machine.  It's often hard to find a table that is clean.  Sometimes the turkey sandwich is excellent and other times it's made with thick, tough grizzled hunks of nasty turkey.  Other times it's very nice, thinly sliced turkey breast.  If you go here after 2:00 PM this location often they are out of the main sandwiches on the menu day after day. Maybe the other locations are better.  I don't know.
The ambiance is sophisticated and upscale. Exactly what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton "luxurious bar". The macaroons are very good and the presentation is aesthetically pleasing. However, the drinks are way too strong. I am not a fan of the over poured alcohol  taste, and the prices were too high. I was a fan of the punch, but I just couldn't justify paying $40+ for a punch pitcher. If you enjoy strong alcoholic beverages then you may enjoy this place. As for me, I'll have to pass.
Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food.
Came here for the "best Long Island in town". Turns out it's not. They use a store bought mix for starters. Apparently they've never heard of mixing a real drink. They also used way too much sweet n sour. Tldr: Store bought mix. Too much sweet n sour.
Good service. Good burgers. Crap fries (Susie Q) and overpriced, non-refill pop. Good if you have a few drinks in you already, but otherwise I spent the time waiting for my food noting the dust and grime build-up. Bathrooms are very clean!
My husband and I went to StripSteak during a a recent visit to Las Vegas.Being a fan of Michael Mina, I was very surprised by this experience.  It felt like a TGIFriday!  The waitstaff appeared to have been on roller skates, given the amount of time they spent with us.  They appeared to always be looking around to see what else was happening while trying to take our order.  And when we asked for the sommelier to make a wine selection, he was there and gone before I looked up from the wine list....  Will not go back.
I gave this place 2 stars only because the server was really nice. Other then that i wouldn't recommend it. They have an all you can eat which the price is great but it speaks for itself. The all you can eat didn't have a lot to choose from. My son ordered an order of chicken wings they had on the all you can eat menu and they were burnt. Also asked for no cucumbers for my niece and they never got the order right.
We waited for seats for twenty minutes at which point they started shutting down tables. We asked what was going on and were given a song and a dance about how that section was being shut down. Eventually they told us that the bathroom was broken and they were closing but that we were welcome to take our expensive hot chocolate to go. Waiting for a purpose is fine, waiting for no reason is not. I usually don't give two stars without multiple trips, but this was a little too absurd to not comment. Based on others reviews, it sounds like management has a huge customer service issue to address with their staff.
2.5 but I rounded down.This is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.I'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.Food is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses.
Have visited Port City on a number of occasions.  Each being hit or miss.  Here is a multi-million dollar property, with the potential to be a outstanding lake side restaurant.  Each visit has been tainted by incredibly poor attention to detail, either by the Wait staff or the food itself.  The price structure is one you may expect to pay while enjoying the view on the lake, but honestly the food never reaches those price points in dining.  Each time we have visited we have had to introduce ourselves to the waiter or waiter.  Each time asking to know what the specials are.  Our last visit was at lunch time.  We ordered the Baked brie to start.  It was serve uncooked on a small platter with a small(maybe 6 Pepperidge Farm Crackers).  On the plate the fruit compote was actually some type of fruit jam.  As we scrapped the hardened Brie from the dried crust we asked for some more crackers or maybe a smidge of warm bread-our waitress sorry "got no mor" and walked away.  Next to the Club sandwiches we asked them to be serve with their special potato salad side. Special indeed, the potatoes were not completely cooked and the only seasoning to the flavor was the watery mayonnaise they happened to brushed over the rock hard potatoes.  The Club consisted of cheap deli meat, nothing fresh or even high end attempts were made at the meat.  The sandwich had been thoroughly and completely dipped in some type of oil and fried on the grill. So much so the we had to ask for additional napkins to keep up with the removal of the oil from our hands. After a few small greasy bites we asked for our check. Our Waitress whom we had flagged down by standing up, came up and said "didn't like it much" we said no and she took or credit card for payment.  By the way never had a refill on any beverages.  We figured her time was better well spent talking with the guys working near the bar outside, since this appear to be where she spent most of her time.  I wish them well at Port City. Just not at my expense.
Ok so, I've been here once when it wasn't a "concert night". The dancing was ok, but there was zero etiquette controlled by the security so people had drinks & didn't know how to not bump into others. Tonight, (4/29) when there was a concert here... the fact that they were clearly understaffed to handle the cleaning, is ridiculous. There tables that had 10-12 empty beer bottles, plus cups and shot shooters. No one cleaning, no one as a server, etc. if you're going to have a concert night, have it maintained. Make it WORTH the $20 cover charge to get in. $20 to a) not dance because the floor isn't controlled b) barely drink because people don't know where to go c) not have a place to drink because the tables are disgusting - is awful. How dare you be a country bar to host a country artist and be as disgusting and unprofessional as you are. Be the country bar that maintains the expectations and look of that bar. Be a country bar people want to go to and stay at! The bar service is not only terrible but consistently messy!!!!! Hire bar backs! Hire servers or people who can buss your establishment! It shouldn't take 10 min to get a drink at the bar!!!
We're a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there's about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107°. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the "reserved" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, "oh, you want more?" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole.I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience.UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven't heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn't change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.
What is the big fuss over this place??? It was below average! I ordered the Ribeye steak dinner and it was awful. I requested medium well, I received a charred steak hard as a rock. The green beans were undercooked and had absolutely no flavor. The place is understaffed, the waiter was so behind he didn't even check on us once. The ambiance is average, a hybrid of Applebees and T.G.I.F totally not worth the fuss. The Food is no better than eating at an IHOP
Not to our liking. It took 20 minutes for them to make a Boba smoothie and it wasn't really good. Had a funny taste to it.
This review is for the casino only.It is a very sad place with very sad drinks.We saw tweakers with the face scabs darting around (yes, IN the casino) and heroin addicts nodding out at the slots. Gave the place the feeling of scuzzy and unsafe.There was a live "band" playing of two guys who were amazingly talented singers singing some of the worst cover classic rock cover songs from the '70s one could cover and they were loud. I hope those guys have other gigs because they were good on guitar and voice. Also other gigs might keep them from playing these horrible covers.We spent two hours on blackjack, and the server and dealer were nice and pleasant. For the addicts running around the bathrooms were clean too. I would hope to never come back here again tho.
Walked in @6:20 and was told they were closed. Says they are open until 7 on the door. Probably won't be back due to inaccurate hours posted.
In the last year I have noticed a lot of mediocre brands.  They only give you around $1 even for items from Gymboree and the Gap so they do make a fair share off of your items which could explain the large supply of Carter's brands etc last time I was in.  If I wanted cheaper brands I would just pay a little more and buy them new.  I also noticed a lot of clothes with flaws, stains, name written in coats, and even melted candy in the jeans pockets.  I don't know who looks at these clothes but they need a better eye.  No matter what brand or price people want Clean...
Isn't it BAD ENOUGH that we poor citizens of coastal California SUFFER the indignities of an onslaught of ZONIES from Arizona every summer? They drive slow like old ladies, are endlessly confused about traffic, and gobble up precious beach parking spaces that should otherwise go to tax-paying San Diego residents! I won't even get started on their white, gross bodies. What else does that desert hell have to offer us here? The manufacturer and management of RED LIGHT CAMERAS! Yes, that is right, ATS is the ARIZONA company that runs the City of San Diego's Red Light Camera show! Another SLAP IN THE FACE  to San Diego FROM Cactus-ville!The City of San Diego Traffic website states: "To adequately enforce traffic signal laws, we use red light photo enforcement. Police officers cannot be everywhere at once." The City strategically mentions this also: "The (Red Light Photo System) RLPS system is a technology that records serious traffic violations the moment they occur. Cameras are used to photograph only vehicles that run red lights in targeted areas. Officers then review the film and a traffic citation is then issued to the vehicles' registered owner through the mail." Now I have been to Traffic Court trying to get out a ticket (not Red Light) and I have seen the anger and rage that these Red Light tickets bring out in otherwise normal people. In fact, most of the cases that I witnessed in Traffic Court were offenses related to camera tickets. They are very controversial. Most of the thugs that live at my apartment complex simply take off (or cover up) their front license plates to remove the threat of a photo ticket. Why? The cost of the citation in San Diego varies, based on your driving record. Citations for running a red light are a minimum of $480. They are a hassle to fight and some require the services of a lawyer-another negative point against ATS!I offer only 2 YELP STARS for this program because, although the intentions are honorable, (to prevent traffic accidents) there are still too many problems and questions still associated with this program. I am all for doing things to stop bad drivers from causing accidents but a lot of them manage to slip through the system.  ATS is just another Arizona scam to come out of the Great State of Hotter than Hell to bite San Diegans on their (toned & tanned) rears!
UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt.  Theirs is soggy.  I first went in during the evening.  This time I went in at lunch time.  There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  This is where they are falling down.  Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.=====================================================================It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  It is very nice inside.  The seating is comfortable and well decorated. However, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  Pretty standard.  Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  I took it back and asked for a re-do.  The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop.
This was our second time staying at South Point and I don't think I will be going back.  How is this hotel a 4 star hotel?  The rooms are big, but the beds are uncomfortable.  The bathroom is nothing spectacular and the wall behind the bathroom door was dirty all four nights we stayed.   I also wish the rooms had a mini-fridge.  We asked for extra pillows two nights in a row and they said they were out. Really?  The guy at the front desk was a complete jerk when we checked in and seemed completely indifferent to us.  I wasn't aware that the pool was closed for remodel and I called down to the front desk to find out the pool hours and the man on the phone was completely rude.  I don't know if it was the same one that checked us in.  He didn't tell me when the pool would be opening up again, which turned out to be the next day.  Thanks!  Having been there last year, I am pretty sure they didn't remodel any part of the pool area...and the water is not heated. Next time I will spend a little more money and stay in a real 4 star hotel.
I have been here twice and both times I had a good time. The atmosphere of this place really sets the mood for a laid back time. But every time I have had food her it blows. There is just nothing special about it that draws me back. To me this place is more of a place to get tootie-fruity drinks and some dip. Then it would be for an actual meal. It's almost like an upscale TGIF with bad food. The waiters that helped us were quite helpful and were prompt. The place is clean and I had a good time. There food is just not my thing I guess.
Not too impressed. Unless you're a tourist...it's not really worth the time and money.
Atmosphere was great and people were nice, but those were the only things I enjoyed. The staff was very unprofessional. They bickered with each other, the manager complained frequently about no-shows, and the bartender talked my ear off about strip clubs. The bartenders also had disgusting habits that lead to contamination, such as coughing on their hands before grabbing the rim of my drink and putting tickets on top of glasses. The food was subpar for the price. I ordered the club, which comes with a chicken breast on it. The chicken was fully cooked, but very cold...this was at 11AM so it had to have been cooked the night before and put in the fridge.I will not be returning to this place...I don't want to get sick.
Still looking for a reasonably priced, good fish and chips place.  I went here yesterday and was somewhat disappointed.  I ordered enough food for my family of 4 and this is what I can say about this place -- service was efficient and friendly.  Food was so-so:  Chicken fingers were good.  Fish was pressed, square processed fish junk; not very tasty or good.  Fries were soggy but onion rings were good.  Cole slaw was good.  Their "special sauce" is not good at all -- they really need to add catsup and some tartar sauce options for their customers.
Been there a couple of times for lunch. Terrible!1. Do not order any item containing meat, it tasted funny the 2 times I had any dish containing meat (I get goosebumps just remembering the taste, yeah, yuck).2. Not real pho, the owners are Chinese, not Vietnamese.3. Bad service and bad taste for decoration.
I decided to give El Chino a rest and tumbled across the street to Evan'sThis was...interesting.I ordered through eat24 at a quarter to 12. I enter around 12. Ghost town. Finally Evan himself appears and assures me food is coming. Cool.I chill at the bar watching a few people mill around in the kitchen. Mind you, I ordered a Po Boy. So that's not a lot of prep time, right? Another 15 minutes tick by. Someone utilizes the bar.Eventually I'm handed my meal and I skedaddle. So the meal. It was fine. Just a hair under below average. Everything was fresh, thankfully. But the fries weren't the best and the shrimp were just fine. Overall not a super experience.I'm really hoping to change my opinion so I will be returning.
Let's give you the run down. It's $10 a person at the gate. Children 12 & under are free. Once inside nothing's free except a beefed up presence from the chandler mafia, police-same thing. There's a few Booths to look for trinkets but mostly food trucks and booths. The lines for the food are ridiculously long. The angry crab booth easily had 100+ people waiting. We grabbed 2 corn dogs and 2 Lemonades for $26.... Then I snagged a catfish poor boy fro another $10. Refills are ONLY $3, well that's exciting ..... There's some knockoff band playing. They sound pretty decent. The kids zone has 4 attractions and it cost $10 for all day ride bracelet. There's hardly any actual seating and being that's it's nice and warm today everyone is hogging the shade which means no where to sit and eat. I think this festival could use a little more planning before it would be worth waisting so much money at.
I always think of Mickies as a must-go place when I am in town, but this time around, I questioned why that is the case.  The food was decidedly mediocre, not cheap and the wait was interminable.  My companion's omelet, ordered with pepperjack cheese, was served with cheddar sprinkled on top.  My mushroom and swiss omelet almost certainly was made with slimy canned mushrooms.  The fried cheese curds - which my every visit to Madison must include - were forgettable, sadly.  Even the coffee was not up to snuff.  At least the waitstaff was friendly and trying hard.
If the owner or management read these reviews, I am telling you that you need to review the practices in your service bay. I waited 30 minutes to check in my car after I called ahead for an appointment. I got a call to come pick up my truck and I have now been here for close to an hour to pick it up. While I was waiting, a woman pulled in that had just had her car serviced and her tire was not put back on properly... Literally it was missing lug nuts. The staff members were laughing about her situation when I think they should have been mortified. The service specialist that helped me was nice, but not nice enough to deal with 90 minutes of waiting.You have 10 employees there... Figure out a way to take care of the customers.
My wife (a chef herself) and I ate here because it was right next to our hotel and the ambience and menu looked appealing...which they in fact are. The problem is the food. We ordered a chile releno appetizer (couldn't taste the poblano chile at all due to heavy handed seasoning in the filling and the overfrying of the whole thing), a halibut dish with a cactus salsa (pretty good), truffled mac and cheese (very good), a chile-glazed skirt steak (completely underseasoned and cooked rare and bloody instead of the WELL DONE that was ordered and emphasized with the waiter) and potatoes au gratin (gobs of cheap cheese sauce and undercooked potatoes which we didn't eat and they graciously took off the bill). The service was OK at first, until we expressed reservations about some of the dishes. At that point the waiter started taking it personal and we just wanted to get the heck out of there as soon as we could. So 50% of the food was poorly cooked, including the steak! This is not a good score for a restaurant of this price point... an unpleasant eating experience overall.
Took 30-45 mins for a pretty sad looking ramen.  Broth was extra salty, took forever and it wasn't even hot... The Japanese soft boiled egg had a center that was way over cooked.. Seriously I can do better with a packaged ramen. Even when getting the check took extra long with barely any customers.   Maybe my waiter just sucked.  He took a break, came back and still didn't have our food.  What a joke!
I was really happy with the massage however Heidi called me 3 times before my appointment while I was driving around looking for the place. Then she texted me also and told me she was checking to see if I needed help finding them because my appointment was now!! Ok so I stop get my phone out to see who is blowing up my phone and try to call her back to find the correct location and she didn't answer the phone. I find the place and I go in to the paperwork and someone comes in the door with kids and a big dog not on a leash. They walk out n and I made a comment to let them know I wasn't comfortable with the dog sniffing me while they walked away! Wow I asked who had the dog. I was told it belonged to the dr. And they had nothing to do with the dog. Just a bad experience! I was more stressed when I left then when I got there.been to this place before was in a different location but I won't be going back!
Was looking for a taco shop and found this place on yelp and stopped by to check it out.  The staff there was very polite and super friendly, the only bad thing was once we got our food the waitress did not really come to check if we needed anything else.  My boyfriend had to get up a few times to let them know what we needed.  I just think they should be a little more attentive to the customers, also since we were the only ones there.  In regards to the food I did not think it was that great. The beans taste like can beans and not like authentic mexican beans and the rice was a little too dry, it did not really taste fresh.  I got a few tacos and the meat was not that good, it seemed to be overcooked and to dry. It almost tasted as if it had been there all day just kept warm and they just keep reheating it up. The salsas did not really have any flavor and overall I was not so satisfied with my food. I probably will not be returning, and I just think the quality of the food really needs improvement.
Server was wonderful. I think there is an identity crisis as the entire decor is rustic western yet the Beatles,, Van Morrison and such are the background music. The  turkey melt was so so. Turkey tasted old.. Not a good grill. Bland taste despite the jack cheese. ( which I did not really see much of).  A lot of turkey but it was all bland. Fries were run of the mill under cooked frozen crinkle cut.Salad was plain iceberg with ONE thinly sliced grape tomato and toooooo many fake fried onion rings. Just a disappointment. from the looks of the place I was hoping for cowboy fair: fresh, tasty juicy burgers. pulled pork, beans....hearty salads. Such a let down.Pricey for the so so food, .
Service department is 5-star, put my last purchase transaction left a lot to be desired.  High pressure to purchase a vehicle on their lot, instead of finding me the one I wanted.The last 2 vehicles I have purchased from them have not been pleasant experiences.  I will keep using their service department, as they have always been great.
Well, we can say that this hotel is not too bad. The hotel itself is so-so. The garden with the animals is good. Pools are ok. A lot of people but it is not fault of the hotel. The staff is friendly and kind. I give 2 stars to this hotel because our room smelt to tobacco smoke every time. We hate this smell and sometime it was unbearable. The housekeeper tried to fight against the smell, but nothing changed (it is not his fault. He was very kind). Also, our room was connected with another room by a door. With which, if somebody wants to do a party you are in, even if you don't want. The bathroom was old and it needs to be upgraded. And the lifts too. In addition, you have to pay for wifi 15$ dollars per day!!! For us this point was important because we are from Spain and we want/need to be in contact. This was very annoying for us above all because you don't pay in other hotels. Even if you are not a guess.
I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not.
The first time i came it was delicious and had fast service. Second time I went i ordered a breakfast sandwhich without spinach salsa or peppers. Got it to go. It took forever. And it had more mushrooms than anything else. It didnt even have cheese and it came with peppers. I even asked before getting the bag if she had made sure it was no spinach pepper or salsa and she said yes. What a waste of $9. All i can taste is mushroom.
Makes an attempt at pub style fare, but it can't decide if it's a family restaurant or a place for young professionals. Their desserts are very good (that chocolate cake!), and their cocktails aren't bad. Skip dinner, come for dessert, and try to sit at the bar.
Don't come here when you are hungry because the food didn't come 40 minutes later. Wasn't busy and only  few customers in the restaurant and I still don't understand why the food took so long???We came 6 people for lunch at 1:30 and we were waiting and waiting for our food, oh man I wish I brought my own food to Munchies while we were waiting.The waitress forgot to bring a glass of water for my husband and he was afraid to ask maybe will take another half an hour.The food was OK, it wasn't our good day that day.
me and my wife just moved there in May and we already hate it. parking feels like a mall parking lot on a saturday, you'll have to drive around for at least 20 min to find one if you're lucky. we work late till around 12 and we mostly park on fire lines and in uncovered parking since parking is not assigned. we can hear the naigbor talking on the phone and know every move the lady in the app above us does or if she's in heals or flip flops and her dog keeps playing and drag stuff all night over our bedroom. the power keeps going off about once a week due to breaker issues or whatever if we use mutiple electonic stuff at once. rent keeps changing for some reason, one month we pay 1400$ and the next we pay 1500$ and the place is not worth the price actually. the staff is nice, mostly adam and it feels that hes the only one we can talk too cause he acually helps, the others will just ignore you bacause they're "helping other".over all its a really nice place if you're home mostly to use their services but they need to get it together and fix their issues
A disappointment!  Upon ordering my croque monsieur, I was terribly surprised how poorly it was made. It lacked freshness, taste, and quality. The authentic croque monsieur has bechamel sauce, good quality cheese and ham. Mine was cold, rubbery and flavourless cheese, stale baguette and served cold with midocre fries. When politely approaching a waitress expressing my negative opinion on the sandwich.. her response was "The issue is that you don't like it, not a problem of the sandwich" I was amazed by her lack of professional people skills and how rude she was. Soon after I was offered by another waitress to order another dish. Which I I did. I requested the quiche Lorraine with fries. Luckily it was a bit more pleasing to my belly and palette. Fortunately, the raspberry tart I have ordered was outstanding! A lovely balance of sweet and tart with a generous amount of fresh raspberries. All this to say, the service was poor, the main dishes lacked authentic French taste and freshness. I will be seeking another place when craving French cuisine.
I have visited this place last Sunday based on reviews and unfortunately it did not meet my criteria, food was just okay, waiters were friendly and i dint mind leaving nice tip. In addition salmon did not taste fresh.
Being new to the area I was looking for a fun, chic and good bakery. Everyone began suggesting Amelie's so I thought we'd try it. The atmosphere is very hipster, and sort of eery. Pastries were OK, definitely not worth the price. Coffee too wasn't anything special.
My husband and I go to this location frequently because it's close to our office. It doesn't compare in terms of cleanliness and service to the one near our home on Gilbert Rd in Mesa. Today, we needed to order 2 dozen bagels and two containers of coffee for a work meeting. We started calling them at 5:30 this morning, which is a half hour after they opened. The phone just rang off the hook and although we tried several times, no one answered. We ended up having to place the order with the Einstein's near our home. They answered and got the order instead of this location. We doubt we will give them any future corporate business. 2 stars just for having good bagels and coffee.
I am sorry to have to write this, for I wanted a place to have a good meal (sandwich) like I have gotten at the Carnegie Deli in New York - this was so far from that - the corned beef sandwich - I wanted something simple and hard to mess up - it was not only messed up it was not what any new York Jew would have recognized as a corned beef sandwich. It was dried up sandpaper like meat.  This is what a corned beef sandwich should look like - http://dzakinsdeli.com/gfx/pics/corned_beef_sandwich.jpg-  I am glad I only got the half a sandwich with the soup - I brought most of the half even home so my wife could try (I did not want to say anything till I had someone I trust taste this drek too) she spit it out in disgust.   Matzoh-ball soup was like my mother's - the problem is my mother cannot cook either - when we visit her she makes me cook -   The Matzoh-balls were a nice size but hard and seemingly undercooked and without flavor.  The soup itself was not that bad and had the crap at the bottom you would expect with homemade soup. Overall if someone reads this with any power to do so "Bring a good Jewish deli to Pittsburgh PLEASE!!"  I gave the stars for the egg cream -
Went to Carolina Ale House (CAH, as they call themselves on their menu) for lunch in a party of 9. The place was busy, as has been the case of 2 other times I have been there. The joint serves beer and pub food with lots of TVs, great place to view games. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is what you pay and go for, not the food.I had the special, a Greek Chicken Pita. Sounds pretty good right, chicken, feta, olives, etc? The problem is that it wasn't made with care, as the pita came soggy with olive juice dripping through the bottom, as if emptied from a can. Worse, there was an olive pit in the pita, which I bit down on, OUCH. Apparently there was a warning somewhere about olive pits... my question, why serve something with pits that can't be easily distinguishable? Great... you put a warning, can I warn you that I may not pay you if I don't like the food and walk out?The fries are flavourful, but it looked like they were rushed. Straight out of the frier and onto our plates... fresh is good, but usually you want to run the fries through paper towels or something to get rid of the excess grease. CAH fries apparently come with an extra serving of oil on the outside, glistening!Other folks had the veggie pizza, a grilled chicken salad, buffalo chicken burger, and the fried fish. I think I probably got the worst of it, the other food looked like standard pub food. I had the buffalo chicken burger before and I would rate it three stars. To be honest, if CAH cooks spent 1 extra minute per plate to actually clean up the presentation, that would earn them 1 extra star. KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid. Nobody walks into CAH expecting miracle food, charge me $10, make me a good burger. Chicken pita would've been fine and good, why add olives and turn it to disaster, honestly, just stupid.Will I go back, probably once in a bit, but their pricing makes it a rare sports event occasion  or an occasional group lunch. Maybe when March Madness rolls around, we will spend some time there for happy hour / game watching.
Thought it would be decent, however I did not like the service and experience I had. Visited Royaltea a couple days ago and I got the chocolate mousse with tapioca and red bean. First of all, I dont know why the mousse was salty, it was like an odd sour salty taste and wasn't that appetizing. So I thought, okay if I keep drinking I will get use to it but I really didn't. I just tried my best to get as much topping while sipping the drink and not the mousse. By the time I finished the drink itself, I still had some topping and it got mixed with the mousse and I could not finish it because the mousse tasted so disgusting with red bean and tapioca. Also the service was not the best, waited like 1 minute to get the cashier's attention while the other workers were facing me and me saying "excuse me" loudly. Other workers were just eating and talking to each other, 4 of them clearly made eye contact with me and I was ready to order and cashier's back towards me. Even my friend could hear me trying to get their attention but it took a while.
The Szechuan is too sweet, not spicy - even when requested.  It's closer to sweet and sour sauce.  Fried rice tastes instant.  Not enough seating. Good price though.  Lunch for 6$ with tea!
I was really excited to get services started. The offer was brought to my attention as part of a special event at Costco. The services are set up under your Costco account, so it makes it easier to find your customer information when you have to call the delivery company. Our delivery driver gave me his personal cell phone in case we needed anything right after we got services set up. I wound up using the drivers number asking for a text once the first delivery was completed. This review reflects the customer service you get when you have to call the delivery company itself. We had a bottle with a crack in it & didn't even know until it was too late. Unfortunately, the water leaked all over my carpet & kitchen (due to placement of machine). This happened right at our second delivery & as we were down to the very last bottle of water. I called to cancel services due to this issue. Customer service was happy to cancel, but never offered any credits to the bill from this cracked bottle. They told me to call back about my final bill, as a credit would be issued for returning all empty bottles we received once they were picked up by the driver along with our machine. Upon calling back, the customer service agent had to manually input the bottle credit.
Came with my girlfriend because I heard that the head chef is vegan, and we both are. When we first walked in, we stood for about 5 minutes waiting to be seating, not knowing that we were in the wrong spot. Multiple employees walked past us, and not one asked how we were or if we needed any help. Mind you, it was not busy at all for a Saturday night. We walked around for a bit and finally found where we needed to be, and the hostesses again looked at us without asking how we were. We got an attitude-laced "just 2?" And after we gave our name, we were ignored again. The bar was fine, a nice older man took my drink orders and gave them to me promptly. The waitress was great and we got our food and drinks quickly. The food was not amazing, but not awful. Don't think we will be coming back again.
Nice bartender, good wine, mediocre food.  I got what was supposed to be their signature pasta, and the meat was really poor quality (lots of gristle).
I was somewhat disappointed; but I didn't grow up in the Northeast so take my review with a grain of salt.I was pretty excited that a lobster roll food truck was going to arrive in Vegas and I had planned with a couple friends to go. Obviously I'm aware that lobster isn't the cheapest thing on the market, but their lobster rolls were $14/ea, which was higher than the price offered at their LA trucks. As lobster rolls traditionally are, this included lobster meat piled on a hot dog bun. Tasty, but just not the Vegas portions I'm used to. I got a side of plain tots which were $4. They were fine. I just knew I was going to need more food in addition to the small roll but didn't want to make this food-truck equally as expensive as going to a half-decent sit-down restaurant by purchasing another lobster-garnished dish.My friend asked if the $12 lobster tots were large enough to be a dish on their own. "Yeah they are huge!" When she received hers she immediately knew it wasn't going to be enough food. It was the just side of tater tots with some lobster on the top.This will probably be popular with people that moved here from the Northeast, though.
Not the Benihana it used to be. We came in for a birthday dinner and we frankly disappointment with everything except for the service and our chef's entertainment ability. There were items listed on the online menu that were not available and the staff wasn't even familiar with. They won't give half orders of sushi even though the menus lists that they do. The portions are a lot smaller then I remember. My food was just mediocre. I don't know is that do to the chefs ability or the quality of the food they are working with. Also they apparently only honor their birthday discount program on Mon thru Thurs, which i understand is a normal policy for regular coupons but said birthday was actually on a Friday and they we couldn't use the discount even though we were actually there on the date of the birthday, This is just a bad policy. I used to really love Benihana would would gladly choose this restaurant over the other Japanese steakhouses that have popped up recently, I don't think i can do so anymore. we had a much better experience at a different restaurant a for a lot less also.This used to be a slightly more upscale location, now it is not much better then an Applebee's but still have the upscale pricing. I do realize that you are paying for the show as well as the food, but when the food is sub par and the environment is lacking, that pricing just feel like a rip off.Everything said, the chef was entertaining, the wait staff was great and on top of things, we never had to wait more then a few minutes for anything. they catered to 3 picky kids wonderfully. Which makes it even more disappointing that i cant give a better review.
The food tastes great... However, as I walked in there's only one lady at the front ringing in orders and answering phones. The line is to the door. I tried to call our order in before I left work but phone lines were busy or disconnected so we had to place our order once we got there.  We finally got to the front and ordered our food at 12:05. We received our food at 12:46, after I asked where it was. (There were about 30 people waiting for their food at this point )  They didn't even have our order, they found half of it but had to make my husband's. After receiving our food mine was not even hot anymore because it had been sitting out. I also had to leave to go back to work and left my husband eating alone. I got an apology but it ruined my lunch. I wouldn't recommend going here on lunch break. Food is good but not worth the trouble.
Recently here for KSU homecoming.  They were apparently unprepared for homecoming and the crowds as food and drink orders were slow (30 minutes) to arrive.  The place was so loud you could not hear the person next to you.The food was mediocre.  We had nachos which hardly had any cheese on them, some french fried pickles which were bland, and a variety of wings which were ok.  The facility is clean and bright with lots of TVs showing sports if that's what you are into.
Not a great place to eat. The food lacks flavor. I got the chicken and shrimp combo. The shrimp and chicken were good. Carrots were over cooked and too sweet, rice was sticky, and cabbage was bland. Egg roll was basic. Surprisingly they have a long line at lunch time. The prices are good. They are clean and you get your food soon. There is plenty of seating and parking. The staff are friendly. They are in a strip mall with other places you can try. Keep your options open. Good luck!
I've eaten here once, for lunch, and it was decidedly meh.  We were seated promptly, but it took far too long for the food to come out.  I ordered a club sammich, which should be pretty much idiot proof to make.  There wasn't anything in particular wrong with it.  It just wasn't very good.  It was almost too huge to eat, and I could only get through half of it.  The accompanying fries were so so.The rub is the sammich was nearly $15.00.  OK, it's Vegas, and lots of things are overpriced, but Planet Hollywood is no Cosmo, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore, etc.
Ok, I have combined my two visits into one review because the first visit was a total disaster. I won't go into details but service (new waitress not enough training), manager (told us we had to pay $5 extra for the waitresses mistake) and food (poor value, overcooked) were all lacking. We got an invite back from the GM to give it another try and service was better but bread for the table still came out after all the food and most of the food ranged from ok to tasty, chicken tacos were soggy. Burger was good the first time and good the second time but overall the value for what you are getting is simply not there. Toronto has so many great food options, I would not waste money here.
Eh. Had high expectations since the place is nicely decorated, but the service and treatment was lame. Despite them knowing it was my first time here, they rushed me through and focused more on the TV rather than on the service.Deluxe Pedicure for $38 was below average; process was rushed and hence the service lacked thoroughness. Calluses weren't addressed properly, previous polish wasn't fully removed, etc. Polish was put on quickly without top clear coat. Smudged before I walked out. They used paper towels for toe separators. Overall, my home pedicures are better than their service.Won't return.
The service is good. Never had an issue,however I wish they would update their hours as they are not opened on Sundays. Big disappointment when Yelp reads they are open and you get there and it's closed.
Good service but that's about it.Food was generally flavorless and in this case, more does not equal better. Too many things going on with the burgers that the meal becomes an unwieldy, sloppy mess. Just because food can be deep fried, doesn't mean that it should nor stacked on top of a burger. Peanuts on table is good but not an excuse to let the floor get trashed. Visited restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. With only 5 tables in the place, the floor looked like it had been bombed.Attempt to offer local and quality products was a plus however the entire experience fell short.
LIke other reviewers, I also tried Oxi Fresh because I saw their promotions in Clipper Magazine, a coupon mailer thing we recently received. I had my beige colored microfiber sofa and love seat cleaned, and three wool rugs. On my upholstery, the only stain issues were some small black dirt scuff marks that our movers got on ALL of the corners of both pieces due to poor wrapping I guess. Also one of the wool rugs had pet stains. Other than that, all of these items had very little visible soiling--I wasn't looking for much stain removal, but general dirt and allergen removal. Pros:-Supposedly more environmentally friendly, etc (However, there is definitely a fragrance involved, see "Con" below)-Fast process-Dries quickly, although it has now been over an hour and my upholstery is still pretty wet (despite having the AC and ceiling fan on)--too wet to sit on--and the rugs are also still very damp. Cons:-The dry time is so fast because they use very little water. It's obvious on all of my rugs that the cleaning didn't reach anywhere near the depth that I was looking for to remove dirt and allergens. This is what I am most disappointed about because I really wanted a good deep cleaning to help my allergies, and this cleaning seemed to just be very surface-level. -Fragrance, which makes me highly suspicious that it's not really less toxic for indoor air/children/pets than traditional steam cleaning. I have allergies, and the fragrance is actually WORSE for me to breathe than the dust and pet dander I was trying to have removed!-Did not remove pet vomit stains from wool rug... In fact, it turned the yellowish stains a strangely bright yellow color, almost like bleach stains, that look just as bad as the original stains. -Did not remove the stains on the corners of my upholstery--they are just faded a TINY bit -Did not remove  some typical "traffic" stains (like Brian, I expected this to help my rugs' colors brighten up a lot more)--I think a steam cleaning would have gone deeper and gotten them out.Payment is cash or check only.Bottom line: They didn't come anywhere close to delivering what I was looking for, which was a deep cleaning to remove deep dirt and allergens, and it didn't remove any of the stains I had either. I'm definitely going with steam cleaners next time!
Mediocre at best.  If Red Lobster is your pinnacle of taste, then you may enjoy it.  The lunches we've had there over the years, however - as a favor to my elderly Dad - were consistenly sub-Olive Garden in quality.   Its really a shame that the follow-through on the WWII era decor was so impressive and yet they care so little about the quality of food.   Also they are not exactly attracting the most gung-ho wait staff.   Its all a bit sad, really.Finally, if anyone gives this place a 4 or 5 star review, you should be very, very suspect.
When it comes to Taco Bell, I I know that I'm sacrificing quality of food and service in exchange for convenience and speed, but unfortunately this time they really underdelivered.During a recent late night drive-through visit in addition to both the rice and shredded chicken being bone dry (in their defense, it was 15 minutes before closing, but still, if it's that bad, don't serve it!), they also forgot to an empanada we ordered .  Normally it's not a big deal to forget to bag an item, but when it takes 15+ minutes to finally get just a damned empanada, that's just ridiculous.
I used to be a Los Sombrero's local. Started going (1998) before they were in their current location. The past few years Los Sombreros has gone hill. Increasing prices and food not as good. Marg's are subpar now. Los Sombrero's is no longer living up to what it used to be. Food is still good, just no longer great. All great things change and I am sad to see Los Sombreros change for the worse. The original chef/owner Jeff Smedstad has left and started Elote in Sedona - I must try there as I here it's what Los Sombreros used to be.
This place is not as good as people make it seem. I'm not into sushi places with all the frills, just gimmie some great sushi and I'm all for the hole in the wall spots as I find them to be more genuine. This place has chewy sushi and all in all I won't ever go back. Save the ambiance and improve your FOOD, Kofusion. You are better off spending a little more at Sakanaya.
Their bagelwichs taste pretty good. But expensive compared to other options around the financial district. However, today the service was horrific. The lady gave me attitude and gave me the wrong order and still claims it's the "bagelwich". Only ordered one thing and she still gets the order wrong. Not returning to this particular Michel's.
Oh lord. This is a great example how a good restaurant will go down the gutter if it does not have it's act together.I have been to Old School at least 5 times in the past few months and it  has been an absolute joy. Sure, their food may be a tad too heavy for my stomach, but that's part of the charm: hearty, big meals that will make you not wanna eat anything for the rest of the day. I have had quite a few of the various options: my favourite is "Don't even go there." Extravagant, unnecessary and fantastic. And then came new management. Or so it seems. At least all of the staff has changed. Suddenly I did not recognise anyone. Which, in of itself, is not an issue - I could not care less in theory. In practice, what ended up happening was that there was some major logistal nightmares going on in the back (i.e. kitchen) where we waited, and I kid you not, 1 hour and 45 minutes to get our food. Now, generally, you'd say service sucks then. indeed it does. However, I must give koodos where koodos are to be given - we had a brilliant server (Danielle) who tried to bribe us with doughnuts and biscuits while we waited. She was an absolute joy, but even she could only bump this to a 2-star review. This whole situation is rather unfortunate, as this place used to be really good. Management needs to get its act together and get this fixed, because places in Toronto do not stay open for very long if you are treating your customers to this sort of fun. The Yelp reviews have dropped from 4.0 to 2.5 from July to August... May that be a good hint to changes that need to happen.
Working in area for a week so visited four out of five days for lunch Two days at no later than 1:30 they had no food (provisions)Last day (not going back) I had to wait 30 mins for food that was sitting ready right in front of me and they substituted white rice in for my rice and peas; I wanted food in the first place so ended up throwing out the nasty riceUpsetting that they could have made more rice in the time they made me wait but so it goesSnapper was a good 3/5Service 2/5Food availability 3/5Would have got a 3 on Third visit but not worth more than a 2 after seeing its downside
Unfortunately I decided to opt out of takeout and actually dine in for once. Big mistake. I always get to-go food here and it's consistently fair to middling. The same or less can be said for my food tonight, I had the lotus roll which has spicy tuna inside among other ingredients, but there was no spice at all. Pretty flavorless on the whole. But, the thing that really put me off of this place was the service. It was 845 pm, just got out of yoga and needed food and possibly a drink... Head to the bar where I'm greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l "do you need a drink menu?"... Maybe she had been having a bad day? She was somewhat helpful selecting the sake I ordered. She was on her phone/computer the whole time, didn't smile once and honestly made me slightly uncomfortable, I felt as if I was a burden. I definitely won't be back to dine in.
This is a Chinese restaurant that offers "Chinese-nized" version of well known dishes from around southeast Asia.The good thing is that food is fresh and tastes alright as long as you expect to get Chinese food.  If it is Thai or Vietnamese you are craving, there are better places in TO to get the real deal.
When you advertise that drinks are 50% off during happy hour, I expect to be charged half price. When the server asks: "any last happy hour drinks?", I also expect to be charged half price. Half of $16 is $8, not $8.50. It's not about the $0.50, it's about principle. Think how many customers, myself included, have been paying more than what we should. Shady business. This was my last time here.
Tonight we decided to try Nani for the first time. We went on a Saturday night around 6 for dinner with a group of 4. We had heard good things about their dim sum and had high hopes. Once we sat down we were greeted immediately and our server explained how to order from their menu w/ pictures. We had to ask to see a cocktail menu and did not get water immediately. Actually, we had to ask again for water and were only brought one water and had to ask AGAIN for all 4 of us to get a glass of water. We ordered 6 different dim sum entrees with the assumption that we would order more. That ended up not being the case as our food was quite underwhelming. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, pan fried veggie rolls, pepper pork ribs, fried sticky rice, bbq pork buns and the sesame balls. When we tried to order cocktails, we were informed that they did not have any tonight but that we could order from their sake and martini menu. So I ordered a martini with the exact same vodka as the cocktail I initially tried to order (??) The dim sum plates that we enjoyed were the bbq pork buns, the shrimp dumplings and the sesame balls (our favorite). Unfortunately we did not like the other half of our meal. The fried rice had small pieces of a dried jerky like meat and small fried shrimp. It overall was very fishy tasting and none of us really liked it. The ribs were full of gristle, fat and bones leaving very little edible meat. We agreed that the flavor was good but the meat quality was poor. We also thought that the veggie rolls were greasy and flavorless. Lastly, our waiter never came and checked up on us to give us water or ask if we wanted to order more plates. Then when we gave up on that we could not even get him to bring the check. All four of us agreed that we would not be back. Very disappointing.
This was my first time there and possibly my last. Like some of the other sub-par reviews state - the food was quite good, but the service was mediocre. I understand being understaffed, having an off day, etc. But then tell us that and don't make us wait ONE HOUR for a meal of simple poached eggs and grits without an explanation or apology. Regardless, $40 for two breakfasts and two cups of coffee is outrageous even with the best service. To top it off... it's my birthday, so this was supposed to be my special breakfast with my daughter.  Oh well, live and learn!
We had some issues with this particular Embassy Suites Hotel in Coraopolis. First, while the accommodations are fine, there is a $10 per day charge for wifi. That is crazy. I would not have booked the room knowing this.Then I took a shower. Five minutes later I got a phonecall from the front desk. Apparently, my shower had caused a waterfall in the room below. The maintenance man was in and out of our room probably five times to fix the problem and he gave us...a bag of popcorn. I would have preferred free wifi.The final straw: there was a rowdy group of high school students(?) outside in the shared courtyard for hours and into the wee hours. I was shocked that no one asked them to quiet down. It was beyond rude and I felt like I was at summer camp on my little tiny vacation to Pittsburgh in the winter.While this hotel is close to the airport, I will not be back.
Not the chipotle it used to be compared to couple years back..they are stingy with everything now..I barely come here anymore it used to be 2-3 times a week..step it up you are a big franchise now
I've been going to this gas station for years because it's clean and the service is fine.  But not anymore.  I recently discovered that their prices are much higher than other gas stations a little further north on Yonge St. and nearby gas stations on Hwy 7.  I thought the air miles promotion that saves you 4 cents per litre was amazing until I discovered their prices are 4 to 6 cents higher than their competitors.  Shame on you Shell for raising your prices 4 cents and making us think we're saving 4 cents!  Also, they only give you 1 air mile no matter how much you spend.  When I asked about this, they said it's during the 4 cents off promo.  I don't think they are following the Air Miles rules.There is now a Starbucks at this location.
Disappointing.  Menu on line is different than real menu which is limited to chicken wings, tenders, hamburger ($17) and "steak" fries which was actually cold pieces of roast beef.  This place will be gone in 6 months.  Sad because it is a great concept if they took the energy to do it right.  Beer is good!!!
I wish they had better management, because the food itself is decent. I used to work close to a different pei Wei and loved it. This one is within walking distance, but after giving it MANY attempts I'm going to drive to the other one, or satisfy my pad thai craving elsewhere.Never has it been an issue to have sweet and sour sauce with my egg roll, here, they charge you for it. Their fried rice is always white rice poorly fried, so you have globs of white rice and 1/4 fried rice. They don't even put silverwear in your to go bag...this place needs a big management change if it wants to make money at this location, or people will continue to boycott it, or drive to a different pei Wei location 8min away...**Update ** Contacted pei wei corporate office to tell them about the bad food preparation and service at this location and they gave me a gift card to try again. They got a star back for the customer service at the corporate office.
Well, on the one hand it's just Starbucks.  On the other hand it's close and open later than any other coffee-serving place in a 2-block area.  So it gets a lot of credit for being there and being available.  But they also play a lot of Christmas music; more than anything else on the planet I hate Christmas music.  So during the next month if I want to come here (or any Starbucks) I have to have upbeat music blaring in my ears to drown it out.  That's not convenient. That level of inconvenience for over 1/12 of the year definitely costs them a star.
I don't know what has changed- the last 2 or 3 times I've eaten there I've been underwhelmed with the food. Staff is always great and friendly, no complaints there,  but the meat always seems like it's been sitting out and is terribly dry. I realize it's a process and when I smoke my own meat it's obviously going to be juicier right out of the smoker or after a brief rest, but I feel like I showed up to a family bbq 2 hrs after the food was served and am cleaning up the leftovers. Not bad, but I really expect better for the price. $22 for 2 meat combo and a beer not including tip which the ladies that helped me deserved. Hope my opinion changes on the next trip-
I purchased my meal, and when I get home I find out they didn't even bother putting in hot sauce or soy sauce as silly it my seems it completely destroyed my meal. Now a days all restaurants always do this. Is not the customer job to remind them of the things that need to be in the bag. Fast food places keep the same prices all year round...always the same bad quality services as well.Thank you Panda Express.
Place is very friendly. Outdated and grungy  but that never deters me. Some of the best places are dives. I had high hopes for this place because of the yelp reviews. I was very disappointed. I was the only customer yet The rolls were all over cooked, very very dark brown. I was given the wrong order. Ordered general tsaos and got sweet and sour, then tried to convince me it was tsao. They used a microwave for everything. And the single serve mustard and duck sauce packets were tasteless and bland. Got beef broccoli for a friend, and the inside of the broccoli was still frozen. Won't be returning. But 2 stars for reasonable price and friendly lady.
I go here quite a bit but today my order was terrible. I got a caramel iced coffee and some hash browns. The hash browns literally taste like they were sprayed with some cleaning solution and about made me puke. The iced coffee tasted strange too. It tastes like day old coffee that was just poured in to get rid of. I know Dunkin isn't the most expensive place for coffee but, I do expect it to be drinkable and the food edible.
The food is ok, but the coffee is terrible. All that effort in creating an atmosphere and they miss a crucial detail. They make their coffee with a Keurig or Verrissimo and can't make an espresso to save their lives.
Father's 75th Surprise Birthday Party-Owner took advantage of a joyous occasion. Months of planning to create a surprise party for my Dad. There was myself and my mother working with the venue to help plan the event. Overall the event went well, but not because of the owner. Family and friends made the event great.Upon arrival we were expecting a private room for 31 people. We were placed in the main dining hall with portable 6 foot dividers to separate us from others. I inquired about a private dining space and was told by the owner the private space could only hold 30 and she decided this was the best fit. She told me she would waive the $50 room rental fee. Which is ridiculous to charge anyways because we had a section, not a private room.(charged anyways)My brother also told her that we would like only 2 bottles of wine placed on the tables for a toast. She insisted on pouring everyone's glass and then charged us $7 a glass(30 glasses) to equal over $200 of wine(4 bottles). We asked for 2 bottles since it was a cash bar and guests had their own drinks already.Also, the owner decided that it was her right to make their traditional toast and then let us make a toast. Thank you for forcing yourself into our event.We also had a table of 3 that was served last after other tables had already completed their dinner.We brought in a professional chocolate cake and were charged $15 to cut the cake. We asked to cut it ourselves and were told they have to cut it and charge us for liability reasons. My mother asked for a slice of White cake since she was allergic to Chocolate(oversight by us). The owner brought out an 8" cake and then charged us $24 for that cake as well, after she told us she would be able to find a slice in the back.When the final bill was due, the owner pulled my mother to the side to settle up. As I watched the transaction, she kept her left arm over a majority of the bill and showed the final price at the bottom of $1300+. Upon further inspection after the check was written, we noticed the wine issue and she charged us $50 for the room fee, even though she said it was going to be waived. Upon inquiring with her about the charges she immediately took offense and said "Don't try and nickel/dime me". Really? We verify the bill and catch you over charging and we are somehow in the wrong?The venue was not very busy on a Saturday night and we brought in a majority of their revenue that evening.It was a great event for our Dad to share with family and friends, but to witness my 75 old mother being taken advantage by the owner was very disappointing. Fortunately, my brother and myself were able to step in and have the owner cut us a check for $200 to cover the over charging. There was another person named Gary who was excellent that night. Very helpful that evening and was able to find us a speaker to play music for the evening. Gary was a pleasure to work with.Fortunately my Dad was not aware of the drama behind the scenes which is the most important thing.The front of the building also needs a good cleaning or a paint job. Very depressed looking building upon arrival.We spent another hour or so in the bar after the dinner, which was also a highlight of the evening. Cool little bar with live music and the bartender was great!I applaud the staff who worked very hard that night.I wish I could give a better review of the venue, but people make the difference.Their ambiance is fine, but if you want to host a private event I suggest you look elsewhere.
This reviews comes as a surprise to me as I've heard how good the food is at the Cleveland location..... at the Hudson location, not good.  The bartender who assisted with my pickup order is the only reason this has a two star review. She was very nice and pleasant.  The vegetarian burrito and vegetable enchiladas on the other hand were not. The green sauce came out of a can about 15 seconds prior to being put on the food. The waxy cheese covered mushy corn and I believe flour tortillas.  Vegetarian at this location means I hope you like peppers and onions because that's all your getting.  We are fans of good guacamole and have heard there's was good so we tried it--- threw half of the 2 Oz we were given (for 6.99) away. 95% chunky onion and tomato, and really no flavor.  If the 4 people sitting at a table being the only customers at 6pm on a Thursday night wasn't a clue, the food surely was a sign to avoid Luchita's. Sadly.
Not as good as it once was... A few years ago when Pink Polish first opened I was blown away by the quality of product and service provided. Not to mention skill of the techs. I went only to PP for two years straight and recruited all my girlfriends as well. We even had a bridal shower there and it was extremely well done. However I moved away for a few years and just recently returned.  I was so excited to go back and was thrilled to find out my favorite tech still worked there!  Unfortunately though I left horribly disappointed.  The prices have gone up. Expected. But the quality of product has gone significantly down. The over all atmosphere looks inviting until you overhear the techs and management talk behind each others backs. I did try and go back 2 more times and found myself equally as disappointed. Long story short I found a new nail salon.
Honest opinion on this restaurant after visiting this place with my gf the other day. Atmosphere is great, not pricy but quality of food just does not make up for the experience. Miso soup was water down, with minimal ingredients. The lunch set that I had was a teriyaki salmon. It served with a measly thin slice of tuna. My gf had a bowl sashimi with rice combo, the problem is they serve in both meal with normal rice instead Japanese rice steam with vinegar. ‍
Maybe this place rocks and swings at night. Maybe people guffaw and clack beers and music buzzes around the room. Maybe. In the middle of the day, though, it's pretty abysmal. The guy working the counter is too chatty and garrulous. I mean I like customer service to be sincere and friendly, but this guy was filibustering. I could barely talk to my girlfriend. God bless, you, dude, but put an ellipsis or two in your conversations. It's like hanging out with a racetrack announcer on fast-forward. The beer selection is also pretty daft. I know it's a kitschy, dumbed down bar - and that my expectations shouldn't be high - but when the best you can do is fill up a bucket with Bud, you not only take the wind out of my sails, but you set them on fire. Not to mention that these macros are fearsomely expensive. I'd probably hang my hat somewhere else, if I were you. It's not as though Vegas is bankrupt of places to drink.
This location's prices are absolutely absurd.  Just 2 hours ago, I paid $6.98 for a medium Original yogurt with 2 toppings.  That's $7 dollars for a cup of frozen yogurt.  Mind you, the medium cup looks quite large, but with this being Pinkberry, they filled about 60% of it with actual yogurt.  (This, however, tends to be a fault with all Pinkberry locations.)  The flavor and quality is not that spectacular that it warrants such incredibly premium pricing.I blame this on Charlotte.  It's a good town, but there is absolutely no competition in frozen yogurt.  Explains how Pinkberry can get away with $7 for a medium cup of yogurt - same goes for the location in Southpark Mall.  I found it shocking and appalling, truthfully.  Shocking & appalling.  Red Mango (along with independent business owners), please jump on this and teach Pinkberry a lesson.  Thank you.2 stars instead of 1 because of fairly good Pinkberry froyo consistency, quality & having the staple toppings (specifically mochi - also try lemon cookie crisp, actually very good).
Friends raved about this family owned restaurant so we decided invite a couple friends for dinner - nice decor & friendly staff - portions very small, several of us had mussels & clams, they were size of a nickel -  spaghetti with red sauce tasted ordinary  & saltimbocca  looked like layered lasagna without the pasta.The bread and olive oil was the best  maybe we just ordered the wrong entrees - don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
This place is over rated for sure. The waitress drops 2 tap waters on the table (super chlorine), I say UMMM we dont want water ( Saving LAKE MEAD water ) She said OH! So its 815pm and the entire Korean staff is filling the soy sauce bottles. I'm like wow they don't close till 11 p.m. how about some customer service. AYCE is only 60 minutes! Haha... She finally comes over I say do you speak Japanese ? She says no!  I say do you speak Korean she says yes then I start speaking Korean and she is stunned! JKKUHL bomb dropper! lol  Funny stuff...   Great news our waitress left at 830pm Haha....  more coming as we are waiting for our cooked food seems it takes a lifetime to cook.  THE CRAZY THING IS NO ONE IS HERE!
Was much better as last place. food is not so good here and the service matched hope they improve thou soon
My parents were in town for the Christmas holiday and since I have been to Sapori twice before and had a great experience, I thought I'd take them there for a nice Italian dinner. I was pretty disappointed this visit. It seemed like they were short staffed, but when you looked around there were 4+ servers running around, plus the owner bussing tables. Our server was friendly, but I think he was also waiting on the patrons sitting at the bar as well as waiting tables. We didn't see him much... My mother ordered the Chicken Parm and got Veal Parm served to her by mistake. The "bread" was served in ceramic soup bowls?? It was oddly shaped really small rolls..? The last time I was there we were served oven baked flat bread and it was delicious. We waited and waited for our check when we were finished and our server walked by a few times and never stopped when we were clearly sitting there after our empty plates had been removed. We ended up walking to the front desk and asking for our check there. I was pretty bummed that we had this experience, I talked so highly of this restaurant to my parents and walked out of there feeling kind of embarrassed. I wish I could give a better review for this visit, maybe the next time I stop in there it will be more organized.
Ordered on Uber eats.... Way over priced considering the portion size. Paid 73 bucks for enough food for maybe 1 hungry person. Cornbread wasn't good. Tasted prepackaged and microwaved
I finally went upstairs to the "museum," and they have great selfie lighting, but not a whole ton else.
First time here and I wasnt impressed at all!  I should have gone to the dairy queen :-(
Came here for "Restaurant Week" after hearing positive reviews from friends.The group I went with all had the 3 course meal.Pros:- Reservations on OpenTable- Parking lot next to the side of the restaurant - $5 - Friendly environment, not loud- Appetizers: Mix of shrimp, Portuguese sausage and calamari were good and the portion size was perfect- Service: Although the server was a bit strange with off the wall comments, overall all the waiters and staff were friendly.Cons:- Main Course: Paella, Salmon and Filet. Salmon and Filet were not cooked properly / or as requested. The lobster in the paella was rough and didn't look fresh. Portion sizes were large, but not worth it due to the poor taste.- Desserts were awful. The cheesecake and chocolate cake tasted as if they were bought from local grocery store. One joke at the table was that there was freezer burn on the cheesecake.We were glad we tried it, but will certainly not be back for another visit.
So  so. Not the same eds. Need Improvement.  Service great. Atmosphere good. Food lacking.
We went for breakfast and while the ambience is great, the food failed to deliver.  It's the only french bistro where i've ever had microwaved quiche (burning hot with a telltale soggy crust).  I've been to Bouchon in Napa and the Las Vegas version does not come anywhere close!
I think Dr Miller is very good clinically and very compassionate, but for our 6 visits since last November (typical stuff - ear infections, stomach bug, allergic reaction), our average wait time was at least an hour.  Even our 18mo check up appointment that was at 8:15 didn't start until 9 because the people with the appointment before us was late.  Not our problem...We're going to try elsewhere.
Been coming here since they reopened! At first service was decent but it been on the decline slowly ever since ! Always running out of one thin or another today it was steak and spinach ! Now service is shabby at best sorry to say since I do support local businesses! This is how businesses fail ! You need to step it up because me personally today might be the last time I eat at this restaurant !
ALWAYS trying to upsell me on a number of services...high pressure too. I usually point out something that needs special attention (dog hair in the back seat, crumbs on the floor, etc) and they consistently proceed to do a half ass vacuum job. Two stars because the outside of the car usually looks nice and the inside is wiped down pretty well.. Overall, however, these guys need to step up their game. I used to bring my car here when it was under previous ownership and was always pleased with the service. Now I would prefer to drive 10-15 miles further to get a superior car wash.
Food was good, server did a good job, but the place is not managed well. I know they don't pick their customers but we ate  next to a table that had a screaming kid and a kid throwing food everywhere and after they left it was 20 minutes before they cleaned the area. There was some confusion concerning the next customers to be seated as they were brought to the table that had not been cleaned yet and stood by or table waiting for their table to be cleanedfor a long time.  As they were final being seated another table was being seated behind us with another screaming toddler that also was jumping up and down on the seat common with mine. Her brother was playing a game machine with the volume loud enough it disturbed our ability to converse with each other.
Bad service, Bland Pizza, and really really overpriced. The whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). With the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... Very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. For those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. With service and food.
We went here on a fluke as the place we wanted to go had a long wait.  This place didn't have one and now we know why.   The owner or manager was rude to us from the start. We were seated then ignored for about 10 mins.  We started to look at yelp and looking for other options as we were ready to just leave since we weren't being served.  The manager picked up on our conversation and proceeded to tell his wait staff to get over to us NOW.  We finally got a waitress, and proceeded to order.  First of all they charge for bread.  Regular or garlic.  Which is fine. But they offer it like it's free and then there is the fact that it is stale and awful.  The portions were small.  The flavor was eh.  And the service was bad.  I also noticed the manager cleaning a table, putting his fingers in the dirty glasses, then going over and making roll ups of silver ware.  I watched as he touched the tongs on the forks with his dirty hands.  That alone is reason enough for me to NEVER go back.  Basically just an awful experience.  And no wonder there was no wait at 7:30pm on a Friday night.
Sadly my first Smashburger experience was an extreme dissapointment! Their customer service was horrible, the food was too salty, the surrounding tables were covered with trash, they screwed up our very simple order, and they didn't have any Tabasco. What burger joint doesn't have Tabasco? Obviously Smashburger. Perhaps we were there on an off day based on all the other reviews they received, but either way I won't be returning.
I was quite disappointed with this restaurant.  We visited this restaurant back in July.  The food wasn't much better than your average Kelseys with a higher price point and the service was terrible! I had the prime rib dinner which was mostly fat! There was a group of us dining and we all said we would never come back!
Why the low rating? Face it, no one wants to ever go to the DMV.  Even with advancements in technology that allow you to do various things online, it is inevitable that at some point or another, you will have to physically go to the DMV....and you WILL hate it.Why the two stars?Two stars for two words.....snack bar.Will return....even if i don't want to.
I have been eating a Malee's for years and never had a bad experience until tonight. My wife and I went in to have our usual fire wraps followed by basil chicken and were surprised that the waitress was covered in tattoos from shoulder to wrist, if appeared we were in a high class motorcycle bar than an old favorite restaurant. If you want to disfigure your body by covering it in tattoos that is your business but you should cover them up at work so you don't disgust your customers by shoving them in their faces. I know that this might not be popular to a some people, but customers of Malee's deserve better than having to look at the wait staffs tacky tattoos. What next, nose rings and pierced eyebrows!
Beware of false advertising! You get a view of the strip with 2 balconies but both balconies are LOCKED. What's the point in having them??? Furniture is outdated and tattered. Surfaces were not cleaned and you could see the marks on them. The bathtub has a huge mark on the outside, toilet didn't seem clean and you have to pay for wifi for each device. My room was a SUITE! Light fixture didn't have a cover, sofa has stains, the AC is so outdated for such a "modern" decor, you cannot put it on "auto," because there's no feature! Bathroom doesn't have a fan and television and outlets are not user friendly. There was a lamp that was not plugged with no socket to plug so we had to move it. My side of the bed lamp has no cover, which is BLINDING and there are no outlets bedside to charge my phone!!! I should have looked at the recent reviews before reserving. Highly disappointed. Won't be coming back to palms place. I couldn't even take more pictures because of the reflections. Save your money!
Came here yesterday for brunch with my friend and was not impressed. We both did the bottomless mimosas and had to wait way too long for refills. Not fun considering you don't get the fair share of "bottomless." We were hungry so I ordered the Monte Cristo and she ordered a burger. It took literally an hour for it to come out. We kept asking where our food was and our waitress had to keep asking. And when it finally did, I had a hair on my plate! Disgusting. I'm only giving two stars because our waitress was nice and felt bad about the hour long wait on our food that she didn't charge us for it. I'll stick to Hulas for brunch and mimosas from now on.
For the most part the staff is not very friendly.  They act like you are interrupting their visiting time.  The office does not offer scans of the back of the eye which is fairly routine now and contains very valuable information on the health of the patient.  The only positive about this office is there is a large selection of glasses.
I hate to give this review but I think I have to... We went there on the day Steelers are playing the Broncos. We were there around 9 and there was a long line.. My friends and I always thought the long lines mean good things.. Boy we were wrong.. Half of us ordered the steak and eggs and it was the most disgusting steak I had, Bland... Not cooked to what I asked... My eggs had all sorts of black residue.. The bread came after 10 minutes of giving us our meal... Customer service was okay....
I am very disappointed in the new place.  The setting is perfect and sets up this feeling for an amazing experience, then you get your food.  I have eaten at the original location many times and have always had great food.  I think this is a classic situation where the company has grown and something had to be sacrificed (quality).  Our party had three people in it and we ordered different items.  Veggie burger, rueben, and the courtyard club.  All warm food was cold and the club was poorly built with stale bread (bacon was amazing).  The sides were fruit, frys (cold and greasy),and potato salad  (very good).  For the history I have with this place i just would expect better.  Manager was not helpful, had no answer other than he would check on the kitchen staff.  Hopefully he does so your meal will be acceptable.
Nice people and seemed to be great at first. Went there for about a year or so now and I'm changing vets..you make an appointment and you're still in a tiny waiting room full of so many dogs you can't walk by for an hour even though you had an appointment scheduled. I brought my cat in in December because he was losing weight quick. All Dr.Scott said was 'it's probably just age, I CAN do blood work but it's pretty expensive so if there's no signs it's probably just age'..3 months later he can't seem to go to the bathroom so I rush him to a closer vet who did blood work right away and said he had kidney failure which weight loss was the first sign of. I could have caught this months ago but thought he was just fine thanks to the doctor. I was also told they have no prescription medication for cats arthritis. Now the vet I am going to has some prescription medication for that. The doctor doesn't seem to want to give you time of day and overcharges. I was charged a vet fee and all he did was check his stools and looked at him. Did not check his vitals-nothing. And I had to pay an entire vet fee that's outrageous as it is.
Ordered a country club with extra cheese. Got a turkey and Swiss with nothing on it. No ham, no mayo, no extra lettuce and no extra cheese. Had already gotten back to the office when I discovered this. Only asked for no tomatoes.
Employees friendly, but do a terrible job cleaning. I rather deal with the long waiting at Fabulous Freddy across the street.
First time here getting a mani+pedi. I liked that I was seated right away upon arriving, and everything seemed to be going quite well. This was until I noticed a few of my nails formed bubbles as they were drying. I asked the person  to see if she could fix them, and she said she would maybe 30 minutes later.It definitely would have been nice to have gotten this taken care of right away. Waiting 30 minutes/longer for her to redo nails and then extra for them to dry. Not very considerate towards paying customers.Won't be returning.
This restaurant not with the times. Yes, this is a seafood/steak higher end restaurant but if you are a vegetarian/vegan guest you don't really have an option for an entree other than a pile of vegetables that lack any creativity or unique flavor. The main irritant is there is no substantial protein source, just a bowl of carbs in the fried rice to make it seem like a traditional entree. More health conscious omnivores who desire a flavorful cut of beef are forced to purchase a giant portion at 16 ounces - no adjustment can be made...we asked. All desserts contain dairy and/or gluten, so no treats for those with specific food allergies. When we walked out the door, we felt highly disappointed. If this restaurant hadn't had a nice ambiance, this place would have earned one star.
Awful service, we sat ourselves down and ordered our own food on the table screens. That was the only way that we received our food. Our waiter didn't introduce himself, seemed like he didn't want to be there, and looked awful when we asked for some time to look at the menu. We waited 45 minutes to find out he forgot to put our order in. The only reason I'm giving an additional star is because manager Tiffany came by to check on our table and formally apologized for the inconvenience. Awful experience.
Fervente de la  cuisine vietnamienne, j'avais remarqué qu'un nouveau resto venait d'ouvrir à Ste-Julie, près de chez moi. Je voulais absolument l'essayer et j'ai persuadé mon conjoint d'aller y faire un tour. C'était un dimanche midi, nous étions les seuls dans le resto...Je me suis dit, pas bon signe car normalement quand c'est bon, les places de stationnement sont comblées peu importe le jour et l'heure que tu te présentes. J'ai commandé un plat de nouilles Singapour et mon conjoint une soupe thaï. J'ai également essayé les rouleaux frits. Déçue, très déçue de la présentation et de la saveur de ces plats. La serveuse m'avait avisés que les nouilles choisies seraient assez piquantes, elles l'étaient. Par contre, le plat manquait de couleurs, les nouilles de riz étaient archi molles et les légumes et le poulet en quantité minime. La soupe thaï n'était pas aussi piquante que telle qu'elle était décrite dans le menu et manquait elle aussi de saveur. Finalement, ce n'est pas le genre de cuisine vietnamienne que j'avais espérée. Je ne recommande pas ce resto aux connaisseurs.
Stopped in for a to go. The BBQ is pretty good, but the service is terrible. They sent me to the bar to place my order, no kidding the bar-tender turned her back on me as soon as I walked in. She started talking with her co-worker who was eating. I waited a few minutes, the did the ol' hello! She never smiled, never even said hello. Simply stared at me....no smile, just stare! I placed my order, waited and she brought it out, and NEVER said one more word, not even when I paid 14.00 for a plate of BBQ, 1 oz of slaw, 4 hush puppies, and three cold onion rings. First and last time visiting lancasters BBQ. And this is one BBQ eating boy.....
Can't go wrong with Starbucks. However, online it said they opened at 5:00 am and the store didn't open until 5:30 am. Crystal was obviously not happy to be working so early in the morning and it showed in her customer service.
This is our second trip to this place. Had combination platter. The shrimps are wrapped with thick flour, chicken barbecue & ribs no taste. The whole platter hardly have any flavors. General Tsos chicken practically soaked in water. Singapore noodle fairly dry. On our first trip, we thought we found a nice restaurant where we can visit once in while. Soup was great. General Tsos chicken, which is my favorite was good as well. But after this second visit, I don't think I'll ever be back. Sorry, they could have made some delicious meals for our dinner.
At $17.95 for breakfast, any buffet with half decent food is a great deal for the variety. I would typically pay a few more dollars for a higher end buffet (Wynn, Cesar's, Wicked Spoon) but with the holiday weekend all of those places had double prices breakfast buffets!The good:-ready made omelettes with standard choices of veggies and meats (no seafood)-the vast dessert bar including fresh made and glazed donuts, cinnamon buns, and croissants-they have mango lassis! (So random)The bad:-we arrived early and the buffet was almost empty. However, the hostess had everyone wait and created a long line for no reason. We waited 30 minutes; what a waste. -the sushi bar has no raw fish. It's spam and smoked salmon and sausages rolled up in some rice and seaweed.Everything else (eggs, pancakes, waffles, etc) were about average. Overall, there are much better (and more expensive) places to grab breakfast!
We stopped in to support them for dinner around 5 PM.  The place was clean and decorated well.  I ordered the fried chicken which I must say was steaming hot and deliciously tasty.  However, the vegetables left a lot to be desired.  I believe they may have sat all day without even a stir.  The sweet potatoes...no.  The steamed cabbage...salty.  The kids loved the chicken but the mac and cheese...they wouldn't touch it.  Way too much cheese that was not blended well.  When kids won't eat your mac and cheese, you've got problems.  I so much wanted this new restaurant to take off and be successful but I doubt, given the current state, this will happen. I am rating this new soul food restaurant 2.5 stars but cannot round it up to a 3.
I came in today for a gel removal on my feet, replacing it with a regular spa pedi/nail polish. It cost $5 for the gel removal and $25 for the spa pedicure. The actual pedicure was fine and came out how I expected, so that was nice. Now, let me get into the nitty gritty... When I walked in, I asked for a gel removal and a pedicure, and was directed to the pedicure chairs in the back. My nail tech started soaking my feet and then started to remove my polish as if it were regular polish. I told her they were gels, and she sort of huffed and rolled her eyes. I did not appreciate that; it made me feel like MY gels were a burden to her, even though I had said from the beginning I needed a gel removal. It ruined my mood, even though she did try to keep up conversation after that. As I said, the pedicure turned out fine. Here's the kicker! When I was done and went to the front to pay, I asked the owner if I could add tip to my total. He looked perturbed, and pointed to an ATM machine in the corner of the foyer and said that I needed to withdraw the cash for the entire payment. There were no signs that said "Cash Only" and I'm pretty sure they do take credit cards, so I was really annoyed that I had to withdraw cash and pay a withdrawal fee on their behalf. I would have liked to have known this beforehand somehow, and even Yelp says they accept credit cards! Overall, it was a decent pedicure, but I would not go out of my way to visit this salon again due to the poor service. My quest for the right nail salon continues...
It was Game Day ASU vs Washington so the entire area was busy.So many new options have opened in this area, however I kept my vow to just follow along. Although rare, I wasn't the leader on this day. I was a little heart sunk when our group walked right past Postinos, and a touch relieved as we strolled by Dickies BBQ, and then there it was... The Mad Hatter, I had been there before and it was always empty. Today the place was very busy with a patio extension and extra security. As we made our way through the place we ended up at a  great table on the original patio, smack dab on the corner of College and Veterans Way. The table was perfect, and the company was stellar and that's as good as it got.Our server was obviously not a regular staff member, he seemed like someone's buddy that just worked on game days. Initial beer orders taken and tiny paper game day menus dropped. The menu was small, with just a few items, a burger, chicken strips, French dip and chili cheese fries. I guess when your expected volume soars from regular days you have to do what it takes to keep the quality coming out of the kitchen. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. everything from the kitchen was barley passable to awful. French dips were bland with no flavor at all and the au jus was served in 1 ounce Jello shot cups, certainly not dippable, and the fries with mine were Ice cold. The Chili Cheese Fries were even worse because they looked disgusting and tasted like curry and were smothered in gloppy flavorless cheese. My friend said she was going to eat her burger but it wasn't very good, and the chicken strips weren't finished by a big 17 year old boy. All this served with no salt and pepper, no napkins or utensils and OLD broken, almost empty ketchup bottles.I know this place is almost always slow, It really needs customers and I think instead of turning off 300 people on game days they should try and wow 300 people on game days. Location for us was great and it was a nice gathering of old friends, at least we had that.
This is unfortunate because, ask me three days ago & I would've given this place 5 stars! Maggie is our favorite bartender around. We live right down the street, frequent the bar often, bring friends, and spend money. However, on the few times we've been in when Jaxx was working, we've noticed that she often seems intoxicated and has never been overtly nice to us...fine...it's a dive bar. But being that we all either ARE or WERE bartenders, we know how customers should be treated and we know how to take care of our bartenders. On one particular occasion, a group of us ordered 6 beers and 6 shots and were charged a whopping $110! A rip-off even by Snottsdale standards! After confronting Jaxx about the bill, an altercation ensued which moved OUTSIDE of the bar and resulted in Jaxx hitting one of our female friends in the face! It's such a drag because we live in the hood and LOVE this bar. Maggie works Wed-Sat nights...I recommend avoiding this place like the plague any other time.
5/26/17 around 10:00 am. Medyo mahal mga tinda nila compare mo sa ibang asian grocery store. Customer service is terrible. At the cashier lane, very long line with 1 cashier only. Seems like she doesn't care. She's didn't bother to tell us if another cashier is on the way or call a manager for help.
It's not a proper Indian restaurant. It's an americanised Indian restaurant. The food is not proper Indian food with Indian spice. And the price is also more. Not worth if you want proper Indian food.
Don't go after 8:00 pm. They just want to close 8 and you out of there. Twice went in late and all I saw was staff mopping and a limited menu. I won't spend another dime here. I recommend the Elliot/I-10 location instead.
Overprice!!!!!! Sooooo few taro balls. How come a few taro balls plus some ice costs almost $10. ????
Uhg. I have not gone to Chili's in a few years. The service is poor, food is so-so, and priced a bit high for what you're getting. And recently I tried them again.. they are consistently disappointing.Waited 15 minutes after sitting for drinks. Waited 40 minutes to order. Received food 1hr 15min after sitting. My burger was good but the onion rings were cold and mushy. Will not be back.For the record, I like Fridays, Red Robin, and Applebees.
I've had better filipino food.I ordered the garlic fried rice with dinuguan, chicken afritada and sago to drink. The food was disappointing. It was warm and not hot and lacked in flavour. I had to put salt and pepper in everything. The sago was the only thing that was good here. The place itself is very spacious and very clean. Love the colours and how everything is set up. Wishing I loved the food just as much as the space itself.
Tried it again and was disappointed. Microwaved patties...YUCK! I cant really remember what I had the second time. I am no chef but my food tastes better, sorry. This place is still better than Tasty Island though. Even though serviced and food sucked the second time , decided to return again because I was being lazy in not wanting to cook, but guess what THE RESTAURANT IS NOW CLOSED DOWN...but I am not surprised. Places like this usually do not last long. Food is not consistent and service can suck.
Take your pick: (Sunday evening, party of 7)-The absentee, surly waiter-The water dripping from the A/C ducts into our heads-The overly greasy pizza-The ravioli literally sitting in oil-The half-hearted oil & vinegar dipping mixture on the table-The high prices-The Slow service, despite being one of only five parties dining-The loud music that desperately screamed 'we're a cool restaurant...we promise!'
The only reason why the Garden Restaurant is worth checking out, is because it's open late (we went for dinner there at 12 am on a weekday) and because you can get vegan friendly chow. If you aren't going there because you need grease in the wee hours of the morning, I would avoid this place.Numero uno, it isn't real chinese food; numero deux, it is greasy as all hell, perhaps even too greasy. We felt absolutely disgusting after dinner.  The food arrives quickly because all the stir-fries are made with frozen vegetables. Several items we ordered from the menu were not even unthawed or the noodles were burned. You don't come here for a culinary delight. It's also waaaaaayyyyy overpriced for what it is. If you aren't vegan and want a late-night chinese food experience, I recommend walking over to China Town which is just a stones-throw west.
Bad service. Had been looking forward to try Pappy Van Winkle for months. When I went to order the waitress acted like I couldn't afford it. Insulted I still tried to order then she went to check and said it was out of stock. So I just ordered one of their mixed cocktails which tasted like any other.
I took a couple clients here for lunch today.I ordered a burger with bacon and mozzarella cheese and mashed potatoes instead of fries.My order arrived and instead of mashed potatoes, there were sweet potatoes.  I hate sweet potatoes so brought it to the person who brought our food's attention right away (it wasn't our server).  As I was eating my burger, I realized that there was no cheese or bacon on my burger but didn't make a fuss about it.  The burger and mashed potatoes were delicious.Two in our group ordered a brie and lobster sandwich and they said it was greasy (it's made like a grilled cheese sandwich) so they used utensils to eat it.Just before our server brought the bill we'd asked for, he came over to apologize (it's the first time he acknowledged the lack of mozz and bacon) and said that I was getting a free dessert because of the mix-ups. I didn't want dessert so passed on it.
Continues to disappoint... made reservations for 6 people and walk in and have to wait forever because as the hostess said, "people aren't leaving their tables like we expected"... huh? This isn't the first time this has been an issue here. Food is ok once it gets to you.
well I was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. I had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (I'm at the Golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My "short rib" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I'm not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey's pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. I'm hoping it doesn't go the way of St Francis where it's got tons of potential, but simply can't deliver
I went to see Cynthia S. Payne to get a renewal on my contact lens prescription. My regular optometrist moved her office to Henderson so I thought it would not be a big deal to go somewhere closer to get my annual prescription.  I explained very clearly at the beginning that I was NOT interested  in LASIK  and was simply there for an eye exam to get a renewed prescription.  From the time I walked in, until the time I left, the entire staff did their part to try to and sell me the LASIK  procedure. They had me do an unnecessary test which later I learned was used to determine if I would be a good candidate for LASIK.  Finally after my exam was completed, they had me sit with a LASIK  consultant/coordinator to go over prices for LASIK!  Cynthia Payne did an adequate job on my exam, but I don't appreciate the sales pitch, unnessary test, and the waste of my time for their own agenda. I was there much longer then necessary due to all of the sales pitch nonsense.  I will not return.
Confused is the word that describes the service here. Every time we asked a question, the first person we asked had no answer so they got "the manager" of which they seem to have a lot. We were ignored for a long time, then when a server came, she seemed surprised to see us. The back room was noisy and they had a TV tuned to the Amazing Race--so annoying. When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn't kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was "to-die-for!" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him. The wines were way overpriced and they had no dessert wines or after-dinner drinks. I wouldn't go back.
Ordered on my mobile app. When we got there, we paid and saw our pizza come out of the oven. Waited 5 minutes before the guy behind the counter got around to give us our pizza that was clearly sitting on top of the oven. He was busy cleaning he said.
We recently stayed at this hotel and were in a renovated room, except the bathroom. This is an epic fail. We paid for 4 persons in the room ( an extra $50 a person) however these fees did not allow for all 4 people to use the fitness center. I would think the additional fees should allow usage in the fitness center. Not a fan and will choose a different option next time.
The Pangoa is good but Its too damn pricey for what they give you. Feels like i'm being ripped off every time I buy. Especially now since they charge you a dollar for chicken (which used to be included). Even though they pass off as healthy, the sodium content is crazy with a calorie count above 500.
Seriously dude? This place is Nasty!  This might be the grossest casino I've ever been to in Vegas.I'd give it no stars if that were possible except for the fact that they have recently redone their restrooms!  In fact, the restroom in this place is the nicest thing going for it!!!!It smells like cigs covered up with air freshener, covered up with vomit, covered up with floor powder, covered up with B.O, covered up with plug-ins.  The smell is so strange and not good!  How about some air purifiers? That would help!  Some open windows maybe???Onto the gambling 1) they have some really old machines that still spit out quarters  2) they have some new machines that just take your dollars 3) they have table games that are like $5 min but really should be like $2 min 4) some of the machines are in such bad shape they've just duck taped them together [I saw this on a couple of instances] they have like old tube TV screens and everything 5) the people that go here...how do you explain...just WOW  6) valet was very nice I'll give them that 7) there's like a baseball game concession stand by the sports book that I found very comicalMy friend did win $45 on Craps-hooray!
Great burgers but they are never consistent with the poutines and milkshakes. I don't know if it's a lack of training of the staff but I was very disappointed in the milkshake I recently brought from there. I could have made a better milkshake in my sleep.
Came back to get a chopped salad. There was a gentleman in the back blasting his rap music in front of customers. Very unprofessional... plus there were two other gentlemen that were in the front who could use a little assistance.
My sister and I were very excited to try this restaurant as per the Yelp reviews and also looking for a gluten free Italian meal.Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. The server started off by telling us that we would have to wait 25 minutes for our food once we ordered. We were ok with that but as time went on, we ended up waiting 20 minutes for the menu, water and utensils.The male waiter could tell we were getting impatient and took our order and promised us ten minutes.Both of our dishes came in ten minutes but my sister ordered the bolognese pasta, not the rapini. They took both of our pastas back to the kitchen without apologizing or really saying anything to us at all. When they brought them back out, they still said nothing!  No apologies or explanation. The two customers who came in after us were served immediately and well taken care of.We went up to the bar to pay the bill, and once the bill was paid, they did not say a word. No thank you, no 'Goodbye! Have a good night!' And no apologies for any of the delay.To conclude, the food would have been a lot better if the service was better.
I have gone to this location twice to purchase a soundbar. The first trip the sales people went through 5 different soundbars all of which they couldn't get to work. I was in the store for nearly two hours waiting for one of these keystone cops to be able to get one of these speakers working. Same experience the second time. Nothing is hooked up properly. The staff has no knowledge of the product. This is sad
The smell was the first thing I noticed. It wasnt necessarily "bad" but it sure as heck didn't smell like a bakery. Funky is what I'd label it. Had a very mediocre bagel at best and my iced green tea tasted like vicks and marijuana.
Tried Thai Orchid for lunch today...1st time.  Order was prompt, hostess was friendly enough but the food was less than satisfactory.  We ordered Pad Thai with chicken, two egg rolls and BBQ chicken entree.  Both orders contained chicken but are cooked very differently...both were extremely overcooked.  The chicken was very dry and neither of us ate it.  I will try again as this restaurant had great reviews, perhaps we caught them on an off day.
This place is pretty cool but there are quite a bit of shortcomings. Expect a cross between Chuck e Cheese & Dave and Buster's. A group of my friends came here after buying the Groupon deal for all day arcade play. The bar was such a nightmare. I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left. They had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken. More often than not, one of the two controller would not work.  This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders.
I've had better... Portions kinda small. Not the best food and the people all seemed kinda stuck up in there.
Read numerous Yelp reviews singing praises for Lawry's lunch special and their salad bar. First impression: the place was a ghost town. Totally empty. Not a good sign.The "salad bar" was, no joke, 2' x 3'. If you're making a movie and you need a miniature version of a real salad bar, come here. I told my wife I thought I was being punk'd. The "lunch special" was a BBQ sandwich for $10. It was God horrible. Couldn't eat it. The meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside. The BBQ sauce helped lube it up but didn't change the fact that it was inedible.I returned that for the Prime Rib Sandwich for $16. MUCH better. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. The au jus was also excellent. But - $16? For a sandwich? Off a lunch menu? So, three sandwiches, a salad (which my wife enjoyed), and some iced teas - including tip = $72! Yep. Punk'd.
Wow this place is a hollow shell of what it used to be :(When I was going to high school in the early 90's, this was THE PLACE for records in Cleveland.  Their basement was full of vinyl, FILLED, with good quality stuff, upstairs had great posters and paraphanalia, and the walls were signed all over by visiting artists and bands.  It felt like a thriving place.  Couple years later -mid 90's - I visited again upon the suggestion of a well known national DJ who was then living in Cleveland, and again it did not disappoint.  The store used to be located at the corner of Coventry, up the street from where it is now.  I believe there was a movie theater next door, right?  Was it the Cedar Lee maybe?Fast forward to 2010.  I'm in Cleveburg visiting the folks and decide to check the place out for finds.  When I finally found it, I could not believe it was the same store.  All the vinyl was pretty much crap, scratched and water damaged.  Even the once legendary basement produced little worthwhile on this trip, and damn it was cold down there.  The clerk who was animatedly chatting with a honey for ten minutes, regarded me with disdain especially when I tried to get him to knock a dollar off the 5 $1 records I was buying.  That said, I did find a few decent records but in BAD shape.  What happened here? Rest In Peace, Record Revolution!
So we recently moved to Brookline and this place is just up the road. Having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... After two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza "well done" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. Sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won't be back..
I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You're kidding, right?!"+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? Enough said.
First I'd like to say that Nick and Angie have done a tremendous job bringing great beer to the burgh...this was my go to for one of kind, can't get anywhere else beer.  Sadly, I noticed a trend of serving beers under 7% in snifters a few months ago.  $7 or 8 for 10oz of a beer I can get anywhere else in a pint is just a little presumptous and overpriced. If you look at their draft list, there are few beers than make it into a pint glass now.  Snifters and tulips seem to be the norm. I'm sad to say I've stopped going to Caliente because of this.  While I love what they bring to the table and their pizza is really good...I can go elsewhere and spend less, and have the same experience and beer now.  I'd suggest happy hour if you want to try it out.  Half priced drafts from 430-630pm.
Brake line holding bracket in rear was bent, and brake line was off. Rubbed against tire all the way home. Took them 5 hours to tell me that the caliper was bad, and then the next day another 6 hours to complete the installation of another caliper I had extra. Front bumper was also detached, and hanging loose when I picked the car up. Also nice size black mark on the driver side paint. I trusted this place, after the reviews where awful....big mistake. Never hear bad things, about a good honest shop. Should have trusted this app. Manager was super nice, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I should at least get a free oil change out my awful experience! Lol good luck!
I knocked a star off.  Last time I went the fish was just not fresh.  I had All-You-Can Eat and they served salmon roe that was just horrible.  It's like the don't taste their own food.  If a sushi place can not serve the freshest food there is a huge problem.  I eat a lot of sushi.  Right now I am ranking this place at the bottom.  Sorry.  No soup for you.  6 Months.
The food was excellent, the location is terrific ,however the waitstaff and management on duty the night we ate there were either indifferent or inexperienced.  We were a party of eight and ordered appetizers, expensive meals, numerous bottles of wine and drinks.  The waitress had difficulty opening the wine bottles with the corkscrew, obviously hadn't done it too often. She tried hard and we worked with her but the food came out very haphazardly with big waits for some of us after others had gotten their meals. After our dinner we wanted to sit outside for an after dinner drink but the staff removed all the cushions telling us that rain was predicted. Not sure what forecast they were looking at but suspect people wanted to get out of there early.  By the way it didn't rain for two days. Also made to wait at least 20 minutes, we did not have a reservation but the place was not busy at allNot sure how long they have been there but if management doesn't improve they could blow this great location.
Got my lashes done here a few times. Ellie does ok but not the best. Wendy a temp did once and I really liked her only to find out she was a temp and doesn't do lashes at any other salon. Katie did my lashes the last time when Ellie was gone- and I'll never go back! She clumped together several lashes, I had clumps of glue in my lashes and they literally hurt! Tried to make appointment with owner, Tammie and when making the appointment he said "ok have you with Ellie at..." NO I said Tammie. Nice trying to pull fast one. Only 1 or 2 of the girls are nice that do nails and do a good job but they are too hard on my nails and they started to be super thin. So had to stop getting my nails done there too. Nice place though, clean and decent prices- oh be careful they will over charge you if you aren't paying attention. My friend got a fill and they had been charging her for a full new set for months till I was standing there and questioned it!
My daughter and I stopped on the way to work Monday morning. We ordered two bacon, eggs and cheese croissants, french cheesecake and a latte. When we got to the car we checked our order and our sandwiches were missing the bacon. I checked the receipt and I didn't think we paid for it. My daughter went back in to have the bacon added and pay for it if necessary. Here's where it goes south.... instead of hearing the bacon and adding it to the sandwiches the decision was made to add it to the croissants and re heat them causing the croissants to get very dark and crispy on the outside. Now what sense did that make? And why would you ever do that to those delicious croissants. Ugh... so rather than going back in we've decided to never return. The customer service was awesome until then. Oh and the cheesecake -didn't even taste like cheesecake. This was our second time here and we won't return.
Visited the Danforth location - solid 2 stars for me ! The place was clean and empty which I actually liked but the espresso was TERRIBLE ! ! ! !The barista made a good impression as if he knew what he is doing which raised my expectation for a good espresso however it was undrinkable.
The food is amazing, just like every other time that I have been here. The service on the other hand, not good. I love going to OG because I get my money's worth, but the waitress we had today refused to give us another order of soup and said we couldn't take any breadsticks to go (after telling her other OGs have let us, she gave in). In addition, there was a point in time when she didn't come check on us for 30-40 minutes. I would understand if there was a bunch of people in the restaurant, but we were one of the very, very few tables she was serving. Disappointed but will come back again. Hopefully service will be different.
The mentions of waiting and waiting turned me off from coming here for a long time. We went on a Tuesday night around 630p and there was no wait. I think we got lucky considering it had just opened for the night but in the hour we spent there it filled up quickly. Once we got inside I could see why there's usually a wait - the place is small! Our waiter was really nice and came by at just the right times. He suggested we order three plates per person. We ordered the tuna tacos, the flatbread, the wings, the fries and a sushi roll.Tuna tacos ($11); they come as an order of three. We got 4 instead for an upcharge I'm sure. Why have items come in threes when it's a sharing kind of place? Then someone is a jerk for eating the last one and someone feels like they got shorted one. These were good and I would recommend. They're two bites each. Flatbread ($10) was dripping with cheese and honey; should just be called a mini pizza. Not very refined and sticky. Korean wings ($9) were also really sticky. Don't order these unless you want to get up to go wash your hands.Fries ($6) were like truffle fries at any other place; similar to the ones at Good Food on Montford. Greasy. Skip.Queen Charlotte Roll ($10) was probably the best part of our meal; 8 pieces, I've had better but at least this was what we expected it to be. We ordered the fresh wasabi to go with this ($5). About a dime sized portion (see picture)All of the above plus 1 cocktail and 1 beer came to $72. Is this real life? The quantity of food is very disproportionate to the cost. We should have just stuck with sushi because at least the price on the rolls is proportionate to the size of the item. It was okay but I wouldn't come back here. The reason we finally came was because we'd received a gift card from a friend. In theory being able to order items from different cuisines sounds like a good idea but in practice all those foods shouldn't mix. We both felt off afterwards. Save your money and your stomach for someplace else.
Tried to come here last week and they said they didn't receive their shipment and had NO food to make anything. Came back today and they were out of halal chicken, tomato and straws. The wait takes FOREVER - don't come here if you are in a hurry. Not sure what's going on with this location lately. Never had an issue before but the last two times I've been here I've been very disappointed.
I used to come here almost weekly but the prices keep going up and the past few times the tortillas have consistently been hard and chewy, I got tired of asking for fresh ones... The salsa is inconsistent also, hot one day then like tomato sauce the next, too bad because this was one of my favorites restaurants....
Reviewing the Cajun Ahi Tuna Salad (Portabella mushrooms, sautéed carrots, and some other stuff).  I have been to Tryst at least seven times and each time I am very impressed with the quality of food that I receive.  This last time was a take-out order and I have nothing but complaints about the $16 salad that I just bought.Problems:- Quantity of greens is far less than eating in house- Quantity of seared tuna was also less than eating in house- QUALITY of Tuna was atrocious** (Most frustrating part)The tuna was low quality and had white lines throughout each piece.  These white lines are tough and are similar to the texture of ligaments in a piece of steak.  The tuna, the most expensive part of the $16 salad, was the most unenjoyable piece of tuna that I have ever eaten (cooked, seared, and raw).  I will go back, but only because I know of other menu items that are of quality... but I will not be returning as often as I have in the past due to the inconsistencies in the dishes (that I am more than happy to pay for, as they are of quality ingredients).  This meal was not worth $16 and I was not satiated.
Nothing a good "electrical fire" won't cure.The 2 stars are for the Pet Valu and the LCBO (both of which, it should be noted, don't actually require you to enter the mall. This is a good thing.) The LCBO looks horrible at first glance, but actually has a good selection of Italian and Portuguese wines and Port. Just don't come in looking for French or Californian wine. The Pet Value isn't my favourite pet supply store (there are a few independents in the Junction that I like better), but they're well-stocked and friendly.The inside of the mall itself is dark and dingy. There are a couple of marginally useful dollar/electronics/miscellaneous stuff stores. The place where you can get both a stainless-steel off-brand toaster oven AND a plaster statue of Jesus covered in blood is a special favourite. I wouldn't buy clothes in this mall; they all look flammable. The PharmaPlus is a decent drugstore for its size. The Price Chopper is dismal; dirty, wilted produce, and stocking is apparently done by poorly trained members of one of the lower orders of primates. They are constantly out of staples, especially if they go on sale.Good luck finding what they do have. The Zellers is just awful. Stock is hard to find, the prices are often MUCH higher than Canadian Tire or WalMart, and they will make things extremely difficult if you try to get them to honour their price match policy.The parking lot is huge, virtually empty, and if you are walking through it at night, kind of terrifying.Basically, it's a handy place to pick up wine or cat litter if you live in the neighbourhood. For almost anything else, you're likely better off walking south to Dufferin Mall or West to the Junction.It will be interesting to see what happens once Target takes over Zellers. That could  make the mall a place worth going.
We have been going to this market for several months and love the local produce. We love the Calgary Farmers Market as it just seems better organized and offers more selection. The landscaping company that sells trees and plants is truely wonderful and a big reason we go to this market.I was checking out the cool zenscapes with my tot so my husband waited for us by the coffee place with the stroller. He was going to order a coffee but the lady working at the coffee place told him to move out of the way and that he not stand there with the stroller. There were no customers and he was simply waiting for the three minutes I was in the zen booth so we could load the tot and drink our hot coffee...
They have added some vegetarian options to their menu, but it's still seriously lacking vegan options. The veggie burger is so bland... Play-doh has more flavor. However, my carnivorous family loved their Jamaican Jerk wings & onion rings. Also, they had happy hour specials on some of their food items, so it was 1/2 off the wings & onion rings. Nice atmosphere, lovely decor. They have live music some nights. I wish they'd offer more vegan options.
Mom and I stopped in for lunch today to try Bowl of Pho in hopes that we would find a new favorite. Unfortunately we were not impressed at all with our meals nor the service. When we walked in, we stood at the door for about 10 minutes to be greeted and seated. It was not overly busy, but being that it was 12:30pm, there were several tables occupied by business casually dressed people so it must be a popular lunch spot for nearby businesses. I ordered the deluxe beef pho. They brought out a large plate of bean sprouts, basil and jalapeños so I was initially excited that the pho was going to be great. But then it came out and it was not steaming hot. The noodles were all caked up into a patty shape, like they had been heated and just set into the bowl, all stuck together, and the broth wasn't hot enough to finish cooking them. The beef was disgusting. The meatballs being the grossest, rubbery, inedible things. All of the other beef was all fat, and there was only 1 or 2 small pieces of each kind. The broth was tasty, but there wasn't enough of it for all the bean sprouts and noodles. I can usually never finish a bowl of pho, but I ate all of the broth and was left dissatisfied.  She had the chicken and cabbage salad. She said it was tasty, but way too salty, and not as good as any other Vietnamese cabbage salad - and we've tried a lot. That's how I felt about the pho, too. Pho Thang Cafe downtown is much better. Go there instead for authentic and quality Vietnamese food.
Under new ownership and not what it looks like online. One person working at 4pm on a Saturday and it took 2 1/2 hours for two manicures. Disappointing, but hopefully they can get it up and running satisfactorily. Outcome was not the color I asked for but - re-doing it wasn't an option. It'll have to do. Disappointing at best. Bummer.
The service was less then quality in this restaurant. I asked three times for a cup of black coffee and the waitress didn't bring it. I had to ask the person bringing our food out. Additionally, the server did not check in with us throughout our time there. We actually needed to find her to get the check. The food was very good. Overall, not a great experience.
All burgers are not created equal... and Mister Steer's is on the mediocre side, which is why I don't understand what all the fuss and rage is about.  I really wanted to like this place, but the food didn't do it for me :(
This was my first time visiting here, and after reading tons of reviews of great this place was I was very excited to give this place a go.The service itself was good, very personable staff, and someone who seemed like one of the owners or managers walked around and continually checked on all the diners. Something I really enjoy when I go out to eat. They were attentive making sure our water was refilled regularly, and we were finding everything ok.My girlfriend and I ordered the "Fat Elvis ($13)" "Triple Stack ($10)" "MTO Breakfast ($14)" and a soy latte on the side. Based on appearance the Fat Elvis looked the best like something you would expect to see, triple stack looked like your basic stack of pancakes, and the MTO Breakfast a larger version of the Grand Slam from Dennys.I personally had the Fat Elvis, and it was great, bacon, bananas, nutella, peanut butter, sandwiched between french toast, and topped with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar, what is not to love. As far as the price goes though, I felt it was high for what you got, just that and no sides, which is the only reason we also got the MTO Breakfast to share.The MTO Breakfast comes with three eggs any style, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, spam and bacon, choice of wheat, Wonder Bread, rye or sourdough, mash browns. Plated looked nothing like the site had advertised, didn't look very exciting to be honest. As far as taste it was just how it looked not exciting, and for the price not worth it at all. The turkey bacon definitely could have been cooked longer, chicken sausage was dry, ordered our eggs over medium and 1 of the yolks had already been busted before hitting our table. Not sure if we had to ask for our bread to be buttered but no butter, just the jam, and the spam were 2 different size cuts, one was more like a thin crispy spam chip, while the other was normal. The bacon was the best part about the dish.The pancakes from what my girlfriend had to say was once again nothing special, and yet again for the price wasn't worth it. Could have went to iHop for the same thing.I know I talked a lot about price, but I'm the type who doesn't mind spending money on food as long as it is worth it, and it wasn't worth it.Maybe if we went with the other more popular dishes such as the Kentucky Fried Chicken, The Hangover Burger, or The Chicken in a Waffle. Our review would have came out different, but everything on the menu should taste delicious no matter how basic the meal is especially for how much they charge.So, based on my first experience I doubt I would return if it was my choice. But if I do I will be sure to make a follow up review.
This was hyped out to be an awesome dog park! On paper it sounds great... multi section parks for all variety of dogs, water area for our paw pals to swim in, what a place to spend an evening. The reality of it though... only one section has the pond so why bother making your way here if you don't play in the water right? However, the water is so dirty, that my boy did not want to step foot in it. If you end up here I highly recommend you wash your dog right after due to the swampy water.  All in all, I think this place has potential to be an awesome park, if the city is willing to commit resources to clean the pond so it doesn't stink like a farm.
Food was great, but based on the ambiance of an Outback Steakhouse was very overpriced.  This is not a great spot for a special occasion or any sort of romance.  Our server was unhelpful and didn't ever smile.  The restaurant was empty on a Thursday night.
I'll start by saying something nice.   They had a decent selection of music playing.  It was not all hip-hop which I liked.   The place has a nice feel and was not super crowded.   Now with that said,  since the place was not packed you think they would have decent service no? Well they don't.   It took for ever for me to get my drinks.   Not to mention when I finally got my drinks they tried to drastically over charge me...  I'm not sure I will be coming here again.  I mean, I know sometimes people make mistakes, but she could have at least apologized for it.
I really want to give South Point four or five stars - some areas are amazing. The front line staff, for example, were always incredibly friendly and helpful. The room itself was nice enough for a 4 star (though by no means as flashy as some others) and the location is surprisingly pleasant, only 15 minutes from the strip at most via I-15. However, I'm not going back. There were just too many minor annoyances night after night that weren't solved around our room. Alone, they'd be fine, but all together, it was enough to keep me from coming back.-The iron was broken. We asked for another - it took four hours and another call to get.-The blow dryer cradle fell clear out of the wall when I tried to use the blow dryer.  -They only stocked two towels each night - even after we asked for more.-They only stocked two pillows each night - they got that right after a couple nights...and so on. I don't want to be one of those reviewers who get into every problem, but you get the picture. Nothing that ruined my time there, but collectively it was just too much. On the plus side, the resort fee ($14) gets you internet access and boarding passes, the buffet is quite good, the casino ain't bad, and there's plenty of convenient shops (not for hardcore shopping, but picking up extras) within two minutes driving distance.
Status upon arrival: Hungover, Starving, Filthy, 3 hours of sleep.Even though McDonalds is known to be fast food as in fast service, we love to request our Angus burgers fresh upon order. (waiting the extra 10 minutes) Okay, so we starved more than we had to, but finally after receiving our food, the first thing my cousin noticed was how old the patties were. Little did they know my cousin worked at McD's for over two years.If your going to give us crap anyways, give a lame excuse instead of having your customers starve for no reason. This branch definitely failed to meet our hunger satisfaction.
Have been there twice , both times servers were unfriendly.  Never had the wings, but the sandwiches are small, not generous portions at all.  We had a party of 8, two separate checks, and the server added her tip in.  That is fine, but let us know instead of dropping off the check and walking away.
Let me start out by saying that I be been visiting this restaurant since 1995. I really like the atmosphere of the restaurant, and the food is good, especially  the pit roasted chicken. I have made it a must visit and never missed coming here the 20 something times I have visited the Phoenix area. But I recently visited the restaurant and had a very disturbing experience. I checked in with the hostess and was asked if so had a reservation,and replied that so did not know they took reservations. She told me that they don't in busy months, but do in slower ones.She said that she would be able to seat us ( my girlfriend and I) in 15 to 20 minutes, which I said thank you! We then stood and watched MULTIPLE PEOPLE come through the door and were all seated within 10 to 15 minutes while They continued to pass by us, and basically ignore us. After 45 minutes of patiently waiting I went to the hostess and asked when we would be seated. I was informed it would be about 30 more minutes. Finally 10 minutes later ( after everyone but us were seated) we were seated.( The blonde manager seemed really put off towards us, slammed down a couple glasses of water on our table, and rudely marched away!   We felt so DISRESPECTED , and killed the great mood we were in before entering the restaurant!  We decided this place did not deserve our hard earned money and got up quietly and walked out! I felt I should leave this review so other people won't feel the snobbery we were treated to. This is depressing to me because I bragged to all my friends that I have brought here how great this place is. Sadly though this bad experience  has soured me, and will not return. People should be treated equal, and we dressed nice.but must not have  met their snobby Scottsdale expectations...RESPECT PEOPLE
We went there to celebrate our anniversary. When we called to book a reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion. When we got there, no one congratulated us. No one seemed to care that we were even there. There were lots of staff walking around, but most of them seemed to be chatting amongst themselves. The food was ok, but not worth the $67 bill for 2 dishes and one drink. The jade exhibit was amazing and the atmosphere was good. It could have been better. We were interested in dessert, but got the impression that there was none, until we were asked after we finished dinner. I would have made room if I knew there was dessert.
Pretty overpriced. Had fish and pork tacos, the fish came in a gummy flour tortilla, and wasn't offered hot sauce until my last bite :(  it's not bad, there are just a lot of really amazing tacos in the city and this isn't the place to get them. If you eat here, skip the tacos.
We have been here many times (about once per month from Nov-Mar) this past winter.  We returned this year with our group expecting things like last year.  The food was still good (Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, and Seafood Fried Rice), the service was good.  However as we were just finishing our meals we were 'visited' by a roach crawling across our table.  Then of course we thought we could feel them crawling all over us.  We didn't of course, but did see more crawling around on the wall next to our table.  Gross and disgusting.  Pointed it out to the waitress and her comment was, "That happens."  No discount, no free meal, and no apology.  Will not return.  It's too bad because the food is pretty good.  No excuse for roaches crawling around the tables.
Was excited to check this place out. Service was very slow for a Tuesday night around 8:00. (Place had 4-6 tables with people in them) waited 10mins for anyone to come over and took our drink orders. O rings were average at best. Burgers had very little flavor, I got the smokey BBQ burger and the brisket was good but burger was just ok and cooked well done when I asked for medium) Food came out really quick, it didn't seem very hot or fresh. Will I go back? If I'm in the neighborhood I would think about it, but I wouldn't make a special trip. B spot is still the king...by far.
The only thing crazy about Crazy Jim's is people who have eaten there more than once. It's not so much that it's bad, it's very average. It's more that the prices do not even remotely match what you get.
After reading many sparkling reviews and walking past the big nose for a year, I was really excited about going. As expected a table of two without reservations on a friday took about half an hour to obtain. Unfortunately they slapped us right up against the kitchen, which made it difficult to hear what my dinner friend was saying. A waitress scuttled over in due time to take our drink orders and give us menus. My drink was delivered in a somewhat timely fashion, however the woman that brought it was not our server and auctioned off the drink. When our waitress took our orders, it took a couple of times to get her to remember what we ordered, and when I asked for a glass of wine to be served with my meal, she brought it right after I ordered it, before we even got our appetizer. In fact, I had barely taken a sip of the first drink that I ordered. The mozzeralla balls that we ordered were fairly good, although three balls and five slices of tomato seem kinda skimpy for 9 bucks. (they have increased their prices) When our mains arrived, I had ordered the sexier duck leg. The duck's outer skin was so charred that I couldn't cut into it, so I just peeled it back to get to the meat, which was super dry and impressively tasteless. The sauce that they poured all over the dish was also curiously devoid of flavour. The garlic mash potatoes that came with it were lumpy, dry and watery all at once, without an inkling of garlic. I decided that maybe salt would help, and our server was so inattentive my friend had to go fetch her. I put about a teaspoon of coarse salt on my plate, and finally resorted to dipping my duck in the balsamic vinegar and oil that they had provided for our bread basket. There was a mouthful that I had to to wash down with wine due to the lack of moisture. We both had coffee, asked for the bill, which turned out to be around 87$. I put in 100$, and she took the billfold and never returned with the change, which was probably the first wise thing she did all night, as there was no way I was going to tip her more than 10%. So disappointed.
We got very lucky as far as insurance coverage goes for new glasses, but without it, the prices here would've been absolutely absurd. On top of that, the quality of service here is pathetic. The employees are severely lacking in any sense of professionalism, courtesy, and even general knowledge of their own products.Eventually we left with what we wanted, but it took some effort to fight past all the stupidity to get to it. I wouldn't come here again.
UGH. My birthday dinner experience was NOT what I wanted it to be this year at Famous Dave's. Been here quite a few times and have always had great service/food. The bar was totally empty when our party of 4 sat down and Matt, the bartender took his sweet time getting our initial drink order. Food arrived and was tasty as usual, but even if something had been wrong, Matt never even really checked back to see how things were. We had a bday coupon that was visible on the table and he ran hubby's credit card without even acknowledging the coupon. When confronted he had a crappy attitude about it saying "well, I can fix it but it'll take like two days for it to be credited back, yadda yadda yadda." Okay, so fix it. That's 16 bucks off of our $85 tab, buddy. And guess what? It ain't going towards your tip. Had to go chase down a manager to take care of it, which took him all of 4 minutes. Being a server myself, I know how easy it is to reverse a transaction... and I also know how to leave the shitty attitude at the door when I show up for work.This won't stop us from going back to this location but if Matt's tending bar we're sitting in the dining room from now on.
Heard so much hype about Shake Shack, and was excited to try it. I got a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a small drink. My wife got the basic burger combo. This set us back around $25. For that price I expected much more in terms of quality. The burger itself was tasty but it was ridiculously small, and the bun was a soggy mess. The crinkle fries were below average and the soda fountain is behind the counter, meaning you have to wait for refills. I did not have a shake and I'm willing to try them, but I'll never waste my money on the food again. Smashburger has much better food, far more toppings, better fries  and is a bit less expensive. Bottom line: don't come here hungry and expect to leave full.
The restaurant was not busy with lots of tables available.  However, the hostess did not make you feel welcome and had us wait to be seated. Michael the server was pleasant.  The chicken and meatball sliders had no flavor and were mostly buns.  We traveled from Phoenix for a very disappointing meal.
Recently, there is a hype around Kingyo Izakaya, the Vancouver-based Izakaya that has recently opened a store Toronto. We have heard a lot of good reviews about it and saw plenty pictures on facebook, even from our friend who tried in it Vancouver! JW and I couldn't bring ourselves to miss out on this!Arriving around 7pm, Kingyo was not as crowded as Guu; the tables were placed fairly far from each other and there were not a lot of people.  Yet, for the same reasons, the atmosphere certainly didn't feel as lively. We were being seated at a huge table with live Kingyo (aka Goldfish) swimming in a fish tank that is embedded into the table. Very interesting!I want to start off by saying that the food at Kingyo comes really really fast. Shortly after we ordered, we had 4 dishes on our table ranging from Seafood don and shooters and sashimi. I recommend one to ask the servers to slow down like we did or else you will be way too overwhelmed and won't be able to truly savour the food.We started off with Mr. Sada's Sea Urchin Shooters. I was very very very excited about the sea urchin shooters because of the extremely pleasant experience I had at Chicago's Arami. Yet, I was quite disappointed with Kingyo's sea urchin shooter.My excitement sank when I saw the raw egg floating on top. But that wasn't not their fault, it was just me so I just spooned out the egg. Following our server's instructions and mixing everything very well, I took a sip of the shooter. The stickiness and taste of the yam was just not my thing. The next thing I realized, there was rice in the shooter and it was kind of weird! I know you are supposed eat the rice with the sea urchin and the combination is perfect when you are eating a sea urchin sushi. But with the yam in the shooter that created the slimy texture, it was just not right. Even though with the freshness of the sea urchin in the shooter, the whole thing was rather tasteless.Next, we had the Hamachi Carpaccio. This dish came with Hamachi along with salad vegetable and garlic oil drizzled on top. It was very delicious, but rather nothing surprising. At this point, we all know that garlic oil goes very well all kind of fish and we have tried this in many japanese restaurants. One thing I want to point out is that the fish at Kingyo was not very fresh. JW tried to taste pieces of fish on its own and said it wasn't fresh; it was the flavour added to it that covered up the lack of freshness in the fish.Then, we had the Stone Bowl Seafood Sea Urchin Don. This was also one of the dishes we looked forward to the most. Like sea urchin in a bowl of rice, can our lives get better? But, we were disappointed again. Although there was a generous amount of sea urchin sitting on top, the seafood don lacked a directing flavour; the seafood don had a very light soya sauce taste with a hint of vinegar. However, it was not strong enough to tie all the ingredients together. They were more like individual pieces that were put together by accident and did not really go together.We also ordered the Aburi Toro & Avocado 2Tone Battera, which we expected to highly resemble Jabistro's ebi and salmon oshizushi. Yet, we were wrong again. The Toro wasn't fresh. The balance of rice and fish was off and there was too much rice. Although there was a sauce that tasted like vinegar and a hint of garlic oil, the sushi was extremely tasteless. Very disappointed.Lastly, we had two sushi rolls from today's special menu. I forgot their names but I think they were spicy scallop roll and beef tataki roll. These rolls did its job by wrapping our meal with disappointment.Expected the spicy scallop roll to taste like Blue Ocean Roll from ND sushi, the spiciness from mixing mayo with sriracha sauce was blunt and tasted exactly like spicy sashimi rolls found in all japanese bentos. Totally not worth the $10 or even more.  The sauce on the beef tataki roll was quite surprising and went pretty well with the fried noodles-like thing on top. But the beef was tough and hard-bitten.verdict:not roastedWe entered the restaurant with excitement and left with disappointed. Everything was very disappointing. We will not come back for sure.visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/03/18/kingyo-izakaya/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :)
ARE YOU SERIOUS? Look at how much cream cheese was on my bagel. I was so pissed when I opened my bagel when I got to my work this morning. This bagel was a waste of money and I didn't even end up eating it... So I was hungry. You can always take cream cheese off.... You can't add more from work! This was my second bagel like this. I didn't post the first one.. Definitely should have. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because my coffee is usually good from here.
This review is for my most recent visit to Tryst.  Normally, I would probably leave a 4 to 5 star review (and maybe i will reevaluate and update this review on our next visit)The point of this review is not to highlight their food.  Honestly, their food is top notch for the most part.  Never any complaints here.  My review is to highlight an over served regular customer who made every other customer uncomfortable who walked into this establishment.  I understand that servers cannot control the behavior of their patrons, but to allow a customer to be beligerantly rude and disrupt others is not good business.  Some servers seemed to play his little game and egg him on.  Other servers seemed agitated with his antics but didn't do anything to handle the situation (and honestly I do not expect them to, I expect a manager to.)A huge part of how I choose where to dine is due to the ambiance of the place.  If I feel uncomfortable, chances are I will not be going back.  If my girlfriend is uncomfortable, chances are we are never going back.If this man wasn't there and/or was dealt with in a proper fashion, this would have been a lovely dining experience at a restaurant I have been to many times.
My wife and I came here on our wedding anniversary. There was a live country band playing and lots of people line dancing and having a great time.  Great drink specials and a good western vibe. We couldn't help but notice the excessive number of bouncers that walks back and forth on the dance floor as if they were making sure everyone is on their best behavior.  It almost seems like something is about to go down. I mean these muscle head bouncers had necks starting at the top of their ears. Hey Toby, Its a bar dude not downtown Beirut
After posting my updated review, I did receive a very nice phone call from the manager with sincere apologies and a full refund offered as well as an account credit for a cleaning service. I booked an appointment for a week from now so I will post an update once I'm able to comment on the actual quality of the clean.
My emergency room visit was fine, although it took two nurses to start and IV and several needle pokes. I am here to talk about their billing department. I received a CT scan because I had a serious headache (probably the worst I've ever had). When I left I told I would receive a bill in the mail. I received this bill shortly after and paid it (it was for $125). Now, FOUR months later, I receive a $493 bill for the CT scan on a paper that states I have no insurance information on file. I called the Dignity Health billing department number, but can't get a hold of anyone because their automated system asks you to input your phone number, but again my phone number was "not on file". I checked the hospital website and apparently  everything is billed separately and everything is contracted out, including radiology. I was not told this upon leaving the hospital and am irritated my insurance information was not passed along to the imaging company. This whole billing thing kind of feels like a scam and wouldn't recommend going here unless you want to be lied to about the billing process.
A burger joint hidden inside a dim sum place. That should have been the first warning sign!  We were a pretty large party of 19 and everyone felt the same way.  The burgers were average, the service wasn't great, and fries were just 'meh.'First off, the burger seemed a little undercooked. I mentioned it to the waiter, and he said that's just how they cook them.  The buns were a under-whelming. They were not even toasted, so for me, they seemed like plain buns right out of the supermarket.  My first bite seemed like it had decent flavor, but the taste of the burger just died after subsequent bites. I guess I just wasn't digging the 'Asian' flair.The fries were okay, but with the price of the burger, you'd think fries would be included!  Hey, it's Vegas right?If you measure service by how long between being seated, ordering, and getting our food,  service also gets 2 stars. Our waiter was new, and he had a good sense of humor, but it took 30 minutes to get our food!  It's just a burger!  Anyways, we don't live in Vegas, so there's not much of a question about re-visiting this place. Many more places to try the next time we're in town.
I visit the Concord Mills area often on business and have eaten at this Red Lobster location on multiple occasions. The food is usually fresh and good, but my issue is that that at 5:45pm, they can't seat guests because servers are not scheduled in to work. The restaurant had more than 50 percent of tables open, but I had to wait 15 minutes for a table/server. This has happened before, but no more. Today was my last visit.
Been going to Nello's for years, but after last night, I'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza.  My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...I was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone.  Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  Headed to Florencia for a while....and so is my $.
I went to this location on my lunch break around 4 PM it's literally 4 buildings down and by the time I made it back 2 minutes later my food was cold and my chips were stale I don't get off until 9 so I couldn't take the food back.
"To him who has nothing it is forbidden not to relish filth."alright, so i'm off transit because turnstiles make me nervous, not in a life is a traffic jam, 'down with turnstiles' hippie sort of way, but i'm actually too incompetent to operate a turnstile and no longer trust myself not making a complete ass/ fool of myself while some transit lady (bless her, she's trying) shouts out instructions that i don't understand, and i  end up feeling like an infant/subterranean homesick alien. i could never perform two tasks at once, and i haven't had much experience with modern technology, coming from a city that was previously stile -free (unfortunately, style free as well), and so i can't insert the card (then grab the card) and turn the stile all at once, i'm always too late..   or at least i'm 0 for 3 since getting here, which is enough of a sample size for me, along with my neurosis, to walk everywhere for the rest of my life.
*only reviewing the lunch special/service*The quality of food and service lives up to its name. I was here with 9 guests and each dish came out separately after 1.5-2 minute intervals (hence waiting 15-20 minutes until we could eat together).The salad was lacking dressing and the bowl had too much water (although good to know they wash the salad). The miso soup was barely warm and rather gritty (see attached picture once it settled). The 'chicken teriyaki' bento box was rather disappointing. The chicken is served on vegetables and due to a lack of sauce, almost resembled chicken fajitas. The tempura was more oily than most places and even the size of the shrimps was quite disappointing (see picture of baby shrimp). The California roll was average, which is shocking, since KaKa boasts about 'premium sushi flavors'.  Even though this is a lunch special, for 13.99 the quality should be there. The sushi place previously here (Sushi Queen) served better quality food and similar portions for 8.99. Yes the interior of this place looks improved but there is no excuse for taking more than 1 hr to serve a mediocre lunch special!
went to pet planet and this time it is 3 strikes and you are out! 1) we called about using the self bath for our pups and no one called us back for 2 days!  2) we showed up today to purchase the same dog food only to discover they no longer take AmX, but the SAME food had gone up 20% in 4 months; that's 3. We want to purchase at smaller businesses, but no more!
What to say about this place didn't really get a try the pizza too much after waiting 40 minutes for the food they made it wrong the couple bites that I had I was not impressed at all Italian beef that's horrible I think I could have got better sandwich at Arby's the Greek salad was very small mediocre dressing had no flavor the tomato soup tastes like something out of a can overall very disappointed only thing it made it worthwhile was the manager comp in the mail and sending us home with a spinach pizza tried that one was not very good but thanks to the manager I will give it another chance maybe in a few months after they've been open for a while
This joint is mediocre. The food is cheap, and you get what you paid for. I've been here a few times with other people and have always left unimpressed. I really can't understand what people find appealing about this place.
Wasn't a huge fan of this place. I love wings so I was excited to try it out. They were out of the flavors we wanted so we settled for something else. I ordered the Garlic Parmesan and one other flavor. They didn't look too appetizing and tasted okay. Needless to say, I probably won't be returning.
Disappointed.  Overly priced and boring except for bread and Alfredo sauce. Pasta was overcoked and eggplant tough. Wasn't a good value.
It's pretty good... Except, there are always fish eggs wrapped up in even the vegetarian ones. Not a nice surprise.
Had a massage with Ericka. Although the massage she provided was skilled and effective, I was unimpressed with her ability to connect with me as a client. I feel it is important to provide a great massage as well as make your client feel comfortable, which she was unable to do. At the end, she asked me to pay for a 90 min massage even though I had a 60 min massage. I had to correct her and her response was that "I needed a 90 min massage".  I'm giving my experience two stars because the massage itself was good and I was able to schedule on short notice.
The first and second time my gel nails and pedicure turned out ok, but the last time it was the worst job I've ever gotten. I went in on a Tuesday and my nails were chipping the next day. By Thursday it was worse. I went in so they could fix it, and they did it without a problem but the next day they were chipping again. They rush with their services and just do a bad job overall.
Drinks and food look great, colorful and different from anywhere else but honestly the quality is not that great! I'm not sure if it's because they just opened up and they were busy but it took a while for food and drinks to get ready and then they forgot to add veggies to our food box. Drinks were kind of tasteless!
I generally like the food I order from here. My calzone this time was a little more bread than I'd like, but by the time I got to the good part I was happy. My issue is that I don't remember the last time this place didn't mess up some part of my order. This time I wanted italian crust, got regular, making it bland. Last time I didn't get any marinara, again making it bland. The time before that I got the wrong meat. The time before that my friends didn't get their salads delivered in our group order. It goes on. I don't need a perfect meal every time, but always having some part of my order messed up by them sours my experience. Their inattention to detail is more consistent than their ability to make a simple meal.
I really wanted to like this place and I had it bookmarked for quite some time now. However, after we sampled a few things on the menu we just were not big fans of this place. We ordered some XLB, steamed pork dumplings, shrimp dumpling, lo menu, and fried rice. As you can see, we ordered a lot. Unfortunately, none of it was very good. I would say the best things were the streamed dumplings. It's hard to mess up fried rice but theirs just really didn't have much flavor. This almost sums up the whole meal. Nothing truly had a lot of flavor. It was all kind of bland and dull. Probably won't return. Service was really nice though.
This location skimps on the cheese of the Extra Most Bestest. Especially when compared to the Cheyenne and MLK location. Go there instead.
I'm so very, sincerely disappointed to say that the service has fallen off here.  They're not much better than Audi Charlotte now  :-(  The waiting areas are still superior, but wait (and wait, and wait, and wait) you will.Took in for a recall on a Tuesday thinking I'd be waiting because I'd already been told there were no loaners available.  Out of date food options in the waiting area upstairs?  Fail.  After waiting for over two hours I'm then told that it's worse than they thought and I can't drive it so will have to get a loaner.  (sigh)  When I scheduled my service a few days prior I had been told there were no loaners and is why I had to wait for this recall service to be done.  So now magically there is a loaner?  Ok?  So off I go thinking it would be the next day (Wednesday) but learned on Wednesday that it would be Thursday.  Then Thursday came and "they found a burned wire and needed to order it" so would be pushed to Friday.  Then when Friday came, the story was that the repair wouldn't be made in time for me to pick up the vehicle so would be Monday.  Then Monday morning I'm told it won't be ready till 4:30pm?  What exactly are you doing to my vehicle??!??  I no longer trust these people and I hate that.  Why must they do business in this manner?  I was so happy with them on Wednesday GGGRRRRR!Good grief!??  How is this any kind of service?  How is this any better than the bu11sh!t runaround one expects at Ford or Chevrolet??  It could just be so much better if anyone actually gave a sh!t.
This tiny shop is located in the Golden Nugget lobby and has nice-looking displays and a huge nugget of chocolate you can spot from a distance. The only thing that's different about Chocolate Box is the Golden Nugget branded chocolate bars you can buy as gifts and souvenirs. Other than that, many items are standard and you can get at other stores. In their glass display at the counter, they have truffles, cupcakes and macarons. In addition to chocolate, they had gummy candies-with their store label-nothing to write home about. They also have ice cream and I was so excited to try some but it was outright nasty. There are only 4 flavors available and the texture was grainy and not smooth at all. Taste was alright but it was also melting as soon as I got it. They also had candied apples that looked amazing but for $10 a pop and after my ice cream experience, I passed. A clearance section is also offered for of course the items that will go bad within the next few months. The concept is great but execution is subpar. Customer service was ok but I probably won't stop back in.
Went for the famous cod fish sandwich! Don't waste your time or money... The fish was cold and it wasn't even fresh fried but baked in a cool oven or warmer. So disappointed....the fries were at least average. Wait till the famous fish is over!
I only gave two stars because their tea is quite tasty and they always have new, interesting blends. Unfortunately, their sales people are extremely pushy to the point of making the shopping experience uncomfortable. This Teavana location is the closest one to me so I've been here several times to get refills on my favorites. Every single time they have aggressively tried to sell me more tea, tea tins, rock sugar, etc. What finally pushed me to write this negative review was the experience I had this past weekend which left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. On the clearance rack, they have some teas marked as 75% off and sold in larger quantities. A friend and I were curious about one of those teas. I remarked to my friend that I was interested in trying that flavor since it was 75% off but I didn't want to be left with 8 oz if I didn't like it. The sales person told us we could get that flavor in a smaller size. I decided to get 2 oz. It was only later when I checked the receipt that I realized I had been charged full price for those 2 oz. If she had let me know upfront that the 2oz size wasn't eligible for the sale, I wouldn't have purchased it. The whole event felt kinda slimy because I know the sales person (who was hovering the whole time) heard me say that the 75% off offer was one of the reasons I wanted to try that tea. During that same visit, the same sales person asked me 5 separate times (yes, I was counting) if I wanted to buy another 8 oz to get to the 16 oz required for their 20% discount. I figured after I declined the first two times she would stop asking.
The food is always good but I spent 20 minutes placing a pick up order using the app and it wouldn't let me pick a pickup time for today. so I phoned and the choice for talking to a manager just took me back to the main menu. Finally got a manager and was cut off. Finally got the manager back who would take my order but had no interest in fixing the app. "I don't know anything about that but J can take you order over the phone."
The food used to be good but it has gotten cheap and lousy.  The room has no real vibe either.  Sorry but I'm out.  There are way to many good places to go to waste my time and money
GVR endeavors to be included in the conversation with the finer luxury brands in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, it becomes immediately apparent that the staff is trained and ruled by the same Station Casinos management philosophy that oversees local day casinos at the four corners of the valley. The property staff is transactional in nature, robotic, and mired in bureaucracy.For a more satisfying customer-centric experience I recommend paying a little extra and staying a classier establishment.
I've heard that their tamarind soup is phenomenal but I wanted to be adventurous and get something different and you know what, this was one of the times I wish I hadn't.  I had the V6 (one of the vermicelli salad noodle bowls with an eggroll and garlic pork) cause somebody had uploaded a picture of it on Yelp and it looked so delicious.  Or maybe I just thought it looked delicious cause I was starving, so that's what I got.  It was bland.  And I was disappointed.  I don't really have much else to say about this place cause I was just so upset at how bland my food was.  If I ever go back, I will try their tamarind soup, but I'm sorry, nothing else.
We saw the episode of Bar Rescue and wanted to check this place out. Had never been in it before so we have nothing to compare its "remodel" to other than the pictures on Yelp. We also read the prior reviews so we went in totally unbiased. We went on a Saturday about 7pm and immediately found seating at the bar. Place wasnt very busy so the service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Coors Light draft and wife asked about their cider beers and bartender said they only have one. Which is weird because on Bar Rescue they devised a specialty drink for them using a cider beer! It wasn't even offered or suggested. So, my Coors came and her only choice of a cider beer. The Coors didn't taste at all like Coors and when I pointed that out to the bartender she said others had said the same thing that day and that the lines must have been switched. Then why the hell keep serving it!! She replaced it with a Coors bottle. The bar was nice and they have a big picture of Taffer from Bar Rescue on the wall so they must have taken his advise on something. But couldn't tell on what or where. NO ONE was eating. The 3 or 4 local patrons at the end of the bar were definitely regulars otherwise I am sure that their loud, obnoxious four letter word shouts would not have tolerated. The female of the group was the most obnoxious. What a shame. Taffer wasted his time and money.It was one drink and gone.We wont be back.
I love that this place is a hold out from times passed, but it needs attention. The elevator was missing buttons, tape covering holes in the floor, light fixtures missing pieces, etc. In addition 4 of us were playing video poker at a couple of bars. They were both very dirty and the bartender at the first was argumentative with all of the patrons including us. Sad.
I am visiting Phoenix and decided to have dinner at this restaurant one night because it was close to my hotel. The food was ok and the service was also ok. Nothing to write home about but acceptable. The portion was a bit on the small side, but the food came out really fast! So if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and you are not that picky, this may be your spot. HOWEVER, do NOT go there if they are busy. I went back a day later with a friend and colleague for lunch, and because of a conference that is was in town, the restaurant was packed. I understand that it is hard to provide good service when it is busy, BUT even accounting for that, the service was really unacceptable. First of all, they put a glass of ice in front of us. Not water with ice, but literally a glass ice with a thimble full of water. We couldn't drink anything out of the glass and so we asked if they could dump the ice and give us some water The waiter actually said no!! He said he was too busy to do that. I was speechless. Then they brought our main meal, which came out fast, but we did not get our soup. We had to ask for it twice and when it arrived, one person only had some lukewarm broth. The spring roll was also lukewarm and soggy. All in all, it was NOT a very satisfying meal. Then they brought the check on our table when we had barely started eating!! I am giving this place two stars because my experience in the evening was ok, but I would give them no stars for lunch.
This is a great place to come enjoy some great food however, this time was not as expected. About 3 problems with food , we didn't get refills we had to ask who our server was after getting our drinks.  The visit got better when we talked to the manager(Angela) who made sure every problem we had was fixed. Then we got our waitress Sydney who helped save the day along with Angela. Hopefully that girl who was supposed to be our server, gets a reprimanded for the lack of  customer service skills , bad attitude she provided.
Just ate what I could from ordering take out from this location.  Barbecue Mac with braised pork, it was soooo hot it almost caused blisters on my tongue.  I looked at my receipt to see if somehow it said ghost pepper barbecue mac, it didn't.  I called and told them they said it was probably the marinated pork, marinated in what, ghost peppers?  Could enjoy just ate around the sauce and pork, the garlic cheese bread was good though.  Thinking about it, it might have gotten hotter as I watched it sit completed on the counter and not bagged until I got someones attention.  There seems to be plenty of staff just none doing anything with the exception of one cook and the girl taking orders.  Customer service is not high on the priority list for this Noodles and Company location.
I think Circus Circus runs this place to handle the overflow from would be guests who can't  pass the Circus Circus entrance exam or something.  After all, they must have  "some" standards at Circus Circus.  Quite a strange crowd to be found under its roof.  I can brave it for the cheap beers and easy in, easy out, which earns it two stars.  Not much else of interest here to me.
The food was good, though my Caesar salad didn't have any dressing on it, and the service friendly and we enjoyed our dinner. The two stars is because after eating we went to the patio to have drinks with a friend. At the bottom of my beverage was one of those silica DO NOT EAT packets.  I was horrified and waited for the server to come back but eventually decided to just leave. How does something like that get in a drink?
Great selection for seating, fun location, cool vibe, yet lacking in more ways than one. Strangely slow service even when there was little traffic, servers were noticeably uneducated on the menu items, and our meal was totally different than what we expected. No ingredients are listed on the menu. At all. Sure they're pretty simple dishes, but who really likes a surprise when you've been waiting for your food? Not planning to return.
Wow, what happened here!? I had heard that Giuseppe left and much of the staff with him. Now the place is a shadow of its old self. No cocktail menu, because they wantyou to focus on the wine. That would be cool if the wine list were longer, I guess. The area needed the cocktail bar that was the old Livermore, not this new business when we have Dinette and Taglio for Italian style food. They do have more filling food now and it looks a lot like the Bar Marco menu but vaguely more Italian. I'm sure it's fine but I don't really care to try it because I was coming here for a cocktail before dinner elsewhere. Thankfully, they made me an "off menu" Last Word from the "off menu" list of five cocktails they still make. It was fine, but I won't be back since I came here for the drinks and Giuseppe. I'd give up one or the other, but to lose both changed this place for the worse.
I wanted to like this place.  It smelled awesome and we don't have many southern food concepts here. The service was sloooowwwwww.  Was seated and it took 20 minutes to get a drink. Not many patrons dining  on a Thursday night at 7pm, which can be a bad sign. Literally only 4 tables filled and few people at the bar. Staff seems inexperienced. Friendly, but not with it. Received the wrong starter. Fried chicken was ok and overpriced for sure. After all, it's fried chicken. Grits were disappointing and needed hot sauce. I lived in the south and this pales in comparison to the worst places I've been. I suggest the chefs go back and gain inspiration to update their recipes or improve kitchen quality. You're missing a lot of opportunity.
Thought it would be a good idea to try NYE here because we had concert tickets at the Events Center. The food was ok, but not worth the price. A much better on- line presence than the actual payoff. Drink menu was actually fairly small...just overall not anything that would bring me back. With so many other options and better food and drink at better prices...I'll be moving on from the RX Boiler Room.
Pros:Nice bathroom and large jetted tub.They did bring up an additional blanket and shampoo quickly when we asked.Cons:  Plan on walking through tube alotPlan on paying for taxisPlan on getting charged a $22.50 resort charge per day.  I complained about the resort charge and eventually got them to refund the charge.  I would never stay somewhere off the strip again.  It was a blunder on my part and I didn't factor in all the extra expenses of staying somewhere off the strip.  The buffet was dingy and had old food.  You could taste the staleness.  I also got a little sick after eating there.  The free wi-fi is only for speeds of 256k - that's just too slow.  They'll charge you extra for a reasonable speed.  The hotel is already expensive enough, this is blatant gouging.Maintenance:  I stayed there 3 days.  There was a light with a burned out bulb.  I reported it to 2 different people on the front desk and it was never replaced during my stay there.
Ate here as we were at a conference and did not have a bunch of time in between sessions. It is just ok not great not horrible. The free popcorn was yummy and the perfect amount of salt. The chicken fingers I split with a coworker were extremely overcooked and dry. Ok when you are rushing between sessions.
I've been here twice now. The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. I ended up only ordering a shake. I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). I was not impressed. I'm not sure what was weird about. The sauce? The cheese? I've had way better pizzas. Loved the milkshake. I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him.
We went here for my friends birthday and the food was very average. My friends had the fish tacos and claimed they were extremely dry. I had the veggie burger and it was also extremely dry. Overall the food lacked flavor and honestly aesthetic as well. Probably would not go here again.
This chipotle location needs to get it's $hi together. They may have hired new employees. Maybe. So if you know the chipotle concept, it's like an assembly line. You walk up to the first person, give your order, and she starts it. Burrito? Meat? Beans? Rice? Then to the next person. Type of salsa? Cheese? Lettuce? Then on to the cashier. It's a simple process. Right? But...what if there's a missing ingredient like lets just say, steak? Does the process stop? As the line starts growing and growing, do you just wait? Employees are just waiting. People are waiting and the line keeps growing. What do you do? The cashier starts to clean counters bc we are all waiting! The right thing to do is to try to keep the process going. Examples should be like: The cashier starts ringing people up, having the ones who are waiting for steak move to the side, tell other people who are waiting in line that there is a wait for steak, maybe it will make them change their mind to get a different meat, work on orders that are non steak related. These are great ways to move the process along and create efficiencies! The workers were like deer in front of the headlights bc there is no steak and they had no idea what else to do, but to wait and have the line grow longer and longer. The wait for steak was about 5-10 minutes. When we got there, it was about 4 customers. By the time steak was finally available and they were able to continue the assembly line, the line grew triple the size at least 12 customers. I give it two stars because the food is still good and always consistent. Seriously though, they need to figure how to create efficiencies as they are probably busy all the time due to it's location.
I have no idea what kind of crack people are smoking in Phoenix. This was the most vile meal I've had in a long time, and without a doubt the worst "Thai" restaurant I've ever been too.In all my life I've never sent a dish back to the kitchen, but my "drunken dragon" noodles were so beyond recognizable as food, they had to go back. I have no idea if the kitchen staff accidentally dumped a box of cleaning detergent on it or what, but everyone at my table agreed that it was not edible.My aforementioned dining partners, luckily, didn't have quite as bad an experience as me. However, they certainly didn't seem to enjoy their dinners and commented on how bland the food was.As for me, I wish my food was bland. It sure beats the taste of bitter, burnt plastic that overwhelmed my poor noodles.2 stars because the server was super nice and didn't charge me for my dinner without me having to ask. And he offered a free beer as an apology. However, it came in a glass that had lipstick all over it.Gross.
I used to love this place, it was like coming home for breakfast. Unfortunately it's lost its charm. Service is seriously lacking, food is mediocre and there are huge air vents blasting cold air on your food (even in the winter) It's extremely frustrating to be served cold syrup for your pancakes ( that are also being blasted by cold air) cold air, cold syrup, cold pancakes, cold food. The dining room smells like musty carpet. It seems they've lost interest in making this place great. I seriously doubt that Triple D would ever visit this place again. The outside is nice but not worth paying for overpriced food just for picnic charm. I'm sure this could all be remedied with some decent management. Truly sad. I gave it a 2 because the last three visits have been nothing but disappointing.
Friendly staff, food mediocre at best. Not all printed menu item available on a Friday night. Pastas were ok but very greasy, burger was decent but expensive. Very small mostly all Northern Italian wine list. Since I am no expert, asked for help from my waitress, telling her what I was looking for. She smiled and recommended the two most expensive wines on the list. She had not tried them. But I should? The vintage was printed wrong on the list when  the wine came but she did not notice. Looked up a few of their wines on wine searcher. Markup is four times retail, not wholesale. Quite a gouge. They seem to try hard to be hip and cool but just come off pretentious. We will not return nor recommend this place. You've been warned. Go to Lola.
My order here arrived fast and was passable but it just felt so slapped together. Really not good quality Chinese food. It's Americanized so much it hardly has any flavor or anything very good about it. I'm gonna say if you're ordering delivery, for me I'd pick another place around here. There are so many that are better than here.
We decided to try this place out because of all the good reviews. However, we were extremely disappointed because of the ***VERY*** small sandwiches and the fact we had to go to another place just after eating here to eat lunch again because their portions are more like an appetizer. And, I am 150 lbs and my wife, 120 lbs so we are small people with a normal appetite.I don't know how places get by with a $ sign on Yelp when this could not be further from the truth. Their sandwiches are more like 1/2 of a typical sandwich and very stingy on the additional items like lettuce and tomato (micro bits and pieces). I told one of the owners we were disappointed and he blamed it on the baguette company not being consistent with their bread sizes. Come on, if the bread comes in too small,  you don't just rip off your customer,  you let them know up front and give a discount or something extra.This place is so tight and out of touch with reality that they give you just a few tiny pieces of lettuce on the plate which they called a small salad but it wasn't enough for a new born rabbit. Seriously, to see it was to believe it...they had to try hard to tear the lettuce that small. So, if you want to spend $16 on one whole sandwich (two of their sandwiches x $8) to get full go ahead. But this place is off the list!! Don't get me wrong, the food tasted good, but the the prices per portion would make this place easily $$$ restaurant!  And, the people were nice but I'm not in the habit of donating to the success of restaurants without something in return.  No thanks!And, this is a legitimate review by an engineer and his wife with no ax-to-grind against this establishment or owners. There was another couple that came in with us at the same time. It was their first time too and they left with the same disappointment as us, and we both questioned whether or not the owners may be better at generating false Yelp reviews than they are at running a fair establishment.
I had my reservations about going to an upscale Mexican restaurant because we all know the best Mexican food can be found in Da Hood at a real dive!  However, against my better judgment, I decided to give this place a try!  NOTE TO SELF: TRUST YOUR DAMN GUT!  The atmosphere is lovely but the food is quite marginal!!  The food is a bit too busy with too many ingredients because they are trying to be upscale and different!  I ordeed the enchilada veracruz,.which was supposed to be a chicken and spinach enchilada with jack cheese and tomatillo sauce! There was little to no cheese, I could barely see the sauce and it had no flavor!! The only saving grace was the wonderful bartender who exchange my dish for tacos!   Will trust my gut next time!
NOT AUTHENTIC...Growing up eating the best mexican food from home it was a  disappointment to pay 60.00 for a family of 4. Food was  okay the price just was not right. Not a dine in friendly place. Refills are not free. I live really close too this place but i will not be a regular. Go to Canasta, Carolina, garcia on McDowell  and 35th ave. Pay the same with full restaurant  service. The menudo meat is good but they use  can hominy corn i know because ive used it personally  and know the difference. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH..
Our first warning should have been when we walked in the establishment and we were told by the hostess they only had one booth and it was reserved. They actually had  three booths and we were able to get one of them. The service was excellent and the waitresses were very attentive. However, the food left much to be desired. The ranch dressing tasted like tarter sauce. The rest of the food seemed to be of the frozen variety straight out of the freezer into the deep fryer.
Ate the chuck chili. It had so much salt in it that I could feel my ankles start to swell as I was eating it. The red neon decor was so loud, I thought that I was color blind when I got away from the intense glow.
I was very excited to visit this place after reading the reviews - I ordered the shrimp, Sonoran dogs, and the baby back ribs.  The shrimp was excellent, and this item would be what I recommend people getting.  The Sonoran dogs were fine, grilled bun is an added touch.  But where I think this place really disappointed is the baby back ribs - I would say they were downright lousy.  They were so dry and black that I went back up to the cashier and asked "is this how your ribs normally are like?" and the response I got was, "yes this is because the sauce is on the side".  I'm a patron of other bbq places in the valley (little ms bbq, famous daves, and even joes bbq) and I'll say hands down this is the worst I've ever had.  I would have been better off buying ribs at the grocery store for $20 and throwing them in the microwave under a wet paper towel in a brown paper bag.  Do yourself a favor and skip this item if you visit.
I'm a little frustrated with Bellevue Beer's push for constant change.  A few years back they were quite simply the best place to go for a variety of craft beers by the case, at a reasonable price.  Fast forward to the present - they now have a legitimate selection of beers but increasingly by the 6 pack and for less than reasonable prices.  Now you have to suffer buying overpriced 6 packs instead of being able to purchase a case of whatever you fancy, unless of course, you're buying a standard American-style "lager"...they still have plenty of cases of watery beers.  I voiced my opinion to the cashier last time is was there and he told me that there is more selection now.  He's wrong.  It's the illusion of choice.  They have a section for overpriced 6 packs (single type of beer) next to the overpriced mix & match singles beer section, both with the same stuff.  Basically, what he was saying is that you have a larger selection of ways to being gouged by a business taking full advantage of the new PA beer laws...to the detriment of the consumer.  If I wanted single beers I would go to a true 6 pack shop, a bar, or a local brewery - not some side of Route 65 pass-thru.  Get a new sister-store if you want to pull this off the right way.  I've been coming here for years (10+), typically stopping in to get two cases of craft beers at a time (one was usually the beer-of-the-month special) and going on my merry way.  You're losing me!  This isn't some walk-in store front.  You need a car to get here, and I'm taking my car and going to a different neighborhood (see: Buddy's, Sav-Mor, Duffy's, etc.) to get my beers by the case.  When I want 6 packs, I'm going to Mt. Washington (see: Packs & Dogs cause they have dogs too) or elsewhere.If Bellevue Beer's owner/manager could charge you by the ounce, sip, or smell, I'm pretty sure they would.  Wrong! And, also...Sad!
I would recommend Yellowtai instead. Same chef, much better food and environment. Slightly higher prices, but still worth it.
Came here and got a few rolls, jalapeno poppers, and udon. Was expecting it to be much better. Ordered it to go and after a few bites at home we threw pretty much all the sushi away. We've had sushi in many states and a few countries and this was by far the worst we've ever had. Disappointing. Customer service was good though...
Terminal 2 is where United is and I have been here a few times. Easy to navigate, but really disgusted with the tsa security. They check through my belongings with dirty gloves that they use to check others bags and touch other luggages. This is the most gross I've ever experienced because people typically change or get new gloves for each bag. Disgusting .. now I need to wash al my clean clothes over because of those dirty gloves with brown stains on it.
Hit or miss. The first time I went the food was AMAZING so much so I I went back for a second time in a week. The first time I got a 'build your own pizza' with Alfredo sauce and chicken. The second time I ordered the same thing and they forgot the Alfredo but put it on the side, okay fine it was still good. Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn't have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.) I picked up the food and brought it home and the "Alfredo" was literally warm milk with salt at the bottom LITERALLY! Needless to say, I'm beyond angry. The quality has gone down consistently since my first visit, I won't be returning.
Waaaay overrated burgers.The quality of the meat, which is what I'm looking for in a burger, is ok at best. It was cooked fine and with a decent bun, but instead of giving me 100 different choices of toppings and crazy burger styles, just make a good burger man.I'm always suspicious of places that cover their burgers in a tonne of cheeses, sauces and condiments...I feel like it's hiding how good or not good the burger ACTUALLY is.Plus they screwed up our order and it took considerably longer than it should've.
Holy Salt. Had the fajitas and they were beyond salty. Also ordered a shrimp cocktail and the salt was unbearable. Staff is gross as well and owner was drunk at bar.
I have been staying at the Flamingo every year for the passed 8 years. Just got home from a long weekend this Sunday. The Go Room's are the best bet, but I have to say  I reserved a GO Room 1 king bed and we were placed in the wrong room at the time of checking in. I had to wait a night to switch rooms (not cool). The newer Go Rooms are looking dingy/not cleaned. The wallpaper is coming off the wall's. The coffee shop line in the morning is out of control 45 minute wait for a cup of Joe. The Pool is great if you can get a chair. You have to be down there at 8am and wait an hour for it to open. People hold chairs all morning/afternoon that are not even at the pool. No free internet for hotel guest. The gift shop prices are out of hand. Sad to say that was my last stay at the Flamingo
I'd been to this location before, but this last time was the most disappointed I'd ever been with a Five Guys restaurant. I had ordered grilled onions, but they came uncooked. The buns were stale. The shake was thin and low quality. We ordered a large fry and there were barely any extra fries in the bag, which is not normal! They usually add an extra scoop into the bag, especially for a large fry.Aside from all that, the food is usually delicious and plentiful. I hope they were just having an off day.
I ended up overpaying. I went on Orbitz and got this as part of the package. I paid $15 with Orbitz and Grey Line only listed $12 for the Strip and $16 for Downtown.But I also wished I had seen the small stack of non-impressed yelpers here before I went to Vegas. I arrived at midnight and still stood around for about half an hour to get a ride when there were 4  cars just sitting around. The ride was like sitting on public transportation. The return trip was the worst. I had a 3:40pm flight; they wanted to pick me up at noon. Circus Circus is only 20 minutes away from the airport. I had to kill over 3 hours at the airport when check-in and everything took half an hour only.
After 2 years living in the area, I finally was able to swing by here and check it out.I came in, it was packed. but we were able to be seated quickly and ordered.It took a while for our food to come out but eventually it did. The waitress was nice but I had a few questions which seemed to trip her up. It wasn't anything too tricky though.The food was mediocre, passable at most. I could live without it essentially. I found the rolls I ordered bland and the soup the best part of the meal.I don't see the appeal to this place. I've got a long list of other places that Id go to over here. That being said, maybe I'm just ordered the wrong things because Wakame has been there for a while and the place is consistently packed....Maybe I'm just wrong.
Why do you allow people to bring their dogs into the store? It's VERY unsanitary... I literally watched this dogs hair shed in the produce... gross.
Eddie V's needs to get a grip.  They act like they are a high end New York or LA steak  house.  Not even close also the music in the bar is way too loud and not very good.  Really just a snow bird trap or pick up bar for lonesome Scottsdale types.
Khoury's used to be my favorite restaurant but ever since they relocated and hired a new staff, THEY SUCK!!! The quality of the food is still ok but the service is super slow and when I left I forgot my to-go bag, i called once I realized it was gone which was maybe 10 min later and they had already disposed of it, could you imagine if I had a full meal for my husband...which I usually do, I would've lost my crap. I almost did with the retarded girl on the phone. Once I told her I left my to go bag her immediate response was, "I don't see anything on the tables", instead of saying, let me check with the other server to see if he set it aside. Let's not forget that my server never once filled my water cup and took forever just to check back with me every so often. I was a party of 1 and it literally took me over an hour to get out of that place because the service is so slow. Oh and the restaurant was practically empty with 2 SERVERS! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER KHOURY's!! Needless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone and will only go at my own risk when I crave grape leaves. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT
I love being so close to Lee"s. However, several times the meat is fatty and with no or one piece of cilantro and missing ingredients. Please fix this Lee"s we love the place but tired of bad sandwiches.
Celebrated a special occasion here. Two of us ordered seafood dishes.  Both got sick in the middle of the night. Should have ordered steak like the others in our party - they were fine the next day.  Had seafood here once before when the restaurant first opened years ago. It too was bad.  Should have learned the first time. Will not make the same mistake again.  DO NOT eat the seafood!
Used to be a favorite of mine and my family. Whether it's due to the season or the restaurant budget, they removed pretty much all the reasons I liked coming here from the menu, and especially no more lobster bisque. Complaint from my family member is too much bacon and lack of clams in clam chowder as well as the lack of items that aren't farm raised. Very sad to say we probably won't be coming back to what was our favorite seafood place.
Extremely drunk 21 years olds everywhere.  Service is awful and drinks are weak.  Maybe we're just old but this place is so over crowded we won't go back.  We're giving it two stars instead of one because of the cute bartender.
I lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. Serviceable at best. Cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. Crust was ok. If you think this is the ultimate then I question your dedication to pizza consumption.PS: The spot is cash only, which is also annoying.
Came to this place for pho. It's a cool hippie joint. It's not the best or worst. So on to the review. The pho I got was ok-good. One size only, good amount of meat. Other than that good service. It's a joint where I probably wouldn't come back to to soon.
I went to get gel on my nails and I realized that the gel on my index finger was tearing off 4 days later. I went back to the salon and they nicely got it fixed... then that night I realized that the gel on two other fingers started peeling too. I don't think I will be back to get my nails done here again.
We live in the community and have gone here a few times. The menu is nothing to write home about, the food is mediocre, the service varies from a couple of amazing waitresses (I've never seen a waiter) to more very unpleasant ones who make you feel like an imposition and after they deliver your food, which takes forever, they never come back. Then, unless you're lucky and got one of the few good servers, then you'll have to hail your waitress for the check as if you were hailing a taxi during a rainstorm in NYC.
Came here for dinner since it was close my UMC trauma, and it closed super late.  When we arrived, there were no customers in the restaurant, and no staff in the front.  I had to yell out "hello" twice to have someone come out, and greet and seat us.  When we sat down, we had another staff come and take our order.  The lady that served us was a little pushy.  She kept trying to recommend a lot of stuff so we would order more.  We ordered tom yum noodle soup, shrimp pad thai, penang curry, pad see ew, and a steamed chicken dish that was similar to hainan chicken.  The menu had an error so it erked me that they mislead customers.  There was a section about that street food specials and noodles, and it said 9am-4am.  Apparently, it was 9am-4pm.  The food was good, but portions was small compared to all the Thai restaurants I've been to.  Service was slow too because we received our Thai Iced tea after we received two of our dishes.  The penang curry took a long time to come out too.Will not be coming back.
I didn't find very many options on the menu that sounded good.I ordered the hominy as an appetizer and it was very spicy and good.  I would recommend it.I chose pork chops as my entree and the sauce on top was very heavy.  The chop itself was tender and had alot of fat on it.  I wouldn't order it again.My friend had clams and enjoyed them.The ambiance was really nice and our waiter was cool.  But if it weren't for great conversation with an old friend dinner would have been a miss.
Salumi plate appetizer was great. Aside from that, I've had better pasta (and service) at the Olive Garden. I would consider returning for a happy hour, nothing more. Expected a much better experience.
I do not get it. I guess you can just be really healthy and people will line up (they do). But I've had so many bad experiences here. From bad service to bad food. Fries that are burnt beyond recognition. Hot cucumber in my wraps. Basically it feels like you're eating the same ingredients in every dish. I like that date almond smoothie though.
My rating of the restaurant is based on a recent dinner experience. My party ordered the farfelle, tortellini, and linguini dishes. We all agreed that pasta is not their strength. My linguini came with 4 pieces of shrimp, a bland cream sauce and some wilted spinach for $16. I've been to many restaurants in that neighbourhood and many of them are pretty good but this one is NOT the place to go for dinner especially pasta. Maybe that's why it was empty when we went in at 6pm. Service was friendly, although we had a wrong order, but it was taken care promptly. Decor is nice and chic. Bathrooms were trendy though lighting is very dark inside. And just a side bar, all but one stall had toilet paper available. All this said, I do think this place would be nice for drinks and desserts. As we were getting ready to leave, I smelled some delicious intoxicating coffee brewing in the background. I was almost tempted to stay for that if my dinner wasn't so disappointing.  And I know their cakes are pretty good if they use the same supplier as the location in Scarborough. Overall, I would recommend this place for desserts and coffee after a meal with friends.
Good soups, shitty service. Possibly the worst service I have ever head. The hostess is more concern with her hair the actually taking care of costumers. The price is high as well for what you getting. It's a shame, because the food is actually tasty.
Whenever I am in Toronto visiting friends, I always end up at Salad King, since it's such a fast, convenient, and tasty option. But, in Toronto recently for the St. Patrick's Day Parade, I decided to try a new Thai place. Thai on Yonge was passable, but I think I'll be sticking with Salad King or trying a different place next time. The restaurant is on the second floor, and we walked right by it at one point (we needed to look up to see the sign!). Once inside we waited a moment to be greeted by the only waitress, an older woman who did not smile once during our dinner. She seated us quickly and came back for our entire order in about five minutes. It was a Sunday night so the restaurant was not crowded, but service was spotty since the waitress was the only one working the floor. And, instead of using a tray to carry meals and drinks, she used a little cart which slowed down proceedings. A couple near us constantly tried to get her attention by just standing up and staring at her. The food was adequate. The portions were small and the flavor was just okay. I ordered the green curry with chicken, which is my go-to meal at Thai places. It was not spicy at all, and the veggies were minimal. My brother ordered the Ginger Chicken. I tried a bite of his and while tasty, it still didn't pack enough flavor for a good Thai dish. Overall, a quick meal but not amazing, with weird service. I'll probably not be back in the future.
I'm sure this salon has amazing stylists, but their receptionist unfortunately doesn't seem interested in booking clients. I called asking if the salon is open Monday, the receptionist said no, but sometimes. I asked if there was a stylist available this Monday for a cut and style and was met with silence. "Hello?". "Ummmm maybe one moment". Moments go by and I'm told Amy is available at 1030am for a cut. Great! How much is the cost? "Umm...." more silence. "Probably around 70, but I'm not sure". Okay well I'm not comfortable with booking the appointment without knowing the cost. My regular stylist is on maternity leave so I thought I'd try some place new - however this won't be the place.
The only reason I'm giving two stars is that they were able to get me in same day, the place was really nice, and had good prices. That being said my tech was obviously very inexperienced. My pedicure took over an hour, she did not clip my nails on one side, did not do the standard pedicure steps in order, the massage was only done on my legs and hurt, finally someone else had to step in to finish. When the second lady came to finish she thankfully cleaned things up a bit before applying the polish. I didn't do a design as I wanted since the appointment took so long and I was already late for a lunch date. I may give them another try but make an appointment with the tech who finished things up.
Me and the lovely went here on a Groupon buy and I so wanted to love it. Sorry to say we did not. We were seated by a very friendly host, next to a map of Thailand painted on the wall and the bar opposite. I felt a little like I'd been put in the back 40. Waiter was nice but a little clueless; I asked for a reco on what the house did best. He totally stammered and stared at his feet and finally said 'a lot of people get the whole fish'. Not wowed. A nice wine list helped but I have had better Thai food elsewhere. No kefir lime leaves in the Panang, no fresh basil...I get it was their version but I didn't think it was great and neither did the lovely. To top it off, stammering waiter man/boy brings the check and says did you want anything for desert? Um. No thanks. It would have been a pricey meal had we not had the Groupon [$40 food for $20]. $52 plus tip for just okay and not such a nice atmosphere? I say, meh.
I got the brisket sandwich and there was about 3oz. Of meat.  Texture tough and chewy would not recommend.
I do not normally give reviews. I just keep returning to the establishment often if I like it. So good reviews from me would never be seen. So for me to give a review I have to be angry and feel a need to address the grievance. So I have been coming often to Times Square Italian Restaurant and honestly I have liked every dish I have tried Pasta Emilano, Past Giovanni, Scampi Fraviche? or something like that and La Princepesa. I liked the dish this time also it was great. My friend had a problem with his dish and they promptly corrected it with no fuss to more than what I expected service at this point would be good. Being that was the case and I had to wait for my friends meal to come out I mentioned at that time I would just get a dessert when the meal came however the server Julie C. never came back or asked or checked in if there was anything else. Finally came by and when I asked if I could get a dessert said they closed at 10 pm it was a few minutes after 10 and I had been waiting for her to come by and take my dessert order. For this incident I took the liberty to express my dissatisfaction with a low tip of 1.00 as I never not leave a tip. I like the food, my friend likes the place so i will probably come back but I expect at least a reasonable attempt to be made that I have gotten everything I wanted to order. The most effective way to have avoided this was to come by and ask it we wanted dessert as the kitchen was going to close and needed to know so they could have it prepared. I have has better service at a chain establishment that I would rate their food much lesser but I go back there as I am not mistreated customer even if it is close to closing time.Edited review as email listed on their web site is: Undeliverable: Notice Poor customer service - negative Yelp review... This is not looking good
Came here bc I was craving ribs, I was thoroughly disappointed in the ribs. They were not fresh they were dry and tough. The brisket we had was good, but the beans were cold and the cheddar corn bread was just cornbread? Nothing special about this place, I had high expectations given the reviews and a friends recommendation, but I was disappointed. I hate when new restos do so well and then let quality slip over time, it's unfortunate.
Not a fan of atmosphere. I understand the hipster vibe, but the establishment should worry about the food quality more than the appearance. I would give it 1 star, but the food was okay...although it should be for the price.
Lots of potential... Horrible product. Only thing good here is the house chips.  My wife and I tried to the first time today and won't be going back
Worst service I have had in a while.  Who only has one sushi chef  and gives the Sushi chef and hour break.  Reason I went there for my birthday.  Waitress  said sorry but any other appetizers without a menu?  Reall?  Another person order an appetizer never got it.  Ask for another fork took 30 minutes.
I'm so sad that I'm writing this review. I had high hopes for this place. The inside is super cute, the boutique-style stuff they sell is darling, and the bakery goods were absolutely delicious looking. Most of the food we ordered was good. The service, not so much. Our order was wrong and the employee fought with me about it, saying I didn't order what I said I did. She was rude and unhelpful, and then said that we didn't pay for something that we had ordered and paid for. So I went inside to pay for it so my husband could eat, even though I KNOW I paid for it on the original receipt. I wasn't going to fight about it, and I wasn't going to let my husband sit there with no food while the rest of our group ate. Oh well. We won't be back. There are plenty of breakfast and bakery options in the vicinity.
Maybe it's just me but Dressler's didn't live up to the hype. Me and the boyfriend spent a date night here and while we've been wanting to come here for a while now, it was a really disappointing experience. The good: We made a reservation so wait time wasn't bad at all. We sat outside and the view was as amazing as people have commented. There was a band playing outside so the intimacy was pretty much gone at that point but they were pretty good and made the ambience less "stuffy". The drinks weren't bad at all. If you're concerned about prices, don't get a cocktail and do a beer instead. Cocktails average around $13 but it was good nonetheless. We got a free dessert, the Apple crisp. The boyfriend loved it, I wasn't a fan but to no fault of the dessert. The best part of the meal was the appetizer. We got the Cajun scrimp and baguette and it was delicious- they should make this into an entree. The bad: The entrees were just bad. The boyfriend got the New York strip steak with fries and asparagus and I ordered the ribeye with asparagus and herb potatoes. We also got the macaroni and cheese side dish. Both of our steaks were over cooked. I ordered my steak medium and the boyfriend requested medium to medium well. Worst steak I've ever had in my life. It was dry, too charred, and we didn't see any pink until the middle of the steaks. I've had better steaks off my George Foreman grill. I didn't finish my steak and the boyfriend didn't either and we always clean our plates. I literally had 3 asparagus spears on my plate. 3. I'm not sure why they would list asparagus to come with an entree if it's going to be a garnish. On the other hand, the boyfriend got a normal amount of asparagus. It was just like WTF. The macaroni was bad. It had basically no cheese and was not creamy. It got eaten because we were hungry. Our server was okay, just a little odd to me. He wasn't very accommodating and was very nonchalant. I could tell that he either had plans that night that he was missing out on or just didn't want to be working.  The ugly: Turn around time is horrendous! We ordered the appetizer and entree at the same time and we were left waiting what felt ages and it wasn't even busy. I was at the point of becoming hangry. We didn't send our steaks back because we didn't feel like waiting another 20 minutes and it was getting too late for heavy foods. The food is most definitely overpriced for the poor quality. Glad I came to say that I went but I will definitely not be returning.
I was interested in one of the new places of lakewood eateries so i took a shot at Something Smoking Cafe... Sorry bad choice :(    Ordered 1/2 chicken price was fine but that's where it stops... The chicken by itself was ok but as soon as i added the mustard barbecue it was like adding watered...very sour tasting.. I really enjoy mac and cheese  so i ordered  it as a side dish. BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste at all i think i took about 5 bites  waiting to find some taste but it never showed up so needless to say that wa the end of that i just put it aside and left it there..Than I also noticed ( homemade) cornbread  Sure glad i did not live in that family  it was horrible.;no taste again...So needless to say look for something soon and new to take over the store front.., I just dont see this place lasting very long at all .
Room was clean, but FREEZING! It was average quality overall. They did not turn our heat on, and we shivered the whole night. The service was ok, food wasn't good, but it's expected in Vegas. Seriously, could not keep warm in the room. Location is pretty good, but they need to fix the temperature and would do good to improve the food to be healthier! Overall, would not prefer to stay here again.
Casbah was more than a little disappointing.. I came to celebrate a family member's birthday and we were seating in the basement room. The whole dinner was 3 hours long. It was just too long. They didn't check up on us anywhere near enough. They were friendly of course, but it wasn't enough! 3 hours for 3 courses just didn't feel good!The menu had two vegetarian options. I have noticed that many of these more upscale places tend to have risotto or pasta as their fallback vegetarian option, and it was certainly the case here. I ordered the pasta and it was $20 and one of the tiniest portions I've seen. The problem is, for that price, every bite should have been exciting and new. It should have been heaven. It wasn't. It was plain and there were more onions than pieces of rigatoni. I saw many of my meat eating relatives seemed to enjoy their meals. They ordered scallops and short ribs and huge chickens. But my pasta was so horribly disappointing. I'm not coming back!
It's a convenience store, like Walgreens or CVS.I came in to get an Arnold Palmer iced tea. The only person manning the counter was not to enthusiastic about working there, and constantly was checking the door. When someone came in, they gave a bland generic greeting. It felt awkward to be there.
NO. Do you wonder why they're giving 2-for-1 vouchers out left and right? We did. But we went anyway. The food looked unappetizing as soon as I stepped out with an expectant empty plate. I got food anyway. It was unappetizing to eat.The only thing that was slightly decent was the dessert, but when you've already lost your appetite from trying to eat the main food, even those redeeming qualities are small in comparison.Save your money and head over to a more reputable buffet in Vegas!If this was my first Vegas buffet experience, I would never want to try any of the others.
They're usually good for quick service and great meals but are TOTALLY not a good deal for holidays. I know tourist are usually not as picky about seating but some are so obnoxious and inconsiderate of those other diners waiting. Also, while there were PLENTY of seats, the host did the WORST job of seating EVER! If the table is clean and has enough room for the customer's party amount, SEAT THEM! PROBLEM SOLVED! Sorry, no tip today!
Small arcade, lacks selection and many of games that my kids were interested in were more expensive in long run va the pay per time concept. Won't go back.
When this place first opened it was MUCH better. Over the past couple of years though, the quality and freshness have been replaced by grease. Nothing special at all, and the older guys have been over heard making remarks about their customers to each other. Not a winning strategy with so many other pizza joints around this 'hood.
This place is like a grown up arcade. Only things that I didn't like was that I had to go up to the counter and order a daiquiri. We sat at the gaming machines for a minute before we realized that the bartender don't come around and ask if you want drinks. Also, the tokens for the arcade games were high. We might try this place one more time. Crossing our fingers for next time.
Can Pittsburgh get a new "iconic" food item please?  I come here once in a blue moon to introduce an unsuspecting visitor to this regional specialty, aka soggy bread with limp fries and wilted lettuce.  Bland and mushy and messy.  Given that they proudly sell Primanti t-shirts at the airport, I guess this place won't be going away any time soon.
I kind of expected more from this place. I've been a huge fan of anime since I was in elementary school and the idea of a cosplay cafe appealed to me so much, it was like a dream. Who doesn't like hearing J POP while eating?!The ambiance of this place was nice, the waitresses were cute yes, service however was lacking. The bf and I were waiting for quite some time for some napkins and it wasn't the waitresses who noticed but some man who I suppose works there as well. We both ordered noodle soup, I the tonkatsu and the bf some beef noodle. I noticed that the bf didn't really enjoy it much, and this being my first time having ramen outside of home, I wasn't sure how its usually suppose to taste but the ramen here was way too salty to my liking. The meat was nice and tender though however. The gyozas we ordered were good as well but pretty small considering the price.
Foodwise no complaints as it is excellent.  The service is less than desirable.  My family arrived  few minutes before me and ordered food.  I attempted to add to our order but they would not take at register.  They said to wait for server.  Server came when she brought food to table for rest of party. Even then, she did not take order. And insisted on getting manager.  This experience put a damper on our Friday night out.The manager was very apologetic and did good job with service recovery.
Don't even bother to order breakfast here. They don't know what they are doing. My bread was burn and they didn't even ask was I want on the sandwich like mayo and stuff. The hash brown is crap too.
Actually 2.5 stars.I don't like to put too much effort into these fast food restaurant chains. So I'll get right to the point. This is not my favorite location. Why? Because the service was a slow. The wings were still tasty.
Usually have good confort food...but last night, not so much. The tomatoes in the salad were dirty, the soup which is usually great, the tortellini was disintegrating. Got the chicken fried steak...which I've had their before and it was excellent, but this time was served with sausage gravy? The mashed potatoes had an unidentified  object that seemed to resemble a watermelon seed. There was one in my potatoes and husbands. At this I point was done.
I've been here 3 times in one year. One time it was for my boyfriend. Anyways, I just had the worst front desk service. All the time. The girls really don't know how to answer questions properly and are so rude for not even working 12 hour regular days. And it's every time I come.
First, let me state that my family LOVES Outback. This is our "go to" restaurant when we want to celebrate anything. We ended up eating here on Memorial Day when the place we were headed did not work out. We were seated and our server came right away to take our drink orders. She was friendly and came back quickly with our drinks and bread. This is where the good review ends. We waited probably over 15-20 minutes and had to ask about our salads. She said the same thing another reviewer said about a computer shutdown. When our salads finally arrived, they were all incorrect. We didn't say anything. Our food arrived another 10 minutes later, but my youngest daughter's meal was not included. We asked where it was. We got a blank look and the server went off to find it. Her meal did not arrive until after the rest of us were done eating. My filet was cooked to perfection, but my potato was cold. I asked if it could be heated and was given another potato. This one was not much better. Normally, when they bring your potato it's so hot that the butter is melting and the potato is too hot to eat right away (just right). My  husband's steak (ordered medium just like mine) was more like rare. He didn't say anything. Oh, and the server never came back. She kept sending others to finish up her job. We were so disappointed! We will not be back to this location again.
I took my daughter to veterans yesterday and it was kind of a lonely spot for a 2-year old. The tennis court was open. Other than that the atmosphere was kind of dull. Maybe because its a holiday who knows.
The view is fantastic, and the steak was ok.  My colleagues had terrible food.  The Buffalo calamari was so salty it could not be eaten by two of the people with me.  The coconut shrimp was burnt and cold.  The service was absolutely terrible, and I don't know why, because they weren't that crowded.  Will I come back?  Yes, because I want to give them another chance. I was here a couple of years ago, and had a much better experience.
My girlfriend and I came in to exchange a watch band today. When we came in we were kindly greeted, but ended up waiting 15 minutes for a salesperson to pay attention to us. Keeping in mind that they took my name down and said someone would be over 'soon'. We got so tired of waiting we returned it altogether. This store is kind of a victim of its own success, a lot of customers, not enough personnel.
I love Vietnamese food and I've been waiting in excited anticipation for the grand opening of Rice Paper just down the street from my house... But it was a total disappointment.The restaurant is located in an unassuming remodeled historic home. The interior is modern and hip with a large bar. We were greeted by one of the owners who seated us and quickly moved on to chat up the male clientele. The menu is "sushi style," in that you mark your order on the menu.As vegetarians, we had very few options (2 fresh rolls, 1 fried roll, 1 sandwich, 1 salad & 1 entree). It doesn't seem like the menu was well thought out for the neighborhood, in which most restaurants try to cater to the large local vegetarian crowd.We tried all the vegetarian menu items except for the curry entree:The Vegetarian Tempura Roll was filled with vermicelli noodles, tempura asparagus, and fresh mango, served with a basil-based dip. Alone it was a little bland but tasted great with some Sriracha sauce mixed in the dip.The Buddha Roll was mediocre. Again, it was bland. I had to smother it with plum sauce and Sriracha sauce for it to have any flavor. The Saigon Bun Salad was horrible. It was literally a big bowl of plain vermicelli noodles, romaine lettuce and fried tofu with some roasted peanuts sprinkled on top - no herbs, no spices. The dressing (served on the side) tasted like it was made with rice vinegar, fish sauce and grated carrots, period. Really??? Ew! I had to make my own sauce by mixing plum sauce, Sriracha sauce, and some of the peanut sauce left over from the Buddha Roll for it to even be edible. The Tofu and Shitake Mushroom Vietnamese Sandwich was made on a pleasantly flaky baguette, with cucumber, tons of shitake mushrooms, carrot, and a little cilantro. There was some sort of mystery brown sauce that again had no flavor. The one saving grace was the side of scrumptious sweet potato fries. The fries were hot, crispy, flavorful and came with a spicy homemade mayo.The nonalcoholic beverage options were limited to soda, iced tea, fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice and Vietnamese iced coffee. The iced coffee was delicious but I wish they offered more options that would go with the food like coconut water, cucumber water, or even Thai iced tea, even though I know its not Vietnamese.Honestly, everything on the menu could be excellent if they just added more fresh herbs: cilantro, mint, or basil. Most items had maybe a leaf or two but not enough to taste.  Also the sauces and dips were boring and tasteless. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Rice Paper may be a good first taste of Vietnamese food for people that are averse to trying new flavors. It seemed very Americanized rather than authentic, which is confusing since the owners are supposedly Vietnamese. Mostly I was disappointed because I feel the place has so much potential. They use lots of fresh veggies and everything seems made-to-order. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting and I love to support local independent businesses. However, I don't see myself returning unless they overcome their fear of herbs and spices. For now I'll sacrifice atmosphere for flavor and drive the extra distance to Maxim's or Pho Avina - now that's my kind of Vietnamese!
I'm writing this as an update to my last review.  Since my last update,  they brought back karaoke and the drink specials, for which I am happy and grateful. They have also allowed smoking on the back patio again. The bar is still bland, however,  and the only thing on the menu that excites me are the fish tacos. They are the bar tender's personal recipe (kudos to the owners for putting an employee's recipe on the menu) and fantastic.  The wings are also rather good with fries but thats about it. This place still feels like its rolling further and further downhill and I can't help but to think the owners didn't know what they were doing when they bought it. I was there this past Sunday and spent the evening with a whole 6 people,  3 of which came with me and one I believe worked there but was off the clock. Rumor has it that this place won't survive a few more months and that saddens me but its not the same place it was as RTOs and probably shouldn't stick around.  Hopefully whatever goes there next is more successful and better managed. PS.: Calling Restaurant Impossible like another person said is actually a good idea. Maybe try it.
The place is easy to find.but the service really poor.  3 person stop by my chair to make my manicure one person start them the second came file my nail and massage the last one paint it . Even the salon has only four client and 6 technicians.
Gotta say I'm very disappointed in our experience tonight.  It was if they didn't want customers, as the tables on the potion were dirty, seat cushions were up to the customer to go find for their chair and they didn't even bother to turn on the musters to help us enjoy our experience.The waiter was very nice but it was if they didn't want to be open on a Friday evening.
On several occasions when I have come here, Autozone has not been able to help me out.Why? No idea?Latest debacle: My battery was dying. I needed a new battery and help changing it. Autozone will do it only if there is zero oxidation on your battery. There was a little bit on mine so, I was told that all of these other parts were affected, because of hte oxidation they were going to snap off, and they couldnt touch it. No recommendations on how to get the oxiation of. Referred me to a mechanic that charges $80 to touch your car if it is oxidized.... and JIC money if parts snap off...I went to Jiffy Lube instead. THey cleaned the oxidation.. took 5 seconds and changed my battery. Nothing snapped off.Second:I needed a new gas cap because I have been getting a false reading of the gas cap not being closed.I talked to one of the Autozoners asked if I needed to get a Gas Cap, or if there was just a part.. (i really don't know about cars and I don't try to hide it)He went on to explain how the gas cacpp makes a clicking noise and i had to make sure it clicked three times. I reiterated on how it was a false reading I would check every single time.. :-|Never again.
Went on Saturday and got their all you can eat taco special "this weekend only" limited to: chicken, shredded beef or ground beef.I can best compare the quality of the tacos to that which you can find and make for yourself at a lower end casino buffet (think $10 station casinos or silver sevens). Tons of shredded lettuce, bagged cheese, very little meat, huge soft taco shell. Wasn't great.We also got a half dozen wings to try since they were 35 cents at the time and they were the smallest wings I've ever eaten...typical buffalo with Frank's red hot /butter mix. I hope they don't serve these sized wings at regular times.We also ordered a weak frozen margarita pitcher.Service was actually pretty good and the fresh chips and salsa weren't bad. Was gonna shoot this one a 3-star but that "A-Ok" rating wouldn't be accurate.
2 stars was all I could give. There was the smell of weed when before I walked through the front door. I ordered a bacon double cheeseburger and an order of fries to go. When I got to my car (raining hard outside) I discovered the burger had no ketchup, mustard or anything on it and there was no condiment packets in the bag. Who does that? Also the girl who took my order acted like I was bothering her by being there. I like to give second chances so I will most likely give them another try.
Don't bother if just driving through Vegas. NO parking available in parking structure.  Obviously just for local business people.
Well I would not recommend this place. I am currently here and my table of 5 were the first customers of the day. Initially our server came with waters. Then we ordered sodas and it literally took 15 minutes to get them with only 1 other table of 2 in the restaurant. We ordered our food with the drinks and it took 25 minutes for a salad and 4 burgers. Seriously with 7 total customers?  Then one burger was not done properly. I asked for my salad dressing on the side but it came fully dressed with my lettuce doing the back stroke in the bowl. If it is like this with 7 customers how do they handle crowds??? I would not recommend this place!
I used to really like their turkey panini for some reason. Simple. Perfect. Right amount of turkey and cheese and pesto aioli, at the right temperature with the right crunchiness. But now it's served cold on a ciabatta bun, and it tastes like every other boring, overpriced cold turkey sandwich with too much turkey and bland, dry bread. Meh.
This was not a groupon purchase. I went in for lashes, not fond of the online booking process which required CC info without being able to ask questions first. Everything is done on the website, and responses to questions are slow at best, if they are even answered. The lack of communication continued after service-- more on that below. Lashes looked fine the day I got them. Would have preferred a more natural look with varying lengths but they worked.Finding the location was challenging.  The service itself in the salon was fine, relaxing, clean etc. I followed directions given following the lash application. I even continued to wash  my face without direct shower stream for another few days. It was around day 2 that the lashes started to fall out. At first I thought natural shedding, however it continued for days. They would fall on my phone, into food, in the sink. Upon examination my lashes were not attached to most of these fallen lashes. I actually took a picture on day 8 to document there was a visual gap where the lashes had fallen out. I wrote to Modlash via email about this on day 11.  I was out of the country so not much could be done, but wanted to provide feedback.  No acknowledgement/no response. I resent a few days later with a follow up message. Still nothing.  I even DM'd  Instagram with no response. It has been 18 days since I had the extensions and they are all but gone. I was trying to provide feedback prior to writing a public review. See photos.
For over 2 years we've  enjoyed a stop at this Chili's once per week after pickleball.  As seniors, at the suggestion of one of their food servers, a couple of the members of our group have ordered off the children's menu.  But 10 days ago we were suddenly told that ordering off the children's menu was not allowed.  I understand a change in policy or perhaps a new manager wanted to enforce an old policy.  No problem.But after this we submitted feedback on the Chili's website inquired about what other options (senior menu , smaller portions, etc.) might be available.  Like any "family", could some of us select children's portions as long as others were ordering adult entrees? Received a prompt (canned?) response that this was an area of concern for them and a general manager and/or area manager would contact us within 2 days.  But as you might expect, there has been no follow-through on contacting us. Oh well, we made an effort to make it work but have found several other restaurants willing to meet our needs.
I just can't handle the poor, huffy service anymore. The food is good- but there is better to be had and with a smile.
My husband and I usually regular the Habit in PV because they are amazing and so quick. This location is not the same. We've come twice now and it's literally been 20 minutes or longer in the drive through line. A little unacceptable I think. 2 stars because the burgers are yummy but that's about it.
I am leaving a 2 star review only because in the  past I have had amazing dinners here. But tonight, I asked the chef to substitute oil for butter as I have a severe dairy allergy (which they've done in the past) and was told 'No.'. Why? I have no idea. I told the very sweet waiter that they had made the substitution before, but apparently tonight's chef could care less. What a disappointment. To be willing to pay nearly $40 for an entree only to be told that they won't substitute oil for butter. I was unable to eat anything on the menu as they weren't open to making any exceptions. Needless to say we will not be returning.
I really wanted to like this place... I love mediterranean food and I think the concept is great (think chipotle meets pitas!) but execution was seriously off! I went and ordered the build your own entree and got the falafel. There were tons of choices to add on to my order and most of them were really great, but honestly their falafel was inedible. If I hadn't ordered it to go I would have taken it back, but instead I was stuck with falafels that could be utilized better by the Phoenix Coyotes as hockey pucks rather than a protein that is offered by an establishment offering fresh and healthy fare. Needless to say I was a bit turned off by my experience and I don't think I will be back. Next time I need my mediterranean fix I will head to Pita Jungle.
I'm giving two stars because I can't personally say she's done makeup on me or for me. But my low rating is for my own personal attempt to book a makeup trial with Courtney. I reached out to her over Facebook because I found her post of her looking to do events for makeup. I reached out to her and we exchanged phone numbers and messages. She got back to me the first day we spoke online and promised to call me later that day. I never received a phone call that day. Which is understandable since she's probably busy with clients. She messaged me a day or so later apologizing for not getting back to me and again then stated to call me back later that day. Once again never received a phone call. About almost a week later she then sends out to me a message online about how she's having a promotion going on. Really? I understand your trying to push a nice promotion but that's just flaky and bad business. To promise a person twice you will call them and never do is just wrong. I'm not sure what others have experienced with her. If you received great makeup service great but I just can't get behind someone who can't even for one apologize for not contacting me and two for ignoring the fact you ignored me.
Well this place used to be fun. Now it's full of annoying teenagers. They are loud and annoying, trying to act cool in front of each other with their posse. Also, many ghetto people seem to enjoy going to the bars there.
Server with buzz haircut as rude. Place was dirty. Not the nostalgic fun place they pretend to be.
Our waiter forgot our order of nachos until we reminded him. Wife's fries were burnt, my "seasoned" fries had exactly two pieces of visible seasoning and otherwise were normal regular fries.
This was my first time there and it was empty on a Sunday night which seemed weird. The food was ok but the portions were small. The large pho I got was mostly soup. My friend's small had more food. The service was terrible. There was only 3 of us and the waitress forgot who ordered what. In addition she was not at all friendly. The location is convenient at finch and leslie. I will probably not recommend going there to anyone. If you want pho I say go check out pho 88 on yonge near empress walk
This location is open 24/7, but don't even attempt to get service after 11 o'clock, we were just forgotten at the drive through window, served ridiculously slowly but asked to move up in order to decrease their drive through rate time, had to repeat our order an absurd amount of times. Although I must admit this shake is pretty good.
Thai Spoon, what can I say?  Definitely not as good as Nicky's in the North Side.  The crab rangoons were not good, no crab at all and a super sweet cream cheese in an over fried wrapper. I ordered green curry, I like a little spice, I ordered a 6, but could barelyTaste the heat.  The broth was watery and the vegetables were absent.  I did get a lot of bamboo shoots.  We also tried the pad Thai whichWas acceptable. Dinner for two including one appetizer, two entrees and water to drink was $29.00.  Interestingly they print a tip calculator on your bill!
Maybe we were here on an off-day, but my party left the place scratching our heads. I had a couple drinks in me, which 100% makes me more forgiving of bad food and drink.A few of us ordered drinks, including the Crown Jewel and Downtown Pimm's. Terribly sweet because of the flavored syrup and other liquers. No finesse whatsoever. Enjoy the hangover and a film of sugar coating your mouth.We also ordered some food to share:- Crispy Deviled Eggs were an interesting texture and weren't too bad, but they weren't anything fantastic either.- Chicken Lettuce Wraps were sad. Instead of wasting your money on three little pre-filled wraps, go to an Asian restaurant specifically.- Tartare was delicious, but it was a tiny serving that was mostly unshareable.- Sea Salt Garlic Fries served with ketchup tasted very little of garlic oil. Most lackluster garlic fries I've ever eaten.- Shepherd's Pie was plain. That's all I've got.- Cheese & Cold Cut Platter was okay because it didn't require any cooking. You can't mess that up. There was a smoked cheese that was quite good.Overall, cheaper prices in comparison to the rest of Vegas. So maybe we got what we paid for?
Mon expérience brunch au Passé Composé de la rue Roy n'a pas été des plus fabuleuse. Comme j'avais déjeuné à la succursale de Saint-sauveur quelque temps avant et que j'avais apprécié l'excellent service ainsi que la qualité des assiettes, j'ai voulu renouveler l'expérience sur le plateau. Malheureusement c'était un essai/erreur car la succursale de la rue Roy n'avait rien avoir avec celle de Saint-sauveur. J'ai commandé la même chose au 2 endroits,mais à Montréal nous n'avons pas reçu nous plats au même moment, on a oublié le pain et les fruits n'étaient pas frais.Déception!
had dinner with the wife for the second time here in 3 years and again a failure and doubtful will be back any time soon..our server was great and informative at the beginning and helped us order appetizer and main courses.. the problem was our main course..be AWARE of the SEA SALT.. I ordered the seafood cannelloni and it's was probably the SALTIEST dish I have never tasted in my lifetime...NOT the one to complain but I HAD TOO.. just that bad..our waitress informed the chef/manager and never introduced himself and said that it was very salty and mentioned the reason was that it depends who is cooking in the kitchen..I thought to my self what.?? what's going on back in that kitchen.?! waited for another 20 minutes for a remake and did NOT enjoyed our dinning experience.. at least they could have bought me a dessert for the inconvenience and for ALL THAT SEA SALT.. BUT nothing.. our waitress disappeared and no sorry or dessert or anything to make us want to come back...I guess I have to know when and who is cooking to expect NO SEA SALT on my dish.. OR no worry and enjoy a good dinner and dinning experience when you have LOLA or Green House Tavern etc. as you next door restaurants....
The $5 burgers are GREAT! but the service is terrible. This is my second time at this location and I got the worst service yet again. Greeting your customer, "How can I serve you?" in a rude tone, forgetting our water&coke, and waiting on our food for 37mins and not checking up on us before or after the food arrived is not how to serve. Of course, the burgers make up for everything, but it does not hurt to be a little nice and give your customers an update on the food if it's been more than 30mins.
Prices were a bit extreme for how little we got. Chicken was weird and not at all we would would have minimally hoped for. Only positive was the hot salsa was perfect amount of hot.
The sandwich was good but not for $12.  Good Dutch crunch bread it was fresh and the sauce is good but not worth a return at that price.
Expensive and not yummy Chinese food. If you are Asian, this is NOT the Chinese restaurant for you. Everything is very salty. The price for the food (dim sum or order dishes) is more like $$$. The waiter /waitress here doesn't speak fluent Mandarin, or Cantonese or English. So be prepare to be able to say 3 different language when order food or ask for drinks. They also don't smile and seems very inpatient. Good luck trying to wave them down.
Although I'm not too fond of Chinese cuisine but I do enjoy it once in a while. I enjoyed Chinese food while I was in Chinatown of SFO. Few days back I was reminiscing those memories and suddenly craved for Chinese food. I read a lot of great reviews about this place on Yelp, so was excited to try it out. I ordered shrimp stir fry noodles and dry shrimp & squash with thread noodle hot pot, from the Chinese menu. They had complimentary tea which was nice. I wrote down my order on notepad and went to the counter to order. Food came pretty fast. I had my first hot pot at Chinatown, which was amazing. I was expecting it to be the same. Now, what I got looked like the food for a patient at a hospital. It was bland and I couldn't taste shrimp at all. Even, if I had been sick this is not something I would have enjoyed. Noodles were ok but again did not have much flavor. Overall, I did not enjoy the food. My husband and I took few bites and left it.
Seriously average food with above average prices. The waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves. I'm wondering if a prerequisite to work here is to feel that you're better than others because you know all the Belgium beers.
Dr. Webb delivered my son in late 2015. Let me start by saying, I love the front office people. They knew me by name (well, as they should, I basically lived at that office for 9 months) and every single person that worked there (besides Dr. Webb...) was seriously amazing. Paula Mazzacano is, without a doubt, the best ever. If it wasn't for her, I wouldve left after the first time I met Dr. Webb. But, Dr. Webb is known around Phoenix and I thought it wouldn't really matter who delivered my son. Boy (pun intended), was I wrong!!Again, Paula is amazing.  I wish (I SO WISH!) she would've delivered my son. I met with her countless times after giving birth as well (thrush, IUD, thrush again... then, thrush, again..) and she was so, so incredible each time. You can tell she truly cares. But, then there is Dr. Webb. When I told the women at the hospital who my doctor was, they made a face. When I told my yoga instructor who is a doula who my doctor was, she made a face. I should not have ignored those faces!! He has a complete disregard for the individual needs of patients, to the point where he just didn't listen to me AT ALL.  I mean, once I was laying on the table while he lost his keys and proceeded to look for them, blatantly ignoring me for 5 minutes. He was just so spacey. When I wanted to discuss my birth plan, he laughed and said, "itll go how it goes." When i told him I knew this baby was coming early, he said, "No it is not." Well, he did, because I'm the mom and it's my body and yeah.. i knew that.  He refused to check me for dilation (causing me to freak out and go into the office twice because the baby stopped moving, because he was descending, something i wouldve known had I been checked). But, the worst of his egregious behavior came when I was in labor. Sure, he showed up late (doctors always do), but did he have to completely ignore me? Did he have to act so uninvested that I'm pretty sure at one point, he was sleeping? Did he have to not explain that he was giving me an episiotomy (something detailed as a no-no in my birth plan) and definitely something that could have been avoided, had he not just wanted to just get it done. I met with the doula/yoga instructor after having my son, and she asked if I wanted to talk through my birth process. She said how essential it is that women do that, as it is a traumatic experience. The second we started talking, I was hysterical. I felt that I had no one (besides my amazing, but clueless sig other) to be my voice in that room, to defend me, to even understand me. I felt alone and vulnerable, which was a horrific way to feel. Thank G-d Dr. Webb isn't delivering anymore, but nonetheless, people need to know he is 3/4 of the way out the door...
So I went back again today at 8:30am. Got the Freddy Special, and when he asked about the dressing for the dash and console and doors, etc, I said yes but last time it was pretty obvious that they just did a quick swipe over the glove box and that was it and he made sure they would look over it. Sooo I just recently bought a used car about a month ago and she definitely needed some love. Annnnd she is due for an inspection today and I'm hoping they don't look too close. This time, I have pictures. I guess it's time to find a new car wash place.  I would however like to say that all of the employees there are extremely friendly, which makes it hard to have to be negative about the job they do.
This Target is OK.  It's never very busy, but that also means that the checkout lines open are sparse.  I sometimes have to wait longer than I'd like to get through the line.  My beef with Target overall is also the fact that the national corporate office gave $150,000 to an anti-gay candidate in Minnesota, and they've handled the aftermath poorly.
Was here a while ago and I am not sure what happened to the quality of food since my last visit. I ordered the blackand blue burger with garlic parm fries. The burger was overcooked, with mushy, hot lettuce on top. The fries were cold, soggy and not worthy of being considered a "premium" side. Not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it. You would think given the location they would have a better craft beer selection as well. Very generic.
For years we have been going to different IHOPS.  Sadly, this is one of our least favorites.  Not only was it so cold inside, but the air-conditioning actually made our food cold too!  I had the stuffed french toast, which has always been my absolute favorite.  Unfortunately, this time, (while I was sitting there freezing) it tasted like it was stale and over cooked.  It was actually terrible!!!  My partners breakfast was "uneventful", but cold too!  I dont know why IHOP feels the need to freeze their customers out!  I realize we live in Arizona, but having to take a jacket inside to keep warm!?  There is no excuse for this!   Our waitress was nice, but not too terribly attentive.  I would have returned my meal for something that was fresh, but she never came back by to see how everything was.  We didnt understand this, since it was the middle of the week, and not even half full with customers.  Management needs to take a good hard look at why their IHOP is not only freezing inside,but their food is cold and stale. I even had to sit on a lumpy seat that was full of torn up duct tape. NOT impressive!! Being one of the larger Chains, one would think these types of problems shouldnt happen. Just reading the other reviews, I can see we werent the only ones that had problems.  What a shame!  We wont be returning to this location.
Extremely overpriced for the quality and quantity of sushi. A couple decent rolls but overall you are better off getting a steak for the same price. Dinner for 2 came to 150, you can do way better elsewhere
Great food, horrible service. The guy at the register was really slow and annoyed with people. He charged me for a meal and a drink when all I got was a hot dog and then he didn't take off when he took the drink back. Just really would prefer to go through the drive through here. I usually do but today I didn't have a car.
It's an okay spot. Close 15$ with a drink. Didn't care some of the selections except for the chicken skewers. They are my favorite along with the white rice with some pot stickers with the sauce.
Pros: 1. Clean 2. Fast service 3. Prices ($25 for white tips with gel polish) Cons: 1. Did not have me wash my hands 2. Did not clean under my nails 3. Did not place the tips correctly. (I did not want to cut down my regular nails. There is a gap between my nails and the tips which shouldn't be there) 4. There were bubbles in my nails.   5. I asked him to round my nails and he thinned them on the sides which is not the same thing.  Overall, the service was OK. The nails look neat at first glance so I won't complain too much. Plus I still left a tip just because I always do. I may return again.
Pretty disappointed with the service. The workers seemed to be caught up in conversation and cared more about that than serving me. I asked for my caramel macchiato with caramel only on the bottom but they instead put it both at the bottom and around the sides on top. So my drink had way too much caramel and was way too sweet for my liking. If they weren't busy talking they might have gotten my order correct. Don't see myself coming back to this location.
Let's start off with their name, "El Cafetal" which means "Coffee Plantation". You'd think with a name like that they'd have a REAL coffee machine to make Café con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant!  Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant. As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were sure they're a Colombian restaurant.  My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants. The Churrasco (Sirloin Steak) wasn't bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS! They are definitely not AUTHENTIC COLOMBIANS!
First off the order taker messed up my order. I didn't pay much attention when I first paid but after I looked at my slip. Although no way should have it been a mix-up because when I said "Mac Jr" that sounds nowhere near a Grand Mac which is what I was charged for.Anyway fixed that without much trouble.Then the lady calls out order 394, which was my cancelled order, however she really wanted to say 393, the order before mine. I don't know how you mix that up (orders not at all similar). She then calls out 394 again but this time it has the Grand Mac on it. I informed her of the mistake and she fairly quickly turned around and got the Mac Jr on there. However she rudely set the tray down, and oh by the way, no apology.Most McDonalds I've been to have improved customer service, this one has a way to go there.One additional thing though is the fries were undercooked compared to other McDonalds. They were barely cooked. They tasted ok, but not cooked the way I usually see them, usually a little darker colored than these.So I think I'll skip this McDonalds in the future - though I have actually rarely gone there anyway but now have a reason to avoid them.
So after a couple of previous attempts we finally made it to the new Bomba Tacos and Rum in Fairlawn.  It's a mixed Mexican-Carribean type menu and some of the options looked interesting. For appetizers we ordered bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers and ceviche. They were good, I've had better but they were still quite tasty.  The ceviche was light with just the right amount of lime. It was served with red onion, avocado and fried plantain.  The flavor was light and not fishy but unfortunately the avocado was not edible as it was unripe and hard as a rock. It really should not have even be served.  We told our waitress and the chef took it off our bill. I really would have liked for them to have told us the avocado was not ripe so we could have ordered something else. Avocado is a huge part of ceviche so not having it edible was a big miss.  We each ordered two tacos as our main.  We ordered the duck, beef, pork and crispy shrimp.  The duck was such a small slice that we had to look for it in the heap shredded cabbage.  The beef and pork had a bit more in them but tacos need a lot of meat and sauce.  All of the tacos had heaps of greens and barely any of the sauce they described on the menu.  All were very dry.  The crispy shrimp was not crispy at all.  All in all a fairly big fail on all the tacos and at $3 to $4 each I think they should have been much better.  I was rooting for this place, nice decor, good service, nice atmosphere but the quality and taste was just not there.  I hope they make it.
For an expensive restaurant like this, I expected much better. The service, although pleasant, was slow. The French Onion Soup was literally disgusting; we had 3 people at our table order it and they all sent it back. The Foie Gras was pretty good. The lamb was cooked as I ordered it, but was pretty tasteless. A lot of us ended up not finishing our meals because we were pretty disappointed and did not find the food appealing. On the other hand, I do have to say the restaurant did look nice and had a nice ambiance. Other than that, I was very surprised at how (unfortunately) "undeservingly" expensive this was for unappetizing food.
My last visit here was disappointing. Overall, the food was only okay. The quality of some of the ingredients seems to have declined since my visit here about a year ago. The fish in the sushi rolls tasted pretty fresh, but the rice seemed a bit dry and old.. this effectively ruined a lot of the specialty rolls for me. The sashimi was very good (especially the salmon and clam), but I wish we had the option to order eel by itself. I also enjoyed the beef tataki. The cooked foods were either hit or miss for the most part. The kalbi was pretty good, and we ended up ordering that a few times. It isn't the highest quality short rib, but they do get a nice char on the meat. I also really like their kimchi seafood hot pot. The broth is delicious with just the right amount of spice. The one complaint I have about this is that they put way too much inedible crap in there (like fish tail).. I'd rather have more soup and less of that stuff. The fried pork chop was probably the worst thing we received during dinner. It was thin, tough, and bland.. just about the worst fried pork chop I've had in a long time. I didn't bother eating any more after trying a bite. I really like the way they do desserts here. The servings are very small (shotglass size), so you can try a lot of different things. My favorite dessert was the lychee mousse.. I should've ordered 5 of those. All of the desserts I tried were pretty good except for the strawberry ice cream. The strawberry ice cream tasted really artificial (almost like medicine).The service was just awful. The servers got something wrong pretty much every time we ordered food. We had to order a few items multiple times to receive it once. We had to wait an absurd amount of time to receive the second half of our ramen order. There seems to be something that is causing a lot of miscommunication at some point in the ordering/food preparation/delivery process. They really need to figure out what the root cause is and fix it because it was happening WAY too often in our dinner. Our table also had a lot of issues flagging down servers even when it was getting late and less crowded. Our dinner must've taken about 2.5-3 hours because of how slow they were. The prices were reasonable for AYCE, but I don't know if I would be willing to come back and deal with the service again. 2.5/5
First time trying vegan food and did not really enjoy it. The burger was quite dry in my opinion. The Poutine gravy sauce was cold, so although it was in a cast iron bowl the meal was cold. The gnocchi was just okay, the consistency of the "pasta" was too chewy. The decor was  incredible though!
This was (and will probably still be) my goto bar in Vegas because I love country, am country, and love dancing without it being a sweaty glitzy expensive Vegas scene. However, they started charging more and more cover- 10 bucks is ridiculous for a mediocre Vegas bar. The band was also meh- not necessarily danceable country (who hollers "any George Straight fans!!" Then plays "the Chair"?!? Wtf?) and overly pleased with themselves- if people didn't immediately cheer after a song they would remind us (um, you're a bar band here for my dancing enjoyment, I didn't come to your concert nameless egotistical dude)... Beer selection was ok and the price was fine- $10 with tip for an amber ale draft. But I hated to order much after the stupid cover charge. Pros- beer was an ok selection, not just BL and CL. Dancing is ALWAYS a good time!! Okay, I'm sounding bitter and I apologize... But I miss my crappy divey cheap Gilley's!
10 workers empty restaurants but somehow took them 15min to seat us. The waitress took forever to take our order and there 5 chefs it's taking them 30min to make our food even though there was no one
The food was decent but for starters the Chicken Parm was not hot when they brought it out. We were in a party of 16 and several people had the same experience. One of our group ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the meat was very undercooked. The floor manager was too busy flirting with the younger women at the bar to be of any help. He tried to tell the person who ordered it that this was normal. The person she was with ordered the same thing and hers were cooked just fine. He was a very rude Italian "rocky balboa" wannabe and should not be in customer service. They took the meal back and never brought her a new meal. On top of that they didn't take it off the bill! He should be fired!! Overall you should save your money and find a better place to eat!
The rating makes me wonder what is going on here. So came here with my colleague thinking that this is a legit Malaysian restaurant. Well seems like most people here order the Laksa noodle. So not sure if this place is only good at making that dish.My colleague and I both ordered the Rendang beef with rice combo. First off, I have been to many Malaysian restaurant and none of it tasted like the Rendang beef I had here. The color was off to begin with. It didn't have the spice kick to it. Its good that the dish wasn't salty but at the same time it doesn't have a strong flavor to it either. I showed the picture to my Singaporean and Malaysian friend and they all said the beef color is off. So this is a fake Malay place or this place doesn't know how to make Rendang beef. Also this place is not busy at all. No one really walk in. Not even take out. I feel sorry for the owner running this place. Definitely need to work on the recipe if they want to stay in business.
I was in the area with co-workers trying to pick a place to stop for lunch. An employee came out of Margarita's Grill telling us how great the food was and how they are the best lunch spot around. He was friendly and we were hungry so we went in there. The place was almost empty when we arrived but did fill up eventually. We placed our orders and the waiting game began... It took about 45 min for us to even get our food and one of my co-workers was given the wrong meal. By the time we finished eating she still didn't receive her meal. They eventually brought hers out wrapped up because they new we were running very late due to their slow service. We all expected her meal would be comped or discounted but no such luck. The food was "ok", I guess I had higher expectations.
Stopped in to get some snacks on our way to a softball game and spent about 15 bucks. I used my debit card and asked for 40 back because I needed some cash for next day. The  attendant started to tell me that I had to notify her prior to getting cash back and proceeded to tell me that I had to inform her that I want cash back due to them having limited cash. For the weekend. If that is true then don't offer cash back and my slices of pizza was nasty maybe I'll be back but I will always get cash back with out notice just to piss you off
Awful drive-thru. Ordered two bacon gouda sandwiches and both were cold in the middle. Also ordered a large unsweetened iced tea and we received a sweetened one! They are in such a hurry to get people through that they compromise quality!
We just checked in and were upgraded to the junior suite. LOLOLOL this is our view. Seriously for $240 I think we deserved better.Oh and ran to the men's room when we arrived only to find no toilet paper.
I don't quite understand the hype. I came here twice while living in Pittsburgh and the first timeThe breakfast was okay. We came a second time and I asked for waffle. The waffle came out too crispy so they made it again...which didn't change much. I finally gave up and asked for a pancake.I wish I took a picture but when I cut into the pancake batter just came pouring out. The waitress was so embarrassed. We finally just got up (the waitress was kind enough to refund us some of our money.. at least for my dish) and called it a morning. Management needs to talk to their cooks bc if you can't make a pancake or waffle at a breakfast place... you will have disappointed customers.
Terrible. Get to the location and get a seat instantly, awesome! However it was cramped and wasn't able to pull out a hair to sit without bumping into the person behind me in the next table. We sat at the table for 10 minutes waiting for the server to come and talk with us. A guy finally comes in rush asking for what we need. My husband orders a Pepsi and I get iced tea. We also order French fries. Then the waiter walks away. Who was my waiter? What's his name? I couldn't tell you because he didn't really have the customer service skill, in my opinion. He said he'd be back shortly with the drinks and take our order. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, even though we were sitting right next to the station. He dropped them off and left. He even got that wrong. He gave us 2 Pepsi's and I couldn't ask for tea because he wasn't around. Finally a girl came from the kitchen and gave us our fries. At that point I asked for the correct drink. Anyways after 35 minutes of waiting, needless to say we never order an entree. Place seemed severely under staffed, maybe if they had more people it be better. But who knows I won't be back Pros: The Pepsi was good, so said my husband  Cons: Everything else.
Bought a couch and love seat from and was promised delivery between 4 and 6 pm. Called at 6:30 and was told the delivery was from between 10 and midnight (who has furniture delivered at midnight). Asked customer service to speak with a supervisor and was denied our request. We were told that the delivery personnel would call us before they arrive, because we made it clear we would have a sleeping young child. No phone call was received they knocked and rang the doorbell waking up our small child. At least they ended up giving us free delivery. I wasn't happy, but sadly to say it was still a better experience than we have had with Ashley Furniture.
I got the complete wash. It was adequate not worth 10 dollars there are other establishment very close that are at least $3 cheaper. The Free Vacuums are pathetic. There is MINIMAL suction in the system. It became more frustrating than anything because because the vacuum wouldn't pick anything up. Safe yourself the headache here and go to the one right off the 60 and Gilbert.
I have only been there one time. I got a $10 manicure during one of their promotions. It was the longest and sloppiest manicure of my life. However, the young woman who worked on my manicure was very nice and they do use quality products. I would not return, but you can't beat their prices, especially during promotions.UPDATE: Kohler sent an e-mail after I posted this review offering me a free manicure. While I appreciate the offer, I declined. I did want to share with all of you that although I did not have the best experience, they definitely tried to correct the situation.
Lots of shops. Place is huge.But not sitting anywhere outside shops.Only ONE elevator working in the mall of thousands for people with strollers and infants like us. RIDICULOUS !! Three elevators, one for going up and down to floors 1-3, the other two for going up/down to parking levels. The line up was huge with other families with strollers. We waited 20+ minutes and could never get on, so we took the stairs.NOT A FAMILY FRIENDLY MALLI grew up in Toronto, and love the Eaton Centre for what it is and provides downtown. But, this was not an enjoyable experience. If the Loblaws located in the old Mapleleaf Gardens can do things right so can the Eaton Centre.2 stars until next time
I am not a fan of this airport.  Maybe I am a bit of a snob since I travel a lot for work , but I expected better.  Many cities fail to understand that for a lot of people this is the first impression of your city with a large number of travellers.The food selection is meager at best and even in the renovated section pickings are on the slim side.  No thanks Cleveland, if you want to get more people here step up your game a touch on the airport, I doubt that many people are going to buy Rock Band for their Xbox in the airport. Let the rock and roll thing go, let it go...
We are always up for trying new places, so we decided to try this place last night.After reading some of the reviews I was worried about running into the hostess from hell thats been described. Luckily we had a very nice hostess.The waitress, while pleasant, was less than attentive. Not horrible but not good.The food was blah. The calamari was rubbery and had little taste.The lemon chicken soup had a lot of lemon but no spices. Very bland.The mousaka of was bland. Couldn't taste the eggplant. Overall not bad food, just not good food.
The biggest plus to this cafe is location.  It's right in the middle of campus, right across from the Chazen Museum, very close to one of the campus theaters, right across from the Badger Bus stop.  Even though there are almost as many superior coffee shops in Madison as there are vegan liberal New Age former hippies, in the middle of the harsh Wisconsin winter, closer is better.  It's not a bad place at all between academic sessions when most of the undergrads aren't around.  When classes are in session there is such a high volume of business, the regular coffee is always fresh, so important if you like it black.      Now, on the other hand, when classes are in session, the place is usually crammed full of college students, which makes me feel fat, old, and tired.  Tired, because there's often not a seat in the place.  If a seat does open up, it's pretty cramped to begin with, but most of the undergrads here have stuff all around them, their computers, tablets, mp3 players, phones, open knapsacks, coats, scarfs, mittens, notes, books, friends, lettuce (only once, but one time I was here killing 20 minutes but trying to get some work done and the young lady next to me had a round head of presumably organic lettuce between us, which I found irrationally distracting), etc. In Madison, coffee baristas take the place of bartenders and therapists for many denizens, there are dozens of cafes that not only serve tasty fresh coffee, but are staffed by very pleasant workers who make you feel like you belong in this world, skillfully adjusted to how busy it is (quickly if it's busy, a little more patiently if it's not).  This place is quite the contrast, the workers are jaded alienated college students who make it pretty clear (maybe they would say, "obvie") that they would much rather be anywhere else, doing anything else, and that they are determined to not get good at making and serving coffee.   If you're looking for the sort of cafe where the cappuccino is served up with a flourish, this is not that place, no one here knows how to do the leaf.  Only a very short walk from one of the world's most respected South Asian Studies programs, it seems especially wrong that they don't realize that chai literally means, tea.
Service was friendly but the ravioli were like the rest of the facade of Las Vegas - paper thin and water-y bland. Very disappointed since they were one of the only 4 pasta dishes on this "Italian" menu.
Very slow and the receptionist was rude!! But the people who cook food in the kitchen are nice! Nothing special at all!
I like Applebee's food but the service at this location is really, really bad not once but twice.
I just finished eating the blandest, most boring pad Thai I have ever had.  This dish consisted of noodles, a bland sauce, a smattering of peanuts, and some plain bean sprouts.  That's it. No spice or flavor whatsoever.  I realize now that this is partially my fault, as I did not read the inside of the menu, which said I had to request spice and flavor.  The server didn't ask either though...and she had plenty of time to, since I was the only person there.  Well, almost the only person.  There was an employee or family member sleeping at a table in the corner.  I'm not sure if that counts or not.  The server was pleasant and all, but she clearly was in "no one is here" mode.  After bringing me my meal, she sat at the table with sleeping guy and played with her phone.  She didn't look up again until I was done with my meal and had an empty water glass.  The other thing I noticed is that staff drank bottled water, rather than water from the pitchers they serve guests.  I was not offered anything other than water and drank the whole glass before I picked on that little tidbit.  Overall, I can't say anything about the experience would prompt me to return...
Was known as Amelio's. Business has closed his door for a few time and reopened
Ordered Chicken GyrosBread was too soft and seemed old and chicken seemed to be  defrosted in oven and served in our gyro...The table was extremely dirty and I wonder how they can ask customers to eat in tables like that
This place is crap. Made an appointment, drove 2,5 hours. Then when we arrive they say they can't help us because they are booked.
Good crowd but way too loud. If they had real dancing the loud music would be fine but it's more of a bar so being able to talk would be nice.
Quality wasn't there, felt like I got ripped off! Had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans really had no flavor. Would never go back first and last.
Don't tell anyone but I have a weakness for McDonalds Chicken McNuggets. Today I ordered myself a ten piece and a large order of french fries. After I paid, the guy at the second drive thru window said I needed to park and wait for the fries. I said no thank you and left.
Just got some food from this restaurant and you can tell that they do not have the same cook because the food was not that good at all it uses to be very good but not anymore.
I used to like Reggies, and was a regular customer, but have found the quality to really become erratic recently, which is a shame.  On it's good days, the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts (all day).  First, when pulling in, beware, as the parking lot is VERY rough, with MAJOR pot holes.  For your car's sake, GO SLOW!One item that I've liked here is the "old fashioned," which is a couple potato pancakes (served with sour cream and cheese), couple eggs, breakfast meat, and toast.   Another few that I've liked are their ruben, their Philly Cheese steak, their ciabatta club sandwich, the hot roast beef sandwich (served open face) and their chicken enchilada soup (spicy).  Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a "breakfast bar", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.Their NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I've gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.Talking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn't been cooked AT ALL!).  I've also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.
Here's the breakdown:Food - 5 starsCoffee - 5 starsAmbience - 5 starsService - 0 starsCame to get coffee and brunch one day, ordered the tree of life pita and the turkey club, both were amazing!! Fresh ingredients, healthy organic options, flavorful sauces, and beautiful presentation. The ice coffee was very good too, they brew ice coffee with the proper apparatus and the taste is perfect.My complaint is on one female staff. While we were standing in line ordering we were disagreeing about the drinks option and this staff started to join in and started to reprimand me for my choice and lecturing me. That's extremely inappropriate and not any of her business. Then after we ordered, she was forcing me to write a tip. I'm ordering a togo order, where there's no service involved therefore I do not tip. She gave me an extreme hard time about not leaving a tip and continue to say that I can leave a cash tip. Wow! Talk about hustling! I'm not at the strip club!I'm not sure if I wanted to come back to be hustled again no matter how good the food is.
My friends and I decided to go to Vegas on one of the hottest weekends of the summer.  We had grand plans to party at Wet Republic during the day, but were defeated by the prospect of traveling to another hotel just to be hot against a different background.  We settled on hitting the pool at the Palazzo, where we were staying.  We decided to check out Azure while we were there, in case we wanted a bit more party with our pool time.We would've been mad if we'd paid money to get in.  Since we were a group of girls, we got in free, and we were able to scope the place out without paying cover.  What we found was a smaller version of the normal hotel pool, with loud music and more people.  There was no atmosphere - the Palazzo pool is one of the more standard Vegas pools anyway, and the Azure version was maybe even blander.  It was, in other words, worse than the free hotel pool in every possible way.We ended up spending the afternoon in the Palazzo pool, and the few scattered children didn't bother us at all.  It was a relaxing day, and not too hot despite the rather intense temperatures.  If you're curious about Azure, I'd say check it out if you don't have to pay.  If you have to give up a dime, don't even bother.
Kinda disappointing. It was a late night pick and kinda wanted to send it back. The veggies and meats on pizza was delicious but the crust seem pre-made and the cheese and sauce had no flavor.
Saw roaches crawling. Their fish tank is not clean as some of their fish are swimming upside down. There is a lot of fried and oily food. The quality and taste is fair. I would not eat here again.
Something has changed and the Red Lobster flavor is just not there any more. I was a regular.
Dryest meatball sub I've ever had.  So sloppily made with marinara sauce only on half.  I ordered it "big" which didn't seem large at all to me compared to any other sub shop I've ever been to.  There was about an inch of bread at the end with NOTHING on it:  no meat, no sauce, no cheese - so I'm assuming I paid an extra dollar for an inch worth of plain bread since I'm not sure what their regular size is.  Very stingy on sauce and on cheese and the few mushrooms that cost an extra 50 cents.  Complete ripoff and not even as good as subway.  Don't bother with this place.
It was ok. I though the winds were very hot even for mild and the chili was watery. the waitress was nice but other than that, not impressed. The place was super packed but that was to be expected. Just wish the food was better for that was the reason for our visit.
Went for brunch and enjoyed the view from the back patio.  Our server was very nice.  However nobody enjoyed their meal and our drinks came out with our meal 20 minutes after ordering.  Chaquilas came out with a fried egg over soggy chips and the avocado toast should be called cilantro with avocado mash on cold French bread.  Don't go here for the food but enjoy the view from the back patio!
Great concept but the execution is sorely lacking. The interface is fairly self-explanatory but the computer locked up several times while trying to upload photos from my phone. Several staff standing around and no one came by to assist. Just seems like there are some missed opportunities. We were close to the front door, and got up from the photo bar and headed out. Seems like the 2-3 staff chatting at the entrance might have noticed us in revenue-generating mode and said something besides "thanks for coming in."As a Mac user, it wasn't lost on me that the Microsoft logos were covered up with stickers. Cntl Alt Delete. We are outta here.
Got some fun hats and horns here for New Year's, although $3 per cardboard hat is kinda steep and they are too small for adult-sized heads. There's also something odd about the way this store is laid out. I used to work at Party City when I was 16 and I think my store had a better layout. I'm also not a fan of reciting my email address at checkout. It's a little inconvenient.
This Is Actually the Starbucks Store I like the Least That I have been to in the Phx Area.... Every Time I have gone Whether Early In the Morning(not too early actually, around 6-7am) or At Night (About half an hour before they Close) They Take The Longest Time........... And ALSO Manage to Get My Drink Or My Companions' Drink Wrong..... Once we had to correct the barista taking our order Several Times... And She Still Got It Wrong... I know they might be busy or distracted but It's A Part Of Their Job To Get It Right....  The Manager Really needs To Think It Through A Lot More when hiring Young Teenagers... The Baristas that have taken my orders could try harder to improve their customer service skills As Well... Anyways... I Love Starbucks!!!  But have No choice but to stop here when I Am In the Area, but I recommend that If It Is possible For You, Pass on This Location....
Stopped going here with the management turnover and decision to go away from $1 pabst, low drink specials and 50% off sushi during happy hour.  If I do go, all the sushi is fair game as good, also since there is some hawaii fusion with the food, you gotta get the fried rice.  Yom!  Yom!!
Weak! Menu sucks like the food but people were nice. Save your date night for elsewhere.
NO TOWELS!I wish I had known this beforehand.  I am a fan of waking up early and hitting the gym hard before work, getting ready at the Y, and then heading straight to work without going home.  I live in the Northlake area, and work uptown, so I frequent the University City, Childress Klein, and Dowd YMCA's daily.  This morning I had an appointment in Ballantyne, so I decided to try out the Morrison YMCA since it was 5 minutes away from my appointment.I walk into the first locker room I see, which is very small and doesn't have any towels.  I reason that this must be one of the smaller locker rooms and that there's a larger main one somewhere else.  Two locker rooms later, I realize that that's all there is, and no towels in sight.  I wander out to the pool deck to see if there are any towels there, and there are none.I asked the woman at the front desk if they have any towels, and she shakes her head and said they do not.  I ask if there is a place I can purchase one (the Dowd Y has a shop that sells various workout equipment), and with a blank stare she answers, "Bi-Lo."  She then suggests that I use my current sweaty clothes as a towel replacement.  I ended up using a ton of paper towels.I just can't fathom that a YMCA of such size would not have towels for it's members.  So, the purpose of this review is to just inform others that if you are working out here and want to shower after, it's BYOT.
I had Oasis drill out some studs on a down pipe, and hang an exhaust for me. The price was right, and they were friendly. I just wish they had taken their time with making sure the exhaust tips were on correct. Upon arrival I noticed the exhaust tips were pretty far under the bumper, not flush with it. Well while doing there test drive they melted part of the bumper. The tech was prepared to put the car back on the lift, but i just wanted to get out because I was trying to contain my disappointment that my 2014 bumper was damaged. Needless to say I brought the car home pulled the tips flush with the bumper the right way, no rubbing, no melting for several days now, why was the tech unable to achieve these same results? Large brush strokes these guys can do, dedication to detail maybe not so much.
Annoyed with the representative I had. Never told me there would be any fees after I signed for insurance on the rental car. He talked through the contract and function of the car at the speed of light that sometimes I had to guess wtf he was saying. It's my fault I didn't read the tiny print thoroughly and carefully, but bad on these customer service reps for not fully explaining the bill to their customers. Not dealing with this place again.
Terrible food I've ever had. Such a shame because it's a great place to hang out. Maybe some day they'll get a new chef.
Good food. Overpriced. Overrated. Snobbish service. Typical Fox concepts. Elitist/Hipster employees. Unimpressed.
Very disappointed.  Menu sounds great, interesting and enticing.  But they missed on many points between what it sounded like. And what they delivered.Ordered 8 things.  Best was the calamari but the portion size was very small, especially considering the dish is normally 9.95-12.95 around town and those places serve 2-3 times a portion size.The pretzel with beer dip was much better after they brought fresh pretzels.  Liked that.  Beef and lobster skewers were minimal pathetic tastes of both, too salty and very pricey.  Most food was very saltyPizza was pretty good but the star of the meal was the lettuce cups.  Enjoy those.  As for drinks, mojito was ok, not special and to fill the glass with crushed ice is a trick to serve slight portions that we are all familiar with.See no reason to go back, and will go to Pink Taco or luckys next time I'm there.
This review is based my latest experience. I have always ordered from Magura, mostly satisfied with my orders. I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later.  So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while.
Okay Westgate is cool but really when ever did a public place close expeccially a parking lot? The cops force you to leave no matter if you saying goodbye to a loved one or not if it's after 12 you better leave right away or be forced by police....I'm sorry but if you need to kick people out you need to get gates to lock up at the end of the night, it's not right when people just want to talk to their friends they have bars there but we can't talk to our friends!
Good ambiance , food is very trendy and not traditional mex by any stretch .  Service was good and friendly but after eating here twice I would rate the foods 1 service and friendliness a solid 4.  The reason I rate this a two is based only off good, not service
This was our initial time at this Iconic Restaurant. We had a business lunch and made reservations a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, they gave our table to another person with the same first name. Not Kool! When we were finally able to sit down  (15 minutes), we found the menu to be quite pretentious and all over the global map. Our server was neither engaging or user friendly and was not an asset in navigating the menu. I ordered the Burger which was literally falling apart as I tried to eat it. I requested the burger a click above medium and received a burnt dried out tasteless mess. I mentioned this to the waiter and he said that's how I ordered it. Really, I didn't recall asking for a burnt, lifeless, dead on arrival Burger. So taking the high road, I asked him to take it away and that I'll just have the fries for lunch. Unfortunately, The fires were a greasy quagmire and not eatable. The waiter, to his credit,  said the Chef wanted to make another which he did. However, it wasn't any better. My associate's had their fish Taco and a Chicken appetizer which were excellent. Their only complaint were that for a $16 price point the appetizer was hardly enough for one and not shareable in any manner, shape or form. It was same case for the Fish Taco, not enough food for a the monetary outlay. So if you want a "little" well prepared, good food at a high price point, this is the place for you. Just stay away from the burger and fries!
Akahana...hmm. There's not really many positive things I can say about this place.  I was in the mood for sushi and saw on Yelp that they have a daily, BOGO deal on their sushi - even for take out orders - which sounded good to me.They are located in a strip mall right across from the Plaza Harris Teeter. Based on the time of day, the parking lot can get tight and spots fill up quickly.When I walked in, I was hit with a strong body odor aroma. Oddly it was only at the entrance. Once I walked inside, the stench was gone. At the hostess desk, I placed my order for two rolls: the Florida and furious dragon rolls. My total for both came to $16 and change. While I waited, I noticed how unkempt they keep the restaurant. Everything needs to be renovated.The hostess brought me my food and once I got home, I was pretty disappointed that avocado pieces on my furious dragon roll were already turning brown. The sushi rolls tasted no better than what can be found in the sushi section of the Harris Teeter across the street.
Take out for a burger takes over an hour, be prepared for your stomach to eat itself as the clock ticks down for the longest take out in human history.
If it were not voluntary it would be larceny. The pros: Excellent filet mignon-gorgeous setting, very relaxing. Very good waiter if a bit pompous, but he's French.Cons: wine prices at about 1000% markups. Wine list prices are for high rollers who don't pay directly but you do. A "reasonable" bottle suggested for only $116 is a Cabernet with the Bellagio name on it. Vile is an understatement. No good restaurant would have this bitter mouth wash on its wine list. It was sent back. Finally ordered with sommelier help a $100 bottle that was ,at best, acceptable. They allow people who know zilch about wine to take your order and make recommendations. really unacceptable. Then again, this is Vegas, a place with absolutely no class unless it is no class. This restaurant is a perfect example, in my view, of why Michelin stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants. There are simply no restaurants in LV, especially the big French names, deserving of the old Michelin ratings, not even the forks. The place is slightly understaffed and really understaffed with professionals. We ordered a sushi dish as an appetizer. Really bad, the crust tasted like cardboard, could not find a Sushi taste with the fruit like pilings on this thing. It also went back. A $14 piece of fruited cheesecake was good, a value here. Service was good but not up to the price level. They should send their entire staff to Taillevent or the old Jamin for lessons. But why bother when most of the sheep accept whatever they are given.
Got a flyer in the mail for this place. Says it under new management.  It also says they are opened 7 days a week with an exclamation mark. I called today (Saturday) and they were just about to close - called around 4 p.m.. The guy asked if I wanted to come on Monday.  When I asked him about Saturday, he asked someone and then told me that they don't always work on Sundays.  Apparently they only work occasional Sundays if there is someone who wants to work that day.  WHA??!!  Why advertise on a flyer AND website that you are opened 7 days a week when you really aren't.  Can't comment about the actual place but that as is wasn't a great starting point for them.
My wife and I moved to the area in July and have been to Marcello's a handful of times over the last few months. Our experiences have been interesting to say the least, however they have been improving.The first time we ate here was around August, and the food was okay, but a little overpriced. The bartenders are very friendly, and it seems they are finally getting some decent beers on draft. We have always received fantastic service, the girls are always delightful and efficient. Which is why I find this confusing and upsetting. On multiple occasions, my wife and I have unfortunately overheard the owner or manager talking down to and yelling at his employees (and not very discretely, I might add). I have managed restaurants for the last 16 years, and the service here is great.I have had some dishes that were delicious, and some that were mediocre. The music on the weekends is nice, but can be a bit loud if you're trying to have a quiet meal.We come back from time to time for the atmosphere, great service, and the specials on the board are usually very tasty. However, it seems like there is much room for improvement in the management. I wouldn't stand for my managers being consistently condescending and disrespectful to the staff.
Jackie Bee's has the prime setup; located next door (with a connecting door and all) to a gamer's paradise, PVP Zone, a 24-hour Internet and video gaming cafe and it's also right across the street from the College of Southern Nevada. I peeped a lot of World of Warcraft action happening in the back. Good work nerds. Great location for students to post up, do homework, level up and bleed all of their allowances.However, high hopes can't save you when the boba fails at all of your (reasonable) expectations. The menu is way too large for their own good and I can guarantee you, in a sea of mediocre, you will only find one decent item on the menu (cough: Thai iced tea- minus the boba.) Pricing is competitive: ranging from $3.50 for a medium - $5 for a large. However, they really messed up the art of milk tea and even the potted plant (plantation) tea; it tastes like dirt and water for real. The tea flavor is nonexistent; I really just tasted water, the crushed Oreos do not enhance the drink, just makes it gritty and taste dirty. Even when sending the drink back for improvement, the drink comes back tasting the same. What in the world? The boba here is legit nasty. Like, I was actually offended with the 2 drinks we ordered. I had a look of pure disgust on my face as my drink was delivered to me with thick syrup and black mush on the bottom of my milk tea. Yeah, you guys, that's the boba. It is shockingly overcooked and gooey. Honey boba you say? Ha! Even Honey BooBoo would be offended.The only reason why I will be nice and not give them a 1 star rating is because the kids working the counter are young and sweet, but man, they need help! Someone seriously needs to step up the leadership game. Please fix what's broken: drink flavor, quality, and dear lord - THE BOBA!
I love their mac and cheese but sadly the burgers weren't up to par at all. They use premade patties instead of fresh ground beef. You'd think with the price tag being on level with Burgatory and BRGR they'd be the same quality. But the aforementioned competition is so much better quality.Slow service as well but likely because I went on like the 2nd day. They're decent but no Burgatory.
Just squeaking in that extra star.... On a recent trip to Vegas, we were a little hungover and a lot hungry for something to eat. After wandering around we just decided to head back to our own hotel and eat there. What a mistake! It was just after 12:00 and on Saturday and Sunday, the breakfast stops at 12:00. They have some breakfast 'specials' available on the regular menu, but it was things like omelets with french fries. I just wanted an egg sandwich or something very simple, but no.... We sit down, decide on what to have, and wait, and wait, and wait. Shockingly enough, I was getting very irritated. Servers are walking by and no one is stopping to take our order. We waited, and I timed it, 15 minutes for someone to come over and say, "we didn't see you sitting here. How about I take your drink order and then find your server?" My response was, "just take the whole order and don't find someone to else to help us. We've been waiting and you've been serving the table right next to us the whole time." I ordered water and a $14.99 grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, no bacon with fries. Dining companion ordered a Diet Pepsi and Reuben with chips. Then, after I complain the manager comes out and is bending over backwards, and a little too far at that, to help us. Food comes out and the grilled cheese was awesome, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. We received the Diet Pepsi comped and 20% off, but think of it this way, if someone had helped us to start with, you would have made a whole lot more money. Go with caution, it wasn't even busy and now I know why. I gave it the extra star because that sandwich was so damn good. I just wanted my sandwich and to be left alone.
Not so sure what the fuss was about but I was asked to go pick up something here and really got BLAH service from the young man who really could not answer my questions. I did not eat the stuff but the person I picked it up for was disappointed that it was frozen - not fresh and dry.
No communication. Just a bunch of employees walking around looking busy but not helping customers. I was told told to wait because I was next. 30 minutes later. No one came. I counted 13 employees. Shouldn't be this hard.
Came to Vegas with my Boyfriend and his family for his twenty first birthday, you know the whole "turning twenty one go to Vegas thing" well the first thing when you walk into the hotel to check in you get a big smack in the face of cigaret smell, the smell is soooo bad it feels like you smoked a pack every time you walk through the casino, your hair and clothes absorb it and your left walking around smelling like a ash tray. The securities are very rude wanna be rent a cops. Here's what happened, first of let me just say that I'm only 20 (but I look like I'm 16) and I know I'm not supposed to be on the casino floor or anywhere near the slots and tables but it was my boyfriends first time here and he got on a slot and I was taking a picture, for memories you know and  I was gonna go up to our room after the picture, two big fat security women come up to me like if they were trying to intimidate me, chest out hands on hips all on my face, they asked me if I'm 21, obviously I said no, and they begin to scold me that I'm not allowed anywhere near the slots or tables or else I will get fined of get sent to prison, chill out rent a cop I was already on my way upstairs, they were very rude and could've handled that in a different way. The rooms are okay outdated, needs some updating, the bed was comfy, though I was really scared to sleep in the bed due to the reviews of bed bugs but I was really tired our first night and slept really well. The second night though I woke up in the middle of the night with my legs sooooo itchy, I couldn't stop scratching, I had little bumps all over both my legs. On our last night there my boyfriend was down stairs gambling and drinking and when he tried to get a drink at the bar the bar tender was being ass hole with him, he asked for my boyfriends ID he hands it to him and my boyfriend said that he kept looking at the picture on the ID and back at him lifted into the light inspected it and told my boyfriend if he had another proof of identification, my boyfriend said no and the bartender told him that he couldn't serve him liquor, very rude and u fortunate for my boyfriend seeing that he only wanted one more drink before going up to the room being it was our last night there The parking was a hassle because they were cleaning the parking garage. The hotel is very old and could use a major upgrade all around. Would I stay here again, hhhmmm maybe not because of the really bad smell of cigaret downstairs, it is a very affordable hotel though so let's see on my next trip to Vegas.
Along the lines of greasy Americanized Chinese take-out, Chopstick Express is pretty good. We used to order from here once in a while on lazy days when I'd stay at the boyfriend's house. We'd get our fill of breaded, fried, and sauced meat dishes like the lemon peel or orange chicken, but my particular favorites were the oily and comforting lo mein noodles with char sui pork. Cheap, quick, convenient...their tofu dishes are also pretty decent, but this is by no means "real, authentic" fare...think: better than Panda Express and cheaper too...
Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.So why the 2 stars?Quite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate.
The only reason this place has any customers is because it is the only restaurant in town (aside from an upscale French restaurant). A few of the dishes were fair (mussels, panko-coated fish, burgers) and everything else is terrible (crab cakes, beer-battered fish, salads).  The servers started out angry and it went downhill from there. We ate there three times and each time we felt like an imposition. If they didn't like a request, they would avoid our table for 15 minutes. The one standout is they have terrific fries!  Not a reason to go, but a plus.
This casino is disgusting. Looks dirty, was crowded and didn't have a huge selection of games. The parking lot is also a disaster. The casino is also attached to the rattiest excuse for a shopping mall I've ever seen in my life.
The food here is mostly very weird. The restaurant actually smelled like blood (not kidding). And nobody in our party of 6 felt right after eating there....varying levels of food poisoning with the common denominator being the chicken bucket. The popcorn pot de creme was good but $8 for probably an ounce. Overall, very overpriced and the food is weird/induced stomach problems. This was my second time there and the first was not impressive either. Would not return.
The service was slow, plates were dirty and our water came to the table only after we asked for it three times. The spicy Asian boneless wings had a funny taste to them.
I really didn't like Wooche. I don't know if we just went on a bad night but the food just wasn't that good and the place seemed really dirty. The quality of the food wasn't that good either. I do not think I will be going back.
Service was great but drinks were awfully unsweetened even after we asked for cream and sugar. Got a frozen caramel coffee and the was chunks of ice and the caramel was not blended well. Also got a mocha, hot, and it was super under flavored. Not the best coffee spot will probably not be coming back here.
I went to eat the specials they have, and the person that gave us the service was very slow, we were waiting 1 hour without food, and there wasn't a lot of people because we were there on midnight
Overall not a bad Hotel, got a decent price online, a convenient location, but the maintenance of the room was really lacking. Small rooms compared to other places I stayed. Bed squeeked, NO firm pillows so bring your own, my window shade was broken so I had no view, the bathroom shower had no door and a stupid hole in the one section of glass to allow you to turn the faucet on and adjust temp-Ive seen this concept executed more efficiently in other similar showers where the controls are on an oposing or side wall relative to the shower head so you can set the temp before getting in. A neat but unpractical design-the water spilled right out of the hole onto the floor and water everywhere. I was also freezing while showering since there was no door. Coffee maker was broken and filthy and why is it they never give you enough cream packets? Very average soaps and shampoos the kind you leave behind.  The staff was pleasant, breakfast was ok but overpriced for what it was. $10.00 for 2 slices of French toast with a few berries, presentation was amateur...not a good hotel for long term stays, one or two days at most, for a little more money finer places are available. Parking was easy but weird, I just parked on the street it was easier.  If you are overly discriminating this hotel is not for you. No bellmen, and the front desk is on the second floor so you have to do your own shlepping up the elevators with doors that scrape the floor and sound like finger nails running over a blackboard.
Basic hotel, we had the two bed standard room. It did come with two TV's which was convenient. The last two Spring Hill hotels in Tempe and Chandler only had one in the living room area.
I have not had a great experience with this company . Jennifer was very nice and tried to help right away but then I was forwarded to James in Tucson because I was told he worked with that employer in Phoenix . He was nice too but the odd part was I was told I was interviewing for either front desk or mailroom then I get to the interview and was told no it would just be a special project lasting about a month . I never heard any feedback from James . Then I got a call from Melanie ( who I see on a previous post wasn't great with someone else either ) regarding an interview . I had to stop her and tell her she was trying to send me on an interview that I already went on ! No communication here- none ! I never heard back from her either and I had to email Jennifer again and all I was told was she was out on PTO and she'd have Melanie call me next week . No apologies or anything ! I'm very aware they work with a large amount of clients and believe me I don't feel like I'm the only one on earth but still, come on, you tell us to be professional on our Interviews yet I saw many people lacking professionalism in communication . I actually was able to get more interviews off craigslist since now employers have to pay to post them so they are legitimate postings . Maybe I caught this business on a bad month or something but I cannot say I had the best experience with Acclivity  whatsoever.
I only wish I knew the managers name....This Tommy Bahama restaurant needs a professional to run this business.  So sad that a customer needs to tell the manager that the music (the singer and group were great) sound system was so off that not one word was understood.  The group was great...SOUND SYSTEM NOT ADJUSTED.FOOD OKAY...Service.  The worst ....I think the staff is unhappy...   NEW MANAGEMENT ...IS NEEDED...Wait...this is Tommy Bahama...Management...Do,you think a Tommy Bahama dress theme may help...Or someone that LOOKS like a manager...We have visited MANY. Tommy Bahama Restaurants...This..by far is the worst..Keep in mind.  The food was fine...the service poor...only because...of attitude of staff...Bottom line...entertainment was great...Sound system poor.  Staff seemed unhappy.  Manager unprofessional.  Food was average.
My bf and I are from the Los Angeles area and frequent sushi restaurants at least a couple times a month. One of our favorites is Sugarfish, just to give you an idea of the quality we are used to. Sushi 21 has the staff and a cute location, but the chefs are definitely not what we had expected. The rolls were much smaller than at other restaurants and the tempura shrimp tasted as if it had been breaded with bread crumbs (!). It was strange to taste the albacore tuna with a liquidy garlic sauce on it and the eel was tasteless. The mussels were also covered in a clear liquidy garlic sauce rather than a spicy mayo mixture that normally accompanies baked mussels. My bfs rolls were smaller than he had preferred (philadelphia but the other I forgot) and he said that the quality was poorer than other sushi restaurants in the area.The only reason I am leaving two stars is because the staff were courteous and the environment was pleasing, they also offer affordable ayce (but again, the quality of the food is lacking).
"japanese" steakhouse for the masses, serving mayo-slathered "white tuna" improvised-roll CRAP. perfect match for the Bell Road restaurant abyss of HELL.HEAD TO FRESH WASABI SUSHI BAR DOWN THE STREET.yeah, yeah... benihana chop chop, zing zing. that's all great, but i look for the seeds of real japanese cuisine, and they're almost nowhere to be found here... (and I gave it 3 hopeful visits before writing this.)--love the tempura. crab stick tempura is my comfort food, and the tempura is expertly executed. kudos to the kitchen. +star#beverage menu boasts a broad sake selection, but none of them are ever in stock.#when asked, the sushi chef promises "all the fish is the best". when your chef says that, it means that NONE of his stuff is fresh.#chef refuses to speak with you when you sit at the bar, inches from him. you must order through the server, and she will speak with the chef.BUT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT!#and the server does not know the japanese words for anything on the menu!#after my ticket comes up on his printer, he looks at it briefly, and then continues his side work.#wait for it.#entry experience paying attention to all the wrong things.fused-to-the-sidewalk bird poop all the way to the broken entry door with taped paper sign, "use other door", complete with arrow.exposed water spicket rusting and leaking all over the walkway. Uh oh. reminds me of "Diamonds Chinese" (see review)glass is filthy as is the rotting wood door handle. ew. "i wonder what's inside" as i pull the crookedly-hanging door from its frame...real japanese experience takes pride in the cleanliness of your entryway and the approach of your guest. not here.
This rating does NOT reflect the fabulous selection at The Bean--that's amazing. I was irritated by the customer service. It STARTED well, with a lady greeting me as I came in the door and asking if I needed help finding anything. When I said no, the lady walked over to her associate, and the two proceeded to engage in an epic--riveting, I'm SURE--conversation that was still going on 10 minutes later, which is when I walked (unnoticed) out the door. The conversation transpired in the middle of a crowed aisle, which I, along with another patron, were having no small amount of difficulty navigating. The two were completely oblivious to the fact that we were trying to see (and move) PAST them. When the other patron met my eyes and shook her head in bewilderment, my suspicion that this is NOT normal behavior for business proprietors was confirmed. I didn't stick around any longer. I found what I needed at JoAnn's right around the corner.
I go there with my kid for his league and cart girl is never around ! I am here right now with the junior league and I called the golf shop and requested that she come to us. She was done for the day. it was 2pm! hot out and kids, adults needing service . I am sorry but these girls need to stay out longer!. so upset . will never bring friends here ever .
Nothing special, manager or cashier lady acted all weird because I was using a free coupon for signing up in there email club. I also asked her do I need to print out coupons or can I show on phone, she never answered me and was rude!!! I saw bfast plates being served as I was waiting,  looks like food I can get at home. My free pastry pie though was great.
Melonheads is 5-stars in several departments:  friendly service, decor (brightly decorated salon with character chairs including Thomas), free photo and certificate for the first haircut, free hair accessory and glitter hairspray and most importantly to my little one - free lollipop at the end.However, the quality of the haircut is where it falls to 1-star.  I know, they're toddlers and don't need perfectly coifed styles.  I'm not one of *those* moms who will cry "They ruined her hair, just ruined it!".  But I think the hair cut should still be quality - one that is not uneven and looks like I took a bowl to her head and trimmed around it.  I had to do some of my own maintenance and trimming of longer pieces when we got home.
Ordered catering for a family event.  We had a gathering at the house after a funeral.  We ordered a few sheet pizzas, penne pasta and meatballs, garlic knots, house salad, and a mixed sandwich platter.  All items were fine except the sandwich platter.  So much so that we took the platter back to the store to discuss our dissatisfaction.The bread was VERY DRY, shredded cheese (on a sandwich?), limited meat, at first I thought no vegetables but later I was told there was a few slivers of lettuce, condiments only consisted of mayonnaise, and there was to be a variety of 5 different sandwiches but in the end we only received 3.  You can see from the photo that our guests did not find the sandwiches appetizing as the plate contains 28 sandwiches and only 11 were consumed.  Of those consumed most were left on their plates to be thrown out.The gentleman we spoke to quickly got on the defensive when we tried to express our displeasure.  He made such remarks of "Nobody has ever complained about it"  "Our bread is good"  "I eat them every day and there is nothing wrong with them".  He invalidated our complaint and instead of trying to understand why we went out of our way, on a day of family mourning to addresses this, he acted put out and offended by our desire for a refund.  This was a $60.00 platter.  You look at the photos and decide if this is what you would expect and then consider before your next dining at Zeppe's is this the type of customer service you want?At first we were only offered a in store credit of $20.  This was a $181 order.  In the end we received a $40 credit but why did we have to go through this in the first place?  Give us a good product and there would not have been the need to address this.
This place is a ripoff. The food is the worst Nigerian food I have had at a restaurant and the portions were extremely small for the money you post per plate. I have no idea how this place status in business.
Disappointed with the experience had here. Iced almond milk latte tasted off and baristas seemed disinterested in customers.
Stopped by for happy hour.  Odd, because it took the better of an unhappy hour to be waited on.  Bartender,  nice guy,  kept telling me he was jammed, but the whole place was less than 1/4 full.  Finally got to order (Happy hour specials, apps and since drinks $5. I orderef 1/2 order of naked wings and a glass of the house cab). Took forever to arrive.  Wings nice and crispy,  but when they say naked,  they mean it. No salt,  no pepper, almost no flavor.  House wine wasn't something I'd order ever again.  Not that I'm coming back here.
Stopped while traveling in the interstate.  Heap, quick and hot. Gave the extra star because there was outside seating.
I didn't even know this movie theater existed by MGM. Not sure how it stays in business. It's pretty hidden and super, super old. The tickets are sold at the concession stand (I think she was the concession stand person as well).Theater itself was huge but seating was old. They don't recline back much less even move. Arm rests don't raise up and the rows are very close to each other. Probably won't go back.
Ohh Stingray.  How I mourn for what you used to be.This place was a solid happy hour spot.  The food is mediocre, the music is generic faux-laptop-DJ shit and the drinks are overpriced.  But on happy hour, hot damn.  It was all fantastic because the prices justified it.But here we are today, and the sake bombers have gone from lower end of the spectrum $5 on happy hour to all of a sudden $8 each without warning.  Really?  Did you think your food and vibe was justifying raising the price that much?  Now you're the most expensive sake bombers around!  I'm disappointed.  This place isn't good enough to justify that kind of price for a bottle of Kirin and some trash sake.  It isn't enough to justify 8 for two shitty small skewers of chicken when Dozo does it better for cheaper.Guess this is the last time I or my friends come to this heap, too bad because there's a lot of us and we're always looking for a decent happy hour.
Food was very good, was a little bit pricey for the portion you got.  My wife and I ate there and the bill was $60 for us, and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages.  Very nice setting but the wait staff was very dull and not well informing.
Sadly was disappointed in this place.  I came here looking for authentic Italian food last night and instead left feeling unsatisfied and rushed through our meal.  I ordered the meat lasagna and to be honest it was very very bland.  The cheese and sauces were sporadic and it didn't seem like it was cooked thoroughly.  We were one of the last people in there and we got the feeling they wanted us to leave ASAP.  The drink menu was very limited.  When we walked in the front door, we ran into other couples eating and we didn't know where to go so we tried to make our way to the middle (as the place is a small house).  Eventually we were seated...it's a very intimate atmosphere and quiet which I appreciated.  I just wish the food and service could have been something to say I'd come back for and unfortunately I can't.
I was excited to hear a Via Cibo was opening close to my house as we usually go to the one in Deerfoot Meadows. We went for dinner tonight with our toddler and 4 month old baby. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and after giving us the menus, told us she would be back shortly to go over the menus. As such, I assumed she would be taking our order at the table and not at the till. We waited for 15-20 minutes before she came back. When I told her what we wanted to order, she told us that they were out of pomodoro sauce, which pretty much eliminated half the items on the menu - and all of the meals we wanted to order. We then spent another 10 minutes trying to find other food to accommodate this and the staff at the till was not helpful at all. By this time, my baby was crying and my toddler was cranky because he was very hungry. I was so frustrated that we ended up getting our meals to go. The meals we did order were fine but the staff should have let us know right off the bat that the restaurant was out of a key ingredient, instead of having us wait 15-20 minutes after we were seated to find out. This would have been more tolerable if it was just my husband and me, but given that we had 2 young kids with us, that should have been taken into consideration (especially for a restaurant that markets itself as family friendly). Also, for an Italian restaurant to be out of pomodoro sauce on a Friday night at 5pm - with no explanation as to why from the staff - is probably not a great sign for a new opening.
I came here for the advertised Cinco de Mayo specials that were not available. The meal ended up being very expensive and the meal itself was just as poor as the pricing. The only thing I liked less than the watered down margaritas was the taste left in my mouth after paying $10 for each of them. I had a regular margarita and decided to go for the cotton candy martini hoping it would be better but was not impressed. Overall, the experience was not great. The food was underwhelming and the drinks were appalling.
The sandwiches here are filling. I like the cole-slaw because it's made with oil and vinegar, and not mayonnaise. There's really nothing else to write home about. The meat is decent, but the fries on the sandwich are somewhat soggy. The fries and bread have the same texture, and so it's kind of the same consistency throughout most of the sandwich. Maybe if the fries were a little crispier it'd taste better, but that's just a hypothetical. A sandwich is about 7 bucks and certainly is filling, yet it's not all that palatable. I think it's mostly name recognition at this point.
The food was good, ehich is why I come here. However, their customer service is terrible.
The restaurant staff was very nice and accommodating to our large group, but I found the food to be very mediocre for a Mexican restaurant. When I asked the waiter for some hot salsa to literally spice up my very plain vegetarian quesadilla (cheese, spinach, and mushrooms in a bleached white flour tortilla), I was given two small bottles of hot sauce, rather than a small cup of fresh salsa or fresh jalapenos. This was very disappointing to me. I expect fresh salsa when I ask for some salsa in a Mexican restaurant. I can buy hot sauce to use at home. I want FRESH ingredients when I'm at a restaurant. When I tried both bottles, and they still weren't very hot, I asked if there was anything else I could add to my food because, I explained, "I like hot and spicy food." Then, he brought me two more bottles of hot sauce, and a very small container of a green salsa. It was OK, but the flavor was nothing special. The bottles of hot sauce were also just OK. (Although, one bottle of hot sauce WAS highly entertaining for its name, "One Fucking Drop at a Time!" Seriously. I'll post pics when I have time. That was really funny!)The quesadilla was edible, but nothing special, and nothing that I would go out of my way to eat again. There really wasn't any seasoning or spices used. It tasted very plain, which is why I wanted some hot salsa. Maybe their meat dishes are better, but I've become a vegetarian and haven't eaten meat since Jan. 1, 2014. There were very few options for vegetarian meals.The highlight of the meal was the guacamole, which was very good on my plate, but not so much on my head! One of the waiters (while clearing the table) had overloaded a tray with plates and accidentally dropped one of the plates with leftover food RIGHT ON MY HEAD! I felt the plate (and food) land on me from behind, and then it fell over my shoulder, onto my lap, and onto the floor! I ended up with guacamole in my hair! I wish someone had recorded a video of the dish falling on my head because I'm sure it would be hilarious to watch, and I missed my opportunity to become a YouTube sensation! LOL. Fortunately, I sustained no damage, and I'll bet my hair will be extra shiny this week due to the guacamole conditioning treatment that I received at no extra charge. I would go back to Casa Reyna if I was with a group that wanted to go, but I would not seek it out myself. The selection is kind of slim pickings for vegetarians. But, the staff is very nice. I have no bad feelings about the dropped plate. We are all human, and we all make mistakes. I was a waitress in college, and my nickname was "Crash!" LOL. But, I never dropped food on anyone's head. I just dropped a tray full of glasses on the floor once at C.J. Barney's in Oakland...about 32 years ago. Damn, I'm old. :-)
I don't usually write reviews for fast food but when I do it'll be for fried chicken. Let me start off by confessing I'm a recent Popeyes convert. I've told some of my friends but everybody doesn't know yet. The chicken is definitely more crispy and the spicy seasoning more pronounced. You don't need Cajun sprinkle but Texas Pete's hits the spot. You may be thinking why I give you this location two stars? At least three of my last five visits something is missing or messed up on the order. To top it off they never seem to have apple pies ready to go. Those things are like crack and on this corner I dont see how they couldnt be selling them like crazy. I can smell it in the air when I'm nearby and it just draws me in. Why can't they have em cookin or keeping them warm under hot lamps. The frost icing on top is literally the icing on the cake. Mickey d's doesnt do that and I dont even know if Popeyes or KFC has apple pies but these are memorable and its sad when they dont have it. Yes I know its empty calories carbs and it nots good for you but its not like I was expecting a healthy meal from Churchs right?
The portions alone are worth 2 stars, the front end service was fine, the food tastes like frozen leftovers, skip or use the 20% off coupon n shock yourself.
Stopped by on a Thursday by myself around 1800 ... place is small ... there were four diners and a waitress and a heavy set guy, perhaps a waiter ... stood by the door for about five minutes and Mr. Heavy Set who wasn't doing much of anything wanders over and asks if i have a reservation ... replied that no, i did not ... "ahhh well then we can't ..." he says as i stare at all the empty tables ... ah, okay, maybe they get crowded later and the whole place fills ... heard the food was good, but Mr. Heavy Set's attitude clearly said he could care less ... won't bother going back
Sometimes I question my commitment to my own well being.  Not putting on my seat belt right away.  Getting too close to the edge.  Eating food that I think is probably past its prime, but "smells okay."  Driving too fast.  Trying to get my boyfriend to do what I want. Eating at airport sports bars.All Stars is one of those small airport sports bars where folks go because they have no other options.  The service is meh (although, I must say the woman tending the bar was quite quick and capable, and even a bit friendly), they're out of most of the things they "offer" and the food. . . well.  Ballpark food is better.  Why I thought this would be a better option than Round Table I'm not sure.  I had a bratwurst and everything on the plate but the pickle, maybe the bun, was clearly frozen.  The brat itself was that awful white color that screams, "I came preboiled!  Won't I be delicious?!", the veggies were the watery, tasteless, came in a mix and were left out to thaw variety, and the fries were room temperature seasoned fries.  The pickle was sad and flaccid, and the bun was, well, it was just a bun.Yeah, it was food, yeah I ate it, but WHY?  Gross.Furthermore, either this article (http://living.health.com/2008/11/24/americas-healthiest-airports/2/) is a crock, or it's another terminal of the airport because I saw nary a "healthful dining option" anywhere in the area.
The doctors are fine but the wait times are horrible. I don't expect to be seen right on the dot, but always waiting for nearly an hour with a sick, whiny toddler with all the other equally miserable parents is just dreadful.  And I'm a SAHM. I can't imagine how you're going to manage your day if you're taking time off work to be at TLC Peds. The office staff can also be nicer. It's already a stressful time for parents to be dealing with sicks kiddos, some sympathy and smiles would cheer up the patient's day.
I specifically went to Yelp to find an Italian restaurant while in Vegas.  I am shocked at how many fantastic reviews are on here.  Either most people have never had real italian food OR they had an off night because my husband and I were thoroughly disappointed.I had the carbona, and despite it being made with pancetta, it really needed salt!  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was just ok.  It was also kind of difficult to find.Sorry guys...
The Nudo counter in Eaton Center turns out a wonderful, amazing, superlative bowl of noodles.The Nudo restaurant in Chinatown does not.Craving the sesame chicken dry noodles I had had a few times downtown, I stopped by Nudo in Chinatown and ordered the same thing.The broth was not very tasty and definitely not as complex as what I'm used to. The chicken was a bit dry, with not enough sesame sauce to cover for that.But the worst is the noodles. They were overcooked (!!!) and not as fresh as usual. Even after adding the broth and stirring a lot they were one mass. Much like noodles become at home after they've been put in the fridge for a while...So basically skip this place and go to Eaton Center counter.
Eh. It was okay. The pork chop was interesting. Lots of different flavors I didn't expect. As for the desserts, take a pass. I really wanted sweet or at least good chocolate. The "choc" cake was spicy and the dessert I got with the caramel cake tasted sour. Not what I was expecting at all for an $80 bill. The ambiance inside was awesome though despite the beggars outside.
Great new building, same sh*t service and food. Go there for drinks but not if you're hungry. 'Nough said.
We were a little hesitant to even try this place due to the many warnings of mediocre food and poor service. But, it was close and we were thirsty and hungry so...I agree that this is a nice looking, clean place. It would probably be great to watch a game. The country twang was turned up a little high for me but I can't knock them for that. If it was gameday, I'm sure I would be happy.Our server was new and did a decent job. Never let our beer glasses go empty. However, I must agree with many others regarding said beer glasses: do not use Mason jars, and especially WARM Mason jars to serve your beer! I get that they are trying for a theme of sorts and they are OK for mixed drinks, but the stupid jars don't work for beer. I couldn't even drink my first one for over 10 minutes because of the massive amount of head on the beer from the jar. By the time it calmed down, it was warm. On to the food. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The chicken was soggy and almost room temp. We think they used sauce straight out of the fridge which cooled the chicken and made it a mess. The bread was barely toasted and got super soggy quickly. I had a burger and asked for it to be medium rare. It was almost raw and was supposed to have avocado on it. It had less than a teaspoon of storebought guacagoo on it. I know because I scraped it off. We pointed this out to our new server and he just laughed. Not funny. Asked for the manager and she never came. Finished our beers, sent both plates over 2/3 full back, paid our bills and said goodbye to The Haymaker.Two stars because the fries were good.
Have heard great things about this place but was left less than impressed.  Silverskin wasn't removed from my ribs and there was a price of plastic wrap in my Mac and cheese.  Cornbread wasn't bad though and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce they offered.  Main complaint was the tempature of my food which basically just slightly warm. When your meat is sitting in a hot box to stay warm after smoking please make sure it reaches the appropriate tempature, no one wants to get sick from lunch.
Came here after reading the BlogTO article. Restaurant is located in a corner of a Plaza, difficult to spot from the street. Service was really slow even though the restaurant was empty. The dips were ok. Falafel and Shawarma were alright. The pita was warmed up not baked fresh. Lighting wasn't great either. The slow service is what really got to me.
Mediocre at best. I had been to this Bistro previously when it had a different name and had walked away pleasantly plump however my experience the other evening was not as filling or fulfilling. It wasn't the food that put me off most however as it was the conversations overheard about the patrons that didn't impress. I would have bought into the fake greeting had i not been privy to the server's true feelings about the less than busy business and the shortcomings of the patrons who bestowed this establishment. Someone needs to be reminded of just who puts those paper bills in your pocket. My suggestion to you is to be cognisant of your surroundings and please revert back to your previous recipe for steak as this version does not compare. Good luck to you in this tight economy as this schmuck will be spending $ at venues more deserving of my hard earned dollar. C'est la vie.
First time.. Only time.I ordered the blue cheese mushrooms burger and waited forever for it to arrive. I was blown away at the tiny size of this $11 burger. It tasted fine, but the price is ridiculous for what this place is. If you want to feel like you're in a nicer place than your average burger joint, I guess it has a certain appeal.Food...? Pretty good.Service...? Super slow and just bad in general.Value...? Not.I don't understand why all these restaurants on Gilbert Rd. have become so full of fluff and high prices. What happened?
I've gone twice and my experiences were very inconsistent. I had the Capitano burger and fries both times.The first time, my burger was noticeably overcooked and dry. The fries were also well-done, but quite good - they appeared to be fresh.The second time, my burger was perfect - juicy, flavourful and meaty. It was probably one of the better burgers around - better than Five Guys or the much-ballyhooed Burger's Priest. But my fries were awful - greasy, undercooked (yes, this time they were undercooked) frozen McCain Superfries.If they could figure out some consistency, this would be my go-to place for a burger downtown.
I've shopped in this particular Vape Land twice - both times purchasing pricey vapes, along with a fair amount of spare atomizers and liquid.Each time I've shopped, the staff has been helpful and knowledgeable.  BUT, in both instances, the (expensive) vapes (after less than 45 days) have simply died.  As I live a long ways away, I cannot "bring it in".  Their only other advice is to send it in for warranty work.  The staff refused to help me troubleshoot over the phone - which was what I was hoping for.I live in a remote area and do not appreciate products which regularly fail - leaving you with nothing.  I would recommend NOT buying their products unless you live close to one of their stores.  They are simply not reliable.
Made reservations on OpenTable. They were slow, so we were sat ASAP. $40 corkage fee for a bottle of wine we brought. We thought that was very high, so we just ordered drinks. I had the barrel-aged old fashion. Too many ice cubes. Tasted like bourbon on ice with a cherry. $16. I'll pass. It also took over 10 mins to get our cocktails after we ordered them. As far as the food goes. Ordered the French onion soup to start. Again, took a long long time to come out (and it's a slow time - 630pm). Soup tasted good, although very watery. Presentation was awful.No bread or anything for the table and the waitress Mariel, rarely came around. Main course took an excessive amount of time to come out. Meanwhile, no waitress in sight. Main course was the Rigatoni in Bolognese. Pretty good, however it came out only warm, not hot. Waitress didn't check on us again. We asked for the check and left. I give it 2 stars. Standard, over-priced Vegas Strip restaurant that doesn't pay much attention to detail or quality. I don't think we will be coming back.
Genuinely surprised at all the good reviews on here, after telling friends and fam about my verbal review I wanted to make it official on Yelp. The beer was awful, I had been told by many people on the beer culture of Charlotte that it was but I had to find out for myself. I have a deep rooted love for Noda Brewery, Birdsong and a high respect for Triple C and Old Meck, and Heist's beer makes our town's brewers look bad. Food was good, tasty, and impressive, but I got only four of the Parmesan Garlic Tator Tots. Note to owners, no one who orders Tots wants only four, regardless of quality. I rarely write negative reviews, so here is more good: service, top notch. Decor, lovely. Sorry, back to negative: pricey, a bit pretentious and how do you screw up a red ale? I'm a homebrewer, that style might as well be training wheels! I'd go back if I were with work people who didnt like beer and were paying for the food. Otherwise, I'm getting a better burger at Jack Beagles down the street with a better beer to boot, then going to Noda brewery for the real draft.
Whoohoo! 100th review on Yelp! Sad it's not a five star though. I read reviews. Looked at pictures and was excited to try this place.We ordered a few apps and sushi rolls from the HH menu and it was all just okay. Chicken wings had a great crispiness and there was a delish garlic sauce just on halfThe chicken wing. I wish it came with more sauce. Calamari was disappointing. It was just random cut up sticks that were overcooked and dipping sauce was sour.  Husband enjoyed his shrimp tempura roll and bulgogi. The bulgogi was burnt and had that burnt bitter flavor and came out last. I had the 6 piece sashimi special. Fish was cold but the cuts were a joke. They literally took one normal slice of tuna and cut it in half. The salmon was two whole slices and the "white fish" ended up being red snapper. At least they were whole slices. I also had the jalapeño roll. Which was literally a jalapeño popper in a sushi roll. It was pretty good surprisingly and had the volcano roll. Presentation was cool because they lit it on fire. Service was a bit much. The girl we had was the onlyOne working until just before we left. She constantlyKept asking if we were ready to order. But when you give me a book of rolls. It's gonna take time for me to read them. Lol. In the end. Food was just okay. Edible. Service was okay. There are just other better places. I guess a plus is they offer a large happy hour menu compared to others.
Can't say I'm a fan of Pei Wei.  The food is very safe and MOR.  It's the "go to" place for your white christian co-workers who don't normally like asian food.  Not that I've ever had anything bad there, just . . . it's the Applebee's of asian restaurants . . . it feels wrong ordering asian food from white kidsI will give them this . . . I don't normally care for chinese egg rolls (how can you when vietnamese egg rolls with fish sauce are a billion times better), but theirs are probably the best I've had
Sorry for the lack of stars.. It's only cus i've only been here a few times and that was cus it's the closest to my house. The 2 stars are mainly for this cinco de mayo roll I had. It was a whole green chili pepper. The taste was more pleasant it's looks. And the other star is for actually have PLUM ice cream. Other than that.. The price is too dramatic for my belly. And most of the meat here doesn't seem as fresh. Seriously, my wallet is more in pain than the tightness of my jeans at the waist.
Employees are generally rude and unhelpful. I shop here only because they have the best produce in town. I shop here every week and Mike and Norma B who are greeters and an Asian lady in the deli whose name I do not know are the only friendly, helpful people.
John came out to repair my AC and discovered that I had a leak in the line and had lost all the Freon in the unit. He offered some options for repair and I chose to go with a liquid sealant through the lines, to try and repair the leak, and to refill the unit with Freon. John said this was the cheapest option but did tell me it was not guaranteed to work. The repair did not last, so we requested a quote for a new unit. At the same time I also requested quotes from 3 other companies for the exact unit. After looking over the quotes John was the highest by more than 30%. I have not complaints about the service John gave but I would be sure to compare prices for replacement parts/service when using him.
Terrible service and subpar food at best. I wouldn't return. The salad..... Is the worst haha. A joke, few pieces of lettuce with some drips of thousand island sauce....Why would you pay even average price for very below average food and service... Will not repeat.
Ok. Looking for a nice restaurant to have dinner for the family. Mother had a burger, 2 kids split diver scallops, 1 kid ordered she crab and Mac n cheese off of the bar menu, wife had  , and I had the ribeye (2 pieces of meat the size of a meatball). Charged a split fee, charged for every soda refill, everything. No wine, 1 mixed drink. Bill north of 250. Wait staff was great, chef/owner great. Food to price to portion ratio? Definitely other places to go , equally as good if not better, at a fraction of the price.
If you think this is good pizza, you need to get out more. I tried two kinds: the bronze dragon and the breakfast pizza. I honestly couldn't tell you which was supposed to be which. Maybe it was because the line was long, but the crust was underdone and too doughy, and the sausage, which was on both pizzas, was still pink. I'm not from the Midwest and I have yet to find pizza that even comes close to what I'm used to in PA/NJ/NY.
I've lived in the area a long time but never been to Cappy's..and now I know why. When you walk in there's no one to acknowledge you or seat you. Then a waitress came by and said to sit wherever. Our server was lethargic and just seemed out of it.. They have about 5 beers on tap- majority just domestics. They do have a lot of bottles apparently but no bottle list to choose from...so. We got sandwiches and they were decent but the fries (which they charge extra for) tasted freezer burnt. We had to ask for silverware and napkins...TWICE. I honestly don't even understand how this place has survived this long in Shadyside when there are a ton of better options.
Horrible waiting staff/customer service, mediocre food. My rating is based on the food. The have a fantastic hot salsa.
Without a doubt, the sushi here was above average. Only 8 pieces of the dynamite roll and I was beyond being full. However, the service is a different story. After first reading the reviews, Mi-Ne appeared to be a comfortable location that was close to where I worked. Upon arrival, we quickly realized how cramped up the space was. My friends and I had to squeeze sit within the boundaries of the booth, which was not exactly what I expected from this sushi place. We waited nearly 30 minutes for someone to take our order. When we signaled for them to come, they said that they would be there shortly, and not arrive within 10 minutes. We signaled several of their employees, but they appeared too frazzled to even come and stop by our booth.Nonetheless, the food quality was still on par. I would have liked to not be starving prior to the arrival of our food.
Ate here with my wife for what I figured was going to be dinner, but wasn't really.  We had been to the Hash House a Go Go at the M Resort before that location closed and were pleased with the meal we had then, so we figured we'd try the Henderson location as it's the closest to where we live.  We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be about a 10 minute wait, even though there were tables available on both sides of the restaurant . After only about 5 minutes we were seated.  I always find it strange when a couple is seated at a table for four, when there are tables for two available.  It seems like poor planning.  Anyway, after we were seated we waited several more minutes for our server to take our drink orders.  While we waited, we scanned the menu to find that there were no dinner options, only breakfast and brunch.  We asked our server where the dinner menus were but this location is only serving brunch until they "get up to speed" - kind of strange to me, as they've been open for 10 days, and have multiple locations in town.  Since dinner was out, and that's what my wife and I had planned for we really had to struggle to find what we wanted to eat.  We had both read the online menu before leaving the house, so we had our minds set on certain meals, only to have to change ideas at the last moment.  I'd had their stuffed burger at their M Resort location and thought it was pretty good, though lacking seasoning, so I figured I'd try one again.  Although my wife and I debated about getting the chicken pot pie we each went with the stuffed burger.She selected the Swiss and mushroom burger, while I wanted the Cheddar burger, but I also wanted bacon on it.  When I asked the server if they could add bacon, he said he would add a side of bacon.  At the M Resort location every meal came with a biscuit, and their biscuits were about the size of a saucer.  When I asked our server if our meals came with a biscuit, he said they didn't, but he would add one, so I said we'd each want one.It took quite a while for us to get our food, I had ordered the biscuits in hopes they would come first as a sort of appetizer as we were both very hungry, however they came with the meal - sort of.  My burger came out first, without bacon.  Then after a few minutes I got my biscuit, when I asked where my wife's biscuit was the waiter said he thought we had only wanted one, and would send out another.  My wife received her burger next, then finally my bacon and our second biscuit.  The burgers are large - 2 1/2 pound patties, but it's almost as if they don't season them when they're being fried, there's very little flavor.  My wife's Swiss and mushroom burger had only one detectable mushroom, but so much Swiss it was sliding off the burger - that's a good thing about the Swiss though!  My burger had a nicely flavored cheddar, but it wasn't oozing out like my wife's Swiss was.  I also find that the bun which is very bland also takes flavor from the burger.  The fries are very plain, with little flavor as well.  The Mac-n-Cheese is not what I had expected - it's thin, with an artificial cheese flavor - lacking substance and just not satisfying.  And then there were the biscuits - The one's at M Resort were large, soft and fluffy, flaky, and full of flavor.  My first biscuit was so hard, I couldn't cut it in half.  When I asked the server if this is how the biscuit was supposed to be, she said she didn't know, she had never had their biscuits.  So we got two more that were fresh out of the oven - they were better, but still hard and very dry and very small.  We were also given some sort of jam (?) with the biscuits - we were never told what it was, even though we got 4 containers of them, and the butter that came with the jam was only about 1/4 of the container.  I had to ask twice more for more butter - and each time only got 1/4 of a container - butter shortage?  Won't be back to this location for a while - might stop in again if they start serving dinner - but can't see ever getting the burger again.  They've got a long way to go, and staff needs to be educated much better (have to ask for everything, ask for refills of drinks, remind servers that you need certain items, etc.) before this location can really carry the Hash House a Go Go name.
This was a very out of body experience for my husband and I the other night. We arrived without a reservation and were given the option to wait 30 minutes or sit at the community table. We chose the community table. We also paid a little attention to the incoming crowd, but probably saw around 2 whole tables come in after us with a plush amount of open seating getting cold in the dining room. The staff was a little scripted. A lot scripted. I felt like I was on a Lord of the Rings ride at Universal Studios or something. Okay, I don't even know if that's a ride. I guess if you really don't pay attention to the whole price/ food equation, then you don't realize how much you are getting ripped off. Sure, I love the down home local farm food just as much as the next gal. That's pretty much all I make at home. I was raised in the South. But my $9 salad consisted of a few sheaths of bib lettuce, and a sprinkle of other things. I wasn't expecting gold nuggets in the thing, but come on. The dinner was so-so. Again, if you take the price out of the equation it was enjoyable to eat. Then reality sinks in when you get the bill and realize you are sitting at a community table surrounded by guys on internet dates with fair that you find at a country diner and a bill that rivals that one you would get at Domminck's. Next time I think we will save the whole dressing up thing and just eat at home. Hey, I can make a mean grilled cheese, too, Beckett.
I'm not from cleveland but feel like I've been to this chain enough to get the gist.  I just don't think it's very good.  It's basically a diner, yet the food takes very long to make it out of the kitchen.  Service is spotty and forgetful.  The menu is big, but not really a lot of variety.  Just the same stuff repackaged as different items.  I legitimately think Bob Evans is a better breakfast
Very average breakfast food. Everything came out quickly, but for a place that's based around breakfast I would expect a little more. I had 3 eggs, bacon, hash browns and wheat toast. I ordered the eggs over medium and they were slightly runny. Bacon ordered crispy and it was slightly chewy. Hash browns were cooked ok a tad under seasoned and then there was the bread, Jesus Christ it was the size of a phone book. Coffee was normal weak crappy diner style coffee. If you've ever been to a place where you walked away thinking "I could easily make this at home" this would be the place for that...Our server was very nice and attentive on the upside.
If you are going here please do not have Ricky (he's a younger male) do your nails. He is so rude and doesn't pay any attention to detail. I went in to get my nails done like I do every two weeks. This time I was given someone new. He was rude from the start. He doesn't like being told that his work isn't good. When he was done with my nails he put the fan in front of them and that led to the top coat smudging. I left because I had another appointment after that. I returned like 4 hours later and told them i needed to get them fixed. He did a horrible job at filing them. He left part of the powder on my skin. They were thick and crooked. He was very upset that i went back to get them fixed. He kept being rude and didn't want to do them but he wouldn't allow anyone else to help me after me telling him that I wanted someone else. I usually love this place but he is horrible at nails and customer service.
Moved here and needed to get my hair highlighted, after calling several places this place seemed to be the cheapest.  Hair stylist was okay, nothing spectacular.  My color came out ok, once again nothing spectacular.  At check out the price I was told over the phone was doubled and the girl had the nerve to ask for tip. It wasnt worth what I paid and i wont go back.
Nice guys but poor service. Inaccurate info on when my car would be completed. When it finally was done, the interior was a mess and grease all over the seats and carpets. How do I even know if they changed all the fluids if they don't care about my car?
First I'll start by saying we love the B&N at Chandler Fashion Square! That being said, this location is a completely different experience...not in a good way. We found the employees to be very rude and not very helpful; and they were out of everything they said they had in Stock.  We stopped by the customer service desk on the first floor and she acted like we were completely putting her out for asking where to find a certain genre of book. There was another woman employee who scolded my children in front of me for "walking up the escalator too loudly." The kids were not being rowdy or disrespectful...they weren't even running up the escalator but walking! They were excited to pick out new books as they love to read! If they don't want kids going upstairs, they should probably keep the kids books on the first floor!  There was a young man working upstairs that was very nice and actually very helpful, he just couldn't find anything because, although their computer said the book was in, it was not. He tried and was very apologetic. He also mentioned how understaffed they were. I believe it! The cashier mentioned  the same thing and was also very nice. (This fact is the ONLY reason I even gave it 2 stars). Needless to say, I will NOT be frequenting this location again.  I prefer a stocked B&N with employees who are willing to help and harvest children's love of reading.
Worst service through the drive-through today. The gal didn't even acknowledge me when I drove up. She looked and got my drink, then just handed it to me and told me how much it was. Didn't tell me what my drink was or ask if it  was correct.  Took my debit card swiped it and then just handed it to me and didn't even look at me. She was way too busy having a conversation with him ever was there with her working. This is one reason why I don't like going to Starbucks the customer service pretty much sucks.
I usually like this place, but today was very disappointing. I give 2 stars because our waiter was very nice. My husband's chicken picatta was bland. He did like his onion soup. I ordered shrimp with angel hair pasta. I thought that is what I ordered. I showed the waiter on a particular page. I showed him shrimp with angel hair pasta but when I was served my lunch, it looked odd. It was soggy breaded shrimp on the side in little sauce, burnt sauce pieces and whole garlic cloves and a Luke warm ball of the pasta. The shrimp coating was pasty/soggy and had a weird flavor. I flagged the waiter and we reviewed the ordering/food quality situation. We decided I ordered the Scampi which has the breaded shrimp and whole garlic cloves. Whatever. He brought me 6 nicely sauteed shrimp which was brought after I ate the slightly warm ball of pasta. I didn't want to complain too much as to not further make my husband uncomfortable. It is hard enough that he needs gluten free so I was clear and took blame for the wording of my order though what I was pointing to and reading from the menu was not the item I was served. Even though I told our waiter the pasta was not hot, he did not offer to fix that.They were also out of soup spoons and offered my husband a tea spoon or a pasta (large spoon). Very weird. That happened when I had soup there 3 months ago. The ladies restroom was dirty and trash can over flowing with trash on the sink and floor. I let them know the ladies room needed attention as I was leaving. The waiter was very nice and 80% attentive. It was an expensive lunch. Not sure if we will go back. I am a former restaurant professional instructor and shopper. I try and not be too critical.
Two stars only because the wine was great, though we waited an incredible 35 minutes for it to arrive at our table and it was the first thing that did arrive, but not the first to take a long time. The server seemed nice, though ill informed and overburdened with customers. The owner was flitting about, not being overhelpful and scantily dressed. Is it wrong to have something like a uniform in a restaurant these days or at least dress like you have some kind of pride in what you do? To pay 125$ for a bottle of wine and ROOM TEMP oysters, cool fried cat tails, sad sad sad greens, a few pieces of duck breast and some unidentifiable deep fried stuff( best thing we ate) is a bit scandalous I think. It took an astounding 40 minutes after our ordering for the food to arrive in the sad state it did, the temperature suggested perhaps it was ready and waiting 10 minutes before.The general vibe is one of confusion and frankly I cannot imagine ever going back, shameful as I found the concept intriguing and inspiring.
Friday January 5 at around 1p I went inside the restaurant to order the crispy chicken sandwich meal. What I got was a longer than expected wait, employees who weren't knowledgeable of their own menu and excuses. The woman in front of me ordered the Rodeo chicken sandwich, but was given a fish sandwich, she told Michelle, the cashier who took her order, Michelle tried to relay that to the cook who responded with he doesn't know how to make that. I watched as Michelle took the fish sandwich from the customer and place it back on the warmer to be served again (EW!) once the cook came out and talked to the customer directly he was able to understand exactly what the woman wanted (Michelle kept saying 'rodeo' in a way that made it hard to understand)I had to wait about 10 minutes to order while being told that they are short staffed and that I would get waited on when she gets to me.My order took about another 10 minutes to get. Food was about warm. Definitely wont be returning after watching food get handled by a patron and then placed back to be served again instead of thrown away. I get you pay for what you get but geez!
I have two tanks - a 5 gallon tank for a beta and a 20 gallon tank for two goldfish. When I moved to this side of town, I noticed that my goldfish had lost a substantial amount of scales. I waited a few weeks to make sure it wasn't a growth spurt, fighting or injury during transportation that they lost their scales. I was worried that it could possibly be a bacterial infection and headed over here for some medicine and a background for their tank.I asked one of the sales people to point me in the direction of the medicine. Instead I got a lecture about how I should totally just wait it out because their tanks have tons of scales from their fish at times. Here's the thing. I don't have 300 small fish in a 15-20 gallon tank that are susceptible to overcrowding, fighting and damage from fish constantly being scooped out. I have two 6 inch goldfish in a proper sized tank that they never leave. My situation is different. I never was shown where the medicine was.I also wanted a tropical tank background for my larger tank. The same sales girl told me I should really just go with the black background instead because it's so superior and how the other backgrounds are cheesy. I didn't ask for a personal opinion. If they're the same price, give me what I asked for. Instead she cut off the black background roll and told me if I didn't like it, I could return it. Agh! Every time I look at the tank, I'm upset with the background because it looks weird. On another occasion I had to buy a replacement 18" 15 watt bulb for my tank. They had two in stock that were $9.99. I got home and put it in. Nothing. I could hear something knocking around inside as if the filament was already broken. Agh! I took it back and asked to open the only other bulb they had in stock before I purchased it. It was also broken. I got a refund and went to PetCo. This location has a large selection for aquatics, but I cant give this place a higher rating because their sales staff doesn't understand that it's my money so skip the lectures if it is not an animal safety issue, and give me what I'm asking for.
Well, correction to my previous review. I did go back there but they did not have the creamy rice soup I liked. The BBQ rips was not great. My hubby's BBQ is way better. My husband had a chili soup and he didn't like it either. Like the previous reviewer said this is the kind of place to you go for experience, not for the food. After a long water play, my kids usually eat anything but the didn't even finish half their order and came home still hungry.It was a disappointment but  I would go back there for their rice soup.
I've been a big fan of moxies since the start, and specifically this location, I remember being there when they first opens in 2007 maybe or so, and always been a regular customer.But lately, the quality has been going down constantly..!!Last time I visited this location was last year sometime in the summer, and I was very disappointed then.So today, I decided to give it another chance, since I love the 'original Moxie's', but things are still not that good unfortunately.They have revamped the menu majorly, keeping some of their main/top seller items, while modifying/adding new items..Presentation has changed also, they now use aluminium trays for nachos for example rather than the original setup, or clay rectangle and oval plates for appetizers.We ordered three appetizers and all three were too greasy..As for our mains, we had the lettuce burger, chipotle chicken, caesar salad with chicken, steak salad and pasta. Needless to say, all plates were dry and missing flavour.On the other hand, moxie's used to have (in my opinion) the best service at a chain restaurant, hands down!This has hit rock bottom now, the service today was below average, slow and just like the food...tasteless!Sadly, this puts an end to my Moxie's obsession!
First off... know that you will be charged another $10 dollars just to PARK!. Basic ticket price is $37.50 per person (everyone over 12 yrs). Is it worth it? a reluctant yea.. there are a lot of inter-active games and displays. I bought tickets 4-5 weeks ago, and was so excited that it was opening here, just a mile away! If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now it's off my bucket list, i'm not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, it's cold throughout. Bring the kids, it's more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lack-lustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food on-site, which we didn't try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside (outside) available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the 'Holo-Blaster Training Simulator' and the 'Black Widow Agility Maze'. There was an 'Avengers Encounter' that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed 'hokey', good-hearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a $10 per car fee since you're already spending money at my place? That is sooo retarded, shame on you for not putting that in your website, or with ticketmaster. I carry just credit cards anymore... you need to bring cold hard cash and lots of it.
Location that's it.....high priced drinks, mediocre service, bad food....this place was a lot better 1 year ago. Find an alternative
When is bar first opened I was excited!  I thought the concept was awesome and it would be like a neighborhood bar.  Instead it is nothing but a tourist attraction for race fans with the need to do all things Dale Jr.  I've been three times hoping it would get better but if I want to drink overpriced beer with a mediocre atmosphere, I would not go uptown to do it..  And if you don't like Whisky River and trot down to Suite, it is also a total bomb... The only reason I gave it two stars is 1, it has beer, and 2 it has a bull....
I went there last night to celebrate my cousin's birthday. With a party of 4 plus 3 children. I came to this Olive Garden first time like 3 months ago, I come here like once a month. After tonight I might think twice before returning to that place. I am personally surprised that one dining trip would make me dislike a place so much.First, one salad was brought out for 7 people, we asked for another, has that simply not enough. The second salad arrived with entries, the order of one of the party was pretty late. I ordered herbal chicken, it was not cooked right and did not taste good. We had 2 waitresses since it is a large party and still could not get a good service.Then comes time to pay and everyone's ticket is messed up. People were paying for things they never ordered and our credit cards were late like 30 min. In summery it was a bad experience.
I'll make this to the pointthe bad:1. There are much better restaurants in this price range, SW being one.2. The food is overpriced for what you get.3. Don't sit on the couches on the wall, they're way over used. The table was at my chest and had to ask to be moved.4. The busser did the server's job, besides take orders.5. The server didn't introduce herself nor welcome us to the restaurant (not being picky, but many patrons expect this when you're paying $130 per person.)6. The hostess had to take our dessert order because the waitress was nowhere to be found, which is extremely irritating.7. I had to send back the scotch I wanted because they gave it to me with cocktail ice. This is completely unacceptable for a $22 scotch.The good:1. The decor was very nice and not too bright or dark.2. They give out free appetizers, french fries, which are pretty good.3. The hostesses are very accommodating.4. Decent beers and excellent wines.
Fish and chips is usually a safe bet in Toronto.  Not here.  Looked ok when it arrived but then quickly became soggy.  So did the fries.  No idea why that happened.  Were they frozen and then fried too wet?  And the tablespoon of accompanying coleslaw wasn't very good.  While the servers tried to be friendly, I noted that my water glass remained empty; they didn't check and didn't refill.  I just wanted to leave.
It was alright . Don't see what the fuss is all about. Kind of heavy pizza. Tried it but going back to my east of Chicago !
Two stars only because of the staff, otherwise would be 1 star for no wait to  be seated. My chicken tortilla soup was EXTREMELY salty, the red wine was so watered down that it was near transparent, my mother got the wrong dressing, and why why do they water down the salsa so much that it's like vaguely seasoned water? Free is no excuse, everything served should be up to reasonable standards....but at least the waitress was nice.
Disappointed in my last two visits and Miro has always been a favorite.  I ordered seafood both times and the last time, I was told the scallops would be jumbo scallops.  It was very obvious they weren't jumbo.  The topping was simply tomato, onion and way, way too much green pepper.  This was over a very small portion of spinach which I requested instead of rice.  I could have prepared the exact same thing in my own kitchen for next to nothing and it probably would have been better. I won't return for a long time.
This use to be my goto spot. I went today and they jacked up the prices, cut the portions and when I asked about it they claim they gave me more, and demanded tips.Guess I'll find another spot to get my fix.
This place has a nice look and lots of friendly wait staff but the food was very bland overpriced for the quality.  They only serve beer and wine and the beer is all cheap stuff like bud light and corona.  We ate here our first night at the hotel and decided not to eat here again.  I'd suggest going to Luna Rosa just across the street.
convenient to my office for a quick snack pick up but Extremely overpriced. the same bag of chips is exactly twice the price from what i can get from Sobey's. ridic
Several months ago I walked in like always and waited to be next in line for my stylist and someone who got there after me got called first so when I questioned it I was told that they were starting to take appointments and although I was upset I continued to come to this location because after all I have been coming for almost 20 years and appointments would be more convenient. Yesterday 1/27/17 I called and made an appointment for my husband with a specific stylist for 10am cause that is what time she was coming in. So today 1/28/17 We arrived minutes before 10am and sat down and watched the stylist come in to report to work. Once she prepared herself and got ready to take her first customer whom I assumed was my husband because that is who the appointment was made for. She takes another customer and when I spoke up and said we had an appointment she said yeah but she's been waiting awhile. So my husband asked then what good is it to make an appointment. She was like well we are told when they have been here awhile we have to take them first. Which is utterly ridiculous. Never have I been in any place of business where a walk in is served first prior to an appointment. If we had been late then that would be the only explanation that would make sense but we weren't. So tell me why am I making an appointment if you are not going to honor it?????   Angie
Acceptable food, but very bad service.  Waiters often forget orders or give you the wrong one.  Sometimes they say "last call" then forget about it.  Still, there aren't really many other similar restaurants that offer better food, so go there if you can put up with it.
We used to love coming to this restaurant, but I must say last night will be our last.   From the beginning our service was horrible - it took our waitress over 20 minutes to even come over to the table and it was downhill from there (it was  busy, but not crazy).   There were six of us, and she opened one bottle of wine, but never asked if anyone else wanted drinks.  Four others did, but didn't get them till way past appetizers (which came out at two different times).   Our salads came out about an hour after we ordered, and dinner way after that.   The chicken and veal parm dishes were very good, as was the veal jolina.  The lamb chops looked good, but were really just average. Unfortunately I had veal piccata and specifically asked about the sauce as I am gluten sensitive - she told me lemon juice, white wine and capers.  Must say I was very surprised when my veal came out smothered in a white pasty sauce and tasted the same.  I couldn't eat it, but the waitress didn't know that because she never came back to the table until well after everyone else was done eating.  She asked me if I wanted something else, but I opted out since I didn't want to make the other guests wait for an hour while I got another entree.  One would think they would not have charged me for that meal, but alas - it was on our bill (which took another 20 minutes or so).  Overall we were all disappointed and will be on a quest to look for a new BYOB.   I don't mind a long relaxing dinner with good service and good food, but this was not it.  Time to move on.
What has happened to your food? We were so disappointed. I ordered the chicken mole pablano. . Mole Pablano in general is one of my favorite dishes but your had no taste and was so watered down.. As I tried the salsa , it was so darn hot I asked the waitress if they had a milder salsa or taco sauce whatever I said. I like some heat but this was way too hot. She said we had a child's salsa. Well that wasn't necessary to tell us, I thought, , just bring us a milder sauce.  Never came.The son ordered your fajiatas.  When ordering the dinner the waitress asked if he wanted sour cream and salsa. Usually when asked that, it is for the main course/. Ahead of main dish she brought I guess what was a salad?? with lettuce and sour cream and salsa on it. Weird.His dish seemed like the onions were cooked somewhat, peppers thrown in and this no taste, tough meat.   There was not a hint of even salt and pepper. The dinner came out so fast you knew it was just slapped together.I reminded the waitress about the salsa and she brings this little dish with hot taco sauce. Now granted I may have said Taco sauce but when originally I asked for it, it was clear I wanted milder salsa.  Finally the refried beans were so watered down that I felt like I was eating baby food.Only good thing was my son was able to use it for the fajiatas to give it some flavor. Best thing still at your place are the Margaritas.  I had just taught a cooking class that day was looking forward to one of those.Please look at how your cooks are making things.  Robert Irvine would have thrown most of it out.
I would've given three stars if not for the neglected, dust covered ceiling around the fans and vents. That's not a good sign of cleanliness.The food: my chili relleno was spongy, the tacos were soggy, and the enchilada had a weird taste. The rice was bland, but the beans were great.The service was lackadaisical.Wow, I guess I actually didn't like this place. Too bad. It's been here a long time, and this is the first time we've tried it.Oh, the chips and salsa were really good, and the place has an authentic ambience.
My fiancé and I originally drove to this side of town to eat at Yama, but the wait was over an hour. We found Sakana on yelp and after viewing the reviews we decided to try it out. Upon our arrival, there was confusion about where the line was or if the hostess took names. We were seated about ten minutes later. The decor in this place is a little confusing. The ambiance is that of a college dorm, with chalk board walls and beer signs. The seats are wooden with no backs.We ordered appetizers first which came out in 3-5 mins. Then we decided to order rolls and we waited for over 30 mins! The waiter kept apologizing for the wait. After waiting we only received one out of four rolls that we ordered and by that time we were ready to leave.We waiting another 20 mins for the waiter to bring us our check. Over all experience;The service was awful, the table next to us kept getting their rolls promptly and we waited. The place is unorganized when it comes to service, they kept bringing the wrong rolls to the table next to us.The food was decent. The cuts of fish were big and rice portions small. Save yourself the 26.99 and go to Yama sushi or Sushi Mon. Those are my go to places and this will be the last time I try a new sushi spot.
I wish I could give this place a separate review for experience and results. I went for the aquadermabrasion facial (which was on special) last month, and at the time I thought it was the best facial I'd ever had. The massage I got was great, the facial treatment was very relaxing, and the products she used didn't irritate my allergies or asthma. But, the results? Not good. I'm not sure if my skin is just too sensitive for this treatment, but I've been peeling in certain places (namely around my mouth and chin) since. It truly seems like a chemical burn - the skin is red, inflamed, and peeling and nothing has seemed to soothe it. I've had to go out and buy special (and expensive) moisturizer because the rest of the products that I normally used without issue now burn when I put them on. I'm disappointed, because I really did enjoy the experience quite a bit and the location is convenient. I typically visit the 10 Spot, but once in awhile it is nice to get the full "spa" experience. Alas, the search continues!
Pretty bad customer service. Got the vehicle just fine and it worked well. Guy behind the counter were talking bad about a customer in front of me and didnt seem to care to help her.
Friday late afternoon and they did not have the Samuel Adams beer I ordered. I changed to Corona, again, on the menu, and of course, they did not have any! I ate the wedge salad - great taste, fresh and crisp lettuce. Hubby had their regular burger. No condiments on this at all - no mayo, no ketchup, nothing. Service was less than average; server not engaged. Went back 7 am breakfast on Monday. Server was Kendra and she was awesome! Breakfast was good; nothing special, though.  Kendra was friendly, engaged and attentive. Great decor, lots of memorabilia, music videos playing on all screens. I wouldn't seek this restaurant out and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, but if you're staying at Circus Circus, 7.99 steak and egg breakfast with server, Kendra, sounds good and maybe just wander around and look at the pictures!
We came here for the 2nd time last week after the first two restaurants we tried were closed on Mondays. I was pretty disappointed with my meal here both times.Our first visit, we had the Thai chicken rolls which I remember being good but nothing that will forever stand out in my memory or compel me to order them again. My husband ordered ribs which were really, really good and I had the one potato, two potato grouper which was greasy and pretty flavorless. The fries were good, coleslaw not so much. Overall an ok experience since we both liked the beer. This time around, we both got burgers (mine was the blue cheese, husband got the bacon barbeque one). We ordered both medium and they came out WAY past well done. Just like the burgers I remember my dad burning, err....grilling as a child (not a pleasant memory). Fries were good (standard for a bar/grill). Really, the only saving grace for this meal was the chicken queso appetizer we ordered which was SO good!! No drinks this time so I can't speak to that but overall we have had about a 25% success rate with our entrees. Probably won't be back unless it's for appetizers and/or ribs and a drink.
One thing my wife and I try to avoid on date night are big corporate chain restaurants; once I heard that Larry and Guy sold the amazing Eddie V's brand to Red Lobster I swore I'd never go back.  However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.The KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit I'm living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item I've ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but it's been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than 30 times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there; every time it was like "I can't believe this is so amazing." That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in 1987.  To finish on a positive note: our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the "pre Red Lobster" version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.  I know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie V's so my review doesn't amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didn't water down great and unique recipes.  We'll stick with the privately owned, local places from now on.
I wonder why Yelp has censored some of the reviews of this restaurant. Two reviews that gave it 1 star out of 5 have disappeared as well as my initial review (3 stars) and follow up review (2 stars). This is bound to be a controversial restaurant. Some people will be dazzled by the decor and will love it. Other people will notice that the food is not as good as other restaurants. The sushi pales when compared to the sushi at the best AYCE restaurants in Brampton including Hockey Sushi which is in the same mall. The cooked food, salad bar and deserts are not as good as The Mandarin. I have twice tried the food in the "Live Cooking" area and found it to be bland. Some people will love this place and others will hate it. No restaurant can please everyone. Still I am puzzled that Yelp has deleted some reviews by people who did not like the place, but did not delete the rave review by Brian H who did not seem to try the food and wrote about Wok Of Fame's expansion plans.
I had eaten here two years ago, and remember it being really good.  I sat at the bar, the bartender was spot-on, and the food was excellent.Went back this last weekend, and was underwhelmed.  The staff was friendly, helpful, and on-point, which was very much noticed and appreciated.  But the food itself seemed to really lack.I had the Jamaican Curry bowl, which is the last item on the vegetarian menu.  It tasted overspiced; not too spicy, but just as if someone had put in three times the spices the dish called for.  I can't imagine the chef who made this tasted it and liked it.My girlfriend got the salmon, which was a really good-sized portion, but it could probably have been fresher.  We split an appetizer that was pretty good, and each had one drink.The music was great, actually.  There's a wall of speakers above the front row of tables, but it's turned to a background volume, which led to the music being clear, well balanced, and unobtrusive.  The decor was good, and I especially liked the custom trussing of lights over the bar.  Anyways, after tax and tip, the entrees should have wowed the hell out of me, and they really failed to do so.  I had wanted to go try the vegetarian prix fixe, but I'll probably hold off on that for awhile.  I'll eventually head back, as I do remember having a great meal there, but at $85 for the two entrees, two drinks, and an appetizer, I'm not in a hurry to check it out again.
Well, i went there with a bunch of friends during out Thanksgiving break. I have to say i am quite disappointed with the overall experience. First of, the food took forever to come. It was a Friday night, but the restaurant was no where being full. We had a relatively big party(11 of us) but it's not like they were waiting for all of the food to be prepared in order to serve us. The foods arrived at different time with 10 minutes of gap in between. I am not sure how it could possibily take so long to prepare dishes like Steak and Frites. Afterall, it's just a Brasserie not some a tradtional French Cuisine. I ordered a special, which is a Braised Veal's Shoulder which was nothing like what the waiter has described. And i quote " it's crispy on the outside and tender in the inside". The meat is relatively dry and hard to chew. The rest of the party ordered Steak and Frites which is again mediocre for a French restaurant.  Lastly, it's pretty pricy considered that the food was nothing special. If you decide to go, just don't hold too much expectations as i did, or you will be disappointed.
Having enjoyed lunch here several times, I picked Chinato as a pre-theater dinner destination on the Tuesday of Restaurant Week. The place was packed on a Tuesday night which added great energy to the place. Several things derailed the experience. First, the restaurant was out of both Malbec and Pinot Noir by the glass. Seriously? Open another bottle and sub it. But no. The boyfriend had the pork belly app and one of the pieces was stone cold. Ugh. My salmon app was completely tasteless shredded salmon in some kind of runny mayo based binder. Only took a few bites. The boyfriend's hanger steak on greens earned good reviews from him. My fluke was just OK. Nicely breaded but under seasoned by a mile. Some kind of mashed something accompanied it and some rock hard slices of beets. Now, the lemon polenta cake as outstanding. Really good flavor, nice texture. We loved it. The apple tart was warm and comforting with a nice chewy texture. Service was slow to slower and then slowest.I realize there's a risk dining during Restaurant Week but I view it as an opportunity to showcase what a restaurant can do...in this case, not much.
Thiis place is what its reviews say it is.   In no way does this compare to non-airport Pei-Wei locations.   I had Mongolian beef and despite the long wait - which duped me into thinking my dish would be made to order - the beef was definitely dry, barely warm, and judging by the beef jerky like consistency, quite possibly from the Jurassic era.  So if you enjoy arthritis of the mandible, this is the place for you.
Good prices on food and drink, but not great food. Had fish & chips and perogies, all terribly overcooked. Friendly service, but unsteady...probably could use more staff.
Meh, it was ok but a bit expensive for a diner.  The wait staff was a bit aloof.
I struggled with the rating on this one, but I really can't give it more than 2 Stars. Yes, as shown in other reviews, the portions are very small, the cup itself is very small, and even a full cup contains less than a medium DQ cone, for a MUCH higher price. Listen, I get it that they obviously need a high margin to keep a one-trick-pony store like this afloat, hire staff, pay the rent, but $7 for a banana and a handful of berries?Still, IF the product was mind-blowingly good, then I could excuse the price, pay the extra, and enjoy the occasional yummy treat.Sadly, the product is just okay.I am an omnivore, but I cannot tell you how excited my vegan friend was that this place was right across the street from where I live, she could not wait to come visit and try the vegan softserve.Between the two of us we purchased 2 double flavour cups so we could enjoy 4 different flavours and share, but sadly, even she had to admit that everything tasted fine, but only "just fine". The basic banana was the best, pistachio was disappointing, chocolate was bland and boring. Overall, unimpressed.But her disappointment was disheartening. In the end, she decided she would continue making her own smoothies and soft serve with her Yonanas machine, in more fun flavours, all for under a buck for a much bigger serving.
My dad and I have come here for a cup of gumbo all the time since this location opened, but we probably wont be coming back. Since opening, the quality of this restaurant and its service had declined significantly. Tonight we came in to super sticky floors everywhere we walked and it took is 10 minutes to even get an order put in, though our waitress kept coming by to help the table next to us and making eye contact with us. It took extra long for my dad's beer to come out and when we reminded them, they dropped off a beer can on the table (no glass, and they didnt say a word) and ran off to help someone else. The bread they bring out always tastes lukewarm and stale, as though they quickly microwaved the loaf. It's hard to pull apart and hasnt tasted fresh since we first came in around opening. The gumbo tonight wasnt the best quality either- as avid fans of it, we were both seriously disappointed. Neither of us could finish because the taste was dull and unappetizing. We are both super bummed because this was our favorite place to stop for a quick, delicious dinner, but after tonight, we've decided we'll be taking our gumbo needs elsewhere.Update: Since posting this review, we still haven't gotten our check and its been about 20 minutes since we finished eating. The restaurant is only about half full, so I dont know what the slow service is due to. There are waiters checking on everyone else... When we first came here, the service was the fastest we've ever seen, so now we're just disappointed and confused.
Not good.  Supreme wash.  Asked for new car air freshener and got none.  They asked what we got after calling us over and said they couldnt find our ticket.  It was in the cup holder. Not enough people drying cars for how busy they were.  Took about 30 min.
Das Hotel ist alt aber deswegen bekommt es keine schlechte Bewertung sondern weil es schmutzig und komplett abgelebt ist! Morgens um 6 geht der Baulärm los (wird laut Mitarbeiter renoviert) .. die klima haut einem nachts aus demBett weil wohl alle möglichen Lager ausgeschlagen sind..  und wenn der Fernseher mal nicht geht, kein Problem die Wände sind so dünn das man imNebenzimmer alles hört.. das ist wohl die beste show was das zum Partyhotel heruntergekommene Hotel zu bieten hat.. lieber Vdara oder sogar das Circus Circus buchen.
sad to see and say it, but the majority of the previous reviews have pretty much said it all. we use to love stopping by on our bikes and sipping some cocktails or having some light eats at the old location. but sadly, no mas....for starters, it's right across the street from that dreadful other hangout, with their techno and club music blasting. we ordered a couple of margaritas. mine, the house margarita, was 9 bucks. my wife ordered "their most popular margarita"....it cost 11 bucks! the price of those margaritas alone is enough to get us great food at other locations in the area!we ordered 3 tacos and thought 3 bucks was high, and were expecting these fish and octopus filled, large tacos. instead, we got these teeny, tiny tacos with about 2 slivers of fish/octopus...which could be eaten in 1 bite....for 3 bucks!!! what a joke! and to make it even worse, the fish and the octopus were way too chewy.i have to say, our service was good and it wasn't crazy busy at noon on a sunday, but we both agreed, we can get much better/larger portions of food for the money at numerous other old town locations.
This place needs help... no fans for ventilation, horrid bench placement... people dont pay attention in the dumbbell area... Everyone on their cell phones.. this place reminds me of a middle school gym... recommend Anytime Fitness... cleaner, nicer, cheaper and better trainers.
Have been so disappointed in them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me 3 times I'm never going again. First time (about a month ago) I ordered 3 chicken veggie bowls. When I got home, none of them had veggies. I called and said come back so I did. When I got my second order, I checked to make sure they had veggies. The first 2 did so I figured all of them did. When I got home, the 3rd didn't have veggies. I called them back and they said to come back. At this point, I was hungry and tired of driving so they said they would give me a bowl for free the next time. I called the other day to redeem and to order 5 bowls for my family and they said they could only give me the veggies and a side of rice as a replacement for the bowl. Huh?!? When I got home, the chicken and veggie bowl was more like chicken and cabbage bowl. About 98% of the "veggies" were cabbage with little to no broccoli or carrots. The meat was as close to jerky as can be. It was so close to being inedible. Will never go here again.
Located a few venues west of Jilly's, dim lighting, the decor was interesting, & the bar had lots of character.Me & Yvonne T. went here for the Winterlicious menu.For appetizers: "Pâté Brûlée" & "Mini Haute Poutine".  The Pâté  was excellent in flavour & texture, however, not enough crostinis were provided as there were lots of the chicken liver left after the the last crostini was eaten.The Poutine, fries were prepared in duck lard so I was expecting crisp robust fries, the duck toppings were not as flavorful as I remembered a duck confit to be. The dish portions were lacking, duck was not the best & the fries were soggy.25 minutes passed after we finished our appetizers before our mains came to the table.For mains:"Lamb Shank" & "Mac et Fromage"Lamb Shank was tender, however it came out cold & there was no juice or sauce which could have easily made the dish significantly better.  The scalloped taters were soft & had no flavor. The dish could have very easily been better.Mac et Fromage was good, nice flavor & the cheese's texture was enjoyable. I would not have minded if there was a little more of it to go around.For dessert: "Eton Mess" & "Triple Layer Brownie Cake"The brownie in the brownie cake was not really brownie at all, more like supermarket cake. The Eton mess was interesting, like a lump of macaron at the bottom of some whipped cream like substance.At the end of it all the bill came but also included gratuity, 18% gratuity, most uncharacteristic of western restaurants. I do not think I will revisit.
We were invited to come here for a time share pitch. Went to first room and it had a dreadful smell. We asked for a new room and staff was very nice and said they would get a new room in a few hours and to check our bags.  Waited 20 minutes with no line just to check the bags.Came back a few hours later room was ready and called to get my luggage and no one picked up at bell desk for 25 minutes just rang and rang. Had to call the manager.That night needed some foam pillows and had to call four times and it didnt come  for 1.5 hours.The hotel itself was fine but the service was worst I have ever had at any hotel anywhere in the world. Why anyone would buy a timeshare here is baffling
This is the worst Buffalo Wild Wings ever! The service is fine but the food taste gross! If you want AWESOME wings there are plenty of other options out there. Wish I could support this place but honestly, how do you make garlic parm wings taste horrible ?!
This is one of our favorite places but last night was a complete disappointment. The beer and Jalapeño Infused Margarita were the highlights. Our Queso Dip was just warm but I decided to ignore that. We ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, maybe my expectations were too high, but no sizzling plate. There was no flavor at all to the dish. I rechecked the menu and it did say SEASONED SHRIMP.  My seven shrimp were as white as could be with no sight of seasoning anywhere. My wife couldn't eat it so she ordered the Chicken Burrito. Our daughter had ordered this before and enjoyed it so it seemed like a safe bet. WRONG! Another Luke warm flavorless dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was won by the RICE!  Out of 10......Chicken 2...Rice 8!! I told our waiter Luka who said he would tell the kitchen but I never heard anything more.  I'm sure we will be back, after a while, but it'll just be Tacos!
It's weird when you go into somewhere and it has the most bizzare smell. I can't even explain what the smell is other then "bad". I'm not overly impressed with prices here or the service either (prepare to be pushed for a "target card" upon checkout). I'd easily go to Walmart over this place.... department stores becoming a dieing breed, we didn't need another one in the mall for sure. Blah.
We used Foodie Call for food delivery a couple of times while in Charlotte and the experience definitely could have been better. For one of the deliveries, items were missing and sauce had leaked all over the inside of a bag. The delivery person was unable to address the issues without a ton of hassle. She did leave to go get the forgotten item, but addressing the damaged item was out of her hands without placing a phone call to Foodie Call. The whole reason we used Foodie Call was for convenience. Having to place a lengthy customer service phone call while managing a 2 year old and newborn is not convenient so we let it go, but we were not happy. With the other delivery, we placed an order around 6 PM and it did not arrive until after 9 PM. After calling Foodie Call to ask them for a status of the order, they were very vague and could not give us a delivery window. We love the idea of this service, and we were happy to get food, but they need to step up their customer service game. Give your employees power to address issues on the spot. Have employees compare the receipt to the items purchased at the restaurant, and have them look at the items for any damage, leaking, etc.
The security line went fast, concert was great but the parking is horrible leaving the event there is no directing traffic out of the parking lot we waited an hour just to get out of the east parking lot not even to just get to the road. Get your parking shit together this is fucking ridiculous.
Ugh their food is so mediocre and overpriced, but what's a guy to do when he needs a quick lunch? I can't imagine anyone truly enjoys the food here. It's just that the prime location to so many offices makes it convenient. It's easy to drop $20 on a basic lunch with drink and tip.
We loved HH's in Anthem years ago so we were excited to have it again when we came back to AZ. No, never, not again. I don't know if the recipe changed or is different per location, but this is not anything anyone would ever crave, want, look forward to eating. This is a notch above Little Caesar's. Overpriced considering the taste.
I loved the Go Deluxe room and if it wasn't for it being super cute and cheap I'd knock this sucker down to one star cause the Room Service is god awful.3:00PM: Arrive and call for extra towels, blankets, toilet paper, pillows and cups.5:00PM: Call again for the same items7:00PM: Call again and I'm flipping pissed this time because I said it's been 4 hours since I've gotten my items. They told me that it'll be right up within the hour.8:00PM: STILL NOT THERE. So I got my ass down to Guest Services so I could speak with whoever was in charge of Hotel/Room service but they said that they don't even have that! WTF? WHO THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO COMPLAIN TO THEN? So I had them call those fuckers again and they were like "Oh apparently you only called once?" So I flipped out on them too. I even told them the times I called and how I was patient with them, allotting them at least 2 hours to get the shit up to the room. Anyways the guy said I could write a letter to them and they'll see what they can do.8:45PM: We got our stuff but the bastards forgot the blankets. I've been to TONS of hotels and I've never had the shittiest hotel service ever.SO STUPID! Even Hooters was better with their service but their rooms were gross hahaha.
Service was the worst. I was checked on maybe once the whole time I was there. I had to get the bartenders attention in order to get a drink and no one Bothered to check back. I'm generally a very liberal tipper but I found it hard to find a reason to leave the small tip I ended up leaving.
Went to this place three times with different groups when it first opened, and never went back. The service was extremely slow, the orders were wrong, the prices were high, the portions were small.  Looking at recent reviews, things may have changed. Will give it another try.
Decided to give this place a try. Party of 3, one ordered the Shanghai Lumpia, barbeque pork skewers and I ordered the pancit malabon.  Order took awhile, my companions were almost done with their meal. My order of pancit malabon arrives, I give it a taste and smell and it tasted and smelled a bit funny. Took 2 more bites and decided that I wasn't going to eat it.  I informed the waitstaff that it smelled and tasted spoiled.  They offered to replace it with a to -go ordered. Went against it. Didn't want to take my chances of getting sick.
Yes... I experienced much better. lets start with the entrance... so i walk in, and there is this guy at the entrance asking me if i am on the guest list... 'come on buddy' i have been through this show before.. why does he even bother asking me... nope. i am not on the guest list... and guess what... in 2 seconds he will welcome me in... so why even bother with making this 'show'. [I am sorry, I just cant get it... guest lists, and stuff, who do they think they are, open the gate, let me go in... now! :)]anyway, 2 seconds and i am, I am going downstairs for an expensive coast check.. at least the lady there behind the counter was extremely nice.. on her Tip jar she she says she want to go to Paris... so i left enough tip to help her... and i also got a big big smile...from there ... it is just going downwards...  the service is bad... not all the barwomen know how to make the rights drinks and how to shake them...  nothing was real... most of the things there were fake. this place has a huge potential... but they just dont leverage it...i will surely visit again and will keep you updated
Green Valley Ranch Resort is outstanding!  However, the spa leaves you ultimately disappointed in the entire place if ever you go there.  Had 3 massages w/my 2 best friends for our local girlfriend get away.  Room was nice, restaurants and gaming area great!  However, the spa was HORRIBLE!  The front desk girl acted like we were a burden to be waited on even when we went to pay our huge bill.  All of us make good money and are professional ladies.  We don't drink at a spa or act up-we are the guests of an establishment and we treat it as we would want a guest in our own homes.  So there was no reason for the treatment we got.  The rest of the staff was ok.  Not rude but the massages and treatments were that of a training school level-yet some of the MOST expensive we have ever paid for!  And they made the 20% tip mandatory for our party of THREE!  Which was not acceptable because the treatments were all very poor and the tip would have reflected it.  Did write a letter to the spa mgr of our treatment and poor quality massages and part of our bill was refunded, but this is not what we wanted.  We really wanted to amazing experience that GVR spa should have been able to of delivered as a true reflection of the prices they charge and the level of the rest of the property.  Will not be back.
Belles tables sur le lac avec vue magnifiques. Service très très lent. Je n'ai pas aimé mon repas, les plats choisis avaient l'air de plats pré-préparés et réchauffés lors du service. Décevant. Peut être que je n'ai pas été chanceuse. J'ai pris de la pieuvre en entrée et pétoncles au repas principale. Nous avons demandé un bon accord vin plats mais ça aussi c'était raté.
I came to Sushi 999 with high expectations, based on the reviews here (hoping that the one negative review was due to that person arriving before the restaurant was in "prime time", as that reviewer generously noted).  However, I did come at prime time (a little after 6pm on a Wed night) and was disappointed. The tempura was really greasy, not crispy. The sushi rolls had lots and lots of mayo on them, and tasted more like mayo than anything else. The ice roll was probably the highlight from the night, as it used a mango sauce instead of straight-up mayo, and the rice paper wrapping was unusual and good.  I also tried to order the green dragon (though they brought me the red dragon, and it wasn't worth attempting to fix the confusion), the spider roll (which was fine, but a little greasy), and the tamago (which tasted like it had been made earlier in the week; spongy and flavorless).  My friends did have good things to say about the sweet potato roll, but were not particularly impressed by any of the other things they ordered (vegetarian dumpling; spring roll; salmon donburi; sweet tofu sushi; veggie tempura; a noodle dish; chicken teriyaki; beef-wrapped asparagus).  We ordered mango ice cream for dessert, and while it was orange, it didn't taste of mango at all and was really icy in consistency.One funny thing about this restaurant is it's hard to predict the size of the items you order: for example, the beef-wrapped asparagus and the spring roll come as one tiny piece each (comically tiny, it was impressive!), but if you order the vegetarian tempura you get a whole basket full (and the same is true of the noodle dishes or donburi). When we left, we felt like we'd just eaten a lot of grease---not what I look for when I go out for sushi and drop $25.  For all-you-can-eat, Crescent Sushi is more impressive.
The only thing I usually get from McDonald's is the chicken nuggets . I decided to treat myself today to some nuggets. After ordering I asked for barbecue sauce, and this location didn't have any!! What kind of McDonalds doesn't have the SAUSE OF GODS!!! I'm pretty disappointed .. I guess there's a first time for everything.. staff was friendly still service somewhat slow.... get your act together Ronald McDonald !
Fun and good value happy hour. But there are just too many places within a half mile that are doing the same thing and doing it better. Makes me think of the divey old pookies... A place where you don't go for food, but good company and tasty beverages.  ...and a drag show (if that's your thing).## the scrambled egg special with jalapeños and peppers was dead and overlooked. DEAD. Think: chafing dish, serving spoon and steam table. Ugh. Small details missing, reflected everywhere including the kitchen. Stop trying so hard, just get good at a few things and let the booze do the rest. # water glass chipped# bits of dried food on the silverware# gents' door sticky enough that somebody might think it's occupied# seating upholstery is worn, cracked and tattered# wall to wall kitsch not dusted recently# staff congregates at the host stand chatting and leaningI'm not supposed to care because you don't.  But I do. It means you don't care about my food. And it shows. ## open face tamale is not a tamale, it's a hot mess. Stop calling that mushy pile of barely-cooked masa a tamale. # queso sauce is a wet mess (I'm always wary when the menu has to change languages from English to convey the description). Glad I asked for it to be left off. # nothing made to order. It's just a lazy kitchen with squirt bottles and chafing dishes doing nothing well. MEH!!What a shame. Maybe if they add a drag show I'd be back sooner than later. So far it'll be later.
Poor service, fair food and airport ambience. Houstons was recommended by the ticketing agent. The place was packed when we arrived, necessitating a 5- to 10-minute wait to be seated (luckily, we were not in a hurry). After a semi-reasonable wait our server arrived, but the drinks didn't come in a reasonable time. Our appetizer was calamari, the best part of our dining exerience and the chardonnay from California was nice and buttery. Our entrees arrived 2 minutes into our appetizer; the server mumbled that it was the kitchen's fault, served it anyway, and apologized repeatedly. We thought our food could be worse. My ribs tasted like it was water infused and the fries had good taste, the "seasonal side" never arrived. The salmon was slightly over-cooked and rice was "ehhh." Broccoli and green beans were al dente--good!Due to the full house (we suppose), our service was lacking. Our water was never refilled, the waiter never checked in,  and it took forever to pay our bill.My advice--consider a different place to eat if there's a line (we were there at 3pm on  Monday). If you eat here, ask for your check when the meal arrives.
I have to say I'm disappointed. I love a good burger and the fact that one of the most hyped burger joint in the country was opening up right down the street was huge. I didn't go right away when it opened, but finally after a few months I was able to go. After waiting 40 minutes in line on a Wednesday at 2:00pm, I was able to order. The prices definitely surprised me for what I thought was a fast food style burger spot. I got a double burger, fries and chocolate shake and ran me $18! The quality does NOT live up to that price. It's very similar quality to 5 guys and the shake was nothing special. It costs extra just to get whipped cream. So all in all very disappointed. If you want an overpriced burger that really is nothing special, and want to wait quite a while to get it, then this is your spot. For me I'll just go to one of the other much better burger spots at that price around Charlotte.
Waited to be seated despite having a reservation and then waited 15 minutes to meet our waiter. 65 minutes after our reservation time was when we got steaks. Steaks were not trimmed properly (1/2" ring of fat around mine), were underseasoned, and weren't charred in the way I'd expect for something in the $50 range. The second star is because it's entirely possible that my experience was just bad luck based on the other reviews.
The food was okay, although lower in temperature than it should've been. The problem was the service. I ordered a veggie burrito and the employee didnt even put veggies on it until I asked, twice. (Yes they are supposed to come with it.) There was one girl on the line and she made our two meals along with the three people's orders behind us, so my food stood there for a very long time before she came back to it. I had paid and was looking at my completed meal (it was to go so all someone needed to do was cover it up) for quite some time as she put beans on other people's food. The workers were slow and they were maybe understaffed. I would not go back.
What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are."Also:"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it."And:"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?"Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Which is why you see two stars here.In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.
Subways is Subways, and they generally all taste the same consistently and have pretty decent quality ingredients. The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. Not sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. He also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.
I've ordered late night delivery for pizza, pasta ans wings as an experiment. Everything sucked. I will never order from them again.
Never thought we need to pay to print boarding passes here been in most of the hotel elsewhere where the printing service is free.  hotel room looks ok. Newly renovated but the bathroom needs a major upgrade. price is very resonable for what your going to get so dont expect to much. I would recomend the hotel if your traveling in a budget. And not looking for much. Front desk staff looks very serious and are not very welcoming. Except for brian who checks us in Very sencere and polite. Over all my experience with the hotel was ok.
BBQ Chicken Salad was possibly the blandest dish I've ever had despite being drenched in what would appear to be watery mayonnaise. Not inclined to go back, but I imagine I will at some point since my friends seem to like this place.
Went to a show last night and a few things were disappointing. The lines in the venue to get drinks were 15-20 minutes long waiting in line! Not enough barservers or locations to purchase. The vocals were somewhat muffled and could not understand any lyrics. Showed up for the show at 6:15 p ,had to wait thru two opening acts, long changeovers between bands and headliner did not start until 9:30 pm. Sold out show , so crowded and poor air conditioning.
Place was empty on Friday afternoon at 2pm. I had the Burrito with carnitas. Lots of pork, but it was dry. Chipotle burritos are better. Wife had pink tacos and they were good, but she had to vut them up, impossible to pick  up with all the stuff in it. Service was mediocre. I downed my soda pretty quickly and was never offered a refill until we were leaving...my fault for being a camel, but we were sitting outside in the desert.
Not a basic burger joint.  This middle eastern establishment is more a sandwich shop.  Some unique sandwich items such as lamb tongue.  I got a burger, which was made fresh, but not sure on the cut of beef, had a gamey taste to it, maybe I got tongue.Not cheap either.  $8.50 for just the burger.  Another $3 if you want fries, which I did not partake.
I have wrestled with writing this....We went in for Valentines day. The reviews were off the chart and my son and his wife had eaten here previously and liked it.  We were stoked coming in.  Our server (Brian) had been highly recommended in other reviews...we were first in line so we could be in his section.  Unfortunately, he ended up being the only bright spot in our dinner and the reason that I gave 2 stars vs. 1 for the food.  Food-wise, we were extremely disappointed on every single item served.  I ordered the bone in rib eye. When it came out it looked fantastic...I ordered it medium.  it came out medium rare.  The taste was bland and was tough....really for prime beef? I also ordered the lobster tail....it was by far the worst one that I have ever had.  It was cold, very tough and had a very odd sauce on it. It is my belief that  due to being fully booked for VD that they precooked it and warmed it when ordered. I saw another review that mentioned the same deal and when they replaced it....it was the same.  My wife had the crispy chicken.  It was tough and had an odd sweet sauce on it.  The mashed potatoes again tasted precooked previously and re-warmed....watery if you know what I mean. She really did not eat it...just picked at it.  For desert, I had the coffee crème brulee which I love and have really never had a bad one....except for now....it really was not good.  Having read other reviews like this...I dismissed them as outliers.....It is distressing to have to write this after my high expectations, but it was a $150 learning. I am going to stick with Anthony's at the M Resort.
First time I went it was really great. Second time was awful. Second time I got a full set with gel and art. First as she is applying the tips I notice one of them is very crooked, I point it out she tells me don't worry I can fix it. So I point it out again when she applied the acrylic and she acts surprised and then has to file like hell and makes it so uneven. It was bad. Then she applied so many coats of gel my nails were a thick hot mess. When I complained about two of them looking awful she got mad. 4 hours including a pedi. And my nails were a wreck.Two days after I had them done 3 nails came clean off while I was at work. How does a brand new set just fall off?I called and asked for a refund, was told no problem. They called me the next day to do the refund to my card that was 3 days ago and still no refund.They lost my business. Also just an FYI:Any place that charges extra for the manicure part of a gel manicure should be suspect.
I made on line reservation at the Flamingo.  Remembering the last time I walked through the casino (10 years ago) and their online pic's of the rooms it looked OK so locked it in for 3 night mid week business trip.  The rates were fantastic, I paid $29 a night (when I checked a week earlier the rates were in the $50's).  The rooms were OLD.  Carpet stained and worn, they had an old beat up chair at the computer desk, the windows were dirty, the elevators were scared with graffiti that was removed, the elevator coming up from the valet had tiles broken and exposed plywood. For the money, a good deal. For Las Vegas strip, outdated and tired.  Wouldn't had been so bad if they maintained the place better.
Mohammed, our food runner was great! Very attentive and friendly. I was also very grateful for the fact that there were vegan options on the menu. Unfortunately, the rest of our experience was quite underwhelming. Our server was double sat by the hostess, so he took about 20 minutes to take our order and we probably waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks (which were delivered by a shaky, unapologetic manager). The only reason I know the server was double sat is because that's the first thing he told us when he came to take our order; he was visibly upset and made us all feel very unwelcome. The experience only got better when Mohammed delivered our food; that was literally the only time we felt welcome and accommodated. My friends were visiting from out of town and I was so excited to bring them here for brunch; instead I left disappointed and embarrassed for having brought them to such an overrated & lackluster establishment. Living in this city, we are spoiled with so many dining options and you expect to get the best of the best at Wynn or Encore but I've honestly had better service at Applebee's!
I haven't been to this location in 5 years...now I remember why.  There is one person behind the counter and 7 people in line.  Is this a joke?Never again.
Was really looking forward to it. Had dinner there last night. The food was okay but the a/c must have been broken because it was brutally hot there, resulting in us leaving after the first round of apps.  I have eaten at Cure twice and now Morcilla and two of the three times it was uncomfortably hot.  I don't know if I just hit it wrong or they are just not appreciating that the experience is as much about the comfort as it is the food. Don't think we'll be back.
Calling this a "day spa" is highly misleading.  It's more of a nice nail salon that has a room where they can do a massage.  I saw nothing "day spa" about it - particularly when I sat in the waiting area, looked up at the flourescent lenses in the ceiling and saw it loaded with a bunch of insect bodies and remains.  And I don't mean two or three - I mean like 20-40!  The other flourescent fixtures had only two or three.And at that, the "massage room" was ill equipped.  Twice during my massage the attendant had to say excuse me and exit the room (once for the hot stones, and the next for warm towels) - letting in the harsh flourescent lighting glare and completely breaking the relaxing atmosphere and ambience that once should be able to expect and enjoy during a massage.   I had a manicure here once a couple years ago, and was very unimpressed and annoyed by how much the manicurist kept trying to sell me on a more expensive service.  No means no!!So if you're looking for a day at the spa - this is NOT the place to go.  If you just want to go in and get a utilitarian massage, then go for it.
I've been searching for a Korean restaurant that served meat jun. I came across this location after seeing meat jun on yelp in their photos. When I got there I was told that their menu has changed a lot. I was really bummed but we decided to give it a try. Their food wasn't bad just not good enough for me to come back. I was also excited to eat the corn cheese but honestly it tasted spoiled. And it's pretty pricey.I loved the service there though! Edwin was our server and he was extremely friendly with great service. The owner/cook was also super nice and has great service too!
Food was good, but the service ruined it for me. I dont know if the young woman who helped me at the drive through was having a bad day, but she was rude and basically threw my food at me. I do not feel like going there again anytime soon.
If you want a nice atmosphere, decent food, and to spend a lot of money but still leave hungry, this is the place for you. My husband and I had the shrimp appetizer. There were three shrimp on the plate, so I let my husband have two of them. We ordered our meals. He got the veal something or other and said it was ok. I got a half portion of the ravioli. When my plate came, I was disappointed to see THREE small sand dollar sized raviolis. THREE. For $13! Even if I had known the half portion was that small, I couldn't have brought myself to get 6 of them for $25. Nurp. My husband did order two drinks that were fine. But for $84 dollars, I would have appreciated leaving without feeling like all I did was take a deep breath for dinner. My stomach was growling just as much as when I walked in. All that to say, our server was awesome.
Service was great. Food tasted great. Now the bad... the happy hour margarita tasted like sour sugar syrup. I mentioned this to the server and asked for a re-pour and the bartender made it the exact same way. I eventually diluted it in about 30oz of water and it tasted like a cheap margarita... a massive improvement, but this should not be necessary, and is far stretch from how you make a margarita. Also, my girlfriend and I both had serious stomach pain the rest of the night. Don't know the culprit there, but it was something. I have great experiences with other locations, but I can't in good conscience advocate this place
i work in the plaza in which this chipotle is located.  so i have more insight than others on the day-to-day operation of this place.as someone who frequents this place at least once a week, i can honestly say this is one of the worst places i have ever eaten from.  rarely do the workers know who is doing what.  at least one person on the line has an attitude that really shouldn't show (im in customer service too and it puts a bad tase in the patron's mouth).  they consistently get orders wrong and bag the wrong things at the register.  food is never prepared on time and they run out very quickly.  the place was even closed for a few hours one day because they ran out!  unbelievable.  the supervision monitors how much meat is given to customers constantly as well.sometimes i hold fault w the customers for having outlandish requests that hold the lines up...to that id suggest calling your orders in or having a separate line for those types of orders.  but that notwithstanding, the service is really bad.  legacy village or coventry are way better options if you're willing to drive 5-10 minutes in each opposite direction.
We came here with a group as part of our cultural experience in Montreal, hoping it would be representative of the city's historically vibrant Jewish community. Instead, it was a series of cliches stitched together with mediocre food and lackluster service. When we arrived, our table was not quite ready, so we waited in the dimly-lit vestibule filled with artifacts from years past. The old menus and photographs were charming and helped explain some of the restaurant's success: clearly they are coasting on a longtime reputation for quality, although they are not upholding it today.Upon being seated, we were presented with bread and pickles, both huge dill pickles and a mayonnaise-free cole slaw. I know this is their trademark and they won't ever change it, but I don't think a giant pickle is an appropriate amuse-bouche for a steak dinner, and the coleslaw was much too sweet to be enjoyable (the caraway seeds were a nice touch, though.) The waiter answered our questions with as few words and as much condescension as possible: when we asked what made the Special Chicken "Special" he rattled off a list of ingredients, and when my husband asked for a wine list he brought him an iPad with the reserve list (hundreds or thousands of dollars per bottle) instead of pointing out that the normal-priced selections were on a different page of the menu. He opted for a cocktail instead.Our appetizers came: the salmon tartare was very small, the cesar salad overdressed and the house salad uneventful. A long wait for our main courses. The Special Chicken was decent, but overly sweet (a pinch of sugar in the dry rub is nice, but this was practically caramelized!) The steaks were decent as well, though one was underdone and when my friend sent it back it arrived overdone. The best steak restaurants I have visited will confirm your preference so that you know what to expect (medium will have a warm pink center, etc.) but as I mentioned, our waiter couldn't be bothered. Sides are not included, but my husband and I shared a monte carlo potato for $5, which passable but not wonderful. We skipped dessert, and as we were waiting for our check, we heard two separate disagreements over bills at neighboring tables (not shouting matches, but loud enough to be heard.) It didn't bode well, but thankfully everything was in order.Moishe's idea of an after-9 menu with lower prices is an excellent one, but I imagine their goal is to whet our tastebuds for the finery we can expect at other hours. Instead, it cut every possible corner, from portions to service. We had a great time at dinner because we're all good friends and took the missteps in stride, but I didn't experience anything that would make me want to return even for a bargain meal, let alone a full-priced one. Good food is easy to find in Montreal at any price point, but not here!
This was my second time at Prime and I was really looking forward to the same wonderful experience I had the first time a few years back. To start with, this was a Monday night at about 9:00pm. My wife and I took our 2 friends there after bragging about our last experience. We did not have reservations but we were easily seated, unfortunately in the very back part of the restaurant as far away from the fountain as can be. The evening began pleasantly enough with our drink order from the bar. My wife ordered a very dirty martini and absolutely loved it. Our friend ordered a Lemon Drop and unfortunately it tasted more like syrup than anything else. She refused to send it back and made the best of it. After placing our complete order we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some bread (like we noticed the other tables were having almost immediately after being seated, not us) and the response was a bit stiff with "I'll be there as soon as I can." We were eventually served some delicious sourdough bread and pretzel bread. The bread was delicious and we made quick work of it. As it was taking a while for our food to be prepared (no complaint here as good food should take some time) we asked the waiters assistant if we could have some more of the pretzel bread. His response this time was "we are out of pretzel bread because it is so late, that is also why you didn't get any raisin bread." Let me state that 9:00pm in Las Vegas is not late. I am also not sure what the point was to tell us what we didn't get. My wife then asked for more sourdough and his response was "Are you sure? You have a lot of food coming." After making it clear that we would still like to have the bread it was brought out without any further comment. We took it with a grain of salt and let it go.The rest of the entrees were eventually brought out and the food was fabulous. Paying a premium at a nice restaurant is a treat for most people, like us. We absolutely do not mind doing it but when the experience falls short, then it makes it so not worth it. As much as I enjoy the food at Prime, I feel that this may have been my last visit there. I will happily try one of the many other Steakhouses with excellent Yelp reviews the next time I am in Vegas.
If you LOVE Lou Malnatis like I do, you will be very disappointed by this pizza. We ordered a medium cheese deep dish just because this location is close to the house wanted to try it out. The pizza sauce tastes like the sauce out of a jar, super disappointed by this pizza! Wish they changed the sauce then could be a lot better! Won't be coming back, worth the drive to go to Lou's!
So we were there as part of a large party. We arrived earlier than most of the party and bellied up to the bar whipe waiting for the table to be ready. Bartender was fantastic!! I got a couple samples and decided on their TentCity IPA. Table got ready and we went into this back room and that's where the evening turned to bad. The room we were in still looked to be under construction a bit. The chair around this table were in bad shape like the screws were loose on them I do not mean 1 or 2 chairs either very wobbly as well. So we had to chase some one down to replace a few chairs.  We finally got to meet our waiter who showed up to work in basketball shorts and a tee shirt seriously basketball ball shorts really.. So he gets our food order and our next round of beers and we wait and wait, finally you guessed it SOME of our food came out agian large party of course not all the food can come out at once  but dam half the people were done eating before some us got our food while still waiting on our beers WTF is going on 48.. It should state 48 minutes in between food and drink!!! So now the food and beer finally shows up now we are eating while people are finished completely ridiculous.. So as we all finish 2 people in my party order another beer and wait after 10 minutes the come back and give them 2 different beers and say they ran out of the kind of beer ordered so they picked the closest beer to what they ordered agian WTF why would you choose someone else's drink. I mean you have basketball shorts on run back to the table and ask if there is something else you may like or maybe bring a sample but don't pour a pint and guess what I want.... Food was barely above dive bar food. Not sure what's going on at 48 but there is alot of room for improvements... I have read alot of the reviews and see the owners/management reads and responds to Yelp community so it's up in the air whether they will do anything but we can warn other Yelpers.. My beer was good, wife's beer was good.  I will give another shot if I am out that way only for the beer if you belly up to the bar.. Seems that only the bartender's gave any care. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars because the bartender's were great but I only dealt with them for 5 minutes or so.
I came here for my friends birthday. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice too. However, the beers just f*cking sucked. Three of my friends and I got flights and we did not like any of the beers we collectively tried. "Very average at best", says my bf... at one point a friend asked us "which beer do you recommend?" My bf replied "I'm not comfortable recommending any of them." Later in the evening someone asked the birthday boy, "Which one in your flight did you like most?", he replied -- "No."
The morning muffin was a sourdough muffin with a baked egg. Not bad, but the first one we had had a fly in it.The almond croissant was delicious - flaky and the filling was flavorful and didn't have any of that artificial marzipan taste.The bakery had no air conditioning when we visited though. It was sooooo hot! I was sweating while waiting on line for only a few minutes.The service was pretty bad too. They were not friendly and had nasty attitudes.I would go back to grab the almond croissant though.
Esthetically the outside of the building and the pool area are both very pleasing to the eye, but don't be easily impressed if you are looking for a good nights sleep. The beds are old, noisy and uncomfortable, and the roll out beds belong in the trash. I had springs digging into my back, tossing and turning all night, only to wake up to a sore back. And when shared with the staff they could care less, their solution was just to add more blankets and pillows. Very disappointing! And a crappy vacation because of it. : (
Still haven't found that go to mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Don't quite understand the good reviews. Pre shredded cheese with powder coat is nasty. Fajitas with more peppers and onions than meat. And waiters with personalities of an unsalted cracker just don't cut it for me. What I would do for a Javier's of Orange County CA in Charlotte.Only thing this place has going for it is the darling decor. That is not enough to ever bring us back.
I've been here 5 times and don't think I want to come back again.There are so many good thali places in GTA, I am surprised why this place is popular.Food: 3/5 too oily, nothing special, ordinary and sadly tastes like it's been out for days and days.Service: 1/5 a lot of shouting from servers and no greetings/manners Ambience and location: 0/5 way too cramped, floors are sticky and dirty, tables are dirty, it sort of kills the appetite. And it's been this way during all of my visits. So I doubt it was a one time thing.Price: 5/5 it's very reasonably priced, but quality is what matters. I would rather pay a couple of dollars more for better food. And in all honesty in the same price range you can get better Thalis in other GTA locations.
My husband and I decided to try this place on a Friday night while I was in town for business.  We could have gone to the scores of other restaurants around this area, but decided to try a this place since we don't have one in the area that we live in.  As I was hungry for ribs it sounded like a good place to go.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was after 6 pm.  We ordered cocktails, which mine was extremely weak.  After finally placing our food order, we waited 40 minutes for it to be served.  The waitress was not very interested in the fact that we hadn't been served yet although all her other tables who were seated after us already had their meals.  We asked to speak to the manager who seemed bored by the fact that his customers were still waiting after the length of time.  He offered us another cocktail, but when we refused didn't offer anything else and was not compensated on our bills.  The food was average, but I think I was so hungry I would have eaten anything at that point.  I don't believe that we will be returning unless it's at another location.
Très déçue. J'ai commandé un breakfast cartet, supposé être composé de baguette, croissantS et fruits frais. Mon assiette est arrivée avec un croissant dur, deux bouts de baguette, une fraise, un quart d'ananas et un quartier d'orange. Mon amie a pris un croissant jambon fromage qui venait avec une salade. Elle a eu les mêmes fruits que moi, une pauvre salade triste et un petit croissant. Résultat on repart en ayant encore faim, et en sachant qu'on ne reviendra pas.
First off, the service is fantastic and our waiter was the perfect amount of attentive. The prices are very reasonable and it's really cool that they include soup or salad with every entree. That being said, I honestly have no idea where these other reviewers have eaten Italian food because that's where Chicago Joe's fails miserably. The pasta is not homemade no matter what you read (and I would know because my wife makes homemade pasta at least once per week). Both my wife and I ordered the Linguine with white clam sauce. It was as if some Campbell's soup was poured on top of bad boxed pasta, and it wasn't even tossed together. Let's put it this way, I hadn't eaten anything all day and that's the only reason I was able to get through it. Yuck!The other couple we were with ordered two different types of pasta dishes. One was like a red sauce with some sort of tiny chopped up scallops and the other was a penne with escargot. Let's just say neither one ate very much. If you're looking for the real deal Italian homemade restaurant look elsewhere. If you don't mind very mediocre food backed by great service and a wonderful attitude, Chicago Joe's is your place.
We had heard some good things about this place....so we were excited.  However, it's sub-par at best.  Service was slow and rude....a rarity in this part of Wisconsin, and the pizza was edible but I don't understand why people think it's that good.  We won't be back.
I had the ribs, which from what I had seen in reviews (blogTO) looked delicious, but they were barely edible. They were so dry I couldn't get any meat off of them. My friend had a sandwich and fries which looked good - I tried the fries and they were quite tasty. Cozy atmosphere though, and pretty good service .
Sad to say... That night that you go out for your cheat meal and it wasn't worth the cheat. I was so looking forward to this date night with the fiancé, celebration and a cheat meal, what can better? But unfortunately the dish I ordered was terrible and cheap tasting.... I could have gone to macaroni grill or out back, but I thought we should splurge and eat some amazing food, food that should have stood out from the rest. But I was sorely disappointed and wish I had choose some where else. The waitress was friendly and the service was fast but I recommend that you stay away from the smoked salmon pasta salad that advertises sun dried tomatoes, smoked salmon, spinach, pesto and bacon. Sounds delicious , but it wasn't! The salmon, pesto and sun dried tomatoes where no where to be found and I could have made it better myself.If only I had read the reviews before I ate there... I had high hopes for this chain in Henderson, because driving across town for the other locations was always a hassle, but if they keep this up, this restaurant will be closed in no time. #canigetmymoneyback #hashhouseagogo #$72
Service can be slow during lunch hour as sometimes there is only one person working. It's a nice looking place that's well designed for that "fun, late night food" feeling but I've unfortunately always left Smoke's disappointed. On their menu the list of toppings and combinations they have sound really good, but no matter how many of them I've tried they've always tasted bland. Case and point, recently got a poutine that had "prime rib beef" but it was all grey coloured, overcooked ground beef. I don't see any reason you would waste prime rib meat by cooking it that way. Their fries are so/so, never quite crispy enough on the outside, or soft enough on the inside, their curds and sauce lack a lot of taste. I also find their to-go boxes make sure all the gravy drowns out the fries at the bottom so they get really soggy, fast. At this point I think I'm done going back to this place and would encourage anyone who loves poutine to try somewhere else.
It's clean, service is okay but the shawrma is nothing special.  It's not bad but within a 10 minute walk, you have Salad House (huge portions) or Falafel House (cheaper).  However, for a quick bite, it'll do the job however I think the purple radish wasn't super fresh as I saw it was getting slightly dark.Verdict: Meh.  Average at best.
I have been to custom built 3 times now the first time was before my yelp days and I boosted all over facebook about it. I let all my friends and family know how awesome of a place it was as well as how awesome the customer service was. I think things have changed since then. Allow me to elaborate, the second time I went to custom built I quickly left the restaurant and choose not to dine there because I was turned off by this one employee today I went back and have found that the employees name is Larry. The time I walked out was because Larry was on the phone in the back and came out front to greet us. When he came out he was holding his cell phone in his hand and asked to wait a second as he finished his call, we didn't see this as a problem so we patiently waited. When Larry returned he had his cell phone in his hand and was hanging it up he placed the phone on a back counter came to the front and asked what type of dough we would like to choose. He quickly grabbed a regular ball of dough and was about to start kneeding it when I stopped him and apologized to him and told him loud and clear that I could not dine at his establishment since I did not see him wash his hands and we walked out. Bummed out by the incident I still did not want to simply stray away because of one employee so I told my wife we would give it some time and try again.Well we did and we re-tried today. Like I said previously today the same employee that I walked out on was there and he was at the door. I take it that he did not remember the incident as he did not even recognize me. I thought that was great so that I could try and get a new experience and try and forget about the previous incident. I have to say the evening staff that first introduced my wife and I to custom built was exceptional they were up beat and seemed excited to just make a pizza. Today it felt like it was Monday and things were just crawling. If it was not for that one awesome employee that was genuinely happy to be at work I would have walked out once again that employee's name is MOE and the first thing that he did when he saw us and asked us the dough we wanted was go to the sink and wash his hands!! I quickly pointed it out to my wife and said look at that exceptional employee that is washing his hand prior to preparing our food. Moe quickly keeded out the dough and placed it on the order line to get prepared. Excited by a happy employee this made me happy and I quickly remembered the first time I went to custom built. I said to the gentlemen that was preparing my pizza the first time I came here the young man that assisted me suggested to try and get creative instead of having the same mundane pizza. He suggested trying multiple sauces and I remember him saying you can split this pizza into 16th's to try and give us a challenge we love challenges. When I mentioned this to the guy that was helping me today he seemed a little put off by the whole thing and even said I don't know why he would suggest trying so many different things. I ordered the pizza in 3rds so that I could try the different sauces 1 pesto 1 alfredo and 1 spicy. The guy seemed very uncertain on how to spread the sauces in thirds so he just made circles that ended up bleeding into each other in the cooking process. I layered and layered my pizza with topping after topping after topping. I always have fun in that part I feel like I'm a kid again when I get to pick and choose. My wife placed he order and I went to pay. When I was paying Larry was at the cash register and I told him that I forgot my belly card but had received the message that all custom built pizzas were 6.95 for the month of April. He said ok and then I showed him my yelp 10% off for checking in for the first time he again shook his head to which I thought was a clear sign for him acknowledging it. I paid the tab and was just handed my change. I thought that was a bit odd so I asked if I could have my receipt. Larry printed a receipt and gave it to me, I say a receipt because I was unsure if it was actually mine I paid with a $100.00 bill and did not nee that on the receipt and I also did not see a discount. I didn't want to be rude and be like YO! WHERE MY DISCOUNT SON!! so I just kept quite and said to myself the food will clearly change my mind and it will be worth every penny.Well I got my pizza and it was totally not what I expected the sauces had all bleed into each other and I could not tell the difference from what was pesto what was spicy and where the alfredo started and ended. Also today I watched as Larry was at the cash register and then went to make a pizza for a guest with out washing his hands AGAIN!!!! SOME ONE NEEDS TO GO OVER SAFE FOOD HANDLING WITH LARRY BEFORE HE GETS SOMEONE SICK!! I don't know if I can try custom built again and I was a fan :(!
First time back to the newly remodeled Plaza Hotel. The valet entrance was less than inviting but inside, things are looking up.Had dinner and cocktails at Oscar's, the new restaurant where Center Stage and the pool used to be. Great atmosphere, friendly staff but they need to work on a few things. Drinks were $8 and dinner ran about $50 but had I made other choices, it could easily have run $60-70 per person.While my food was delicious (awesome double boned pork chop and creamed corn brulee), the long wait from the kitchen was terminally s-l-o-w. My dining partners complained that their food was cold (must have sat around, waiting for my pork chop to cook, because mine was hot).I dined with six, unrelated business associates, and splitting the bill was beyond ridiculous. I would have been fine splitting the ticket six-ways but that wasn't really fair to two who were eating light, probably due to budget restraints. The server could easily have given us separate checks (come on, it's all computerized!) but of course he refused. One of the guys spent 15 minutes figuring who owed what.Add in the poor acoustics due to the glass rotunda and you can bet that I'll never go back. I wish them well but they've got a few areas to improve.
Our group of 3 decided to eat here after a long day of walking in the city. We thought we would try this little joint for some dinner.We ordered a pretzel which was really good. It came out warm and soft and was served with what I assume is homemade Dijon mustard. The schnitzel was also good but not memorable. The outside had the perfect crunch and crisp but I would have preferred it served with a sauce rather than butter. My biggest issue with this restaurant is the service. When my table ordered waters to start (which after the day of walking we had, we could not get enough water) and as our waiter was walking away he made a comment that made me feel awkward for the remainder of my meal. I am not a walking dollar sign and I appreciate not being treated as such. Considering the place was almost completely empty when we sat down, this little hipster gastro pub was lucky to get our business. Though the food was good, this is a place I will not be returning to.
Food is ok much like any chain breakfast restaurant but service was poor.  At first, I thought they were understaffed because our waitress seemed harried, but as time went on, it was clear that our waitress should find a new line of work.  I ordered coffee and my wife ordered a large OJ. The waitress brought two coffees and when my wife said she ordered OJ, she asked what size.  Really? It was only a couple minutes ago.  When she brought our food, she asked if we needed anything else.  Well, my coffee was empty so I had to ask for more coffee and cream.  It took forever to bring the coffee and she didn't bring cream, so I asked a second time.  When I was done with my food, she finally showed up with coffee and I asked a third time for cream.Oh, and the silverware which is wrapped up in a napkin only had a knife for my wife.It doesn't matter how good the food is if the service sucks so we are unlikely to return.
Despite claiming I would not be back after my last review, a friend talked me into having lunch there again.  They have pared down their menu considerably even since last fall (it seems), and they have also pared down their portion size. My friend had a wrap that was clearly made with the smallest tortilla possible (it wasn't even the length of my hand), and my cup of chili was smaller than the average coffee cup.  There is quite a bit of chicken on the lunch menu but only two meat dishes:  the pulled pork sandwich and the "barely naked burger."  (I really miss the steak salad!)  I guess lunch isn't their emphasis anymore.
I guess this is an OK stop if you know what you are going for. But we have experienced only slow service, and mediocre food
Cheap on RICE. That is just the start. You'd be hard pressed to find unfriendly chipotle staff. These people are among the friendliest I have encountered. But, they are cheap on the rice, let alone the meat. How else do you improve same store profitability? I've had better. Recently their guacamole is pretty good.
I was super excited to come here for dinner from all the good things I heard about this place. However, It didn't live up to the reviews and comments I've heard.The people were all very friendly though which is why they got two stars. The decor is nice as well. But the food, left much to be desired.I ordered the starter caesar salad and it was just awful. It tasted less like a caesar salad and more of a citrus orange dressing salad. I seemed to have the end of the lettuce stock only and there was no caesar dressing taste at all. I sent it back because I couldn't even eat around the dressing. For my main I ordered the sunday special. I believe it was the prime rib dinner. It was dry and bland. I was so disappointed because it sounded like quite the dinner on the menu. Maybe I just came on the one off day but it left a bad taste in my mouth.
Store is the same as any other T-MOBILE store but the customer service here sucks.... Don't harass me about asking so many questions. I'm no punk. You won't sucker new into signing my life away on a $700 phone
I ate here two years ago and found it to be one of the best sushi experiences I had ever had.. Not so much anymore. I ordered the white fish carpaccio to start. Not only was it ridiculously salty, but the mixed greens in the middle were so smothered with dressing that I could not eat it all. For my entree, I ordered the chirashi. The pieces of fish included nearly all seemed to be the leftover scraps that they couldn't use. Some were a bit mangled and others just didn't look appetizing. Service was great, but the food lacked so much that it made the overall experience a fairly disappointing end to a long work trip.
Well...I work close by, and on Monday I finally decided to go in for lunch.Half of the menu was missing (and is it so hard to erase the missing items from the board?!).The guy serving us was extremely annoying, and would not shut up for a single second, and despite the fact we stated we are not doing a takeout, the food was still stuffed into a carton boxes, followed by a statement that "there is no other way". Really?!So, for $35 we got a very mediocre fish and chips...I can name at least 20 places that do it better AND cheaper.I suggest you take a big pass on that place. They are closed in Annex, and if they will continue the same way - Queen West location will be gone very soon as well.
Welp. I don't think I have ever been so pumped to try a new restaurant before than I was when I saw Tako opened, and was getting rave review. I've been waiting patiently to get the right time to get everyone together. Finally got around to it last weekend. I gotta say, I was SO underwhelmed. We walked in and were promptly seated per our reservations, but it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come say hi. Long enough that we paroozed the menu and already picked out what we wanted. We ordered drinks; one was a mixed drink which was TOO strong of a drink.Secondly, the tacos were good but not that expensive good. I know a lot of people really enjoyed it, but I just don't think it's my taste.
Didn't live up to the hype. Slow service. Long wait. Nothing we got tasted great. Bathrooms were disgusting. Host was also a waiter so that really slowed things down
1/27 I always Tip the takeout person but, WHY WHY WHY should I, if you are going to keep during a half a.. job. Yes, I believe I was crazy to spend this type of money on takeout, when my own cooking taste better. They did not give me any lemons or any melted butter for my lobster plate and my order of crab legs, as well as no utensils ect... I WANT MY TIP MONEY BACK because you really didn't earned it.
We went here for our wedding anniversary after it being highly recommended... upon sitting down we had rose petals and a special card and the ambiance was warm and inviting-- unfortunately, this was the high point of the evening (and between that and the food-- the only reason why this exp. got 2 stars)... while the food was incredible, the service was not. We had 4 courses in just over an hour... which is fast paced to say the least (we were left with horrible stomach aches at the pace dinner was served). We spent time researching the best place to spend our wedding anniversary because every special occasion is important. Our experience was not what we were hoping for. Our server (lizette) was curt and cold and rushed us through dinner (it seemed as if we were inconveniencing her with our presence). It was relatively slow when we went through, yet -- we were seated right by the kitchen  and could hear their jostling and banter from our table and our experience felt like we were being pushed out of there ... what was meant to be a special celebration turned into a supreme disappointment. To note:: the 70 minutes we spent dining-- not a single manager visited and asked about our food and experience... on a slow evening, the entire experience was a large disappointment. We will not be returning. My advice:: if you are going for food, while good, the experience tarnishes it in a way that it can't recover. I'd spend your money elsewhere on a place that places value in their customers (since this place clearly did not).
The prices went up after new ownership and the quality stayed the same. Also, less daily specials and less items on the menu. Two stars for convenience, otherwise one star.
Food was ok. Not worth the cost. Service was satisfactory. Did not leave with a desire to return. Live music was great!
Oh Kaya.  Your drinks are good, the food looks ok, but the atmosphere just doesn't quite feel right.  We were there for Happy Hour and you could tell something wasn't quite right.  The place felt overstaffed and to a certain point you could cut the tension between the employees with a spoon.I had the Atwater Java Vanilla Porter and it was rather delicious, maybe if anything there was almost too much smoothness.  I then tried the Rum Runner which didn't really have all the flavors listed on the menu.  Their Dark & Stormy was the best drink out of the three.I plan on returning, I want to sit down at a table and try the food.  But for Happy Hour ... I'll check out a different locale.
We came in and ordered two chocolate shakes, two vanilla and a chocolate blended. I was really not impressed. The chocolate just lacked flavor and my blended was barely half full... if that, and I'm talking below the clear bubble cover too. Even though we ate them inside the shake was just a complete liquid mess. My son finished half of his and didn't want any more. We thought this place would deliver a quality product, but honestly Culvers is better and like half the price. If we do come back we definitely won't have the same thing. Maybe thier Italian icees are better? But we are used to NY style icees, which are much creamier, so afraid to try it. Either way this was disappointing...even to my kids.
Although in a questionable location, the inside appeared clean and open. The dining area was darker and I didn't go in that side. I was greeted upon entering by Juan. Both men in the kitchen were friendly. I ordered to go and was brought a warm garlic knot while I waited; it was delicious. I took my meal home, the price was just over $30 for a 10" pizza with about 4 toppings, and 10 chicken wings. The wings were ok, not great, but I don't care for breaded chicken wings - they get soggy. The pizza looked great but had no flavor aside from the anchovies. The crust was as bland as eating a pizza box. The dinner didn't sit well in my stomach. Sadly, as nice as the owner was, I can't recommend the food. The gelato looked good but I didn't try it. Great service- not great food.
My family went there hoping for a good burger place to go to near our home. When we got there, no one was at the door to seat us, we got out own silverware and menus. Finally someone who I guess work there sat us. It was 5:30. We sat for 10 mins without anyone ask what we wanted to drink and then when our waitress finally came over she told us we had 10 mins until happy hour was done and went to get our drinks. Did not see her again for 15 mins by then happy hour was over and we could not get any of the specials. She finally showed up again and we got to order. 30 mins later finally got our food. The food was fine, not a lot of fries with the meal. Our waitress boyfriend came in and she gave most of her attention to him and did not pay attention to her tables. We left there very unimpressed and may go back to try a different waitress because most seem to be very good but ours was horrible.
I go hard at Sephora...usually the Walnut St. location but Ross Park is more convenient.  I go there 2x/month and spend 200-500 each visit (I know thats awful). You'd figure at this point I'd be able to get some friggin' help from the sales GIRLS, but no.The only reason I go back to this location is because of the sales GUY. I don't know his name, but he has a shaved head with a spider tattoo and is AWESOME. Every time I'm there, he remembers me, my skin type, what we've gotten in the past and what I need. He spends times with me...he doesn't hawk over me and bug me. He's SO MUCH more knowledgeable than the other girls there who are just plain RUDE. I went there yesterday and unfortunately my guy wasn't there.  I asked for help, and told the girl I wanted to try a new primer. She pointed at one, and while I was checking it out, I told her that I needed some new eye contour palettes and needed help picking one out. But, she had already walked away. Weird...? I continued looking at palettes my damn self, couldn't pick one out, so I said screw it I'll just get them all. I picked up a basket and threw 3 palettes in. The SECOND these birds saw me pick up 3 palettes they all stopped their little side convo and came hopping on over "can I help you" "would you like me to hold these at the register for you" blah blah blah...oh NOW you all are interested in helping me? When a minute ago you wouldn't even help me pick out a primer? I see you, ladies....I continued, on my own, and took all of my product related questions to you tube. When I was finished about 90 minutes later I took my basket to check out. There was a laminated Sephora slip in my basket...I know exactly what this is...but I didn't put it there. When someone helps you pick out products, they give you their card with their ID and a barcode on it. This helps them "keep track" of who helped us pick out products. NO ONE helped me pick out anything. One of these girls actually slipped their card into my basket wanting credit for my purchases. How disgusting is that!!!!From now on, I'll be calling ahead to see if the gentleman employee is there. Otherwise, no thanks.Sephora, if you read these, you need to make this kid a manager or something (if he isn't already) and do some serious training/revamping. Judging by these reviews, I'm not the only person who thinks these girls are rude and only interested in commission, not actually helping the customer. I am so grossed out that some creep got credit for 300 bucks worth of goods. Transfer it to the guy, he's the only one who deserves it!
I shop here 2-3 times a week. The convenience factor is terrific because there isn't anything else comparable close by.However, it has happened on many many occasions that the fresh fruits and vegetables that I have bought are rotten or just terrible quality. I only realize this when I get home and open the fruit or vegetables. It is just way too inconvenient to take the stuff back - I only bothered to do this once when the salad I had purchased was completely wilted when I opened the plastic container - it took them a solid 15 minutes to find a manager to refund me even though I had the receipt, etc.Just today I purchased some fruit, only to come home, cut open two of them, and they are both totally inedible.  There goes $15.I definitely don't recommend this place for produce. For other stuff that you can even pick up at a convenience store, it's great.
This place has really lost what they once had.   I believe the increase in business in the Noda area has occurred and they can't manage it correctly.   The Mai burrito was pretty good but the rice was cold and the chips were stale.   My suggestion is go else where in Noda,  there are too many better options
Sleepy restaurant near Shadyside. I've been for lunch several times while visiting family in Pittsburgh and it is always filled with retirees around that time. The place is nice and clean with some formal touches (white tablecloths for example). The decor is a bit odd though, with many paintings of partially nude people including a large voluptuous topless woman on the door of the ladies restroom.The food is just okay. I split the swordfish sandwich and crab cake sandwich with my cousin. The swordfish was not good at all, basically a white bun with a small and flavorless piece of fish in between. The crab cake was better (large pan-fried piece of fish with some good garnish). My cousin got fries with his sandwich and they were kind of bland. The beets in my beet salad were flavorful, though I had an up charge for getting that salad instead of greens. In general this place is pricey for the so-so food.The desserts were the best part of my meal last time I went. We got a nice cheese plate, an ice cream sandwich on peanut butter cookies, and a delicious chocolate bread pudding. See photos below. These were again pricey, but at least they were worth it based on taste.
Comfortable bed is the only good thing I can say. They said the rooms were recently renovated but they need to call the show catch a contractor because they didn't finish the job. 2 elevators were out so I could have either walked 4 flights up and down the stairs or wait 10 minutes for the elevator. Cold showers. Water is too hot then too cold. Something was wrong with my heating unit. Every 10 minutes it would start up and make an annoying loud sound for about 15 seconds. I refused to have my room cleaned because I felt the floor maids were unprofessional. As I was waiting for the elevator about 3 of them were cleaning rooms and talking loud about the guest who recently stayed in the room using vulgar language and so on. Coming in from a night at the bar you are hungry. They have no small store or anything to grab a quick snack and the 24hr room service is just sandwiches. The people st the font desk were hit or miss. Some people were friendly and helpful others acted as if you were bothering them. It was about 1 AM and a group of front desk people were standing around and I asked them about room service and they looked at me like I said something crazy. And didn't ask if I needed a menu for anything else or my options in the area. At the end of the day. I would NEVER stay here again.. I would rather stay in a Red Roof inn to be honest with you.
This place was, yes, was great when I first moved to Anthem. As I start to get along with the staffs, I get up-charged for my regular iced coffee. I usually have the 16 oz but recently they charge me with the 24 oz price, plus tax it's gonna be 2 dollars for a 16 oz-cup of iced coffee?! Well, it doesn't seem that much but if you don't have much money then this would be a trouble (I'm saving for my tuition). Gotta say goodbye to my favorite iced coffee then.
Would have liked to use them, but they apparently are too busy to answer the phone. Too bad. Will need to find another non-dealership Toyota service ship.
*****update below Food is delicious. Absolutely have to stop in and try. Service was slow, it took forever to get a refill on water. Maybe because we sat outside. Updated****Today we visited again, they weren't on top of things. Dirty tables sit around us during the entire time we were there. I requested hummus which the waitress brought out long after I ate my pita-bread. Speaking of pita, I had one that was more like a pita chip and one that was still doughy. The Pepsi was flat tasting and we had empty glasses for longer than we should have. The food wasn't the best today either. Lastly, they got my husbands order wrong.  Even after having to come back and ask him a second time what it was he had ordered.  Smh.
Ok, I am a HUGE Bobby Flay fan. I had to go here, so I dragged all my friends along because it was for my 21st bday. We ordered an appetitzer and it was ok. My friend ordered a margarita and it wasn't to our liking.  Service was good, but not great. The food was OK, i already got tired of my dish after the 3rd bite.  It was maybe too sweet? Too many flavors combining and its not concentrating on one flavor. When Bobby cooks on Food Network, your mouth waters, but at Mesa Grill...I didn't.  I tried Emerils before Mesa Grill, and loved Emerils. But to mention we could order off the BRUNCH menu only.  I looked at the pics from the dinner menu, and they look very good. And I had the spicy chicken potato hash....way too sweeet, and too much.
I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it - like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir-fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.
Garlic Parmesan fries sound good unless they are served cold.  Took over 30 mins to get a couple of sandwiches.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because Jeremiah our server really was attentive and tried his best and the manager came right out and addresses these and other concerns.
Not very happy after tonight's visit... Food was undercooked for both of us and we ended up having to pay full price for bottle of wine because apparently if you have a Groupon (which doesn't even cover alcohol) they penalize you for having it. Tonight's dinner ended up costing more than our norm. Really unhappy and we were regulars so I'm not sure that we will return.
Had a late breakfast while waiting for my flight. Chose the traditional breakfast.  Oh geez.  Danny's would have been a better choice.  The bacon tasted like it was five or six hours old and the potatoes were soggy and  very greasy.   Service was okay but certainly not four-star.
Seated right away.  Seats were not cleaned.  I had to brush off food remnants from bench seats.  Ordered calamari which took FOREVER.  Not bad taste, but not great.  Wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Meatballs were not too bad.  But spaghetti sauce was like it was out of a can or Ragu.  Not impressed.  I had linguine with clams.  Pasta not cooked right and the sauce lacked salt.  I had to salt it myself.  Overall:  2 stars.  Mediocre service from staff.  Very slow kitchen.  Mediocre food quality.  Contrary to other positive reviews, I would not recommend this place nor would I come here again.
This place is definitely  not about the environment or the service. Owner did not have a good/positive attitude, who was also the cashier at the time. Tried the beef nahari, chicken haleem, naan, some orange chicken wanna be and chai. Naan, chai, and beef nahari were good, and but rest was crap. Chicken haleem smelled old and really bad and also tasted like it had gone sour. Would not eat there again.
This is my second time here. The first time there were moments of brilliance so I went back for more. The salad was the best ever on the first visit- so fresh and wonderful combination of tastes and textures. Tonight the salad was wilted. The tikka grilled cheese and tomato soup was also a real downer. The soup was first serve and not even warm. They took it back and it came back curdled and bland. The grilled cheese was more like grilled farm bread with a piece of cheese that stayed for a minute. I could go on but why bother. If it is a change of chefs then it doesn't bode well. All I know it will be sometime before I consider going back and spending my hard earned cash
This was a ho-hum menu with nothing outstanding to report. Prime location with below prime expensive food. The wait staff was marginal. We thought we would try this over Harper's. That was a mistake!
I had to use this place while my car was being repaired at a local shop. The one young man was very nice and super helpful, drove me to the repair shop when I repaired the car as well. The reason for the low rating is the actual cars. The first car they tried to put me in was a Camry with the front bumper hanging off. The next two cars were extremely dirty: windshield had so many bugs and dirt you could barely see through, stains on the seats, etc. I would recommend going a few miles out and finding a better rental place or even a different Enterprise in nearby Gilbert or Scottsdale, where the cars are actually clean and nice in those areas.
I love breakfast. I love eggs. This place has probably the lowest quality mass-production factory eggs Ive ever had.  I ordered the "portuguese sausage" plate & it definitely was not portuguese sausage. Very low quality, super greasy & tastes nothing like the real thing.  The couple stars are only because our waitress was very nice & timely, and their potatoes are seasoned & cooked pretty well.
This place was one of my favorite places to go to in China town. My whole family loves this place. However I brought a friend of mine recently for the first time and the meat was not cooked well it was pink. I ordered beef and chicken and they were all shade of pink. The new management is awful! I was not impressed as I used to. I hope they can improve this and return the old cook! Presentation was not the best!
The hot dog is average. The burger is below-average. Sorry, folks, that's the truth.I've held off on reviewing this place for awhile now. Overall I don't consider it fair to review a place after only visiting once, but I cannot bring myself to go again, and Ted's will not exactly hurt from me saying bad things about them. Also, seeing as how the food my friends had looked the same (I think I tried some of theirs but can't remember for sure) and they raved about it, I don't write this off as an anomaly and will go ahead and review Ted's.Like I said, the hot dog was extremely average. Nothing different than you would get off of a typical hot dog vendor.The burger was below average. The patty was too thin and it just wasn't that good.The workers were what I like at a place. They took my order, made my food, and nothing more. Good job. The store has a pretty cool feel to it. The line was short when I went, but apparently it can get quite long.How was the experience overall? Well, I won't go back as I would rather have a hot dog and burger from Sonic or (cue dramatic chipmunk) RALLYS. ...Exactly.
Sushi here is average, no better than what you can get from the cooler at harris teeter. Overpriced drinks are even more over priced and service is sub par
Okay, downgrading my last review.  One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken "Vings" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.  Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips.  Someone else will appreciate it I am sure.  Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won't hurt your profits that bad!!Peace out.  Find your sizzle!!Attorney Steve
I starting coming here back in 2016 , the service was great. Coming now I wait at least 2 hours to get seen. I leave work early of a scheduled appointment and they still never see me on time. The front staff is rude well not all of them are. One day I had a app and she gave everyone else a call that the doctor was not in, but didn't give me the call. I showed up and she had the nervous to roll her eyes. I can't wait to get my braces off. The doctor is great and some of the staff members are great.
Floors were covered in the winter-y salty grime and it didn't seem like anyone was interested in cleaning it up.The lunch specials were small in portion size for typical 'fake' Chinese food (eg. sweet and sour pork, general tsao chicken, etc). The meat had too much batter and there was too much celery and onions acting as fillers on the meat side. The vegetable side of the lunch special had the same celery and onions this time with trace amounts of baby corn and broccoli. Rice was generous.The dumplings were ok. At $4 for 6, I thought they were pricey especially since they didn't taste particularly special.The view from the window is spectacular. The waitress was friendly, but the restaurant was empty when I went in for lunch (?). They play Cantonese and Mandarin music in the background but the waitress doesn't speak Cantonese (?). Free wifi from the pub across the street (FnF). They recommend using debit/cash if the bill is under $15 according to a sticker on the bill sleeve but not sure if any extra charge exists.
Could you pick a more horrible location? Limited parking and extremely dangerous to pull out of the lot onto hwy 74 with cars going 60MPH. Building was small and dirty however the staffs were well dressed and professional. Anyway, I booked my reservation online. On the day of pickup, I arrived 45 minutes early. They had no cars and so we waited for a customer who was schedule to drop off the car. Half an hour went by and one was dropped off. The staff processed the transaction and quoted me an amount higher than I had reserved. He stated it was because I'm early. What the hell? I'll wait the friggin 15 minutes then. They "refreshed" the car for me. It still smelled and was dirty inside. Car ran fine though and we dropped it off a few days later without issues. Hertz, please send some money to this branch so they could fix up the place.
Half the items we tried to order on the menu wasn't available. The conversation essentially went like this: Table (of 9 people): places orderWaitress comes back: Sorry we are out of the sous vide sirloin beef and rib eyeTable: okay we will have ox tongue skewers and lamb skewersWaitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we ran out of lamb skewers and Ox tongueTable: okay we will have the panini Waitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we don't have that either.Table: What do you have??Oddly the sous vide sirloin and rib eye beef ended coming out, which was delicious. However, because of all the ordering and re-ordering, we had ended up ordering additional friend chicken thinking we wouldn't have the beef..so 3 chickens instead of the 2 we originally ordered.The fried chicken wasn't great either, the basket i got had too much batter and i had to use my napkin to soak up some of the gross excess oil - I'd say the Fry or even Kokoya is better. I dont think i'd come back here, maybe only for the sous-vide sirloin or rib eye.
The food here is always good as you watch them cook your food to order.  Better selections as of lately as it seems they've changed their menu a bit since my last visit this past summer.  They reserve seating apparently.  I saw several tables reserved the entire time we were there (1:20) and they were never used.   It posed a challenge for my party of 3 to be able to find a seat.  They need to do that better.  The big issue on this Friday even was the noise level.  It caused my family and I to have to raise our voices quite a bit to talk to each other at the table we did find.  Not a pleasurable experience in the least.
I purchased a $10 groupon that turned out to be broken into 4 uses... Shoulda read the fine print! I went once and they are supper nice and have great bread but when I returned today I found them closed with a sign stating they will only be open Saturday 9 till they run out. I'm not sure if business is just so good they can afford to do this or if they are ready to shut it down? Either way that was the proverbial nail in the coffin for me, just bummed I wasted my money on the groupon. I would have given them four stars easy if not for the let down.
Wow! God forbid any of the folks paid to assist customers here actually ASSIST CUSTOMERS! I could stand back here at the flooring and blinds counter for days and probably not see one associate who wants to help set up an appointment for getting estimates on shutters. The sad part is this is the third time we've had to come to this location and we experienced the same lack of service. Plenty of employees seem to be walking around talking amongst themselves or avoiding eye contact with customers. Pathetic for a Saturday afternoon in Scottsdale.
My most recent visit was the opposite of the amazing first visit.  My meatloaf entree on this visit had incredibly shrunk.   Like shrunk by half size.  The mashed potatoes were tasteless.  The meatloaf was so dry I got choked.  The fried okra was so tough that a human being would find it impossible to bite through.  We asked the waitress if management or cooks had changed.  She said no.  But portions were smaller, less tasty, and prices remained the same.
Looks promising from the outside.  But was largely disappointed by the overall experience.  Beer was good and cold - best thing about the night. Got the nachos since they were on special.  Bland at best - even with the jalapenos. Little flavor. That was followed by probably the worst Caesar salad I've had (wasn't sure if it was just lettuce and cheese without dressing).  And I tried the french onion soup which was at best average.Service was OK (a little slow, but he was nice enough).  Beer was cold.  And good beer selection.  But doubtful I make it back there.  Plenty of other pubs to try out nearby.  Which is too bad, I was expecting better. I probably should have read the other reviews first...
I would have given it 3 stars. While their selection isn't huge, its offerings were enough since I was starving and would have eaten anything. The sushi was surprisingly fresh and decent. The stir fry veggies and noddles were tasty.Their American bbq section...the tri-tip= not so great, okay mac&cheese, weak greens and decent yams. Yummy salad bar, but they prepare it for you. And the dessert bar? My favorite part of the meal. They had a great selection of mini desserts. The creme brulee, fruit tart, chocolate covered strawberries and banana donuts were all yummy.Although some of my food didn't taste that great- it wasn't horrible, I was fine there leaving with a full stomach. But not even a couple hours laters, my tummy started hurting and I was hoping it'd go away as we had got to our seats for the Love show. Sadly, my stomach got worse and I had no other choice than to go poop in a public bathroom. I NEVER go #2 in a public bano! That's just not cool. But my stomach was killing me and thankfully, I was able to relieve myself with plenty of time before the show started. Because of my bad tummy ache, and not being able to pinpoint what brought it on, I will say that visiting The Buffet at TI in the future will not be on my list. :(
Myself and some work colleagues have gone to this restaurant several times and every time we leave, we always leave saying that we will not return, not because of the food, but the service. The food is always great!Today was a perfect example. There were four of us and we all received our food in stages. With 5 to 10 minutes in between each us. Today I was the last person to get my lunch. Then we wanted to get separate checks and were told no. I would understand this being an issue if the place was packed, but it's not the case.I will not be going back!
We were seated for 30 minutes before we were even asked what we want to drink. The food was just bad.. we had the french toast sandwich and the California omelet. I asked about the corned beef hash and the waitress told me that it is made from a can. After dropping the food off we never saw her again until she brought the bill (I needed hot sauce but just ate without it)...my husband was NOT happy with it. I can say that this restaurant is definitely a drunk no other place is open spot to go to. Nothing else.  Dennys and ihop would have tasted better. The servers were all polite just slow moving to help.
Meh.  The good..................- Free parking.  Not sure if we scored it or what, but we drove up right to the front of the gates, drove in, and found a spot about 500 feet from the entrance.  It looked like a "valet" area, but we were able to score a spot, and nobody was there collecting money for parking. - Nice entrance up to the stadium with the stairs and cool sign out front.- Decent smattering of Angel fans who really like baseball.- Right off the freeway, very easy to get to.The bad...................- Clusterf#*#* of a "promenade".  Right when you walk in, you are bombarded with nowhere to walk.  Their "standing room only" section behind home plate and along the baselines are literally right in the area where people walk.  They have a painted line on the ground stating where you can/can't stand.  People buck up to that line to watch the game, thus leaving only a small area to actually walk by.  If you are claustrophobic, you will not enjoy walking into this stadium.- Ticket prices.  Technically, I got these for "free" through a work rewards program, but even then, they were more costly than other stadiums.  SRO tickets were $21.00 I believe, and that is pretty steep.- Minimal shade.  For most of the game, we hung out under the beer tent just for the shade.  The last 2 innings we went down to our "seats" and even then, still in the sun.Overall, meh.  Too much of a cluster, too hot, too expensive.  Glad I saw the stadium once, but I am not coming back.
Ordered gluten free bun. They put onion straws on burger - loaded with gluten. My fault as it was actually listed on the menu - BUT, seems someone should have asked. BBQ Burger came with no BBQ Sauce. Had them remake it. Ordered shakes. They ran out of milk & had to go to a store so they could make them. Mixed up the order. They don't have it together. Excuse was that there is a new cook. Time to fix it. Food was actually pretty good. I was going to give them a 1 but they sort of recovered.
We were in South Pointe a little bit ago and when we walked in we immediately felt a weird vibe. Instant paranoia and had a "look over your shoulder" type feeling. We went there for a little gambling and a dinner special they were having and due to their limited availability we did not get the special. We decided to just gamble a bit. After finally looking for someone we ordered a coffee at the bar.  It was 11pm at night and we were told the kitchen was closed. They actually told us its too late for coffee. We gambled a little more and this place just gave us the creeps. Here is the thing... We came up with friends recently (a few weeks after our  original encounter). We never said anything about our experience and our friends asked if we could go to another casino because they didn't like the "feel" of the casino. It was then we told our story and took off.
This place is a douche magnet. When it first opened, it was pretty cool. Friendly staff and patrons, good prices on food and drinks, decent drink selection, and the billiards was a good time. My last few experiences here have pretty much solidified my stance on never returning.First of all, I wanna start out by saying that 99% of the servers are rad. However there are 2 in particular that I'm not a big fan of, and I can't imagine anyone else being one either... the chick with the GIANT boobs- you gotta do more than adjust your cleavage all night if you expect anyone to have any respect for you. Yeah, you're friendly enough, but you need to learn to look at a person when they're talking to you. You seem uninterested in any of my questions or comments about the menu.My next comment is in regards to the young male server. We were playing pool, and in the middle of a game we set our sticks on the table and walk outside to smoke a cigarette. We come back in, and two drunken soccer dads had re racked our table and started a new game. ON OUR TABLE. I walk up to them and tell them "this is our table, and we were in the middle of a game." Now mind you, I'm a little buzzed and trying my hardest not to get too shitty with these old geezers, but I'm kinda pissed at the lack of respect. He looks at me, and tells me that the server (points at the young dude) told them to grab that table. The server walks over and gives me some bullshit story about a reservation and he had to bump them off of their table so he sent them to ours blah blah blah.  I say "what does that have to do with us? We were in the middle of a game?" He comes back with "well there's other open tables you can use, I'll put you over here." Well no shit there's other tables, dude. Why didn't you put THEM over there??!! we weren't done with our game! If you're gonna advertise your establishment as a billiards hall, know your billiards etiquette. And teach your employees.The owner, or who I assume to be the owner, is a giant waste of flesh and space. Every time I go in there, the servers and bartender are running around trying to get everyone their orders and he's got his ass stuck to a bar stool with a smug look on his face. One time I walked to the bar and asked him if he could change the channel on ONE of the 20 tv's they had. It was on an effing infomercial. During the NBA playoffs. He literally game me an EXCUSE-ME-ARE-YOU-TALKING-TO- MWAAAH look and said "probably not." I laughed and said " thanks anyways." The bartender ended up changing it a few minutes later. I guess the owner doesn't know how to operate a TV remote, which surprises me considering how lazy he looked. ..Red button on, arrows change channel, + sign turn up sound... I hope this helps you, sir.I heard this place changed names. Hopefully they changed ownership too. If so, I'll give it another shot.
I'm giving this bar/club a 2-star bc of the intense amount of country music that was played in the first part of the night. True, I am not a Charlotte resident and I was there with a group of friends, just visiting for the weekend and might have made a mistake in going to a country bar. But nonetheless, I thought at least they'd play a mix of country and contemporary. Sadly, the contemporary dance music did not kick in until the dance floor was too packed to dance. Drinks are reasonable ($3.50 for a bottle of Miller Lite, $6 for mixed drinks) and there is a mechanical bull in the back near the exit, which makes for good people-watching.On the Sat. night we visited, there was some kind of fire drill which took out the whole place. One minute we were drinking and having fun, the next all the lights went on and we were ushered out into the bar for no reason. Or, at least not a reason my group could figure out. The group of bars in the area where Whisky River is located seem like fun, but the plaza is still under construction and it was a little hard to tell where things were located. We popped into Blackfinn too but it was v. v. crowded. Whisky River is prob. more geared towards the "just out of college, just want to drink and dance" crowd, and if that's your scene you'll enjoy it. If it's not, go somewhere else.
Going into this review, you should know I'm basing this review on what I expect a really locals-only gaming place should be. I found myself at the Wildfire because there were some dudes working on my car down the street from there. Seeing as it was going to take them an hour to get me going again, I decided to walk out to the Wildfire. I don't know what I was expecting, but this place is really small. It's just a casino, so there's no hotel portion like Texas Station or Arizona Charlie's or anything like that. As such, the place is really small and there aren't (currently) any restaurants like the aforementioned properties. And I say (currently) because there's a burger place there about to open up, it seems. Since the place is gaming-only and has a bar, I should write more about that... except there really isn't much to write about. The bar is small, and the gaming area is small, too. I spent about 20 mins and $10 there, and I don't really have a lot to say about it. Would I return? I guess, but the Texas across the way would be a much better bet.
Everything was sort of fine but kind of pretty underwhelming. I expect premium to mean service that goes way above & beyond. Walked in, & 3 TVs had the QVC network on, 2 more on some NFL network clip show, but no TV had the World Series on, nor the Hornets game. Are they paying attention or even trying? Our awesome waitress Jessica got cut right as they were getting busy, & the bartender got slammed & couldn't keep up with her tables. Rest of the floor staff was a little unpolished. Not rude, just meh. The fried pickles were ok, but too salty. The burger was fine but either the plate was huge or the little handful of fries too small. $6 for a draft beer is just too much. Again, I expect 'over the top' friendly for these prices & 'premium' name. Too many staff walk around frumpy & annoyed looking. Oh, and don't charge me for an extra (low quality) blue cheese that you don't even make here. That's just petty.
All the 47-year old men in the joint wearin' sportcoats hangin' out with your beers waiting to catch some hot young tail which won't even happen but you're still lingering around anyway in an awkward looking sausagefest - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"To the endless video loop of the Tempe 12 Girls trying to figure out how to best flaunt their mamms for their calendar photo shoots like ohmygawdtheresnowaythatIwillnotbechosenforKipWingerscomebackvideo - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"To the dumbfuck DJ who thinks spinning 15 seconds of every song from the 80's and 90's into some megamix is like cool but it's actually more akin to the sonic equivalent of Sybil, raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"All our servers who were kind of friendly but more like passengers on that UFO named USS Space Cadet that you see on top of the Space Age Lodge restaurant while driving through Casa Grande because you couldn't get ANYTHING right nor understand what we were saying as if we were of a different species altogether, like as if we were human and you were the green hoochie that Captain Kirk got together with in Star Trek - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!" (if you can)All those single bathroom stalls where the door doesn't become opaque unless you lock it all the way but I'm sure the ploy here is that as the night goes on and people get more and more drunk, girls will come in and maybe haphazardly lock the door but not all the way but they don't care because they have to pee so hard so they're sitting on the throne and watching people walk by and think that "Ohmygodit'slikeaonewaymirrorthat'ssocool!" but then they notice that guys are now just standing there and converging on the other side of the door looking right at them and all of a sudden the drunk girls realize that the door is not a one-way-mirror at all but.... - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!" To my Yelp companions who made all that was Six completely tolerable and proved the point that whatever the case may be with a semi-retarded-but-really-cool-looking Scottsdale venue, if you're in good company, you'll still have a great time - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"And scene.
I planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us. At first  we chose the $25 pp package with limo pickup, admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel. So then we went with the package of $45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off, VIP entrance, reserved seating, and 2 drinks. All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time, however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus!! Not cool! And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for. The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back. Then we pull up to Hustler club. No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler. Again no big deal but would've been nice to know that's where it was at. No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty. And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early. Seated limited! Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be, however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadn't been freshly waXed or shaved. A big turn off! Never the less we had a good time. I just wish it was a little more organized! Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another $60 to get bride onstage was a little much.
A deli right next to the sports book = Sports Deli.Hmmm there really wasn't a choice for a quick meal and I didn't really trust the Vietnamese spot next door so decided to grab a sandwich.  Went for the pastrami + egg triple decker and damn it is a huuuge sandwich.  Essentially a pastrami sandwich and then on top of it are your veggies and a fried egg, then covered with another loaf of bread.  Tasted whatevers.  The pastrami is your generic deli pastrami, and pretty fatty too.  The egg is pan fried but I wished the yolk was only half cooked.  It's over $10 for the sandwich, so a bit pricey, but it is inside a casino, so that's to be expected.  Again, huge sandwich, so you won't feel hungry after that's for sure.  Add fries and a drink for $5 more.Saw someone eat this crazy footlong hot dog.  That looked much better.
I hate them. They don't know how to turn off a maintenance light on a car newer then 1995. They told me I needed synthetic oil, I don't. Very unprofessional.
I'll echo Katie S. in saying BOGO rolls everyday are enticing. Unfortunately that's where Akahana's appeal ends for me. The restaurant smells funny when you walk in. I think they try to use a fragrance or deodorizer, but I always smell chlorine/bleach undertones. I've been a couple times when friends have tried to sell me on it and I've never been impressed with the food or the service. Edamame was over steamed and mushy. The waitress on our last visit was admittedly new, but couldn't speak to the menu and messed up our payments when closing our tabs. While I paid with a credit card and left a cash tip, she ran my friend's meal and tip on my card, and mine on his. Of course she returned the right receipts afterwards, so I only caught it when reviewing my credit card statement a few weeks later. Rather than processing a refund to my card I had to return to the restaurant when a manager was working and get a cash refund. Not impressed.
Disclaimer: I ordered take out and have not yet eaten in the restaurant. That said, my experience was not appetizing at all. The fish was beyond oily (see picture) and was quite smelly (fresh fish should not have a "fishy" scent). There was clearly no seasoning on the fish, nor in the batter, as it was entirely bland. The fries were also unseasoned... Always salt fries when they come out of the fryer - that's basic technique. Overall, a highly disappointing meal. I'd say I'd give this place another try, but my colleagues say they've eaten in the restaurant and had the very same experience. I blame them for not warning me ahead of time. Folks, this is my warning to all of you!!! P.S.: check out the picture of the new menu.
Pizza and food was good but the service was lacking. They don't have the ability to handle large orders the day of.  I don't fault them for having a small kitchen but they should have let me know they couldn't handle two extra large and three large pizzas, wings and a salad. Our order took over two and a half hours to receive and we had to go get it after wanting it delivered.
We used a groupon to check this place out. Despite having a pleasant sever, the service was poor. We ordered the dumplings (delicious), spring roll (not tasty at all. Probably the worst i have ever had), and chicken and steak hibachi (very salty). I can't say I will be back any time soon. It was just okay for us.
Last night my wife and I watched a show on lobster rolls in Maine. We were craving lobster and thought it would be awesome to go to Cousin's Maine Lobster truck. We drove the 12 miles to get to it and we're simply excited. I ordered the Maine lobster roll, she ordered the lobster grilled cheese and we ordered the lobster tots and a whoopie pie to share. $60 later we got our food and hurried home to eat it. We got home and to my disappointment got a 2 bite roll with about the same amount of meat in it as 3 crawdads. You can see the length of it is about 4 inches. Now the lobster in it was good, don't get me wrong, but from the pictures and the just shy cost of $20, it was a major disappointment. The same went for my wive's grilled cheese. There was a small speed bump of lobster in the middle of the bread and that's it. One bite of lobster and the rest cheese. So the lobster tots were awesome. Crispy tots with a pico and lobster topping. That's about all I can get behind. Unfortunately I was hoping this was going to be a weekly stop since they are right by us every Saturday night. But oh well.
It's alright place when it's open to get quick accessory or check the b.  Unfortunately the store has been closed with "paper indicating reasons". In general- the business aspect of this place is weak and selection non-existent.
Not very impressed. Sushi not well constructed, fell apart easily. Food good but not as great as described. Server either inexperienced or inattentive, not appearing very familiar with the menu and leaving dishes uncleared. Owner/host checked in on other guests, but not me!
Been here twice -- one time for dinner at the sushi bar and the second time for take out and both has been a very mediocre experience.The location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It's the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away.My dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was.  I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings.The restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn't feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I've found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn't seem to be actually hamachi and I found their "hamachi" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy.The two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV.  The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer's comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting.The cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish.I decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn't have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed).Next time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen's Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well.
Since I found Great Wall (35th and Camelback) and Little Saigon (58th and Glendale) I don't like Panda Express. Plus my favorite SweetFire Chicken Breast is nothing but fried dough and not much chicken in it. If you want to spent $7~9 I'd rather want to eat dim sum at Great Wall or Pho noodle at Little Saigon, it worth to drive there.
This store is way overpriced, but it's in a convenient location if you're in a pinch.  I used to stop in every week for my guinea pig's Carefresh bedding, but they've recently stopped carrying the natural version I prefer.  They also used to have pretty ok sales on the bedding, but I haven't seen any in months.  It just got too expensive.  Plus the staff at the Pet Co in Westgate seem much more established, happier with their jobs.  This Pet Supplies Plus is really weird -- the manager's "office" is a whole looming 5 feet above the cash registers, and is basically like an open cubicle meant as a place for the manager to survey the store and employees.  A little too Big Brother/King of the Castle to really boost employee morale, I think.It appears I'm chained to this store, though, at least in the timothy hay department.  They carry the OxBow brand of timothy hay, which my pig much prefers to the Katee brand -- the only other place I've seen it is at my vet's, which is down in Brunswick.  It does take a little digging to find a bag that's not dried out or brown.  So as soon as I find another retailer that sells the OxBow...see ya, Pet Supplies Plus.
Came in to return some items that didn't fit my daughter that were a gift from my mother in law down in Pismo Beach, CA. The guy checking us out at the register was very friendly and helpful. When I called after I left I found out his name was Cj... Anyway we didn't have the receipts because my mother in law gifted them without it and like we've done in the past, we just go in and give them our ID and they exchange it. Well a few of the tshirts were "Guess" brand and they couldn't locate similar shirts so they couldn't exchange them, totally fine no big deal because they were able to find two other matches and were able to exchange them. The reason why I'm writing this review is because the lady Diane or Diana was a total BITCH! I hope I have her name right because when I called the store after we left to find out her name, I'm almost positive it was her who answered because she had the same annoyed attitude that she had in the store... she was a shorter, thicker, woman possible in her late 40's with brown hair and glasses... what happened was when Cj had paged her in to come up to the front to ask for some help regarding the clothes, she came up and didn't say hello to us or anything (which is fine) but came up and was already bothered or in a hurry to run off and do something else... after hearing what I said and what Cj told her she walked off and said call "Tyler" (I think that's his name?... he was a tall, younger African American man who I believe was the manager)... he was great! Came up and greeted my husband and I and took the time to go look for a dress and came back and was able to exchange it... EASY PEEZY... anyway although I love marshals I will never be back at this location again and will drive 25 minutes out of my way to go to another one because of how rude Diane/Diana was... The impression I got from her was that it looked like because we didn't have the receipt or the Marshalls tag on the clothes that my mother in law must of gotten it from somewhere else... The clothes did have tags on them (Guess tags) just not the Marshalls tag... anyway like I said I will not be coming back here ... she's not a good example for her co workers under her because the way I was raised to work is you always put your feelings aside and if you have to pretend to be happy because you're having a bad day, well then you better put a smile on and represent the company the way the company would want you to represent them.
I've eaten at Rocky River Brewing on several occasions. The first couple of times were great and the food was terrific! However, my most recent experiences including the one tonight, have forced me to write negatively about this establishment. I recently went during a lunch break with a coworker and we waited 45+ minutes for a salad and a wrap. We were forced to eat our food very quickly and barely got to enjoy it. Talk about slow service!! Tonight I ordered take out for dinner on my way home from work and specifically asked the hostess over the phone if they have take out to double check what I saw listed on the website. I gave her my order and my contact information, which she wrote down (or seemed to be writing it down). She confirmed my order with me and told me it would take 20-30 minutes. When I arrived I walked up to three hostesses and let them know I was there for a to-go order. None of them were of any help and told me to head to the bar. When I asked the bartender he said that there was no order under my name. When I concluded there may be some kind of mistake and it could possibly be under another name, he became very rude and said that they had not received any take out calls all night and acted like it was my fault that the order was not in. They said I could put the order in again but then I would have to wait another 30 minutes. I feel that the service has fallen off lately and instead of hiring a bunch of people to stand around the hostess table and not do their job they should be focusing more on the customer.
2/5 stars, a blatant waste of money. Where do I start. Let's get the good things out of the way first. The decoration is appealing and the service is ok. If only the same could be said about the food.  The portions were very small for the amount paid. Almost 6bucks for a fistful of tempura fish cakes that weren't evenly seasoned. Some pieces were much saltier than the others (at one point it felt like I ate a spoonful of salt).10 bucks for a fried chicken bento that comes with rice, UNseasoned broccoli, half a cutlet of chicken, HALF an egg and HALF a meatball. I get that meat could be expensive but half a meatball?! Half an egg?! I also ordered Tainan braised pork rice and my oh my. The pork was less than a fistful and was very dry (tasted like it was microwaved) and there was no gravy or sauce to add moisture to the meal. It was overall unsatisfying. I was really excited for this place to open at first because I really like Taiwanese style street snacks. But after giving this place a try twice, I would say that I am utterly disappointed.
Visiting from Las Vegas and was looking for an authentic Mexican/Spaniard restaurant. If I was reviewing the service I would give it 5 stars. But ~ considering we have an executive chef in the family ~ we are always expecting an amazing meal. Was shocked to see tiny shrimp as an addition to most dishes. The cerviche was sweet. Not the way it's suppose to taste. Was not impressed with the food at all. Definitely not a restaurant that I would have to frequent whenever I came to Phoenix. Hope to have better luck somewhere else tomorrow while we're here
Pizzas are salty. All the time every time. I don't know why My kids think it's gonna be better next time. No matter what kinda of pizza it's going to be salty. They also use cheddar cheese on most pizzas.  The salads are good and we have had the Pablo Picasso a couple of times.  The dirty monkey drink I ordered was mostly ice so the next one I ordered I asked if I could have "light ice" and when she brought me this the glass was just over half full to "compensate" for the "light ice".  This was odd in my opinion. The first Dirty Monkey I had was so full of ice that it was all that hit my lip as I drank it.
Attentes élevées, amère déception.  Choix de sushi limité et surtout axé vers makis spéciaux trop chers.  Que le menu ne fasse aucune mention de Nigiris démontre que ce n'est pas un endroit pour amateurs de sushi du tout.  Table d'hôte limitée en options.  Le Tartare de boeuf était bon, les frites aussi.  L'entrée de dumplings frits était correcte, mais beaucoup trop salée.  Le seul truc plus salé étant la facture, au dessus de 72$ pour 4 entrées avant le pourboire... un peu élevé!
Well, correction to my previous review. I did go back there but they did not have the creamy rice soup I liked. The BBQ rips was not great. My hubby's BBQ is way better. My husband had a chili soup and he didn't like it either. Like the previous reviewer said this is the kind of place to you go for experience, not for the food. After a long water play, my kids usually eat anything but the didn't even finish half their order and came home still hungry.It was a disappointment but  I would go back there for their rice soup if they ever make it again
I'm really not sure how this place ended up with 4 stars, because I was struggling to give it two.   Service at the bar dragged it up, but that's about all that I have positive to say about the place.   I went there for a wine and coloring book event, but had dinner at the bar first.  It was warm in the bar, but even warmer (sweltering really) in the restaurant section.  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little.  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential, but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy, greasy mess.  The lettuce on it was questionable as well.  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter, which was a nice touch.  It's still freezer food though.  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles. Once I moved to the dining area, I wasn't sure which was worse - the sweltering heat or the "entertainment".  At first, we thought "what is with this music selection?"  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to.  Then, we thought "hmmm...this version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke".   After looking around, we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine.   Oh...that explains it.  It IS bad karaoke.   30 minutes later, though, we thought "why is this same terrible guy still up there?"  And then he pulled out a trumpet and clearly, it wasn't just karaoke night - this was the intended entertainment.  Yikes!
I have been to wok of fame a few times now... I do think it is slightly better then madarine (food wise), but I must say the customer service is just horrible, especially by the girll station where the steaks and fish is served. Those guys are just rude!!! They make it uncomfortable for my family and I to even ask for a piece of steak like I'm bothering them or something. Maybe they should retrain their staff because good customer service will retain customer.
very very disappointed in this property.  We purchased our package through travel zoo and was very excited to have the opportunity to stay in the room that was described.  It was the one bedroom suite with a full kitchen.  We usually stay elsewhere and frankly we should of stuck to what we know and like.  This was an anniversary trip and we arrived early in the morning so we'd have the full day.  We went to see if we could check in (we knew it would be a slim chance).  Since we requested a high floor with a view of the city our room was not ready yet.  Which was fine since we had a car and decided to grab some breakfast.  I did not interact with the staff but my boyfriend said they seemed a snooty and felt like they were upset that we came early.  Nonetheless we went to breakfast with them say they would call or text us when the room was ready.We returned a couple of hours later to see if the room was ready.  It was not, so we decided to check our bags with the bell staff, change and hang out by the pool.  After about 2.5 hours we wanted to rest and get a quick bite to eat.  Room still was not ready and they were still snooty about it.I still had on my bathing suit, but had a wrap on around my waist.  we walked into the Rojo Lounge and there was a group of workers standing talking and they stopped looked at us and kept talking. We decided to sit at the bar to eat and have a drink.  We began to sit down and the bartender asked what we wanted.  We told her that we were going to get a bit to eat also could be have some menus.  As we were getting comfortable, she asked me if I had something to cover up with.  I said no, our room is not ready and our luggage is checked.  She then proceeded to say she couldn't serve me dressed like was I was and I need to go find a shirt.  They should of said something when we walked in the door and they should have a sigh saying such.  We left.  Checked on our room and it was not ready so we went to the gift shop to get a snack and sit in the lobby.  While in the lobby the bell staff were having a loud conversation about personal business for all to hear.  Very unprofessional!  Thank goodness our room was ready shortly thereafter.Now on to the room....yes it is nice but lacks upkeep to keep it looking nice.  The fake wood floors squeaked and sounded like they were ready to crack.  I did my best to stay away from walking on it.  The refrigerator is obnoxiously loud.  There was a rather large "patch" on the floor of grey electrical tape covering something that obviously needs fixing.  There were parts around the room that were falling off.  The windows were filthy.  The towels made me feel like I was using sandpaper to dry off. On the night of our romantic dinner, I was fully dressed in brand new red pants and brushing my teeth.  As I was doing that I happen to look down and realized that the front of my pants were wet with water.  The water in the sink was hitting the drain and splattering all over the floor and my clothes. Also with valet every time we called ahead to make sure our car was ready for us when we left.  We always had to wait  for them to get the car.  The Wi-Fi plan is the stupidest thing I have seen.  You are only allowed one device per room per day.  And I couldn't use the Wi-Fi until we had a room number.  it would of been nice to use my iPad by the pool while we waited. We decided not to have housekeeping clean our room because we were afraid how long it would take them.  Also the shower is a challenge to get set on the temp our want.  The next day I noticed a slight smell coming from the shower. It is a long walk to the breakfast buffet that we had complimentary passes for.  The view is nice and the room was quiet.  We would rather stay elsewhere next time. Seems people are blown away by what is in the room and not the quality for the room nor the staff.
It was edible. The mixed drink -Daiquiri was incredibly sweet. The wings were substandard. Too fatty and not enough flavor. My salad was not great. I got the BBQ chicken salad. It was pretty boring. I don't know how they expect to grow as a chain. They make Taco Mac look like fine dining.
Great beer, marginal food.  Fish and chips were really greasy and other items were not great.  Loved the beer choices.
Extremely disfunctional. No manager. Servers are overwhelmed. Bar is dirty. Meatballs were not hot. Tall blonde bartender looked like she was on crack. Had to ask for water. Had to ask for cheese. Complete mayhem.
Came here for the Super Bowl weekend . I stayed for 4 days! I didn't know what to expect cause it was the first time staying at a resort hotel . I got a corner suite with 2 bed room on the 3x floor ! First impress was amazing when I opener the blind and saw the view. The decor was okay and felt kind of cheap . Wasn't impress compared to the other hotels that I stayed at on the strip. The drawer where hard to push back in when you open it . Biggest complaint that if you really wanted to stay up late and party after u get back from the club it wasn't  a ideal place to do so! There are mostly older people who wake up early and to go sleep early ! So if you want to be loud at night your most likely get a complaint from the Neighboor s.The security would come by and give u a warning letter ! Then they wait 1 more hour before they come back to escort the people  who are not on your guest list out. This would be a good place for a family that doesn't party. If you turn the tv on loud in the living room then you can hear it in the hall way cause of the design of the place. Overall it's okay ! Don't think I would stay here again unless i get the 4 bed room suite where there wouldn't be any Neighbor's ! There was never a line to get a taxi which was a plus .
The review of this seafood place is for dinner that we experienced as a group. 2 times within a month. So I think I can have my say in this place now...First time, when I called for Father's Day dinner. Booked more than 2 weeks in advance. Was advised in advance that we would only have the table for 2 hours, which is totally fine. We were somewhat expecting the dishes to be like Fishman Lobster House in Scarborough where the seafood is topped up and we would be stuffed...from our previous numerous experiences...so we ordered a 5 person set dinner for 7 ppl.. The food dishes were particularly small,  in comparision, the ambience and seating area was better than Fishman Lobster House...(1 star)...nothing was Wow or spectacular in terms of taste...lobster deep fried, fish had a muddy taste, steamed king crab was the best thing perhaps... Around 7:15, when all the dishes arrived and we started eating maybe a quarter thru, they kept on asking us if they can take it and pack it away...I'm like is it time for us to give the table back? They said no. So why were they rushing us leave? They claim 2 hours but they want you to leave before 1.5 hours..epic fail....( minus 2 stars) I want to enjoy my food and company, not gobble down and leave....this is not a hk cafe... please...The second time, same thing, rushing us to leave and realizing after the fact they didn't provide all the dishes on the menu..So that's their business strategy..sit down, order the most expensive from the menu and rush you to leave so you won't have time to enjoy and figure out what was missing from the set...I have way better places to spend my $600-1000 dollars please  with way better service and food.... not coming back...
I'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  Another time our white wine was room temperature.  We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, "uh, ya, thanks." then printed us a new bill.  There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty "QSA" isn't what St. Clair West needs.
Meh...kind of feel steered wrong by my fellow yelpers. Overall, just "meh". I have seldom met a spider roll I didn't like so when I saw the Angry Crab Roll my insides got all gooey with excitement only to be served overly greasy, soggy crab without any crunch AND it was topped with fake crab AND it had romaine lettuce sticking out like a salad. Overall, just kind of sad knowing how amazing this roll could have been and the kind of place that makes me upset I did my hair for this.The one nice thing, and reason it has 2 stars instead of 1 is because my server, Mauro, was very helpful, friendly, and efficient.Really, all the staff is very friendly, they deserve better.
The pizza is ok nothing to brag about and the service sucks had to go to the counter to get my drinks refilled and they looked at me like I had three heads.
The trout was excellent.   I had ordered frites with it.  Three of my colleagues ordered steak frites and their plates arrived piled with frites and mine on the side didn't arrived.  I asked the runner who said he'd get them.  Later on I asked again and was told that they'd get them.  The waitress got them to me as I was finishing my trout.  And when I told her that I no longer wanted them, she apologized and said that she wasn't charging me for them.  I should hope not.  I"ll never go back.  The quality of the food was quite good.  The service would have to improve to get to cavalier level.
First of all, I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  I was not offered a menu, but saw the order forms in front of me.  Initially was going to order a burger and a shake, but without a menu, figured you couldn't get shakes at the bar, so I just ordered a coke and burger and fries.I ordered my burger pink, with romaine lettuce, tomatoes,grilled onions, and bbq sauce.  The burger was TASTELESS.  Onions were non existent, as was the bbq sauce.  Fries were average. Got a refill on my coke without asking, then was offered a milk shake as a dessert (why oh why didn't I get a menu at all though?).  Don't know what the attraction of this place is.....personally when you walk in and stare at this big walk in freezer staring at you, you figure it is going to be reheated, microwaved crap.  These people figured out how to make it look nice, but it is a far cry from the burgers at the Squirrel Hill Cafe or Tessaros.  Not impressed.And I would hide that walk in cooler if I was designing the room, especially if what I want to eat is FRESH food, not FROZEN.
i'm really hoping i can update this to a better review. i dropped off my phone at around 2 pm today. I was told someone would contact me by 7 pm. i sent a text at 6:50 and didn't hear anything. Update : I ended up going in the next day. They told me my phone was fixed, but when I put my SIM card in my phone had no signal. Wookie told me that is was $120 which I just couldn't pay to say that I would have to go to the phone store and buy a new phone on top of that since mine still didn't work. I understand that not everything can be repaired. But I specifically told wookie I don't want to pay unless my phone can be fixed and he agreed when I dropped the phone off.  I tried to see if Wookie would work something out with me because after talking to other stores they told me that paying $120 for a phone that still says "searching for signal" is pretty ridiculous. Wookie kept telling me it's $120 and thats it. Nothing else to it. So I ended up going to att and getting a brand new phone. I went to another phone store later on in the day as I also have an iPad mini 4 that needed some work done. I told them what happened and they advised me that it was illegal and that I should ask for my phone to be put back with the broken parts and returned to me if it cannot be fixed. I asked Wookie for that to be done which he reluctantly did do "when he got the time to do it". Long story short. I spent quite a lot of time sitting in desert wireless. From what I gathered some people have a great experience. Some people have a horrific one like I did. I'm glad I read the reviews before I picked up my phone and saw how many people had problems with their devices and had to bring them back because that's what got me to look at my phone and see that I got no signal before I paid. It was previous people that ended up paying for a broken device back or their device running slow that saved me from doing the same. Be very careful. Desert wireless is the cheapest place I found but then again you do get what you pay for. In the end I did get my phone back and I took my iPad mini 4 to a different company which treated me very respectfully ( an issue I won't even get into because I got my phone back from Wookie so whatever) but that goes to show you that I can't even say my thoughts or I wouldn't of got my phone back. Be very careful! Sometimes it's better to pay the extra $20 and get a quality repair than the absolute cheapest thing. Most of these reviews were written for a free phone case or screen protector. Let's just say I did not receive a screen protector or case. But I did get my broken phone back and saved $120. I hope your experience is better than mine. I'm just super glad I looked at my phone before I paid or I would of been VERY upset.
Not a very clean place. This is the first impression when you walk in here. Staff aren't friendly either. Very hard to get their attention when you need them. Food is average. The only thing that I like on the menu is Satay Beef vermicelli. Never expected much every time I come here. Only come here when it's a friend's request or when we ran out of option.
Nothing is authentic here, too much cheese, beans and not much flavor. The chicken looks it has freezer burns,  no flavor because they boil it before putting if on the grill
Burgers and fries were tasty.  French fries do not come with burgers.  Burger arrived on a plate alone and the plate looked bare.  Very odd layout for a restaurant.  There are about six tables that are right by the kitchen.  We were seated at the table across from the kitchen doors.  It was loud and chaotic as all the servers were passing our table within arms reach of us.  We could see in to the kitchen.  The doors leading in to the kitchen are black and had greasy hand prints all over them which was grossing me out as I ate.  The bars sits somewhat out in the middle of the restaurant so the back tables see the back of the bar.  There is an additional beverage/dessert bar that is waste of space.  The women's bathroom feels like an outhouse.  I am willing to pay a buck for a burger but I need a bit more atmosphere.  Went there on the first weekend or second they opened so overstaffed and hectic.  Even the hostesses were confused.  What appeared to be the owner or manager walked around using his cell phone most of the time looking overly anxious.
I saw this place passing by today, and I needed a pedi badly. So, I gave them a try. No wait time on a Friday. The girl seem not very happy to be there. She didn't really want to do her job. She did my spa pedi really quickly and rushed me out the door. I'm not sure if I want to come back again. I have 3 nail spas to pick from by them that I can try next time.
I'm a fan of Starbucks and that's why this is getting a 2 stars. But they have very rude employees here. Employees give dirty looks while you're trying to order. The lady helping me in particular had a rude tone and was very short with her responses. I saw her intentionally ignoring other customers as well. I understand that side of town is a little rough, but not every customer deserves such disrespect. Won't be coming back to this location.
Was excited to have a BBQ restaurant in downtown Phoenix, and was also excited to see what Phil the Grill could do in a brick and mortar joint.  I had eaten at his old trailer a couple times, and the food there was decent, but not great.  Obviously the new restaurant is still coming together, with some final painting still going on and I'm sure there are kinks to get worked out, so it won't be my last time visiting, but I will give them a few months to get good at running the place. I ordered the 2 meat sampler with brisket and pulled pork, along with the waffle fries and jalapeno grits.  The waffle fries were the best part (as they were at all my visits to his trailer), and the grits were decent, but didn't really have as much jalapeno or chese flavor as I would generally expect.  The meat is where I was very underwhelmed...The brisket was cooked well, but was definitely not trimmed properly.  Each slice was about an inch thick, with about 1/2 inch of greasy fat cap on it.  I love fatty brisket in general (and tend to ask for it), but this was just way too much.  The seasoning used was overly sweet for a brisket, and lacked the smoky flavor I would expect. The smoke was there, but was only a faint hickory taste.   Maybe the hickory contributed to the sweetness, because generally the better tasting briskets (in my mind) use mesquite, oak, and/or pecan.  Overall I would try something completely different before trying the brisket again.The pulled pork was also extremely fatty, to the point where 20% was just an inedible chunk of fatty skin.  Again, it was also somewhat greasy, but generally tasted better than the brisket.  I think the sweet works better with the pork than it does the brisket.  My top in Phoenix is still Little Miss. And I realize that everyone has their own style.  If you are going to charge Little Miss prices for your brisket, you better have a somewhat comparable product quality wise (taking individual style out).  As it stands now, this place doesn't even crack my Top 5 in Phoenix.   Work on the quality control, and I'll see you in a few months to hopefully update with a better review. Also, it's kind of tacky to have your cashier using her vape pen at the register.  I realize it was pretty empty in the place, but pretty sure that isn't allowed by AZ law...
Based on a recommendation and okay reviews, we recently gave Phoenix Palace a try.  Got there on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm.  The place was very busy and Dim Sum carts were everywhere.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were blunt and unfriendly to us and the nearby tables; not to mention they were pushy with their fellow cart colleagues.  One actually shoved her coworker's cart right out of the aisle with her cart and headed to the next table to sell her food.  As customers finished their meals and started leaving, the carts never came by our table again until we made a specific request. In addition to the poor service, the food wasn't nearly as good as other Dim Sum places in the area.  The food we received was fine, but the selection was surprisingly dismal & quite limited, and special orders took well over 20 minutes.  First time I've left a Dim Sum restaurant feeling hungry.  Won't be back and can't recommend this place.
Easy-going cafés are hard to come by in the areas between Bishop and Peel, and I once thought M was different. Unfortunately in the past few months something has changed, and not for the better. M café now feels like a cheap, bad diner without the food and prices to match. The same salad I had last time was now drenched in oil. When the servers weren't clinking down cutlery or leaning over us mid-bite to pour us water, they were loudly chattering being the counter. Was this a one time thing? I don't know. I'll do my best to avoid this place in all its synthesized-music-medley glory, unless I'm picking up a box of macaroons to go.
I grabbed the 2 for $20 to go from this location earlier this week.  We ordered the queso blanco dip as the appetizer.  The bourbon street chicken and shrimp and the three cheese chicken penne were the entrees.The to go woman was very friendly and the food was carried out to us within a three minutes of us pulling into the designated parking space.When we got home and looked at the food we were dissapointed.  The portions were very small and since when does "cajun" mean burnt and shriveled?  The queso blanco was okay but a little salty.  Luckily they put the jalepnos on the side and gave us a good portion of chips.The three cheese chicken penne was DRY.  There was barely any sauce on the pasta and the portion was small.The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was a joke.  A miniscule burnt dry chicken breast next to some dry ass potato chunks that were so salty that you could see the grains of salt on the potato skin and about 5 burnt shriveled up sliced mushrooms.One star for the price and one star for the to go woman.  Thats it.
Will I make it a must see whenever I visit friends in Las Vegas? Definitely NOT!We decided to do a group date ( 3 different couples) and thought this would be a good place to go to since we had all been wanting to try it out for quite some time.  We went during happy hour which was great since the drinks and appetizers were 1/2 priced, but that was really where the good things end.We sat at the bar out by the patio area. You would think sitting at the bar you would get some faster service, especially since they were not even close to being busy yet with maybe 3 other tables in the whole place being occupied.  It took forever to get the bar tender to even get our drink orders since apparently he was deciding to flirt with one of his co-workers that night.  Finally got our drinks (which I will admit weren't bad) but then it took another 15 or 20 minutes before we were able to order any appetizers since apparently every one decided to go on break or something.After we finally got our appetizers (which were okay but nothing amazing) it was an evening full of having to ask 3 or 4 times for other beverages, even asking for water about 3 times and never getting it( again we were right at the bar, and by now there were maybe only 5 other tables in the whole place being occupied). Finally we were fed up and decided to take our business elsewhere, paid our bill and left. We took our business to another one of the bars in Town Square and were much much more satisfied.Good drinks, mediocre food, and really, really bad service.
Wouldn't recommend this if you're in a rush. Very slow service. We waited over 30 minutes for eggs and the people next to us had to leave before their food arrived because they were going to miss their flight. Also, warning: the omelet are made from a pre-mixed egg formula and are completely disgusting. We sent ours back. All in all, I would not recommend.
Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My "large" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the "fresh" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.I wouldn't go back here.
This place should be called Zabas Mexican't Grill.  I just paid $20 for three flavorless tacos and some gross nachos.  The whole time they were making our food I was hoping there would be some magic in the taste because it looked really sad.  I think I ate 10% of my nachos before I had to give up.  They gave my son the wrong kind of tacos. He ate about 50% of his food before giving up. We won't be back.
The service is terrible. We waited for 28 minutes for our breakfast which was eggs and bacon. Another guest who walked in after us and sat down behind our table was half way through eating his meal when we finally asked if our food was going to make it to us. 32 minutes later our food had arrived. We were so hungry that anything would have tasted good at that point. The food was decent but I much prefer Sunshine Spot.
Carne Asada quesadilla came drenched in grease.  Completely unnecessary - no respect for consumer health - literally bathed in grease and dripping from the inside out.  Cmon man!
Ordered the meatball app and arugala and cherry tomato salad.  The meatballs tasted good but they were served barely warm in the middle.  The plate was cold and the sauce was room temp.  Disappointing.  Salad was good.
Wanted to use my Groupon, and they were closed for renovation! Not sure how long that will last, but you may want to call first if you are thinking of going soon. Will update when I can actually go!
I'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place. The wait staff was nice - that's the only reason I gave then two stars instead of one. We should have known to skip this place when we saw the cheesy plastic sign and neon logo, but we decided to give it a chance. Our waitress asked if we wanted to sit somewhere quiet or not (which was considerate), but when we said we'd like a quiet spot, we ended up gitting a table right next to some annoying doorbell thing that gave three loud beeps every time someone walked into or out of the door, so we asked to be moved. We were also given lunch instead of dinner menus, so we had to ask for the right menus. When we finally ordered and got our food, the quantity and price looked okay, but the quality was seriously lacking. The duck in the duck spring roll seemed to be prepared well, but there were none of the other subtle ingredients and flavors that one would expect - no rice noodles, carrots, mint, basil, ect. - just iceberg lettuce and cucumber! And the dipping sauce was overly thick, way too sweet and tasted like something that came out of a jar. The wonton soup broth was bland and oily, and the wontons were okay but tasted like something I could get out of a box from the frozen section of a store. The pineapple fried rice was okay, but didn't have as much chicken or pineapple as we would have expected, the chicken was a bit dry and again - none of the subtle flavors that we're used to in this dish that make it so tasty - cilantro, raisins, cashews, ect. The beef rendeng was terrible - a pile of beef bits in a disgusting looking sauce with a side of unseasoned brocoli and cold canned pineapple. The sauce actually had a decent flavor, but it looked so unappetizing and the beef was so dry that I sent it back. The waiter took the amount of the bill, so we were grateful for that.
Decent show last night and you can take photos, but really needs a different venue.  Palazzo Theater has the worst service!  We waited over 45 minutes for our server to take our drink order, the whole time we are waiting there is an obnoxiously bright LED light lit on our table during performance.  Then, she never brought our drinks.  I didn't bother pressing button again since light was so bothersome and despite being bright as the sun, the server was blind to it.  Theater needs more attentive servers and better ushers too.  We were advised to enter door on completely opposite side of our seats.
I've been to Choolaah twice now. I want to love this place because the format reminds me of my favorite Indian restaurant chain in Austin - Tarka. Unfortunately, I've been kind of disappointed in the food and dining experience.Both times I went, it was totally packed inside. Sure, it is new, and people are excited to try it. The space is vast - well, the vertical space is. Seating space, however, is pretty limited and cramped. Some parts are right up against the windows and line, and there's little room for patrons to move around, get toppings, and employees to bus the tables. It is also quite loud. They play music that sounds like you're shopping at an H&M.As for food - it isn't bad. But also, it really lacks that punch of flavor that I've come to expect and appreciate from Indian food. It really tastes like they dialed back the spices and heat to appeal to the midwest palette, and I'm not very happy about that. They don't offer any spice level when you order - but do have some hot sauces in the condiments area. Unfortunately, those just aren't the right flavor profile - they taste more on the tabasco pepper side of the sauce spectrum, and less on the delicious hot curry spice side. It's just not the same.Mango lassi is delicious.Samosa chaat is also quite good.I wish they didn't use so many disposable plates, cups, plasticware. Another negative compared to Tarka.All in all, I think this place is a fine quick alternative to, say, Chipotle, but if you really want quality and interesting flavors - look to one of the old-school restaurants like People's Indian, Tamarind, or All India.In reality, I can get in and out of People's Indian just as fast as here.
All I got was tikka masala. It cost 15$ and it came in a very small container. 15$ for a tiny amount of food is not worth it. I have been to Indian buffets that are cheaper and are still very good. It's no wonder this place is always dead. Small portions big prices. I expect this place to be out of business soon
I ordered a polish dog and fries and was not impressed by either, especially the fries. The cook asked me if I wanted fries and I said yes and when I got to the cashier and paid for my food, my food came out with a large fry. Apparently there are different sizes to the fries and no one bothered to check with me what size and charged me the largest. No big deal if the fries were delicious, but they were far from. The hotdog was just ok. I love the concept but wish they executed it better.
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple years, they've changed some things.  I was okay with some changes, until it got to the recipes.  The lobster cabenara was a family favorite, but they switched out the angel hair (or thin spaghetti) for regular spaghetti, and instead of chunks of roasted garlic, they now use some kind of garlic sauce or minced garlic.  For me it took away that homemade flavor away and made it more of a pre-packaged Nesley's special.  Either way, the change was not an improvement, and made me feel as though it was a way to cut corners while charging the same prices.  I'm not a fan of noticeable changes to menu items when it's not in the interest of improving on them.  I went from visiting at least 9 to 10 times a year to not even being a customer at all.
This food court, consisting of 7-8 primarily stir fry stalls, is a complete nightmare for an indecisive person.  The main reason is because with the exception of Arigato (Korean/Japanese) & Pho Tai Loi (Viet/Thai), & Dynasty BBQ (more Chinese-BBQ dishes) stalls, they're all the damn same.  Most of the stalls offer Fried noodles, rice, rice with pork chop, spicy fried pieces of fish, etc.  Customers either have their go-to place OR they try a different place each time.  I suspect that some stalls are owned by the same person.I came because I wanted to order from Pho Tai Loi, but by 6pm on a Monday evening, it was closed.  Arigato & Lemongrass were both also closed.  Maybe they're all closed on Mondays.  There are also a coupla places that serve BBT.Food court is clean because there is some sad looking senior who is mopping, wiping down tables, whatnot.I think what would make this food court better is 1) more variety and 2) an iota of being environmental.  When I went to toss my used napkin into the garbage bin, all I saw was a bunch of styro containers.  Not surprising as my people don't really give an eff about recycling.  :S  Frankly, I find this place a bit depressing.
Atmosphere is pretty nice (a mix between hipster loft and Scottsdale club). Beer selection is decent (better than the average restaurant). Food, however, was very disappointing. I am just glad we were there during happy hour and only paid $7 for our clearly frozen (digiorno) pizza.
This is a real typical fast-food chain place.  Strips are ok, drink is ok, fries are pretty bad and the toast is ok.  Not so sure why there are so many good reviews for this chain.  Maybe compared to other fast-food places?  I don't know.  But compared to a real southern-style restaurant that serves fried chicken?  Not even close.  Just completely pass on this.  Especially in Vegas as there are a ton of great places to eat in this town.  I only went  'cause it was late at night and I didn't feel like dealing with the "hip" crowd that night.
What's up the restaurant it's empty and there's a waiting list????¿¿¿¿Food was better before it got busy. I see already it's demise in future,they forgot how they used to do it.Just another up and coming place that was good going down now they're busy.Bye bye,oh by the way I'm sure owner will put in not recommended review all 1 and 2 star comments are put in this file
My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering, we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However, once we got into the burger and fries, our experience began to go downhill. Maybe it's unfair, but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad, but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries, which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you, but instead leaves you feeling crappy.  Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger, fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Five Guys.
I think it's better to order and wait in the store than to order online or call it in. Not that it was faster at the store, but the wait time is less - about an hour less. So, we called the store to check on our order and was informed that it would be arriving at 8:15 PM or so. Or so. That's scary.  Indeed. It took over an hour and a half for the two pizzas to arrive. Would have been done with dinner and already at home had we gone out to eat at a restaurant. It might have been more expensive but less inconvenient. Talk about paying for convenience! Anyway, girl that delivered our pizza said they were busy when we asked what was going on. I mean, really?! Our order wasn't complicated. I don't understand how others can deliver a similar order in half the time. No, not even half the time! It's less than half! Good news, our order was correct and the pizza was still hot enough to be enjoyed. That's what the two stars are for.
Let me start off by saying that I love to shop at Smith's Food, just NOT THIS LOCATION.  I live very close to this store but will drive several miles out of my way just to avoid this store. I will only go to this store if I am in desperate need of something quick. There are always tons of beggars and homeless people in front of the store and in the parking lot. You cannot get into the store or out of the store without being approached. I have told the security guards this is annoying and disturbing all the time but they always say there is nothing they can do about it.  It is very annoying and can be scary, but once you get into the store, the employees are very nice and very accommodating in helping find things and they do have good prices and good selections.  Going into the store is like a game, thinking ok once I get out of my car, which way should I attempt to get into the store quickly. No one should have to shop like this. They are not just begging for money, they are also rude. They asked my husband for money and he ignored them and they called him very bad names one time he went there. He refuses to ever go there again. He said he doesnt care if he has to pay double at another store but will not step foot in that area ever again.
Love their pad thai! Sadly i can't seem to find any pad thai better than this. Maybe lots of msg is the secret. Thai Express's tom yam noodle soup is pretty good as well.The service at this location is decent. However, like with many other Thai Express franchise, I wish they take hygiene more seriously. Cooks here touch ingredients barehanded and it always makes me disgusted.
It's never good when you feel like you have to start a review with "where to begin."So...where to begin?Let's start with the service. If you haven't noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it's just being nice - ya, that's pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I've ever had. Let's start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I "Young man" and "Young lady" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I'm not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn't old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I'm not 5, I'm not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don't call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if "our food was delicious." Unfortunately it wasn't, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it's obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don't care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I'm dining (unless I'm at Dick's Last Resort). Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I'm sad we didn't pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave's and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don't see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn't seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable. Upon telling the server that the food wasn't "delicious." She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren't satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave's. Lucille's at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I'd rather just not eat than have to eat here again.Famous Daves...you are the weakest link...goodbye.
Cheap happy hour, good location, ok food, ok drinks, awful service. 7 of 8 visits the service was terrible. Go check out the crowd, grab a drink then go anywhere else for a nice evening.
The front desk girl took our name and said it would be 10 mins, she suggested we wait at the bar. 45 minutes later and 4 margaraitas later, we noticed so many more people were being seated. As I walked up to her to see what the deal was, she said she was just coming to get us. Yeah right. Anyway, our waitress was great. Food was typical American Mexican....tacos, burritos, etc. Nothing too fancy, and nothing worth noting here. We were in a hurry so we chose this place on a whim...we will plan better next time.
Love the music, service was good.. Food was Ho hum.. Got the ten gallon combo and also brisket filet. Flavors were ok. Too much 'Gas/Charcoal' to the cooking, instead of mesquite wood flavor. So food tasted like it had been drenched in gas..
Food was mediocre and expensive. Our waiter acted like he couldn't be bothered by us even though we spent a lot of money. This was our most disapointing outing in our Vegas trip.
This place is great in Tucson, AZ but here in Phoenix it's everything but good, the food is very bland the hotdogs are always cold when I get them and the sausage is very small and the bread is huge, place is clean and the workers are good, it's just that the food is always cold or just bland.
Way too slow, way too salty and enough to get me to break my long streak of not leaving poor reviews. . One table when we arrived, people finishing up outside around 1930 on Thursday.  Food took a dog's age to arrive  approx 25 mins ( kids , love to wait, oh yes they do)  My poutine was awful,easily worst in the valley, and about as salty as this review.To be  beaten by Food trucks and several bars may not be a disgrace but there are better offerings at ice rink restaurants within the valley. Not saying anything else on the menu is awful but that was the main reason this restaurant was chosen.    I  left it mostly uneaten which didn't raise a comment.  Barely any gravy, curds that couldn't squeak if you tried , fries  limp as all hell, I.E.,  Just vile phoning it in crap.   when people don't ask why you buy things to just sit on the table it suggests it's a known issue.  The kids fared better and really liked their waffle kid's meals which appeared reasonable value and came with a mountain of fries , insultingly bigger than the poutine for adults,but I digress. I didn't eat their food. I just can't forsee another outing based on our being in Westgate is event based and if takes this long on a quiet non-event night I'd hate to imagine the lead time before a game.
Just spent $45 (not including tip) for food that was just alright, not cooked the way I asked, and I'm still starving.  Service was great though.Edamame with kimchi butter was good.Asked for the teriyaki salmon to be rare, a quick sear, but was more medium well.  It wasn't a bad dish, but for $30 you expect your socks to be blown off, or at least somewhat sate your appetite.Just went to another restaurant to get another meal.
The service was horrible!  We were the only table and got decent service then a crowd of rowdy women came in and we were nonexistent.  It took us over 30 min to get our check and that was after I  had to walk up to the front counter. The food was decent but will probably not go back. I don't like to be in an establishment where I'm treated like I'm a bother than welcomed. Being a prior food server I was very disappointed at the quality of service.
I think I expected more from this place because its supposed to be "New York" pizza and the decor of the restaurant is decorated very New York-ish.  But I guess it is New York style, thin crust, sliced pizzas ready in the display window... but as for the taste, yeah not so much.  The couple times I ordered pizza from there, the crust was semi burned with black burn spots on the crust and on the bottom.  The cannolis were just OK and smaller than others I've had.  Maybe I'm just comparing it too much to the "real thing" and being biased.  Word of advice:  Less than a mile down the road is Rocco's NY Pizza... definitely go there instead!!!
I ordered "PS3 EyePet" for $9.99 plus taxes ($11.29 total) for one of their Deal of The Day promotions on March 23. The payment went thru on March 26. Purchasing the game on the web site was not possible since it was a Daily Deal, so I had to phone in and place the order. I spoke to a man who took my VISA information as well as my e-mail and phone number. He told me it would take some time for the game to come in from BC. I stopped into the store nearly two weeks later and the game had not come in yet, but the man at the desk told me he remembered that he was the one who took my order by phone, and that the game would be in next week. I received no order number by e-mail, so he looked it up and found my order by phone number. I stopped in again a few days ago to pick up the game, the same man was working there but was busy, so I went to another employee. He could not find my order associated with my phone number, though it did show my name. No info under my e-mail either. I see on my VISA bill that NCIX did charge me for the game, but I can't get it. I would now like for these charges to be reversed, I no longer want to purchase the game. Too much hassle and confusion.
I was so excited to try this place and left so disappointed.  I had my hair blown out just before Christmas wanting the style to last a few days over the busy holiday.  I've had my hair blown out hundreds of times by various stylists, however, the stylist here used the most odd technique.  Regardless, the style looked like the blew out my hair myself - and I'm not a pro.  I was planning on becoming a regular customer and left so disappointed that I wont' be back.
The food here is always good but 4 of 5 times we come here at least one order is wrong. If the waiter would write our orders down that might improve. It's frustrating to have limited time for a lunch break and get the wrong order. Today, 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong and they gave a 30% discount. So, we basically got to eat what they decided to serve us for $2.00 off menu price.I also believe it is obscene to charge $1.00 for a tablespoon of sour cream or 1/4 cup of cheese in a Mexican restaurant.
Duffs famous wings are famously not that great. They are expensive for what you get and the flavours are really poor compared to say St Louis or I wings on Queen. My girlfriend and I have been here several times, each time expecting better, but do not get the other Yelpers recommendations. Poor fries, poor wings, average service and an average setting/ ambiance. 2 out of 5. If u love great wings try elsewhere!
Came here with a friend for dim sum last week for the first time. The decor was very nice and it is evident that effort is put forth to make this place "classy and upscale".  That being said, you do get a feel that it is not the usual dim sum digs. The decor is modern and attractive, though where we were seated was rather chilly! There is a nice reception area where the host greets you. I made a reservation in advance and so no waiting was required. For some reason, they automatically speak to you in Mandarin. I had to tell them in English, that I don't speak Mandarin but then I added, in naïve hopefulness that I can speak Cantonese though! They proceeded in Mandarin with me and lead us to our table. The food was ok, not exceptional but not too bad. The thing that made me want to write a review was the attempt at being high end but neglecting that what goes with that is customer service! The service was meh at best. In fact, the most off-puting was when a dim sum lady brought our dim sum to our table. She had a tray of a few more dishes but was obvious that there was room on her tray. I politely asked her in Cantonese if she would be able to take an empty dish for me. She responded very curtly, "Of course I cannot! Can't you see I have little space?!"  I felt like I was scolded by this lady! Is this the kind of service you'd expect? Wasn't there a less crass way to respond? Management needs to train ALL their staff if they want to provide "upscale dining experience". Like most Chinese establishments, initial efforts are there but attempt to try and stand out as "upscale" is futile. It will soon be another run-of-the mill York Region Chinese restaurant. Won't be much to write home about.
For the friendliness of the staff do the store, I'd give 5 stars. However, the quality of their furniture is the reason I'm rating them so low.  I purchased a living room set for $1,990. 3 months down the road, the couch broke. Then a month further the loveseat broke as well. I returned it under manufacturer warranty and got a completely different set. Guess what? It broke only after one month. Just over it.
We took some clients out to City Smoke the other night. I can't say that the food was bad, but it wasn't great. This place has a good beer selection and a nice list of bourbon specialty cocktails. As a bar alone, I would give it a higher rating. Nice atmosphere and huge bar area.We started our meal out with the fried pickles, which were pretty good, but the shards of glass that I bit into in one of the pickle slices kind of ruined that. The staff reacted, comped my meal, etc. so I wasn't too upset, but it really did freak me out a bit to spit out a few pieces of glass after I just bit into a fried pickle.But regardless of that event, my opinion of this spot wouldn't change. I would much prefer an NC barbecue restaurant to focus solely on NC barbecue and not try to be a mediocre version of Austin, Kansas City, and Memphis as well. The NC pulled pork was quite good, but the eastern vinegar sauce was horrible. I love Eastern NC style vinegar based sauce, but I don't know who came up with the vinegar crap I tasted there. No flavor at all. The Kansas City sauce resembled nothing like I have ever tasted in my 6 or 7 experiences in KC with their local style barbecue. It tasted like Ketchup when compared to Arthur Bryant's or Gates'. Their own "city smoke" sauce was decent and tangy, but nothing to write home about.On a really positive note, the Brunswick Stew was killer. Probably some of the best I have ever had. It had a nice spicy bite to it and had a bunch of chunks of pulled pork. I could just order a giant bowl of this and I'd be happy!As uptown barbecue restaurants go, I think Queen City Q has this place beat by a long shot. Unless I just want to grab a beer or a bourbon drink, I don't think I will revisit this place.
I did receive a call back referring to the review I left about a month ago. The lady was nice and sounded like she honestly cared, told me if I cared to try working out  another deal she would do her best to help me.
They get worse every time I come to this location!  Not only do they skimp on portions, but...where's the flipping meat?!? Seriously???? Where.is.the.meat!? When I order string bean chicken, I expect string beans AND chicken, not just string beans, and ONE piece of chicken. I asked for mixed vegetables, not just broccoli. So sick of the lower quality, lower service,  and they raise their prices after cutting portions. I'm sick of it! Go to New Asian Star on 99th ave and Lower Buckeye instead, better quality, cheaper, amd free egg rolls with yelp check-in!
The wait wasn't too bad for a Sunday morning.  But we were taken to a dining room that was just "too open".  We got no feelings of privacy or anything, being sat in the dead center of a very noisy dining room.  The bathrooms are so cramped and crowded, which is uncomfortable.  The menu.. well, let's just say, that sometimes less is more, and BBD has way too many options on theirs.  It's confusing to order and when you do, it's obvious that the cooks make the "easy" meals first because my food came out ice cold.  The food is nothing to write home about, in my opinion.  I really wanted to find a new Sunday breakfast spot, but BBD just didn't deliver.
This wings are alright and affordable.  Great atmosphere.  However was expecting more flavours for a restaurant that specializes in wings.  Their flavours are very basic and can be found at any restaurants that serve wings like mild, medium hot, BBQ, honey garlic, salt and pepper.  They need to be more adventures and play around with some sauces even as a special.
I think this might be generous. The fajitas were so bland, the rice was crunchy, they charged $21 for two beers, and service at bar was rude! We will never go there again!
I came here last night around 8:30 with my boyfriend to get something to eat. We were greeted and then chose a spot nearby to sit and right away we saw a cricket nearby our table. I didn't mind it, and neither did my boyfriend. We sat down and ordered our drinks and food. My boyfriend mentions how he saw a roach crawling up the stairwell. I got gross out at the thought of it but shrugged it off. As we continued to wait, I felt something land on my right shoulder and my immediate reaction was to quickly brush it off. I asked my boyfriend if it was a roach and the look on his face answered my question. The roach fell from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder! Either it came from upstairs or was crawling on the ceiling, I don't know for sure. We moved to a different table and the waitress brought our drinks and asked if we saw another cricket, we told her what happened and she looked horrified. She apologized and told us that they spray the place once every two weeks. I told her it was okay. When she left I saw two more roaches. One crawling on the wall behind my boyfriend and one underneath the table next to us, barely alive. My boyfriend and I decided to leave, we didn't feel comfortable eating there anymore. We asked if we could just pay for the drinks instead. She understood and asked if we would like our food to go but we said "No thank you." She said we didn't have to pay for the drinks. She was very kind to us. I suggest you don't come in during summer time. I'll probably just come here during any other time of the season.
The food at l'Harmonie d'Asie was absolutely fabulous. Fresh, savoury, well-prepared and beautifully presented. The crispy duck was a particular favourite. Unfortunately, I can't bring myself to ever go there again because the service was so unbelievably horrendous.The waitstaff was very kind and friendly. However, there were only two waitresses for a packed, Saturday night room, and I suspect that the kitchen was even more understaffed. We literally waited an hour between each course. An HOUR. We chatted with the couple sitting next to us, who were apparently regulars, and they said that the service was always the same - unbelievably slow. They seemed to enjoy kvetching about the service while downing an unfathomable amount of alcohol - which might explain why they kept coming back despite the bad service. We, on the other hand, were just starving and annoyed.Another annoying aspect of this place is that while it is BYOW, beer is forbidden. The waitress informed us that before the ban on beer, people would mix wine and beer together and get sick in the washrooms. This didn't stop people from sneaking beer from their purses - we noticed a bit of this, and we indulged ourselves - it just made drinking our two beers (without incident) unbelievably tacky-feeling and uncomfortable. The staff just didn't seem to understand that their clientele were getting stinking drunk, loud, and sick, not because they were mixing alcohol, but because they were being forced to wait three hours for a meal with nothing to entertain them but their wine.In short, good food, but not worth the disappointing ambiance and the absolutely terrible service.
I've been looking forward to trying this bakery for a while now, and today I finally did.  I expected the cupcakes to be expensive, but I was still bowled over by the $3.50 price for a single, very average sized cake.  The selection was pretty good - everything from the standard chocolate and red velvet to peanut butter and cherry.  I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation, which had coconut and a pineapple filling.  I purchased my cupcake and took it back to the office with me to enjoy.I was impressed by the packaging, and I suspect that's where the bulk of my $3.50 (plus tax) went.  The plan white cube had an interior cupcake tray so the cupcake wouldn't go sloshing around.  It was a nice touch.  I just finished eating my afternoon treat, and here are my thoughts:- Average size- Heavy, but that's due to the huge amount of very heavy frosting- The consistency of the cake was very nice - not dry, not too dense, just right- The coconut flakes in the cake itself was a very nice and unexpected treat.- I expected the cake to be coconut flavored, but it wasn't - it was just a white cake.- The pineapple filling had absolutely no flavor aside from "sweet"- Way too much frosting.  The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided.- The frosting itself was way too dense.  I was able to pick it up and break off a piece without it getting messy or falling apart.I really, really wanted to love Cupcakes by Design and would have gladly paid $3.50 for a really spectacular cupcake, especially when the flavor selection is really unique, but I can't imagine I'll ever go back unless their prices drop by a couple bucks.
The cauliflower sliders were mehh. Not worth 10 dollars. They were not crispy either. Quite disappointing.
The menu looks intriguing and they validate parking for $5 so we decided to try it. We waited at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone offered to seat us, once they finally did the staff was really nice. Note you cannot substitute anything but you can buy extra sides if you like .. which to me is annoying but we dealt. The wings were not hot but room temperature, like they had been sitting under a warmer for a while, the greens tasted as though they were canned, and the waffles were chewy as though they were not cooked completely. All in all the staff, though slow, were really nice but the food wasn't worth the $40 spent.
We went there for the lunch special.  I had broccoli chicken and my mom had vegetarian.  Both were drowned in a salty sauce.  I recommend getting the sauce on the side.  Otherwise, the food was ok.   Mine came in a smallish bowel.  If you don't want to get full at lunch time, it's perfect.Service was very friendly and fast.  Prices were ok for the amount served.  It's pretty quiet in there, so people can hear your conversation if anyone pays attention at all.
Moist, fresh food from a chain, on the west side. Who'd have thunk?--actual STEAMED fresh vegetables, not micro frozen. see what little effort it takes?--loved the "buffalo" potatoes; nicely cooked, bite-size, drenched in wing sauce with ranch for dipping. BING.--really pricey for what it is. $14 for a basic salad? where do you think we are, Scottsdale?--too many windows, too much light to be a proper pub--decor from some pick-by-page-and-letter Irish kitsch catalog.--um. there's a metal fishnet thing on the ceiling!--all two- and four-tops except for a giant picnic-table size 16-top: you can't bring your extra 0.6 out of 2.6 children -- who needed him anyway?--ding for leaving my half-and-half on the bar for 5 minutes; this is a PUB, lady! Don't keep me from my Guiness and Harp!Something surreal about the popup mall that sits across from a dead field. And right on the corner is the Auld Dubliner. Far too many windows for a proper pub. Fill those in, man! And what do we get to look at? The empty dead field across the street.Although very moist and fresh, the food here is mostly bland. Thank God for Coleman's mustard. Between us all we emptied the entire jar onto our food; ok, most of it was on my plate, but hey!
Wasn't totally impressed here.   Went in for a gel pedicure.  Was greeting right away and asked to pick a color.  I picked my color and showed it to my nail technician (Lan).  She asked another technician to get her the color.   After some back and forth in another language, the other technician gave her 2 different polishes.   Lan and/or the other technician never told me they didn't have the color I wanted.   I had picked a coral/pink with glitter.   Lan put 2 coats of a coral/pink plain polish and topped it with red with glitters.  Maybe they thought that would work, but not my toes are a dark red with glitter - not what I asked for.    Additionally, I was surrounded by other patrons getting pedicures and they were all offered a beverage (water, wine, etc).   I was never asked about wanting a beverage or anything else.   Was not impressed!
Service is the best part of this place. Nice, friendly and attentive.Cha gio are home made but not fabulous. Pho is too bland to my taste and meat not a first choice. Perhaps this place is better for bun and do-it-yourself plate/combos.I can continue to look for the best pho in Toronto.
I work in the building where this bar is located, so I've been there a few times.Warning: if you want to have a meal - or even just a drink - here in under an hour, best to go elsewhere. It doesn't seem to matter which manager (and as I understand, there have been many) runs the place, service always seems to be at the very bottom of the list. The food is serviceable, but nothing to write home to mother about. They used to be a "pour house", meaning they had tons of beer on tap, but for some reason have changed to what they call a "martini bar". If that was the case, you think they'd learn how to make an actual martini. I ordered a dry vodka martini (which means little vermouth) with a lemon twist (and I specified no olives) yet I was served a dirty martini (tons of vermouth) with three olives.This place can be so sad sometimes that it's humorous. Mediocrity reigns supreme here.
Have ate here a few times the only thing worth ordering is the pot stickers ! Food is made haphazardly with low quality ingredients and it's poorly prepared!! After tonight's order I will never order from them again the items were just thrown in the bag several items spilled and the pepper beef was awful ! Never going back
Would not recommend. The room is small and  they claim remodeling took place recently, but all furniture is old. The walls are very thin so you can hear everything. Also make sure you not next to the train tracks you hear all night from your room. It used to be an old train station we found out l ol. It is also very far from the main attractions on the strip. Expect a $50 cab ride from the airport.Will not stay here again.
This is about the chicken noodle soup.  I just paid $4.00 for a bowl of thin, salty, and what tasted like packaged base to which they may have added a few plump noodles, several pieces merely of diced carrot and ONE half-inch shred of chicken.  (Well, there was also a 1/4 inch shred of chicken in the bowl).  RIP-OFF!  What nerve.  I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote that the chicken noodle soup is mediocre.  That was being kind.
Well, we approached the entrance, only to see a "mom" sitting in her car combing her hair in blithe acceptance of the fact her young (6-7 year old) son  was - yes, you're reading it right - dropping trou and peeing on the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Copp's front picture window, in full view of the entire world.  From the sneer and scowl set to her face, saying something would have invited an (un)righteous indignation by an ignorant woman apparently egregiously put upon by the world's demands, such as, uh, caring for your spawn.  About the timbre of the clientele and store, from what I can tell.  Call me a snob.....but I prefer to keep toilets and toiletries separated by at least a partition.  No thanks.
When I think of Thai food, I think of Swadee. Swadee was sort of my introductory restaurant into the world of Thai food. I've gone with many friends and family her over the years and they all have been satisfied.So it pains me to write a bad review, but the last couple experiences I've had at Swadee have required me to bid Swadee adieu.The first bad experience I ordered the Larb Tofu. The dish was so salty I couldn't finish it. It literally tasted like the cap fell off the soy sauce bottle and they dumped  several cups of the stuff in the pan/wok. Even if they didn't, it was pretty much inedible. Inedible in the same way a salad swimming in vinaigrette is.The second occurred during a visit with my girlfriend. We are both vegetarians and took great care to make sure that the dishes we ordered were meat (and fish sauce, and chicken broth) free. Those ingredients can upset a vegetarian's stomach if it's been a while since they ate meat (or if they've never eaten it). Well, my girlfriend ordered the pad thai (carefully made veg) and she found a piece of chicken in her dish. To most this would not be a big deal, but to us chicken isn't considered food and it taints the food it was cooked with. As a result she lost her appetite and it made me feel uneasy about what might be in my own meal. Our lovely Valentine's Day dinner came to a screeching halt.And as a side note they have a dish with oyster sauce listed on their vegetarian menu. Since when is an oyster a vegetable? The only vegetarian oyster is an oyster mushroom!I understand that there is always a risk for cross contamination and I expect it when I dine out. But this occurance is far more than just cross contamination. I mean, this thing was a pretty decent sized chunk of bird. It makes me feel uneasy about the level of cross contamination that takes place in Swadee's kitchen. The staff was kind enough to comp the tainted Pad Thai (which accounts for the ** instead of *) but I don't believe you'll see me walking into Swadee any time in the foreseeable future.
The food is consistent and good. However, be aware that apparently volume spikes will slow down service significantly. Placed my online order at 11:30 for pickup at 12:15 PM, and prepaid. Quoted an additional 10 minute wait on arrival because they are experiencing heavy volume.
I have done business with Buddy Stubbs for the past several years, but unfortunately my experiences are a mixed bag. In a nut shell: The good, the bad, and the ugly. First the good. The rental department has always been a joy to deal with. I've rented seven different bikes from them and the guys behind the counter are great. If you would like to try out a new model of Harley, rent one here, you'll be glad you did. Also the guys at the parts counter, all cool, good to deal with. And yes, the museum inside is awesome. If you have an interest in vintage bikes, do take the tour.  Now for the bad. Walked in one day and they had the model and color of bike that I wanted on the floor. The salesman suggested that I take it for a test ride. After a quick ride, I hinted that he might throw in a couple of goodies to seal the deal, which he agreed to.But then while reviewing the purchase contract I see that he added on an extra 600 dollars to the freight and prep. I said, wait a minute, I see what is going on here. You're trying to stick me for an extra 600 to pay for those goodies. Well, he looked like a kid that got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. I said look, I really don't need those goodies right now, just keep 'um but put the freight and prep charges back where they are supposed to be. After that, they acted like they couldn't wait to get me and my new bike out of the store. Never even thanked me for just spending 15 grand at their store.I have been back several times to purchase oil and filters etc. and when that salesmansees me come in he goes the other direction. Even walked right by him  a few times. Never a, " Hi, how is the new bike?" or anything. Nice way to treat a good customer.   Now for the ugly. My model of Harley had a recall on the gas tank filler neck. Recall notice said that the cap could leak gas unless the dealer ran a tool down the neck to straighten out the threads. OK, no biggie, took it in to their service dept. to get it done.The first thing that I notice about the service dept. is a bit of an attitude amongst the employees. Kind of like: we know it all and you are a dumb ass. Maybe because I had the audacity to ask them not to let any paint chips or dirt go down into my gas tank.As they rolled my bike away the alarm went off. Seems the know-it- all's forgot to askfor my proximity key. I hand my key to the guy at the counter and he throws them tomechanic who misses letting them hit the floor(remember it's an electronic device).Anyway, about 20 minutes later they roll my bike back out and tell me it's done. Well,the first thing I do is unscrew the cap and wipe my finger around the filler neck. There was a lot of paint chips and crud that came off on my finger. Theydidn't even have the sense to wipe the inside of the neck clean. No telling how much crud went down into the gas tank. I thought to my self, ' I wouldn't have these monkeys work on my kid's tricycle.'
Very cheap when they priced my un-used  name brand boy shoes...I  expected more. Didn't take any of my sons nice clothing compared to what they had in the store the clothes I brought where a lot nicer.  Not a Fan!
Service is good. This place is opened super early and super late. It might even be 24/7Anyway I arrived on a Saturday around 5pm. I purchased a groupon hotel deal which came with $10 in food credit.No lines. Quickly seated. Service was good too. Ordered the fried zucchini. The zucchini itself was ok but the sauce made it tolerable. Spicy with some zing to it. My zucchini was very soggy after 5 min tho. Not really worth getting. I don't think I'd get this next time. 3/10Ordered 10 piece hot wings. Garlic Parmesan. Not breaded and with bone in. First bite was great. The other 9 pieces were lacking flavor and sucked though. Dry and felt like it was microwaved. 3/10This place charges 99 cents for ranch! What the heck? At least tell me beforehand!!Anyway is average stuff you can get anywhere. Only went here because of the food credit. Wish the chicken had more of the sauce on it because it was totally lacking.
We went here last night before dinner to grab a snack while we waited on our reservations at a restraurant nearby. The place is charming with its 1950s traditional ice cream parlor decor all done up in pink and white. In the back room there is a half way done kid's area with a couple of old games. Although the atmosphere is sweet on the surface and the staff was nice- the place lacks in cleanliness. The floors were dingy (they need a good strip, scrub and wax) and the restrooms were hideous and dirty! I'm with the previous reviewers in that the place needs a good cleaning.Our group ordered a few cones and while my rasberry sherbert was good- we'll likely be going elsewhere for a sugar fix next time.
It's quite a neighbourhood pub although in a busy financial district corner. The recent changed ownership makes it worthwhile to check this place out again. The waitress who was serving our table was efficient and attentive.For a Friday night, it's not as busy seated inside. But the patio was full outside. Nachos was good and you can't go wrong with calamari. Good array of beer in bottle and tap. Cocktails are mediocre...  Drink pricing is affordable and certainly not too expensive.
It's not true one reviewer said there's no bad seats in the house. Try sitting for the entire show in the nose bleed section on the top level. We went for the Andrea Bocelli show on Dec 7th and bought those seats because someone wrote on yelp there's no bad seats in the house!! Big mistake! Pay a little more to get better seats, it's worth it.
As a harris teeter customer, I know I shop here for great service and great selection. However, my last 5 visits are all disappointments at checkout. There are over 13 checkout lanes but only two cashier's working to take care of the customers after 6pm. This is unacceptable for a Harris teeter. Please see my photo of the unmanned checkout lanes. I pay more to shop at Harris teeter and I hope in the future changes are made to have more cashiers. This wasn't a one time issue, it has happened at least 5 times.
Unfortunately, this place could not live up to the hype created. The cheese bread was fine but nothing to write home about. You should not go here when you are very hungry because the pizza takes about 45 min to an hour to prepare. Sadly, there was a mistake in the kitchen with our pizza and we waited for 1 1/2 hour for our pizza to be prepared properly. This would have been forgivable if the pizza lived up to my expectations. It did not. It was not even edible. The only saving grace at this place was the staff. Everyone was pleasant and that means a lot. Although, I'm doubtful the friendly service was enough for me to try again. Very disappointing.
got fish & chips. very generic diner. credit card not accepted.
Like many of the big chain restaurants the menu is standard fare. I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home. The location needs a good cleaning, faster service and a better product delivered to the customer considering the cost of the meal. Skip this location and look for a local haunt to get a great meal. I won't go back.
So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review.
I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I'd probably develop an eye twitch. I went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2"x 2"-- a sad display. The chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn't even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. This was Cuban cuisine?! Where's the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! We left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness.
One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience, said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted, and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.We called in an order last night, exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce, one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First, the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then, when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount, she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90) THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie, do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up, and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS, because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad, which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie, it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck.
I came here to get new glasses and contacts the office is beautiful and they have a great collection of glasses! But they didn't add up my payment correctly! Thankfully I had a record of it or I would of been overcharged! Than once I received my glasses they didn't even give me a case that correctly fit my glasses! I will not being coming back here I was very disappointed, I have never had this many problems at any other optometrists office!
I have frequented many goodlifes over the past year and this has to be the worst one. From the state of the equipment, clientele to the layout this place is dismal. It is a renovated location, goodlife bought out some old fitness club, you walk in on one level, go down a flight of stairs to the changerooms have to go up some narrow stairwell three flights which brings you to the fitness area which is assembled in a circle with all the machines, benches strewn together in some haphazard manner with mirrors just to make it more confusing. It has squash courts, I guess the only goodlife that does, but it always seems very busy. The free weights area: The worst, the benches are an inch from the wall which makes spotting impossible, there is only one squat rack and limited benches.  Change-rooms:  Smell terrible but are actually very well stocked with every amenity imaginable (hair gel, mouthwash, hairdryers, body lotion etc) . This location has a steam-room which functions only half of the time, and a very small sauna. Clientele: This is the noisiest gym ever, full of teenagers going nuts on the machines talking loudly to their bros or on their cell-phones. If this isn't happening there are some random bodybuilders grunting out rep numbers as loud as possible. I have been to many goodlifes and this my fellow yelp readers houses the loudest most annoying people. Group fitness room: this is a nice larger sized room that is free in the evenings, I like to hide in here to get some serious plyo work done if no one is in. Staff: Helpful enough, no impolite or bad experiences, but they do like talking to each other a lot, especially in the training area which is loud enough already.In conclusion I don't recommend this place if you are looking for a high-energy, well-organized, streamlined place to workout. If you want to fool around with machines and sit around willy-nilly waiting for a bench to free up while listening to personal trainers joke with each other this is your spot.
Wow...  this one was an experience.  We went on one of the days it was raining in town and very cold.  It is never a good sign when you go into a restaurant and the employees are all wearing their jackets.  We were slow to get attention from anyone.  Once we did, they were quite pleasant, but continued to be slow.  We ordered the veggie plate and a beef dish.  The odd bread did not satisfy either of us.  It was moist and spongy, and to us, did not go with the food.  The beef was good.  There were a couple of good curry dishes on the veggie platter as was the salad.  We asked for the bill several times with only the owner coming over to talk.  (We are eat and run folks)  When we finally got the bill, he asked us if we wanted fresh roasted coffee which we declined.  Truly, there was nothing wrong with the food, just a strange atmosphere in a sketchy building.  This is another one in town we will not be back to.
Slow service nothing to brag about steak was dry not a real good atmosphere we went to the one at Tempe Marketplace not sure what the other ones are like but if they're anything like the one in Tempe then they probably suck just as much
It's a sad, sad day when a truly tasty burger bar fails terribly in providing basic service! [I used to stop in frequently when I lived close by but sometimes things change and not always for the better]Waited a good 15 min to get a menu after taking a seat at a nearly empty bar around 4:30p on the weekend, then another 10 min to get my drink. I gave my order to the bartender, but she completely forgot to put it into the kitchen. Meanwhile I witnessed others who ordered after me get their food. The bartender never made so much as eye contact with me even though I was trying to catch her attention about my beloved burger lol... So I flagged down a server to ask about my meal and it got walked directly to the kitchen.Eventually the burger double stack came out and it was every bit as flavorful as the wait was long. As good as I remembered. It was topped with 3 slices of applewood bacon and side of pickles ($12). Oh happy belly!! The sweet potato fries on the other hand were small in proportion, dry, and didn't have much taste until I salted them on my own ($5). Maybe in a rush they forgot to season them? Oh well.At no time did anyone ask how my meal was and at the end, not even an apology or concession for the lack of service/order mishap.
Three tables on a Saturday night should be a clue.We had shabu shabu. It was just ok. Upcharges for everything including sauce.On our way out, we saw a $20 all you can eat BBQ menu. They knew it was our first time and couldnt be bothered to even mention that special.Left a sour taste in our mouths. Will never return.
It was a rainy sunday afternoon and all of the korean restaurants were either closed or full. We decided to come here since it was the only place that wasn't full (it actually only had 1 other customer lol) and we were desperate. We ordered a beef and octopus hotpot for $20 and shared it amongst 5 people (even though it's usually only for 2 people).I have to say it was pretty bad. There was barely any beef in the hot pot(which was honestly the only thing we wanted to eat anyways). The soup was way too spicy and lacked flavour... it was like drinking spicy water. The octopus was just plain bad (way too chewy and had a weird taste). There were some vegetables in the hotpot too but it wasn't anything special. I was really let down by this place and will not be returning.
It was fine. The food was OK but I've certainly had better and fresher Thai food elsewhere. I would not go back.
It's was a bit pricey for the quality of food. Huge portions but I would never be able to finish. Don't think I'll be returning.
Terrible parking lot with bums everywhere.  Good thing the curly fries were hot.  What a neighborhood bars on all the windows.
Came pretty late after dinner. They do take Credit Card which was good since we had run out of CAD and most places in Chinatown only take Debit or Cash. The cute little older woman who was sitting at the cashier informed us we couldn't order any of the "food" items since she only knows how to make the desserts and the bubble teas lol.I got an Herbal Jelly dessert and she literally messed up all my toppings, but I was too lazy and disappointed to correct her. The toppings I did get were good though, albeit very very sparse. In the pictures, it looks like you'll get a ton of boba I probably got like 20 boba balls total.Disappointing. Don't come here unless you need to go somewhere that takes credit card.
I've been practicing yoga for 5 years. I've been going to Aum for about 3 months, also on a voucher, and my experience has been up and down. I finally felt compelled to write a review because I genuinely want them to do well, and just hope that they really listen to the feedback to make some positive changes - not get defensive. They opened up too early and unfortunately because the space wasn't ready and they had a few terrible instructors, this was the first impression people got and as a result, they've lost a lot of potential customers. I've witnessed them get better though - the space has cleared up, the instructors have gotten better and the equipment selection is out of this world. From the free tea and popcorn, to the organic fruit to purchase, you can feel they are genuinely trying to create a welcoming atmosphere - and it is. This is a no frills studio, but there is also no pretentiousness, so it's great for beginners.... that is if you get one of the good instructors. Unfortunately, this is what compelled me to post feedback. I go to this studio for Marta and will continue to do so as long as she is there. There are a few of us who go on Tuesdays & Saturdays religiously because she is outstanding. When she is not there, the owner Wally-j takes over and what unfolds is 60 minutes of chaos and bewilderment. I've been to a few of his classes and they are to put it mildly - excruciating, simply for the fact that he should not be teaching yoga. This is not a personal dig or meant to be an insult - he's a nice person and clearly passionate about yoga, but he does not know how to instruct, plain and simple and sadly, half of the classes are with him. I've never seen a class so consistently confused, frustrated and exasperated. I feel terrible expressing this, but I feel even worse for those trying yoga for the first time and this being their only experience. My hope for Aum is that they continue to hire great instructors and that they truly listen to customer feedback so that they can continue to encourage the community to move toward the many benefits of a positive yoga practice.
We visited due to a groupon offer. Came here expecting good food and great service. Only received mediocre service and food. The enteee was tasteless so it was dipped in excessive teriyaki sauce. We tried the beef and the salmon. Tempura is not an entree but a side in japanese cuisine, yet it was listed as an entree.The service was mediocre when we asked if there was wifi, and the reply we received was that "we want our customers to enjoy the food", yet with their incredibly slow service, it was impossible not to fiddle with our smart phones. I believe this place is worth a try if you get a great deal with groupon or other alternatives. Otherwise I recommend another place for japanese cuisine.
Meh. I had the salmon and my husband had a burrito. The food lacked flavor. Needed to add salt to almost each bite. The cucumber margarita was ok, nothing memorable. The best part was the Mariachi Band! They were hilariously enjoyable. Brought the average to two stars.
Should have looked at the ratings first...made a hasty choice - salty, greasy...your on your own...good luck!
Tried the pizza for the first time today, I was expecting NY style pizza which it was not. Was with some co-workers, one of the girls asked for the soup of the day as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have one, asked for the free passion bread when dinning in, as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have any because the manager wasn't there and the cooks don't listen to the waiters/waitresses we were told. Overall it was ok.
While not the worst food I've ever had it was close.  Bland, over spiced and over cooked.
The acid test for a Greek restaurant is clearly going to be the gyro, just as fish and chips is the test for a pub kitchen.  If you think paying $7.05 before tax for three small half dried up strips of gyro meat is acceptable, then you might like Crazy Jims. The big chunk of raw onion and the hard pink tomato slice did not make it any more apppetizing.  Now that IS crazy Jim.
I selected this shop because of the recommendations I received.  I was satisfied with the estimate and made an appt. 3 weeks before bringing in my auto for a broadside repair which included at minimum two driver side doors. I was advised on estimate that they would advise me of any additional repairs when the car was received.  Upon pick up, I noticed scratches and dents in the doors, as well as some sloppy paint on the trim edges.  There were also other scrapes.  I questionned and was advised that they did tell me they were going to secure used doors.  Of course, I knew that.  However, I was not aware that they were not going to repair the used doors to look 'new.'  Although some of the other scrapes were able to be easily removed, the deeper scratches and sloppy paint was not.  I was advised that a new estimate of nearly $1300 would be required to fix these scratches.  I am more than disappointed.  I paid $1000 for these two doors (of which they used my own existing interior), which in my own estimation were just swapped.  Very, very disappointed I was not made aware that any pre-existing conditions to used doors were additional responsibility--and never informed of additional work needed.  Never heard of such a thing!  I am financially unable to have these scratches fixed.  My auto did not have any scratches, sloppy paint, etc. prior to the accident and this was just shoddy.  Tears, tears, tears.
So this place is a step down from No Frills. Less selection, not as clean and way more cramped in the aisles. I found the entire shopping experience pretty unpleasant, except the cashier was quite friendly.Things were cheaper than at No Frills, for the most part. Don't think I'll be rushing back here any time soon.
We were out in north Scottsdale early on a Saturday and this was the only breakfast place open for miles.Coffee was a bit weak but good. I ordered the chorizo skillet and it came with scrambled eggs on top.I thought it should have over easy eggs but, ok.  It was tasty but a bit dry. It came with a buttermilk biscuit which tasted like Bisquick mix. Love Bisquick but expected an independent cafe to have homemade ones. I also thought it was odd to have a biscuit with a southwestern chorizo skillet.My friend had the blueberry pancakes which were huge (3) and tasty but way too much food. Giant portions of average food. Made me sad because the place was so cute.
I came with in hungry and with an open mind, being a huge steakhouse fan.  They charge a hefty price for their steaks; and the steaks are very good.  However, the steaks are nothing special.  I had the ribeye, and my date had the filet.  Both were obviously quality cuts of meat, but just nothing that would set either apart from other steakhouses.I did not appreciate the attitudes of the snooty staff and hostesses.  This place is over-the-top pretentious, which is to be expected, but I just felt like there was an ora that was disgusting.  In Vegas, I've enjoyed Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon which are other even higher-end restaurants.  There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.  At Prime, they made it feel as though I should be thankful to be served and seated in such a prim and proper, "high" class environment.  Prime is trying to be something that it's not.  This restaurant is located 45 yards from a wheel of fortune slot.  There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.  We're not in Paris folks, we're in Las Vegas- king of the nobody doing his best to act like he's somebody, and paying the credit card price for month's to come (LV is my favorite city in America).Finally, the $100 seafood appetizer platter was a complete waste.  The oysters were terrible (relative).  Prime needs to lose the attitude, and focus more on special food that matches the price.
Got the red bean boba slush, it wasn't what I expected. My wife got her favorite taro, her's was better. I should listen to my wife when it comes to getting bobas.Back to the red bean boba, wish someone told me there would be actual red beans in my drink, I added boba to the slush so it was a hot mess at the bottom of my drink. I threw it out and drank my wifes taro. She's nice to me.I've had better boba.
Winghart's is yet another addition to specialty burger places in Pittsburgh. They have a very nice beer selection, and the service was fast and friendly. After an appetizer of Tatonka dip, my wife and I split the shipwreck burger which has brie, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. We got it cooked medium, and it came out more medium rare inside and well done outside. I was expecting more flavors from all the amazing toppings, but I think they were shadowed by the burnt outside of the patty. The fresh cut fries were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.One big complaint is that they only give you enough pita wedges for half of the buffalo dip. She came by when we were finishing one of the last ones, and said, "Would you like more pita? It's $1.99". So they knowingly do this just to get an extra $2 out of you. For this reason, I'm dropping them to 2 stars. It's just a really shady business practice.
I have been to Zaba's a few times and I have never been blown away.  Their burritos are just plain bland.  I understand that this is a chain but you have to have something to stand out.  This place does not stand out.
Came here on a Thursday night maybe like 15 mins before they closed. The service was super slow and my friend and I waited like half an hour just for bubble tea...Maybe we just came at a bad time but it took way too long. I decided to try the mango smoothie for the first time. I got 30% sugar as I do with all my drinks. They don't even use real mango, I saw them pump in mango syrup lol. This drink also contains one of those little yakult drinks, then it's just a ton of ice and like a cup of milk. Taste is like artificial mango. Ya not getting this specific drink again. My go-to for coco is usually the regular milk tea with pearls since you can't really go wrong with that (unless they mess up the tapioca or add too much water). The black tea they use is nice and strong and the drink is quite rich.
Nothing special about TriSports.  Prices are usually more than other online stores, and it carries a relatively limited range of brands.  If one is racing for USAT, however, he/she is obligated to give TriSports money.  Nice gig the store has: shotty customer service, USAT uniform deal, and high prices.I've never physically been to the store, and prefer to limit my purchases to items required by USAT.  As well, I try to limit my interaction with TriSports to online sales and email support.  There has been only one person I have spoken to who is 1) pleasant and 2) knowledgeable.  I've conferred with USA Team USA teammates and they have all had similar experiences.Bottom line: With so many other online shops around, there is really no reason to do business with TriSports unless you absolutely have to.  If you must, shop at your own risk.
Here on 11/2/12Meh! Mashed potatoes seem like baked potatoes that are mashed. Crab cakes had tons meat, but were soft and fell apart too easy, don't understand the rave reviews.  Old and stuffy atmosphere that needs an update.  Quantity of food given is large, but lacks quality.
Good selection. Prices OK.Service not so much.Wife and I were in there, and felt like we were interrupting an XBox tournament the guy was having with his buddies. We're relatively new to vaping, and were hoping for a better experience. Just cuz we're not 25 and tatted and pierced, doesn't mean we won't be great customers.
Really went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars but when it comes right down to it, a steakhouse with a $46 steak that's allegedly their best (being that it is the only dry-aged offering) and is underseasoned and slightly overcooked.. I couldn't bring myself to give the third star. Slow service and underwhelming steaks left us fairly disappointed. Upon specifying that I wanted my steak cooked rare, the waiter gave me the always-slightly-condescending "that'll be cool and red in the center" speech before eventually bringing out a steak that was somewhere in between med-rare and medium.  Meh.The Mac and cheese was delicious, though- had a delightful smoky flavor and thick chunks of bacon. Really delicious. Wish the meal overall had felt like they were putting in more effort.
You really can't beat 24 hour pho... if you're drunk and don't mind a drive off the strip, definitely go here. All food is good when you're drunk.For us, we weren't drunk and we were searching for a pho place to eat at during the day. Our taste buds were extremely alert and ready for stimulation. I was left a bit unsatisfied, mainly because of the service.Pho LIttle Saigon is a large pho restaurant nestled in Vietnamese town. We all had pho in our group and only one person wasn't happy with how the pho was. The pho, in my opinion, had enough flavor for it to be a little above average. What I wasn't happy about was the service. They just weren't very accommodating, nor friendly. No greeting, no smile, no warm fuzzy feeling inside. To add insult to injury, the server spilled water all over my friend and ALMOST his iphone. Forget my friend... save the iPhone! I understand servers don't run around intentionally spilling water on customers (I THINK), but he didn't even apologize.Whatever.The pho was okay and it was priced a little higher than what I'm used to paying out in the Bay Area, but hey, we're on vacation. We're meant to get ripped off.
Pros:-price-location-shorter check-in line for total rewards membersCons:-thins walls in room (very very noisy). I could hear the neighbors and their tv, neighbors across hall, and guests walking and talking in hallway. There was also some construction noise or something late in the middle of the night.-under construction near by-entrance to park was hard to find (took an hour w/ traffic circling the hotel 3 times over). We called the hotel asking for directions and even they didn't know that the small entrance they directed us to was temporarily closed. We had to make another u-turn and the. turn onto a small street. We passed that small street twice and there was no sign or anything to help visitors find the entrance to park at Flamingo.-calling guest services took long (had to wait 5 mins before getting in touch with a person) every time we called-pool closes too early (6pm)
This is it for a chicken parmigiana sandwich!?!!! Round on a hamburger bun!?!! A FEW fries....very disappointed.........9 bucks for this!!! Will not be back...tailgaters or brothers.....mushroom appetizer needs flavor also....beer was cold...food was hot but bland and weird...very overpriced
I went two weekends ago with girlfriends and the wait was 20 mins at 11 am. But then it took 1 hour and 15 mins to get out food. They had warned us it would take 1 hour once seating us. I don't think the coffee is worth $3 but it is free refills and they have cream and milk. Also seems like a ploy to almost force you to get coffee while you wait so long for your food. The new waitress did being out a delicious banana chocolate crumble muffing to tide us over. My chicken and waffle was good! Not great but good. The waffle was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The single piece of crispy fried chicken was tasty with a mild spice that went wellWith the syrup. I sampled the poutine and it was decent but I'm not a huge poutine fan to begin with. Not sure I would go back between the hours of 10:30-1 pm. The people who got their before 11  am were still waiting for their food!Something needs to change. The $25 brunch + tax and tip isn't worth the wait unless you're purposefully fasting until noon. Ha.
Dude.  I am so bummed.  This is pretty much my most favorite restaurant in Dallas and I was SO excited to find that there is one here.  Sadly, it's not the same and the standards are definitely completely different.  I ordered my favorite dish - the enchiladas veracruz - and they came out a bit sub standard.  You see, Cantina Laredo originated in Dallas and in the Park Cities, it's ace.  They are ON it.  The manager always comes by your table to check on you, the service is impeccable, the food is fresh, crisp, and amazing.  In Scottsdale, it was slimy - the sauteed veggies came out mushy and deluged in oil, not sauteed to perfection.  The rice tasted like it had been under a warmer for a while and in Dallas, that is a serious no-no.  I passed up on some other choices to eat here and I wish I hadn't.  Who knows what else I might have discovered.  Oh well....
This review is based on my lunch experience at Li's House 1988. The lunch menu is quite extensive with entree, noodles, dim sum and more. We ordered a few items to share so we can have a taste of what they offers before we come back for dinner.蒙古羊肉面 ($7.99) Mongolian Lamb Noodle Soup - tasted homemade in a bad way小籠包 ($4.50) Steamed Soup Dumpling - doughy and heavyVeggie Pancake ($2.50) - hardly have any filling豆沙鍋餅 ($2.50) Red Bean Pancake I found most of the dish we ordered were mediocre at best. The waitress though looks cute in her Mongolian costume but I care more about how the food taste.I doubt I would be back any time soon....
Stood in line forever.  Said there were no more SUVs upgraded me to a suburban - waited forever - huge vehicle I couldn't handle.  Gave me the suv that was sitting there the whole time I was waiting.  They do no walk around it show you one thing about the car.  I will never ever use Alamo again.
You appetizers are no.bueno, your beer was hot. You get the 2 stars because the staff is extremely good and offer a great service. I would give you another Chace bit pleas make yourappetizersworth while
This place ladies and gents is a Korean sushi restaurant. Don't confuse this with a Japanese sushi restaurant. The fish quality was sub-par. The sweet shrimp was probably old because it was cooked. Usually par cooking is a technique to somewhat hide the fishiness of seafood as it gets old. The sea urchin was horrible. It looked dark and tasted off. Usually it will taste creamy with a lil briney flavor but this was of bad quality. Appetizers were good. They were hot and crispy when expected. The place was empty at 9pm. Not sure if that's just the lack of traffic in the area but it seemed more like the public knew about the quality.
Last night I went back to Havana Cafe with a groupon and wasn't as excited when I left.  For starters we get there and go to ask for a table and get wait time and the head of the house says it's like 20-30 min wait you sure you want to wait and we said yes that's fine and he goes ok and walks off shaking his head.  We were a little caught by surprise as that's not very professional but whatever he wasn't the cook.  So we sit down and wait and notice he is trying to get people to not wait and leave every single party that came up asking for a table as a matter of fact.  Many of us waiting have started to laugh at how horrible this guy is.  He even went as far as saying ya it's over a 30 min. wait so I wouldn't wait if I were you.  OMG really??? I hope the owner reads this and does something because if that was my restaurant I would be pissed.  Anyways on to the meal.  Laura A. and I shared the Tapas sampler which was good it comes with a Tamal Cubano which was excellent, some Chorizo and vegetables, Frituras de Frijoles, Maduros Fritos, Bacalaitos Fritos, and a couple Croquetas.  It was perfect for the two of us to share but there was a lot of fried on the plate which wasn't as much variety as we would hope for.  We both finished the meal with coffee she got the Café Cubano which was a sweet espresso and I went with the Moro Castle which had Dark rum, Bailey's and butterscotch schnapps combined with Cuban coffee it was a nice way to end the evening and enjoy with dessert which we shared a coconut flan with mango sauce.  The dessert was good not great though I am a huge flan fan and I have had better.  So overall I would say the meal was a 3.5 but the front of the house being so rude knocked it all the way down to a 2.  Pretty sad after I had given it a 4.5 on my last trip.
Had to wait four days to get my simple script filed after my two root canals. They blamed the Federal government for the delay but it's no consultation for being in pain for those days and being told to come back to the window at noon everyday and maybe we'll have some meds
Food was amazing! The service lacked so bad. So so so so bad. To the point where I almost got up from our party and ordered from the bar. The drinks were very watery but no waitress to say anything to. We were there for 2 hours and seen her only twice and one of them was bc she was told she could go home so she wanted to give our party of 11 all of our checks. Were in the middle of eating when this all happened. We said fine as long as another server came by. She brought the check and it was completely wrong. Once we paid we did not see another server until asking for one. Thankfully the second server was nice but holy moly! We wanted to make sure this would be the place to celebrate 5 birthdays this month but more than likely not if a server couldn't handle 11 people I cannot imagine our party of 20-25 being taken care of.
The sandwich was good, however it better be for $10 and that doesn't include a drink.  I asked directions to a washroom and they said they didn't have one.The man at the counter said I had to use the one across the road at ST.Mike's Hospital......WTF.
I was huge starbucks fan until I ran into the starbucks at Gate C. One of the baristas there was extremely rude. She tried to pick an argument with me- All I was doing at that time was addressing my concerns about the drink I ordered because she kept saying the wrong name of the actual drink. She kept blaming me for what I had ordered and was extremely stubborn. One of the other baristas there stopped her, and offered to make a new drink for me but I still left feeling very upset. This ruined the brand name Starbucks for me. They made me feel like there was something wrong with addressing my concern. Starbucks baristas are usually very nice- believe me I've been all over the world but this starbucks in particular for some reason was very off.
Ok so we always drive by Jordan's and wonder if it is any good. The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the "Salsa". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that. Well actually it was only a half star and you added a star but since I can't give a one and a half stars, you get two. Fellow Yelpers you have been warned. Check Yelp first, no matter how good a deal it seems.
Overpriced and slightly biased. Didn't allow certain people to go in because of their no jeans dress code, yet allowed others. Makes no sense to me.
DO NOT EAT HERE! AFTER I ATE HERE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER I HAD THE RUNS! FOOD WAS AWEFUL, OLD AND DISAPPOINTING! The restaurant was empty on a Wed. 10 o'clock PM. Our server was nice, (Chase), knowlegable, however when we complained about the corn it was raw. Chase, explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...I never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like RAW CORN when bitten into it. That is a LIE. Later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side, we declined. We ordered a Steampot, 2 Lobsters, sausage, 6 shrimps and a pound of clams, 5 Alarm Hurricane Margarita, a captains kid meal. Our meal was horrible! We ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat since I paid for it. What a waste of money! Your restaurant cooks seafood all day long, how do you get it wrong, your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes RUBBERY! My 19 month old son did not want to eat his food, which was unusual, because he is an eater. So I tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish, OVERFRIED! (The piece of fish was around 2 1/2 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.) It seemed like the fish had been refried. Old fish. I was totally disappointed. I did not speak to the manager, it's obvious that it wouldn't have helped to tell anyone. Since the manager must be CLUELESS, the atmosphere was sad. This is probably the worst seafood I have had ever.The service was not attentive, when asked for a little time to look at the menu I timed him waiting 10 minutes before I looked for him and found him NO where to be found. Waited 5 more min. He was in the kitchen. I finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only, unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well. When the place is empty I expect for the wait staff/server to PAY attention to the 1 customer that he has. I asked for the server for more tartar sauce for my son, (19 months old, he can't speak yet.) Chase brought after I asked a second time. My son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tartar that he had?! So I told him it's the same thing, and pushed it back to him...but he didn't use it! Puzzled I dipped my finger in the "tartar" sauce Chase had brought and to my surprise it was Blu cheese dressing! :0( I feel so cheated I think I spent $60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters. I will be YELPING THIS BECAUSE SEAFOOD CHAINS LIKE YOURS SHOULD BE EXPERTS AT COOKING SEAFOOD!*SERGIO the GM called me quick 30 Min. after I posted this review. He apoligized and offered a free meal for our next visit, I told him I will not return, but I feel I deserve my money back. He said he would return my money and asked politely to please give them another chance. He also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience. I will go visit again but I do not wanting special treatment, "I just want good food with good service in a timely manner" "THAT'S ALL CUSTOMERS WANT" I just want to thank you very much for your service Sergio, as the GM you did the right thing.
I really wish that I could give 5 stars, but after my last 2 experiences here, I can't. I love the food here, the bottemless steak fries and root beer floats are awesome. I just wish that the service was as good. We walked in and the hostess was very friendly. She seated us in a booth, as we requested. It was just next to a team of softball players celebrating a girl's birhday after their game.  My husband and I were sitting in the booth for almost 20 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order, next to these loud girls.  I was already a little annoyed by this. The coaches brought in the bags of ice from the car, trying to prevent them from melting. They melted, spreading a huge puddle of water. Many people nearly slipped and fell in it, including a couple of servers, as well as myself. I complained to our sever. I am gluten free, I don't want the gluten free bun, so I ordered the teriyaki chicken with lettuce. They brought it out, but didn't bring me any utensils to use. It was 15 minutes before anyone came by us. This server wasn't even ours, but we asked for utensils. By the time they brought them, my food is cold. I also don't have anymore water. Our server finally comes by to ask us how the food is, and I had to ask for water and explain what had happened with the utensils. He apologized and brought us more water, then went back to his tables. I thought that he would send the manager over to talk to us, but nobody came. I am surprised, since they always have in the past for issues like this. The puddle still hadn't been cleaned up when we left.We had gone in a few weeks earlier, the hostess was nowhere in sight, there were 5 other parties ahead of us in line. We were all standing there for a while. Some people got really frustrated and left. When the hostess finally came up front, she wasn't smiling, and looked surprised to see so many people waiting. I heard someone up front telling her about how long they waited and that a few people left. She apologized and seated them. She finally got to us, still not smiling. It was a while before someone came to get our drink order. We always go on a Tuesday for the 50% off special. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with no bun, as I am gluten free and made sure that no onions were on the dish, they said that it didn't come with onions. The service was so slow. We were so irritated with them not keeping up with our bottomless fries and root beer floats. What was the point of even ordering them if we are not getting the refills?  They finally bring out our food, but my food has a  non-gluten-friendly bun on it, as well as onions. I hate onions, and the item I ordered didn't come with onions. The manager came out, apologized, and gave us a discount on top of the 50% off special, for the mistake and the slow service. We were in a hurry to try and make our movie. My husband paid, but he didn't realize until after that neither discount was on there. We complained again. They said that since we already paid, they couldn't adjust it. They gave us a gift card with the amount we would have had taken off. It took almost an additional 45 min to get this. By this time, we had missed our movie, which was literally across the street. Our date night was ruined.
Came here for my cousins birthday...OK first its in the Mandalay bay hotel so its pretty loud out there. Next the place is really nice, it has a pretty cool decor that reminded me of little italy. So first off the waiter sucked so that means that our service sucked big time. We ordered ice teas and he brought it out like 15 minutes after we ordered it. I had to remind the waiter about our ice teas!!!Food was bleh, it was not that good, OK the pizza sauce was really sweet and it felt like i was eating pizza sauce with sugar. Oh and that huge chunk of mozzarella cheese in the middle made it perfect, ewww the cheese was just in one place. Ever thought of spreading it out????? The only thing good here is the bread and butter and the tiramisu. I do not think that I will be back  to this place.
Dump. Tacky décor. Shitty beer selection. Not worth the effort of finding. Go to Velveteen instead.
Upon reading all of these four and five star reviews I decided to try Thai Orchid. My experience was either drastically uncharacteristic of this eatery or it is a mediocre rendition of Thai cuisine. My entree dish was dry and over cooked and the spring rolls were underwhelming. How are they spring rolls with salad lettuce from the grocery store? I just think that is unacceptable. The service was slow, but I don't blame it on the two workers in the front. I am sure they were aware of how the night was going insofar customer satisfaction. A family next to me received the wrong meal and they voiced their concern. Overall, I don't recommend going here as it is not even close to the best Thai food in the west valley as many have claimed on the Yelp page. I dislike lambasting restaurants, but I can't hold back on this occasion.
We went there for lunch June 7. My relatives live there and don't have much money, so they like this place because it's cheap. If you join their slot club (which is free), you get a discount at the buffet. Also, we got the senior discount, so it was less than $9 per person.  They all liked it better than the Circus Circus buffet. I think I liked the Circus Circus one slightly better, but that one was way more expensive.The chicken is really good. The ham was so not so great. I loved their "no sugar added" chocolate pie.  Nothing was marked as gluten free, so I was taking a risk eating there. They had some pretty good salad options. There wasn't much there that wasn't breaded and fried.The waitress was very nice.  She told us about some other food we could order that was not obvious. I probably wouldn't go there again since it's so out of the way.
I have been to another Red Bowl, but this was my first time at this location. We arrived a little after 1:30, hoping for the lunch rush to be over, and it was. We were greeted right away and led to the dining room, which was less than half full. The hostess proceeds to sit us next to an infant in a high chair, when there were clearly better decisions that could have been made there given the empty nature of the dining room. The hostess came right back and said she would be taking our drink orders, 2 minutes later she delivers a Pepsi and a water. So far so good, except for the screaming kid next to me. It is then at least 10 minutes before we first met our waiter, and he was clearly flustered and over-sat. He took our orders quickly, and was off. I ordered Mongolian beef which I love, my better half went with beef lo mein. We quickly got our egg & spring rolls, which were great, and fresh. The wait for the food seemed a bit longer than it should have been, but again, that could have been the effect of the screaming infant in my left ear drum. When our food was delivered I was just about out of my soda, the waiter says "i'll grab ya some re-fills, be right back." That was the last time I saw him until my plate was just about empty, my glass had sat empty for at least 10 minutes, and I was just about ready to go. He never stopped back to check how the food was, I never got my refill and ate more than half of my lunch without a beverage. There seemed to be a "manager" who did a real good job at walking around looking pretty, but never had a thing in his hands while everyone else is running around crazy. The sad part is, other than not being piping hot, the food was great. Both my wife and I loved our meals, but the experience was ruined by absolute lack of service. On the way out, I asked the manager if there was a customer service e-mail I could have or some kind or corporate contact, and was directed to redbowlusa.com. That was it, he obviously did not care that there was something I was un-happy about, that could have been solved with a quick apology and acknowledgement of some sort. Oh well despite the great food, I will not be back.
Poor selection, indifferent staff. Your existence will not be acknowledged by whoever is working. On the lower end of the spectrum for Vegas used book shops. Cool name, though, and great font on the sign outside. That's really the best thing I can say for it.
Food was decent. Waiter was attentive. Music was a bit loud and I did not appreciate the people smoking cigars while I ate. I am sure its because they were "making it rain" on the band performing. This restaurant would get 4 stars if it weren't for the cigar and cigarette smoke, which I think is against health code now. Probably won't go back unless it is to-go.
Came here after work one evening because I was really craving a shawarma. To be honest a left quite disappointed. Here they use a different kind of bread which has more of Naan type flavour and it tasted very doughy.I found that the bread overpowered most of the other ingredients and it felt like that's all I was tasting. On top of that the wrap was poorly put together and fell a part as I was eating it. The price was also on the high side just for a single wrap, I was not really a fan of this place and most likely won't be coming back.
Ordered a beef shawarma platter for take out. Spent $19 on some dry beef, dry rice and very few veggies (exactly 4 pickled beets). Very disappointed for the price I paid.
Good prices you'd be able to work with. Great tasting daily specials but you can't compare pebble street to the sister restaurant, Calgary court (downtown). The service isn't great here. Seems like a lot of sass coming from the waitresses and the worst attitude when taking your payment. Whether your left your tip on the table or tipping with change instead of on the machine, not to worry, they'll remind you!
Sushi was mediocre. I do like their variety. Service was great. I just wish they'd work on one thing... My experience there was okay for my first time and the moment you step in to wash up its a nasty disappointment. I am huge on cleanliness and a restaurant should always have a clean restroom. If they can't maintain that for their customers and staff what's it to say about their kitchen? Just a thought. Not sure I'll ever go back. If they'd fix that issue it'd be a perfect little local spot.
Not one of the better safeways available.  The store is small and the people who work here are pretty good.  Most of the time they're helpful but occasionally they're rude.  It's a busy store and there aren't any express or self-check out lines, so checking out can take awhile during busy times.
The real test of a coffee house is not how it prepares its specialty drinks...(let's face it, enough sugar and cream can make anything taste good).   No, the real test of a coffee house is how their black, regular drip tastes.    I like it complex, rich, and nutty.     How disappointing that Lola's regular drip is weak, watery, and tasteless.     Pastries are great, though.     Ambience is cool...though it's echo-y and a little loud if you want to carry on a conversation.     Step up the coffee and I'll be back
Wow.  One of the best breakfast places in Vegas?  Nothing special here: ambiance is dull - celebrity photos of "D" listers; regular diner food which was OK and coffee not notable.  I don't get it.
First, I have to say, that is one of the best acai bowls I have ever had.  The store is very nicely decorated and has a nice vibe.  The food and atmosphere are not the issue here.As other reviewers have said, the customer service is lacking.  I ordered one Vitality Bowl this morning.  From when I walked in the door, to when I left with my food, took nearly 40 minutes. There were only 3 people in front of me when I ordered, and they got juice.  This should be a fast casual restaurant, like a Jamba Juice or Chipotle.  I do not understand how it can take so long to make a few items. Also, their menu is absurd.  They have it displayed on two 50 or 60" TVs and I can hardly read anything on there because there is so much text.  I think they need to go the In N Out route and simplify the menu.  Maybe that will improve their productivity.I was absolutely shocked to see that this is a large franchise.  The way this store is being run, I thought for sure this was a small independent company.
I don't know if they gave us the flavor-less version because we are not Korean. But we had soon doo boo and dwenjang chigae and they were so-so at best. I had to add salt, gochu powder and gochujeon to mine to give it a little flavor. The owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews. The dining area was cramped and uninviting. I will definitely find another Korean place to go to in the future.
I am giving them two because I knew how bad it was going to be. It you have ever had real Italian food or lived on the East Coast, you know better than to fall for those stupid commercials with the 12 Italian family members shouting across the table to one another while enjoying an Olive Garden meal. This is not possible, First of all, bread sticks are not bread at all. So, my friend had a birthday and this was his choice and though I tried to talk him into ANY other place, here we ended  up. First of all a note to the chef; LAY OFF THE SALT, FELLA!The salad, SALTY. The pasta sauces, SALTY. The dressings, SALTY. Soup: SALTY.Nothing worth mentioning, we tried several items and were disappointed, But we had breadsticks, so why worry?They funny thing is they had wings and they were cooked to perfection. Of course then they put spicy tomato sauce and hot oil on top. Hopefully my blood pressure will return to normal before my friends next birthday...The two stars are for service because he did bring the food.
Mad Mexican is really all over the board as a restaurant. Their salsas are great. Tacos are very good, but for the price it's a ripoff. Add in the fact that the guacamole is $8 and miniscule, you find yourself with a place to skip. Lots of options in Toronto for food; no need to get short changed for your money.
I got a negative reaction after eating their food because the menu hadn't stated all the ingredients in their food. on top of that, my meal tasted sour. They get an extra star because the spring rolls were tasty. I probably won't return.
Not sure what they're going for here.  Looks like a night club, tables all have a mix match of goodwill type chairs.  Large tanks on the wall with some impressive live fish and shellfish.   Too bad it's dark and not displayed as it could be.Seafood dishes are ok, but found I was picking at little bits if lobster and crab, to get it out of the shells.  Just overcooked and over battered.
Why I wound up staying here aside (valet lost our car keys!), I suppose I do have to admit that the rooms are 3 stars (er, the new ones at least). We had a nice view of the Strip (including the Bellagio fountains). Good comfy beds. Decent bathroom (though, no tub, just a shower). The decor was decent too. No robes, no minibar. But for a place to rest your head at night in Sin City, you could do way worse. And it's a pretty good central location too.However, there isn't much else to do at the Flamingo. There's a couple of ok shows, but it ends there. The restaurant options are sucky. Room service is no more than 2 stars. The stores are sucky. Etc.So for the right price, it's a good room, but not much else.And then, of course, there's the issue that the valet lost our car keys. Yep, lost our car keys. What are the friggin' odds of that happening? Either way, can't say I would recommend valeting your car here. Why take that gamble?I do have to admit, though, that I like their pool. Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. It's free for locals (after a certain time). And the adult only pool is pretty good too.
I guess I am just not a fan of this "new age" style of theater. Really all you are getting for the extra charge is a bigger seat which isn't even all that great. Also, parking right around the theater is not as good as it was in the old location. But mainly I do not understand using up so much space for a liquor and coffee bar when you are a five minute walk from much better options both inside and outside of the mall. Bottom line: There are better "premium" theaters in Scottsdale so if you can travel, I suggest you do. For locals, the Cine Capri in Tempe is a much easier experience and you don't have to shell out $40 on tickets and drinks for two people.
Definitely not impressed. The first time I went in the girl was rude and did a horrible job. I called and complained and they were super nice and great about getting me back in to get them fixed. But while I was getting them fixed the girl who messed them up just kept hovering over us the whole time. It was super awkward. Figured I would give them the benefit of a doubt and try again, but it's just not quality work. I went last week to get a mani pedi and by the third day after, I had 6 nails chipped off. Not worth going back to get them fixed again.
We got a good price and the Camry we had ran beautifully.  So why two stars?  The agent tried to charge us almost a $100 more than our reservation was for.  Once that was corrected, he showed me the car.  It needed washing and vacuuming.  He washed and vacuumed it.  It was dripping wet - hadn't been dried.  We inspected the car, noting the one significant scratch, and went on our way.  About a half our down the road, we noticed the smell of cigarette smoke.  It became obvious that someone had smoked in the car and that the company had done nothing to mitigate that.  I also noticed that the gas gauge was on 3/4, not full.  Guess I need to check that rather than trust that a company like Enterprise would fill the tank or note it on the rental agreement.  They did neither.  The next day, we drove west in the morning, meaning the sun was shining on the rear of the car.  The inside of the back window was so covered with dirt, grime, and film that it was impossible to see out the back in the rearview mirror.  Finally, one of the features of the car I found while playing with the controls was the tire pressure monitor.  According to the monitor the pressures were 36 (LR), 38 (RR), 39 (RF) and 40 (LF).  Being that out of balance and that overinflated indicates a potential safety problem to me.  Obviously, Enterprise does not check tire inflation.  Again, the car was otherwise excellent, we were finally charged what we were supposed to be charged, and had an excellent 10 day trip.  I would go back here, but would be a real pain in the butt about checking our the car including making them check tire pressure before I got in.
There so many falafel plate places in this town, I decided to try this one since it has good reviews. I have no clue why. I am so unimpressed. I ordered the falafel plate with taboulleh, baba ghanouj, and rice and salad. Nothing tasted authentic, the rice was a bit lumpy and not fresh tasting. The falafel's were probably the best thing in this combo, and they were mediocre at best. Taboulleh was a bit soggy and nowhere near lemony enough. Baba G was not smoky, just bland. I'm pretty disappointed, although I do think for something so simple... I have eaten at so many places that screw this meal up. Add this to that list.The prices are reasonable,and the service is decent. But the food certainly doesn't warrant any reason to return. Cest la vie, Parsley...
For a new location it is very lacking in essentials.  I've been there twice and both times it was ridiculously hot.  There was also a lot of tiny flies everywhere. If they weren't flying around our table, they were sitting on the walls.  It is difficult to enjoy your food when you're concentrating on flies and the heat factor.
Had high hopes for this place, but I was totally let down. First off, got a pitcher of sangria for $50 that was well overpriced. Next ordered about $120 worth of sushi and was so small I fit it all in one frame. Their sushi orders are only one piece instead of 2. It honestly wasn't that good. Kinda bland. I will totally tell people to avoid this Disneyland style price rape.
My Fiancée and her family had booked 3 suites and a room at the Elara Hilton, an expensive and extravagant treat as my Fiancée and I were in town to get married.Surprised to see that upon our arrival at the Elara, there had been a flood affecting the main guest elevators and condemning them to being out of action. The staff made provisions and employed the service elevators for guests, for which on our arrival there was a horrendous queue to use. Still, this couldn't be helped as there was a fault.My now wife went to the desk, concerned the next day to ask how long the elevators were likely to be out of action, and if they were out of action on our wedding day, could some provision be made to be escorted in the service elevator so that it was occupied (for one journey only) only by the bridal party, to avoid being crammed in like we were on our initial use of the elevators, to avoid anyone trampling on her wedding dress. A reasonable request, one might think.To be responded by the staff on the desk that "they would not hold an elevator even for the POTUS" was down right rude and disrespectful, and certainly not the attitude one would expect from a HILTON.This was the first in a line of poor customer service encounters that both myself and my wife encountered during our stay at the Elara.Our room was not turned around despite having the sign set to "please make up" and we were not supplied clean towels or toilet roll for multiple days until we had to request them.The rooms were of course magnificent, as we had 3 suites between us these we're amazing and worth the treat to ourselves, but what should have been a magnificent week at a prestigious hotel such as the Elara during our wedding getaway will forever be marred with the poor customer service of the staff.Luckily the guest elevators were working again by the time of our wedding, at least to the 3rd floor, from which we could take a secondary elevator, or escalators to the 2nd (lobby) or 1st (valet). As one final kick in the teeth as we left however, the escalators also decided to give-up-the-ghost and left us cramming into the only 1-3 floor elevator with all of our luggage at the end of the stay.Given the circumstances the staff could have handled themselves a lot better and made the bad situation of mechanical failures a little more palatable to us as we were patient customers, instead they decided to be hostile and arrogant. Poor Form.Would not recommend.
I frequent HK cafes quite often, and my first impression of this place is that it is quite expensive in comparison to similar places around the area. I like how spacious the restaurant is, and how there is a lot of variety of dishes. They also have an ambiance with their romantic 2 set dinner specials catering towards a cute date night.Each dish order comes with either Russian Borsche/Cream Soup with dinner rolls. Bread is rarely served these days so it was a pleasant surprise! Also there is a tea to drink (the lemon tea is really bitter) as well as dessert (lychee jelly with condensed milk) Linguini Bolognese (~$8) - i like how they changed it up from spaghetti. Generous portion of cheddar.Chicken Sizzling Steak (~$15)-  served with veggies and onions. I've had better though.Probably won't come back unless it's for afternoon tea. It's overpriced!
Walking up to Sage Bar, we were unsure if we had come to the correct restaurant.  It's definitely more "bar" than "Vietnamese."  We double-checked the address on the Groupon (Rural & Chandler) and then dove into three entrees and an appetizer.  My brother in law saw the white servers and the non-Vietnamese atmosphere and adeptly ordered a burger.  I shared a pho bo and stir fry beef dish with rice.  Pho Bo was okay.  The broth was very sweet in the Southern Viet style.  Beef slices were neither plentiful or scarce.  I don't usually eat that many noodles, but I found the serving to be skimpy.  They used the pho cut of beef (eye of round) in the stir fry which was very strange.  It was served with a sweet soy sauce concoction and we asked for nuoc cham (fish dipping sauce) and we were given a viscous and strangely sweet sauce.  I've never seen a Vietnamese person serve such a thing.  Plus they added an extra charge on the bill for the sauce, wtf.The tofu appetizer was overpriced and not worth it.  I'm gonna have to buy a $1.30 box of tofu from Lee Lee to erase that dish from my memory.I'm not sure what atmosphere the owners are going for.  This place gives me a weird feeling in my tummy.  Flat screens everywhere for sports fans.  Seems like if you're a single guy who enjoys Americanized/fusion food and often dines alone then this is the place for you.  If you''re looking for a gastronomic experience you will be underwhelmed.I won't be coming back to Sage for any Viet food.  If I ever return, I'll stick to the American foods on the menu.  Hopefully they won't charge me extra if I want some ketchup.
The Wynn usually never disappoints but Charlie's has very mediocre food. Super disappointed! Bring back Zoozacrackers. That food was great. The only good part was a view of the wonderful new sports book.
To be honest the food was pretty good. I got the chorizo stuffed dates, which was the best thing I had tonight. For my entree I got the wagyu burger, which was overall pretty good. However this is the point at which their rating goes down. The wagyu burger is advertised as coming with a "golden brioche bun", but the bun we received looked like the average bun you get at Walmart for a picnic; thin, flat and crumbling. We asked the waitress if there was some mistake but she confirmed that, indeed the bun we received was the "golden brioche bun". Either the waitress was mistaken, or this restaurant does not know what a brioche bun is. I guess it's also possible that I have no idea what a brioche bun should look like. I uploaded a photo of the bun if you guys want to see for yourself.
All the kimchi and side dishes are made with a ton of sugar. No gochujang. The meat is sliced very thin and for good pork belly you do not want thin. This is not authentic korean, if you want authentic go elsewhere, if you want to fill up on all you can eat meat and only meat then go here. You get what you pay for.
I own a 2013 Ford Fusion, purchased from Berge Ford.  The two times I've had it serviced at this location have both been poor experiences.  This instance specifically was very disappointing. I contacted the salesman who sold me the car (Brenden, who did an amazing job and continues to be extremely helpful to me by the way) and he helped schedule an appointment with Joey in Booth 1.  Joey was very nice and helpful with the entire process.  The oil was changed and I received my car in a timely manner.  It wasn't until I had driven around to the other side of the dealership to say goodbye to Brenden and thank him for his service did Brenden notice that there was a fairly large scratch in the side of the car.  This scratch was not present when I dropped the car off.  I chose to wait until today (12/1) to make a statement to make sure that the experience was reported to a manager.  I was extremely disappointed with the quality of service coming out of the service department at this dealership.  In comparison to the service I received from the salesmen and finance department during my purchase one would assume that that same quality would come from other departments of the dealership.  It is apparent that is not true. I will not be returning to Berge Ford to have my vehicle serviced, nor will I recommend anyone visit that location for service.
The Ritz may be a 5-star hotel, but DEQ is not the place to go for a 5-star high tea experience.There was a nice selection of teas, and the food was good. Quite good, but nothing I was really impressed by. My favourite part was actually the passionfruit cake that was provided as a birthday treat. The coldness of the cake added a refreshing texture that made it taste just perfect. I would go again for that cake, but the food in the high tea set was only average good.The service was what left me unsatisfied. The servers were polite, but we had slight troubles grabbing their attention. A spoon was not provided to eat the panna cotta, and we were told to use the same spoon we used to stir our tea. It wasn't a problem but I found it strange, especially for such a nice place. Here's my biggest irk, and the reason I'm taking away a star. We asked to have our leftovers packed up, and we were given only a takeout box. For some reason, other customers were given fancy bags for their leftovers. We weren't even given a plastic bag, and left awkwardly holding onto a takeout box. I guess we could have asked for a bag, but we didn't want to bother trying to get a server's attention for something that should be standard. In short, food was good but there are better options for a better price. Service needs improvement. And say it's your birthday so you get a nice cake.
I thought it was going to be really amazing here but ....not really.1. I got a perm and my curls are not lasting very long it's been a month and most of the curls are gone. 2. my scalp was hurting a lot after the perm. I've gotten perms before and it was the first time it actually hurt. 3. the hair cut itself was just so so i brought photos but were not very helpful... I recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a Japanese style.
The bar looked great and they had some rocking live music but it was too packed to get in to so we had to take a seat in the restaurant. The decor was nice and it was great that the doors opened up on to the patio. They should crack down on smokers right outside though because the smoke blowing in is like eating at a smokers house--gross! The drinks were ok. Nothing special and they featured a big like up of slushy drinks. I was hoping for a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned but they were not to be found. My friend ordered off menu for a whisky sour but it came in a mason jar and looked radioactive yellow. I had a sangria which was good and a Hendricks with tonic (hard to mess that up). The food was unimpressive. The thin crust pizza was disappointing with a soggy crust and light on the toppings. The risotto balls were dry and tasteless rather than the delicious cheesy molten goo I was hoping for and even the flavourful tomato sauce with chorizo and capers couldn't revive it. The only good thing about the food was how fast it came out.The service was good and our server was friendly and accommodating.
The reason that I did not make this rating one star is because they have several specialties which I did not try. We went and only had sushi, which was enough to scare us away. Very poor quality in both the rolls and sashimi. It looked like they did very well with the hibachi grills, but I would not recommend the sushi to anyone.On the plus side, the atmosphere and decorations were very nice and the server was very helpful.
I visited on Sunday morning.  The drive thru was busy, so I went inside the store.  Not busy there, but still waited a very long time to get my coffee.  It tasted horrible, so I waited again to return it.  The staffing looked sufficient, they just didn't know what they were doing & didn't care.  Poor customer service, depressing vibe, just not worth it.  I will not return to this store & am trying to break my Starbucks habit in general.
Supper disappointed by " jetlag therapy " + scalp massage as an extra service . The premise itself is super nice , clean , stuffs super polite is the only reason why I gave 2 stars and not minus .The therapy itself was a waste of time . Over 300$ for a super poor therapy really . The therapist didn't really knew what she was doing , she didn't apply any pressure on the points , I asked her to use  more pressure but didn't help though . She was just going back around using same movement for literally 1 hour .The purpose of this therapy it was to have back , neck and shoulders massage mostly , she didn't touch my neck or shoulders , but instead she massaged my front chest for 20 min with same rotating movement .  The scalp massage was a JOKE . I get a 10times  better one with any hair wash in a cheap hair shop . She just managed to put me oil in the hair and that was it . Scalp is just the front part and that was it . I would doubt she have a massage qualification because honestly she didn't knew what she was doing . Supposed to be a 90 minute therapy ; but was a 70 min . I feel it was rip off and didn't worth the time even if it was free .
Meh is right. We are trying all the Mexican spots around us and this one was a little too greasy for me. I will say it was probably the best service we have had at a Mexican restaurant so keep that up!
It is an ok restaurant and bar. Since I was traveling alone I sat at the bar. Service was not that great but the food was good. One thing was that they ran out some stuff so I had limited choices (Whole two sections were gone)
Stayed here for 1 night while in Charlotte on business:Pros:- Cool building, brand new- Nicely furnished- Good bar set up- Easy parking (valet or parking deck next door)- Convenient to Uptown restaurants/bars (but may border on dangerous area)Cons:- Borderline customer service from the front desk- Sketchy areaI was really looking forward to staying here due to its location and also that it had a unique design.  Upon checking in I was told that due to being fully booked I had been "downgraded" to a room with 2 queen beds vs. a room with a king bed that I had reserved a month prior.  Not the end of the world, but the message could have delivered better and they could have offered something in return (a drink at the bar would have been a nice gesture).  Other interactions with the front desk were just okay.  They could use some customer service training.  So minus 1 star there.Minus 2 stars for the location.  There is a transit station across the street and I noticed a lot of people loitering.  No big deal in and of itself.  Charlotte is a big city.  However some people may not be comfortable walking through that area.  But from my walk (in daylight) from the hotel to the Uptown restaurant area, I passed at least 6 ARMED security guards outside various business within 2 blocks.  Once I reached a certain point in Uptown, no more security guards.  Hmmmmmmm.  Upon returning, l had to walk past a potential police situation to get to the hotel.  It was going down less than 50 ft. from the hotel lobby.  Basically some teenage (15-18 years old) kids were yelling and trying to intimidate people on the sidewalk.  Cops showed up, 6 of them - THANK YOU MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE.  The cops were very calm as the punks tried to escalate the situation.  People going in and out of the hotel were very uncomfortable and it was a fairly volatile situation for 15 minutes or so.  Obviously the hotel has no control over what goes on in the streets around them, so it's not their fault but...Bottom line is you will more than likely be totally safe if you don't walk alone at night around the hotel...typical big city advice.  However, there are a lot of other hotels in different parts of Uptown that are safer and where I wouldn't think twice about walking around by myself at night.  And that's where I'll be staying in the future.
The food is just about ok and I don't really understand why the portions are so small. I've  tasted better mediterranean food in and around Charlotte. This place doesn't stand a chance in front of any other mediterranean places.For the portions their serve, I feel it is over priced. The ambience is nothing exceptional. It is a usual takeway/quick eat in kind of dining setting, which works well for regular dinners/
The management must have changed because the flavors and care they used to take in each dish is nothing like when we first used to go. I prefer to go to Indian in Scottsdale or in Peoria instead. Very unimpressed. Will not return anymore.
I don't understand why this place is so hype other than the interior decoration. It's just an overpriced fast food. I don't dislike fast food.  I just don't find anything special about this place but the high price.
Good food, terrible customer service.  For me customer service plays a huge role in every dining experience.  So the attitude of the employees throws me off.
Spent a little over $45 on 2 boxes of wings (5 lb.) and only got a little over a tablespoon of Ranch dressing (dip). I think this place is a rip off........ But, the wings were tasty.
I honestly can't believe that McMahon has gotten 4 stars when it honestly looks like it is about to crumble to the ground.  Is this really the best that a world-class city like Calgary can do?  I grew up with Taylor Field (ie. Mosaic Stadium) - it's a sad state of affairs when Saskatchewan is ahead of Alberta in the infrastructure game.  Or Edmonton for that matter when you compare Commonwealth Stadium to McMahon.Why I dislike coming here (and this has nothing to do with the general atmosphere at a Stamps game...which are usually pretty fun):- Limited to no parking at the stadium itself (Pro: Easy access to the C-Train), and I have no idea how one would ever get a parking or tailgating spot.  If you do drive, it is a gong show getting to or from the general area during sporting events.- Chairs with no backs.  Seriously, it's 2013 - I'm sure we could spend a little money getting proper chairs that aren't wooden backless benches.- Limited space in the concourses.  I went to the Stamps/Riders game this summer - it was an absolute nightmare trying to get from your seats to get drinks or to the washroom.  I can only imagine what would happen if, God forbid, there was ever an emergency during a game.  This lack of space is especially evident at half-time, where line-ups for food and booze are very long.  Service for drinks is VERY slow!- Washrooms - I will give them a point for at least having decent washrooms that are generally clean.- Stairs - If you ever have the misfortune of sitting in the cheap seats amongst the riffraff that tends to frequent Stamps games, not only can you expect to leave with a sore back and bum, but also expect to fear for your life walking up and down slippery metal stairs.All in all, McMahon has limited redeeming features.  Time to tear it down and start over again.
Food is okay, but very bland for Thai food. I've had the Panang curry and pad Thai. Both were small portion sizes for the cost. I got the pad Thai to go and it smelled fishy when I opened it up, plus it was almost dry from not enough sauce (luckily I had extra pad Thai sauce in the fridge). Service was good, but there are better Thai restaurants in the area that have better fotos for a similar price.
Well, ordered pizza with black olives and pineapple. Came with black olives and pepperoni. Since I am a vegetarian that won't work. The salad was OK and cheesecake ok. Nothing special. Very sad excuse for a Streets of NY.
This place is good for a "quick fix" sushi/schezuan meal. It's not pricey however don't expect great service or getting what you've actually ordered. I have been several times and the service seems to be getting worse and worse. Some things that are on the menu, they don't even serve!! You would usually expect the staff to tell you what was available and what was not, but it's not a the case here. It's a guessing game.I'll be honest with you, the bathrooms are not a very pretty sight. At all. Kind of makes your stomach turn to be quite frank. If the resto's bathroom is that dirty, do you really want to imagine the kitchen??Like i said, for a quick fix, if you aren't scared of a nasty bathroom, it's fine; "fine" being the key word.
I've been to numerous Chatime locations, and this one is definitely the slowest, but as other Yelpers have mentioned it could be that the staff are still new.  My main concern is that all the drinks seem to be more diluted.  They're starting to taste quite bland and you can only taste the sweetness from the flavoured powder or flavoured syrup and only with a slight hint of tea.   If you watch the staff making your drink, you'll notice they'll start filling half of the cocktail shakers from one of the drink dispensers labeled as "ICE WATER".   So I'm not quite sure, how much tea actually goes into the bubble tea anymore. Maybe they're trying hard to stretch out the tea and sell more drinks made with more water, since water is a lot cheaper than tea.
No free intenet at a hotel of this caliber??? Now I know why I choose Hilton...I typically stay at Hilton Hotels when travelling for work as I like taking advantage of my Honors rewards.  When I learned that a recent meeting I would be attending would be taking place at a Marriott I was a bit disappointed as I have been Hilton-spoiled.  I decided to check in early and called to ask about their policy on early check in.  I was told that even though it was still a bit early in the morning that I could still check and I was pleasantly surprised I didn't get any pushback on this.  When I arrived a short time later I approached the check in desk and explained I was checking in early for my reservation for that night.  The front desk clerk had either pulled an all nighter or just wasn't very bright as she kept asking me how my stay was and referring to my check out.  I had to interrupt a few times and re-explain that I was checking in.  When she finally realized she processed my form of payment and got me my keys, etc.  I had made sure when placing my reservation they had my Marriott Rewards # on file as well.  Even though I don't stay at Marriott properties often, I wanted to ensure I credited my account for future purposes.  After she finished my check in, I proceeded to ask her where the meeting rooms for this hotel were as it was my first time here and I wasn't familiar with the property.  I don't think she understood again what I was asking as she walked around to the front of the check in desk to point out where the elevators to the rooms were.  Again, I had to clarify I was asking about the meeting/conference rooms, not my actual room.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the room and furnishings.  As I tried to log in and work off my laptop, much to my dismay, I found out that there is only free wi-fi if you are a Gold Marriott Rewards member or above.  I was shocked as Hilton properties don't put this stipulation on any of its guests, regardless of their Honors level.  As it was a work visit I didn't give it much thought as it would be expensed, but had I been staying here for personal reasons, I would have been livid at having to pay $9.95 plus taxes/fees per day for Internet.  Not that I don't have $10 to spare, but for the sheer principle.  This wasn't a cheap hotel.  The meeting facilities were spacious and accomodating.  My company had managed to reserve every room for the various meetings and breakout sessions that were occurring.  The quality of the food prepared by their banquet facilities was also pretty good for a mass production deal.  Another issue I experienced was that two weeks after my stay, I noticed I had not been credited for my stay through the Marriott Rewards program.  Odd I thought as they had the number upon reservation and check in.  I had to submit my receipt to them again in order to have it credited to my account.  My overall rating for this property was based mainly on the lack of customer service.  I guess I am spoiled by how much Hilton values their guests, which really shouldn't be a feat given that you are a paying guest.
We wen't to this place last night for dinner. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. We looked online at the menu before we went over to get an idea of what we would order. We ordered a Canadian Burger, a Meat & Potato burger, a poutine, mac & cheese and fried pickles. We spent about 50 dollars but wanted to try a bit of everything. First off the burgers were so disappointing. The Meat & potato burger was supposed to have  a crisp potato patty on it with gravy. Instead i got runny mashed potatoes mixed with gravy slopped on the burger. The Canadian burger should have had pea-meal bacon on it and from the description and photo online, several slices. When we received the burger it had one small slice and a glob of grainy mustard on it. This was quite sad since the actual meat of the burger and the bun are very tasty. The poutine we ordered was terrible. The fries were terribly burnt and the box was only half full. There was hardly any gravy on it. We threw most of it out in the trash. The mac & cheese was tasteless and was pretty much just warm cream poured over noodles. The fried pickles were very good. Over all, the meat of the burger and the bun were good, not great. WE won't return.
Red Lobsters around the country have gone through a recent renovation of both their decor and their menus that you may have missed. The move has made the restaurant into more of an upscale offering, with concordant higher prices. It is the act of offering that is now more upscale, however, and not necessarily what is offered to you.The change results in an additional menu section where you can choose any of a selection of fresh fish and then choose how you want it cooked (oven, pan or broil). Then you get a couple of their standard sides for $13-20. The rest of the menu, other than the big crustaceans, is cheaper than this. Its not a bad deal if the fish is good and fresh and then cooked skillfully. In my limited recent experience, (one recent trip to this location and two recent trips to other Red Lobsters) their cooking is hit or miss. I was very happy with my broiled salmon in terms of size, flavor and doneness. Others have been less enthusiastic, with classic fish complaints (size/strong smell/consistency). Don't worry, they still have their stupendous cheddar biscuits and the coconut fried shrimp with rum sauce that are even better. These shrimp are so good, I think of them as the crab rangoons of the Red Lobster and get them every time.The rest is pretty much the same, but with slightly different (less?) stuff on the walls and probably higher prices than you may remember. They have a decent variety of beers and booze and a chain restaurant's expected  bevy of froofy drinks. But is it worth it? If you go for one of the shrimp or lobster fests, or you have a coupon or gift card to soften the blow, its definitely worth it. I am a pretty frugal guy, and even though I love fish, there are many places I would rather spend this kind of money at, like Yellowfin. If somebody spruces up Seaboat into a nice take a date joint though, its over.
Went to Sugar Bowl for dinner & ice cream. We had a cheeseburger & milk shakes (that DIDN'T come with French Fries OR whipped Cream; who does that!) The burger was completely tasteless... Certainly NOT grilled; watery. Toppings were fresh & delicious however. The decor is definitely vintage gone bad! Johnny Rockets does a better job with better tasting food & ENERGY! Overall, Sugar Bowl is cute, but needs a new Chef, uniforms for their staff (yoga pants are unprofessional), music & life breathed back into this tired restaurant that's seen better days.
First, I would like to thank the staff for a wonderful post event concession. Everyone was helpful and took very good care of our large group. Next, I am sure we will not return to this establishment for the following reason. When it was time to pay the piper, my debit card could not be found. The bartenders and Charlie (owner) gave great effort for 30 min to try and find my card. No worry, If not found by the next day I will cancel the card. Said owner Charlie "don't worry about the tab, I will call you tomorrow and let you know whether or not we found it. I will just comp this tab". Cool, things happen. So next day comes and no call so I call them. They said card was not found, ok. Next day bank shows pending charge of $46.80 and says card was swiped Sat at 6:40pm (an hour and half after I had left). I called again thinking great they found my card, no, they said that is the amount they used to hold my tab open thus to wait and it will drop off. Card has not been found. Same evening I receive a phone call from the organization manager that booked El Santo saying some girl was just givin my card and the receipt from saturday afternoon. She didn't know me or how to reach me so she drove it to the address of the event sponsor. Now today my card shows the bill of $39.00 posted and the tip they chose to give themselves in the amount of $7.80 and yet Charlie claims still that my card has not been found and no one has swiped. F********g bold face LIAR
Returned there again to give it another shot.   Inattentive wait staff and very slow service sort of highlighted this visit.  The food was okay but to watch ticked off people sitting around waiting for their food and drinks didn't create much of an atmosphere.  Lunch crowd was very light and still the service was pretty slow.
I have been to 168 Sushi Buffet several times and most recently a few weeks ago. The restaurant is a standard iPad order setup as many other AYCE Sushi places, however they added a buffet bar for items like the salads, desserts and also where you get your wasabi.  I am not a big fan of the mix of iPad and buffet bar, and would rather have everything ordered by iPad and delivered to the table.  This restaurant has gone downhill a bit over the past couple years and there is also a lot of other options in the AYCE Sushi market right now.
Yikes. After quite a nice meal here two years ago, I organized a brunch for my mommy group and the service was really pretty bad:/We had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.When the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. I do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.
Driest pizza we've ever had on both their gluten free & regular crusts, & we consume ALOT of pizza. Premixed 'craft' cocktails, !!! Caesar slams, we asked if it was super anchoviey, waitress 'no', reality yes.... the place looks so great & inviting, though uber disappointing.
I have not  been in here for awhile but they have remodeled the whole thing. I got a cheese steak sub and the steak was sorta checked too long. Also for 9.00 I would expect a lot more meat, for that price I will stick with Penn Station or Jersey Mikes.
I love Hobby Lobby stores but this one is slipping downhill. Aside from it being messy and having a lot of broken items here and there, the bathrooms are disgusting. The floors in and around look like they haven't been cleaned with effort in a long time. There was toilet paper and toilet seat covers everywhere. I understand customers do all of these things but staff should be about and continually checking the bathrooms. I don't see the need to go to this location when there are others that are hopefully cleaner.
Really austere, creepy interior. It's all white and chrome and too OPEN - gives me a weird vibe. The girl working there was really nice and came right out from behind the counter to offer us samples of flavours. BUT they had hardly any flavour choices I'd want (coconut, pistachio, hazelnut, pomegranate all sound gross). I went with typical salted caramel and vanilla. They had a lot of different toppings I haven't seen at the other yogurt places I've tried (like whole Hostess Zingers and donuts?!) but a lot of the bars weren't chunked up so you couldn't really mix them into the yogurt, just kind of add it to your lot. Overall, another typical yogurt place that's trying to be a little too high-class for what it is.
Slow slow slowIt's mostly Sysco and Shamrock Service food, ya know flash frozen then thrown in a deep fryer, then some 'specials' but they're competing for the lunch business of Vermont Sandwich Company next door.During the day and weekends you have the 'regular' Off Track Betting clients and evenings it's so hard to find a freaking parking spot. It's 'Cheers' of East Scottsdale, all locals and hard to break into their 'clique'. Last Friday their toilets were backed up and no one could use them (had to go over next door to use their competitors, who were sympathetic & friendly), I thought as a health code violation you had to close your doors over this.But if you only have one hour for lunch and plan to go, be prepared in a slow slow afternoon return to work.
I've been here a couple of times but I still don't see all of the hype, the cupcakes are just okay. On my 1st visit I had a red velvet cupcake, which was not good at all. The frosting only made it worse. Once you've had red velvet done right, there's no going back. This is just another example of a failed attempt at red velvet since it's become one of the popular kids in the dessert world.On my second visit I had the Pink Cadillac, which started out good but then a few more bites became too much. Yes the cupcakes are big but the amount of frosting is unbearable. I will not risk visiting again unless I feel the urge of setting my money on fire.
Don't we all hate to order food  " to go" and to discover while already at home that they missed something from your order?  Driving back there is not worth at this time ....
I went with my sister in law before the ballet on December 18th. When you walk in, it smells like stale cigarettes which is odd since you can't smoke inside. So we sit down at the bar and the bartender looks at us and practically rolls his eyes. I've been in f&b long enough to know he was thinking, "oh great. They're young." We order our drinks and he makes them then immediately gives us our tab and doesn't Check on us or even look at us again. It wasn't busy and other people were being tended to, so I was pretty offended. We intended on staying for a while and I've rarely encountered a golf bartender who doesn't Check build. We were going g to eat but the smell alone was too much. Fortunately, a cute little blonde wAitress was really sweet and ended up closing us out.
Every single dish is super salty. Just a very below average dim sum place. The standards just aren't there. Food isn't too greasy though, so there's that. A lot of the dishes weren't even decent. Only good "dish" was the egg tarts (super silky filling and super buttery crust), although that's probably sourced from elsewhere, not made in-house. Would not recommend this dim sum place.
Kind of surprised by amount of good reviews. We were on that side of town and wanted to get something sweet. Happen to see this place in a sketchy corner, but my boyfriend suggested we just go in and try it. It was very small inside, I believe there were 2-3 small tables with foldable chairs, and the menu was creative looking but "different"...they had random food choices from greek salads, elote's, to being a juice bar...We just weren't too positive on how this place was creating all of this fresh food and drinks with one adult worker and 2 kids walking back and forth behind counter and partially helping the adult with the orders. The adult also spoke limited English, so we ended up just getting a banana split, handed it to us in a meal size styrofoam container, nothing like the picture we saw on their site, it was a good regular banana split, of course because its ice cream.. but definitely not worth $7...Sonic makes bigger and better for cheaper. The people before us ordered a drink that had scooped in fruit with juice, a salad, which looked like a flat, quick, put-together salad with pieces of chicken and some veggies... anyway, that was our experience, nothing worth us raving about to anyone and may not go back. Maybe there isn't too many places to choose from around that area. I gave it 2 stars because it states a "meh. I've experienced better".
Old hotel, never enjoyed staying there.  Far too much smoke.  I stayed there quite a few times for business trips in my last job.  The events were usually held at other hotels that were already full, so the Flamingo was the overflow hotel used.  This hotel was one of my least favorite to stay in.  I don't think I'll be going back.  When I do come to Vegas for something, I try to stay at hotels off the strip.  I vastly prefer Red Rocks and Henderson and Green Valley even though they're quite a ways away.
Was a spur of the moment decision to see this, they had some "VIP" seats left for same day and they gave us a bit of a discount (matching some online coupons that we didn't possess at the time). VIP seats are assigned and the first 10 or so rows, the rest are first come first serve. First, an "8:30" show that we were told to arrive by 8:20 for to be seated. At 8:50, as we were on our 30th minute of being crammed together with a couple hundred of our new closest friends in the undersized bar/waiting area, I wasn't feeling too VIPish, and my mood was pre-soured.Once finally allowed into the theatre, it was like "wow". They clearly spared no expense in constructing this modern masterpiece that could easily make Shakesphere feel at home. Wait, no, sorry got confused. I could replicate the entire theatre, seats, stage, and all, with a $100 Home Depot gift card. It clearly was shoehorned into a spare room. Maybe that was the point, but as others have said, the entire seating area is at the same level, so even with decent VIP 5th row seats it was hard to see everything, back of the theatre to me would be unwatchable.The show itself was fairly entertaining. Not memorable but not bad. The performers were enthusiastic.I'd say worth it if you can get decent seats at a discount and drink ahead of time so you aren't perturbed by the shortcomings of the theatre and process to get in, and zombies are your thing.For our performance there wasn't any racial jokes as others have said, and certainly nothing offensive for an adult crowd in Vegas.
I only rated it two stars because I have no idea how the food is since they only deliver to businesses with orders in excess of $40. I don't think this qualifies a business to advertise delivery services on Yelp, they're a carry out or dine-in establishment for the average consumer. Due to the poor business model and my personal eating habits, It's pretty likely that I will never end up spending any money here. And that sucks, as I like to support local when I can. I will mention that the guy who answered the phone was nice. He seemed genuinely apologetic about the owners crap business model. That's the only positive I have for this place, thus far. His professionalism earned these guys the second star.
My wife and I were there for a late lunch today.  My wife ordered a salad with blackened chicken.  The first attempt came with uncooked chicken.  They did remove and replaced it with a properly cooked chicken.  By the time it arrived I had completed my burger.  Which was very good.  I was disappointed that we were not compensated at all for the inconvenience.  We won,t be coming back.
This yours truly restaurant has surely seen it day come and go. The physical building itself is worn pretty badly and the restaurant could stand too close for a week or so and do a thorough deep cleaning. Varnish peeling of woods, the grout in the floor is filthy and it was actually pretty greasy if you had wet shoes you would slip slide around and it didn't seem very safe.I don't know what it is about this particular location versus the location and Mentor. The Mentor location seems to be a little bit cleaner well cap. Could do to a holly volume of traffic but a high volume of traffic should also lend itself to a high volume of repair in cleaning. The food itself was neither remarkable nor bad. It was sustenance, plain and simple.  locate rest area he would stop and eat at and then completely forget about it one hour later.I'm pretty sure it's not a chain, but the location. Clean this place up, we can work into the restaurant and you'll be ok
I have been to Erin's a few times.  Rhonda always suggests it and I say no.  After about a year between visits I forgot how bad it was and said yes.  The food is not awful, it is greasy and low in flavor.  The prices are high.  Rhonda had the fried bluegills and they were greasy and left a film in your mouth.  I had a couple of bites and wished I hadn't.  It took a few hours before the film and taste went away.I had Mediterranean pasta with chicken.  I know, you don't go to a Irish Pub for pasta.  I thought it would be easy for them to make but I was wrong.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was lacking flavor.  I thought having kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes would make it flavorful but I was wrong.Hopefully this review will remind me not to go back and drop $60 on food I don't like.
Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.
Too salty!!!!!   I was warned about this from a friend who had dined there, but had heard other fabulous reviews, so wanted to try it for myself.The bread board entree was good, but did not include any preserves as described in the menu (and was over-priced).I ordered the corn carbonera, a pasta dish.   None of us could eat it, it was way too salty AND too peppery.My daughter had the veggie burger...nothing special and the side salad was unbelievably SALTY.   Salty lettuce?    Just weird!My husband got the lamb burger.   I thought it was delicious, although he thought it was too pink.   But again, the fries and the dipping sauce were off the charts SALTY.   We had desserts also.   Vegan chocolate ice-cream was delicious but TINY...about two bites.   My daughter's s'more torte was ok, but even that was too salty!   My walnut ice-cream was good....but not out of the ordinary.What is all the hype about this place?    Love the philosophy of locally grown organic food etc,   But why cover up the taste of the food with all that SALT??The atmosphere dining outside is very nice, but the chairs are so uncomfortable!  And too low for the table.Overall, we were not impressed and do not plan to return.
Iv had alot of great experiences here in the past but recently they updated their menu and made some other changes which made my last two visits here less than pleasurable. They got rid of my favorite sandwich the Italian and also removed the amazing garden chowder. Why? I have no clue but ok. I can deal with a menu change but also the service changed. Maybe due to so many new people there. My last two visits here took about 20min compared to the usual 4-5min because the new sandwich makers just forgot to make one of my sandwiches. Both times.   I hope they aren't going to run like this forever because I usually really enjoy everything here but have been recently disappointed due to management making too many changes at once with poor integration.
LA Fitness is a mediocre gym that has pretty bad customer service. Registration is a hassle, every now and then you'll get bugged by a trainer to sign up for special training, and the facilities are not always clean.It's convenient because they seem to be everywhere.They claim to be 24 hours, but that is not true. They're only open 24 hrs on M-TH.When you sign up, make sure you don't get ripped off on your monthly plan. Do your research with competing gyms and negotiate. These guys are sharks.
Cool, chill little spot. Drink prices were average $5 beer $10 mix drink. The hummus/guacamole dip was a little bland and the chips were stale, the pita bread was good and warm. Service was good, nice people. Been there done that, prob won't be back.
It was OK, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing (both had lasagne) or perhaps my expectations were too high based on the other reviews.  Menu selection seemed limited and pricey as well for the area (maybe because it's close to Hudson). The lasagna was $17 each and didn't come with anything except bread. The portion was generous, almost too big.  Personally, a nice side salad and a smaller entree portion would have been better. We won't be back.
Only two stars because it was clean and food didn't seem to be old. It was unimpressive choices with very little flavor. We got it for free with a groupon for the hotel and would've been very unhappy if we had paid for it. The dessert section was the only part that was even somewhat okay for the price.
This is probably my last time here... I think the quality has been worse and worse throughout the years.We ordered the charshu udon and grilled salmon set.  The size of salmon is quite big actually so the value is not so bad.. but udon with chashu.. I have never seen this combo in japan!!  I have only seen chashu with ramen.  With udon it's always tempura or curry!!  Anyway despite of the creativity, the taste just doesn't match.  Also ordered teba gyoza.  It was quite salty.And dessert was matcha creme brûlée and it was ok.  Expensive for the quality.
I was craving Pad Thai really bad one time so I tried this place out.  I was hormonal and I actually cried because the Pad Thai was so bad. The noodles were over cooked and it had a weird aftertaste almost like a cockroach. It's hard to explain but I never came back. The Thai tea was good though. I was just so disappointed that they can mess a Pad Thai up.
This was the one thing I was really looking forward to in Vegas so my expectations were very high.  Three of us went for dinner with reservations at 5:45pm. I was the only one in our party that knew who Bobby Flay was.  I consider myself a foodie but the others not so much. The dinner menu was somewhat limited but to be expected if the food is done well. All en tree's were $35-$48 with the sides about $8 each (yeah, entree' does not come with sides.) OK, paying for a big name but not super expensive a la Robuchon. I wanted to try several different tastes from the menu so I ordered 3 appetizers at about $15-$18 each.  The bbq duck on blue corn cake was fantastic in a really sweet bbq way, however it was more like a tapa in that it was tiny and not enough to share a taste with my companions.  All the appetizers were really, really tiny - tapas style.  The mushroom quesedilla was unremarkable and so salty, I had to send it back.  I love salt so for me to send back a salty dish, it has to be nearly inedible. I have no idea how this could have happened. My companions had the salmon and she felt underwhelmed with the dish. The other had the rough cut tuna nachos which was basically like Hawaiian poke' served with a side of chips...tasted this and nothing remarkable in any way.  The bread was fantastic and interesting. The sauces were good.  The staff was attentive and professional. I left hungry and annoyed that I payed so much for unimpressive food. I think my companions were a bit annoyed with me for forcing them to go to Mesa.  Apparently, some folks here have had a good experience so maybe my expectations were too high.  Given this, I highly recommend having lunch or brunch here first as the prices are more reasonable.
There is good stuff here but parking is always a disaster at the district.  They added additional shops that took away from the parking lot so there are fewer spaces now.  Avoid the district entirely on weekends unless you want to risk getting towed because you will have to park on neighbouring properties.
Vegas local and these prices Vegas comes up with for food and drinks is getting to be ridiculous. Pizza was decent. Defiantly on the smaller side and a bit pricey. NO local discount.. Why?FOUR BUCKS for a SODA? Give me a break. Pizza Rock is way better and cheaper and gives a local discount.
there are no managers around when you want to complain. The first room had a mildew smell. second room had problem with the A/C. Coffee costs $3.50...not free. a jr suite is just two rooms with a connecting door. Don't opt for that upgrade. Furniture was just left in the hallway. water is not hot. get the north tower. east tower is not as good.
Had sunday brunch here as the ending of vegas trip because the restaurant was highly reviewed. The food was okay but the service was very disappointing. The waiter took a long time to take our order. Then, it was long waiting before we got the food. We asked if the server can help us check if our dishes were coming. The server did not even apologize but had a huge attitude, saying that "you see that we do have an entire restaurant inside to hold"(we were sitting at the patio). When we finally got the tiny plates of food, the waiter forgot who ordered  what. For the entire period of time, the waiter disappeared and did not refill the water.  Lastly, the bill. The server took our cards but charged 15 dollars more on each card. When we asked, he said that he did it wrong but no apology again. Overall, a over-rated place. Don't think I will ever come back again, as there are way better choice in vegas.
two tacos dinners to go. fish and carne asado.both ok. place hard to find and parking was difficult.designed as a place for those working nearby or parked across the street in the mall.ok value to price, ok food, nothing to write home about
Went in the other night. The place was empty. There were two employees at the counter watching TV. The guy was shoveling something into his mouth from an orange cup. I was wondering if he was eating toppings. I poured myself a three sampler. The coconut came out like shaving cream, not frozen at all. I immediately told the girl. She said, "Yeah, that happens sometimes."  Aaaaaaand, right back to the TV show she went. After I got my stuff I went to the toppings area. The bins were half empty, some had only a few crumbs left.  Then the hot fudge pot was broken. I once again told the girl, and again I got the same response. But this time she watched as I struggled then finally gave up. The marshmallow topping was disgusting. But at least I got to pay $8.00!!!!!!
I used to come here late at night to order a munchie meal and to my surprise this Jack in the Box location has never messed up my order. I guess I would just arrive at the right time. LolOther than that the reason why I give this place two stars is for their location, there's so much sketchy things going on in the parking lot and in the drive-thru lane. It's not the employee's fault but it's a warning to those who are night foodies looking for a fast food restaurant, this location is not entirely safe for you. If you do visit this location go during the day, you'll still see sketchy people but the area is more publicly busy.Their food is bomb, even though I know it's totally bad for you. However, I always order their tacos or their jalapeño burger munchie meal. Employee's are chill, they aren't rude but they aren't go happy.
I'm from Chicago so this pizza is as close to home as it gets.. but when you consistently get pizza delivered at work and home and the cheese is always sliding to one side of the pizza box tells you that they are consistent in making the same mistake over and over.. I work at a car dealer and we stopped ordering from them on Saturdays bc on a few occasions we got almost 10 or more pizzas delivered the same way I got my pizza delivered last night.. funny thing is I'm sitting at the bar having some beers while my wife and kids were at home when I got this pic. Bar service is always nice. April is awesome.. I just hate paying $30 for a thin crust and getting it delivered this way continuously ...
They served us raw dumplings. Yuck! When they're cooked they're yummy, though. There are several beers on the menu, all of which suck almost as much as raw pork. The beer terms glossary on the menu won't make Budweiser taste any fancier.
First let me start off by saying that the people here are SUPER nice, super attentive service, and very helpful in suggesting something for me to try that's new.  If you order water, you'll find they give you a tiny glass, but no worries- you'll never see the bottom of your glass.  Someone will always come by to make sure it's full no matter how thirsty you are.  That alone is kind of entertaining to see!  But my review is for the food and it is not that great, I've given this place two shots and both times they have disappointed me.  The tastes here are very bland and boring.  It's too expensive to try it again for a third time regardless that I come to Caesars a lot for their spa and shopping.  On a more positive note, the goldfish are really cool.  There's something about watching fish swim that's relaxing. :-)  It's silly but the fish are the only reason I came back to give this place a second try, atmosphere is important, the taste of the food is more important.  Blah.
The prices on the bill were not the same as the prices on the menu, which did not contain the specials that the their website said they had ($3 mimosas and Mule specials). The service was friendly however multiple items we did not order appeared on the bill at first, when I asked that it be corrected some were taken off (but not all, the remaining once were small things and our bill was around $100 so I did not bother), then noticed that multiple of the prices were different on the menu then on our bill (mostly by a dollar or 2 off, but it was on a couple different items.) Waitress was confused but didn't bother to get a manager to clear things up, we just paid and left because the 6 dollar difference (Originally 18) was not worth the struggle and we don't go out in Old Town that often.  The food was decent, some in my party thought the breakfast burrito was rather small, another person was told they no longer carried the item on the menu  they wanted to order from it. I normally tip well over the 20% gratuity when I go to a place to watch a football game, in this case since the bill was wrong I just paid the gratuity and did not leave the extra I would have left after being at a table for over 3 hours. Disappointing that they did not have their advertised specials and that the bill prices and menu prices did not add up. The huge LCD screens are cool but they need to get their act together
The selection here is on the lowest end of the spectrum for Charlotte.  I think they should ship items here from around town because the local donations just aren't cutting it.  I go here to donate and they give you a blank receipt every time.
Had the panang curry and the "Orange chicken rice" both we're bland and the panang has the consistency or water. Won't be back.
I love lahaina!  i think they have delicious sushi.  Happy hour ALL DAY on fri - sat - sun    that says to me good sushi for cheap on weekends.  Whats to complain about?!The waitress i had last 2 times was absolutely just a sweetheart.  She was very tentative about us and you can tell she was just so sincerely trying her hardest to make us happy.  Great customer service with her.  I think her name was Kelly?  I'm posting this a bit after my visit so it's hard to remember.  They have a bar and football games on the tv as well and they have a room for karaoke?!   I donno bout you all but i'm a little curious to check it out. Might be fun for a night with the gang to hang out eat cheap sushi and sing your heart out.Over all i love this place.  Only reason i dont 5 star it cause i dont know if it's "as good as it gets"  but it's pretty darn up there.  i'd 4.5 it if i could.Edit as of 4-20-13!!:They no longer serve all day happy hour.  It was the one thing that my friends and i came for.  Yes they still have a happy hour but it's more regular times and not 50% off.  I came here as a treat for not AYCE cheap and delicious sushi.  Is it still tasty?  Yes! But to rich for my blood anymore.  I can find somewhere closer to go to.
Wish I would have read the reviews first.got the ribeye stake medium...$30.it was raw...sent it back...took forever... Couple beers....bottle of wine for the misses$30...+ her meal$30.... Finally finished it was good but I've had better...waited for the check for 30 minutes... got tired of waiting...went up front and paid my $100 Bill+20 tip....they gave us a wallgreens bag to put the wine in....when I pay this kind of money I would like to be wowed....the only thing that wowed me was the bad service and prices...if you feel like you have to much money in your pocket buy all means visit
Very nice atmosphere lots of TVs and literally the worst chicken wings I've ever had in my life. They were very tough and over done. They gave you two little skinny pieces of carrot and celery and blue cheese dressing was very very runny. The drinks were good but my wife had a turkey wrap and you had to look twice to find a turkey. It's really too bad. The french fries were awesome. I spend the winter about a half a mile from there and it's disappointing that I won't be back.
$30 for two cheeseburgers, two draft beers , a bottle of coors and a rum/ coke is too much.In these hard times, it's ridiculous to not mention to the customer that fries are extra and will cost $6 on top of the $6 each for a burger. The burger was real good, but not worth $6 and it has shrunk. The order of fries was $6 and not worth it at all. I shouldn't have stopped, even though traffic was bad, I could have taken my wife to The Armadillo Grill for 5 star food / experience at this price, just across the street or gone to Aunt Chilladas and spent it on drinks and had free happy hour Mexican food.The girl didn't even mention the fries were an extra $6  !!! Come on ! I feel raped !
This place is god to hang out for the fact that it has a dance floor and for its proximity of being in downtown. We were there just for drinks. The most awful experience was they took cover charge from us, gave us a wrist band and when I had to step out for a phone call and step back in within 15 min, the woman at the front charged me another 5$ saying I didn't get a stamp on my hand. Neither was there anyone at the exit to stamp nor anyone informed that we have to get a stamp on our hand. It's not about paying 5$ but the desperation to make that money when they could see the band on my hand and understand that I was admitted. Neither she or her bouncer was willing to listen. I could have thrown 10$ for their desperation.
My boyfriend and I wanted to give Georges a try for Queen's Feast since we've heard good things. Our reservation was for 7:30 on Monday. We got there and saw that there were maybe 7 other tables seated. The menu looked awesome and the Queen's Feast options seemed like good bang for your buck.The service started out great. Our server was personable and made some recommendations. I decided to order from the regular menu since I wasn't feeling the need to have three courses. I ordered the one rosemary and fig cocktail, escargot and the duck breast, and my boyfriend ordered the ruby bulleit cocktail, oysters, seafood stew, and the creme brûlée. Both of our cocktails were delicious, but I must say that the one rosemary and fig was outstanding. Very well balanced and not too sweet. Our hors d'oeuvres came out probably in about 10-15 minute after we ordered, but they brought me mussels instead of the escargot. The server was very apologetic, but we waited at least another 15 minutes for my escargot to come out. My boyfriend had 2 oysters that tasted dirty, and the escargot was lacking flavor. Not a lot of garlic and just under seasoned overall. We got our entrees after being there for over an hour. While I was enjoying the company, the restaurant only had maybe 7 other tables seated. During Queen's Feast I feel like they should be putting in extra effort to make a good impression, yet it was taking a noticeably long time for us to get our food after they already messed up my escargot order.The food itself was good, not great. The duck was cooked well, but was over salted. The 2 huge scallion dumplings it came with were good, but they took up space in the skillet that would have been better filled with more Swiss chard and roasted carrots. My boyfriend's seafood stew was tasty. The sauce was good, but there were two pieces of each type of seafood, so the portion was a little underwhelming. I'm not sure if that was the normal portion or specific for the Queen's Feast menu.We shared the creme brûlée for dessert. I have nothing to say about that other than that it was creme brûlée. Overall, we were pretty disappointed by the service given that they weren't that busy and that the whole point of Queen's Feast is to draw in patrons who they hope will return during the slow post-holiday months. The food was mostly good, but for a meal that was a special treat for us, I didn't feel that it was worth the price point. We probably won't be going back.
Went in to obtain my free 9 inch sub only to realize when I got here that it expired. Had my usual Bobbie and it was terrible. Tasted sour and had tons of cranberry on it. Oh, also found a huge bone in the sandwich.
The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is for the Prime Rib. Came here for a wedding and the staff was clueless and sent us to the reception room instead of the ceremony and were very rude.
Terrible customer service. Took 10 "minutes to get a beer and then the server never came to order food. This is the last time I come into this place.
I'm not a fan of this restaurant using thick noodles for their pho. Using the thicker rice noodles is more Chinese than Vietnamese. It's supposed to be the thinly sliced rice noodles. That's the reason why I haven't been going to this restaurant for many years. Is there even an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto? It seems like all of them are Chinese-influenced. It's a shame.
I ate here today, Saturday, at around 1:30pm. The service was good but a little slow. I was not impressed by the menu. The salad bar peaked my interest so I went with that but it turned out to be ok. Yes, just ok. Aside from the typical veggies, lettuce, and salad dressing there really wasn't much else. A few pre-made salads like beat salad, couscous, mushroom salad. Fruits that really kind of tasted funny. No cottage cheese! No pasta salad or Greek salad. Soup of the day was an extra $9.50 , in addition to the salad bar which was already $18.50. I have no desire to return here. Really did not feel like I got the money's worth.
Horrible service - it's like the waitress was more interested in talking to her friends/other servers than taking our order or refilling out waters.Wings are overly drenched in sauce, and the "most popular" flavor isn't hot nor great tasting. Average wing place, wing size is a little small compared to other wing places north on hwy 7, and just an okay place to go to.Would not return. Please take note manager.
It's not actually a Best Western any more.  It had changed ownership the week before my friends and I arrived.  After checking in we were informed that the elevator to our room didn't always work so we should take another elevator to the 7th floor than take the stairs up to the 8th.  Apparently they needed to work on a few kinks.  We get to our room and there is 1 queen bed but we booked for 2.  But there was a couch and ta-da!  A pull out queen.  It's all good, except wait, these queens look a little small.  Yup, this must be the first time I had my feet hang over the edge of a queen bed.  On top of that the pull out bed was uncomfortable as hell!  It sunk in toward the middle so I kept feeling like I was sinking.  I fell right to sleep since I was so tired but my friend woke me up when she bumped into my feet in the morning!  Stupid short bed.In any case, house keeping were great and we had a nice little view of the surrounding area thanks to our little balcony.  It's also close to the library, old spaghetti factory, an art museum, cafes, etc.  It was also within walking distance to 1st and Roosevelt where they were holding 1st Fridays which is pretty much a block party for the arts.The location was the best attribute here.  House keeping was nice but the beds did me in.
I thought being a privately owned pizza restaurant they'd have a good recipe. Sadly I was very disappointed. Paid $25 for a medium pizza and wings and that was with the special. The wings were in this kind of breading which was soggy and unfavorable. The pizza lacked much flavor and wasn't very good. Delivery was fairly timely, about 30 mins but then again it was also early Thursday evening. I probably won't be back. For that kind of money I'd rather go elsewhere and get more quality for my dollar.
The buffet at the casino is just that.....a buffet.  Nothing over the top.  I ate at Corky's in the food court last week and got sooooo sick.  Was not in the least bit impressed.  Never mind I was out of work for a week.  Food poisoning perhaps?  Not cheap either.  $16 for a sandwich meal.  Never again eating there.
We walked in for lunch, and ordered each of the classic tacos listed on the menu along with a side of guacamole. The service was friendly, the food was okay, with the flavor falling flat. You are provided with 3 bottles of sauce, one habanero, one jalapeno medium and one they dubbed "the mexican ketchup". The venue was dark and dimly lit. Though we won't be returning for the food, we might come back to try the drinks at the bar.
There's something about this Panara that grates on my nerves.  Maybe it's the surly service.  Maybe it's the couldn't care less about the customer attitude.  The food is ok but there are other restaurant options close by.
Any modern day traveler compares airports. It's a fact of life. The process of checking-in, going through security, and getting into your seat are all on a timeline. Sometimes we're rushed, sometimes we're way early, and sometimes we're right on the money. I tend to be the first of these three... I usually snooze twice, take my time showering, and forget that I have to put gas in the rental or time the subway the night before. Where do these all play into this review?... Well, Cleveland Hopkins Airport has the WORST security checkpoint at that I have ever encountered (@ American Airlines gates). Now, I only went through one of the three TSA checks, but that's good enough to make the above statement. The line was extremely long, with no place to go as the roped off area held 20 people max. The entire process took nearly 40-minutes, and lucky for me, I had just that much time to wait. Recommendations: Arrive EARLY!
My friend and I chose this company for a Hoover Dam tour.  There were two options. Option 1. The Hoover Dam Tour only. Option 2. The Hoover Dam Tour, with a lunch, and Ethel M's Chocolate factory tour, and a Cactus Botanical Garden tour.We opted for option number 2, which was a great deal!The Hoover Dam tour was pretty nice.  The bus driver stopped at the famous, "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign for everyone to take a picture.  And then he took us to a check-in place with a gift shop/small airport with helicopters and Cessnas.  After checking in, we got onto the bus and headed to Hoover Dam.  The driver was very informative, and tried to be funny, but in a way that no one knew he was joking, so it really wasn't funny.We got to Hoover Dam, and went in for the power plant tour and then went to take some pictures. It was for an hour & a half.After this tour, everyone got back on the bus and the driver took us to lunch. I was happy since everyone was so hungry.The bus stopped in front of this really dirty, old casino, and I was wondering why we were there, perhaps to pick up more people?Just then, a real hillbilly with no teeth and super long braided white hair comes on board the bus wearing really dirty overalls.  He started introducing himself and the casino, and "the buffet" and that's when my friend and I turned and looked at each other horrified and mouthed, "Oh My Gosh". It was one of those moments you only see in movies.We went into the casino, past all the gamblers that looked quite different from the gamblers on the Vegas Strip.  When we got past the mutant people that looked like they were from the movie, "The Hills have eyes", We arrived at "The Buffet".We got in line to what must've been the smallest buffet ever.My friend and I each grabbed our plates. First came to some bread bins. The bread looked super old. I didn't touch it. I decided to pass on everything but the celery, carrots, and a piece of fried chicken that didn't look so scary.  The rest of the food looked like globs of mysterious "stuff".  I could barely look at it.I sat down at the table and ate just enough to get me through my hunger pains. My friend's plate had some "things" that looked like bbq ribs and bbq chicken, along with some other stuff. My friend has a strong stomach, so I figured she'd be okay.We finished eating as quickly as we could to rush back to the bus.Next came the very disappointing Ethel M's chocolate factory tour. When we entered, there was a guy standing there with plastic glove on one hand, and one small bag of coconut flavored M&M's. Ethel's last name was Mars.... *sigh* He gave each one of us 3 pieces of the M&M's. Really? Why bother giving "samples"? And then we got to the factory tour.  It was a small hallway area with glass between the chocolate makers and the visitors. The chocolate makers were laughing and pointing at the visitors, like they were in a zoo, and the visitors were caged animals. hmmm... interesting?We got outside and that was the Botanical Cactus Garden. Ummm... really? You call that a garden? It was a big space filled with different types of cacti and cactus fruit. We got back on the bus and the driver took us all back to the hotels, but not before having us shell out some cash, since "that's how they make a living", doesn't the company pay him?  I hate it when they pull this trick.  I'd rather have paid more upfront, instead of being harassed by the driver to give him a good tip.When we got back to the hotel, my friend was sick. Yes, from "The Buffet" at the oldest casino. (#4 to be registered back then)She was so sick all night, she barely made it to her flight the next morning. She also missed her NYC vacation that was already planned and booked for the next few days because she was still sick for a few more days.This dam tour taught me that next time, go for option#1. Don't trust them to take you to a nice dam place for lunch! =)
I'm a Panera fan but this location is disappointing. An item in our rapid pickup order was incorrect and another item was missing. Rather than offering to replace the items we paid for but never received, management offered nothing. Just thanked me for my feedback.
I had good intentions going here.  Naturally with the recent disaster in Vegas I wanted to make my contribution to donate blood.Made an appointment and completed Fast Track with hopes of decreasing my wait time.  I arrived, checked in, provided my paperwork and took my seat fully expecting a little delay before giving blood.  An hour passed and so I approached the desk to inquire how much longer it'd be before I'd be seen.  To my disappointment I was curtly told that they're behind.  After a little further probing I was able to get the desired response.  I patiently waited another 30 minutes and was finally called in to interview!  I had run out of time as I had to pick up my children from school.  I know the men and women at these facilities are working hard and extremely busy.  Their service to the community is tremendous.  The only suggestion I have to improve business is to display or simply communicate wait times so donors can make good use of time.  I will be scheduling another appointment to fulfill my commitment but perhaps at another location or even American Red Cross instead.
We ordered P1 with tripe, rare steak, and tendon and P7 Vegetable Pho with Beef broth.  The Pho broth just wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping.  We read a lot of reviews and there was a mix of comments about the Pho.  When we walked in, the smell is amazing, just wish the food was as good.  Disappointed.
This is a disgrace I come with my friends 4 of us, one was wearing basketball shorts and was told he can't wear it after 8 so Toby Keith's bar lost $100 over a pair of shorts we had to go to Denny's it made me so mad we just left the Lee Brice concert and wanted to go there, see if this were any other bar and grill it would be empty the only thing keeping it open is the name! Come on Toby Keith's you guys know there's money to be made....make it!
I wanted to love this place sooooo badly. Here's the deal, their bagels are a tasty form of bread but in my opinion they're not authentic East coast style bagels which is what I was hoping for. They're just not correct in that regard. Outer part is wrong texture, inside wrong density, flavor wrong. That doesn't mean that as a piece of bread it wasn't good or wasn't tasty, it's just not really a "real" bagel. It should also be said that most people don't care about real bagels, but for me, these are a pass. I gave them 2 stars for nice atmosphere, friendly staff and having Infusion brand coffee but I wouldn't. It the bagels again. For me the search continues!
Free tortilla chips and salsa are the best part. The margaritas are about average and the enchilladas are ok. The price is right and the decor is good but I've had better.
I should of known when I saw the Kurt Warner marinara sauce that it was gonna be nasty.... I was right and we shared two of the "guest favorites" and they were nasty so I can just imagine what the other entrees tasted like. The people next to us had pizza which looked like maybe it was tasty but from the two items we chose its probably mediocre at best...
We wanted to like Luigi's.  Had been looking forward to trying it out. We felt all but forgotten while there. With small kids, we order our food fast so ordered the drinks, appetizers and pizza at once. They were out of 2 of their 5 appetizers. Appetizer came out just fine but then didn't see the waiter for 30+ minutes until he came with the dessert menu.  This is when we realized our pizza had not been made. After an hour of waiting, got our pizza and drinks refilled once (by then they were half full of water from the ice melting).  Pizza was decent but not good enough to overcome the poor service.
Typically I really like paramount. And I was very excited for this to open in my area. This location is shit though. Not sure how the food could be this much worse at this location. Get it together paramount!
My first visit was last night with a friend, and we experienced terrible service. I'm not a big complainer or full of difficult requests as I worked in the industry for 5 years, but this was bad.  After we were sat and given menus, we were basically deserted. We had already picked what we wanted to order for dinner yet hadn't even been brought waters yet. We had to walk to the bar to ask if anyone was going to come serve us at the table.Finally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal. I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+. If I'd had more time I would have asked to speak to a manager.
Walked in on a Thursday night to be told they've ran out of chicken at 5:30pm. Okay fine... understandable, stuff happens. 15 min wait? No problem I'll wait. Lady walks in behind me gets told the same thing, she looks a little upset but whatever, gotta wait just like me.  What bothers me is when I come back 20 min later expecting my order to be ready and chicken is nowhere near cooked, and the lady that was behind me already got her order and left!!! Did you just give away my food? Ended up waiting 35minutes for some 'fast food chicken.' Sure was fast. Staff/Service: The cashier at the front seemed nice and seemed to care but the rest of the staff seemed absent minded. Whats worse, David Adjey was around and nobody even seemed to be working hard at all to push out orders.Food: You'd think the long wait for the freshly roasted chicken would of been worth it? Not at all. Chicken was dry, underseasoned.... bland....The only thing worth getting here is the potato salad, which tasted pretty good. But a takeout chicken restaurant with bad chicken???? Gimme a break. 1.5stars/5 but I'll give it a 2 just because of the potato salad. Conclusion: Not coming back again for sure and would not recommend. Whole chicken + 2 sides for 24 bucks... If it had been amazing or even half good, I would pay that price, but not for this crap. Rather buy a roasted chicken at Whole Foods or Longos or something. Service was terrible too.... ridic.
$5 bottle of Bud Light, $8 per shot of Liquor.  No Thanks
On my return from Cleveland to LAX I was able to move through the security line pretty quickly which was a plus. One of the security guards told me to remove my body spray I had forgotten was in my purse my entire trip,  which I understand now why. But his interaction with me went as follows. Him: You have to take that bottle outMe: But I flew here with it in my purseHim: No you didn't ???? (So I guess I'm lying)Woman security: You can take it back to your carMe: I am flying HOME, which means I don't have a vehicle and am not coming backI don't know they were just a little rude about it. Maybe LAX slipped up when I travelled to Cleveland.  He could've just said something similar. Sheesh!The airport is clean and well kept though.
+ The FOOD was good, I ordered the Cajun chicken pasta. They have good music & lemonade. The staffs nice.- I found a hair on one of the noodles. GROSS. The wait is ridiculously long, like 30-40 or MORE! The waitress kept messing up our order & receipt. She takes forever to give you your check.
Was seen as a new patient  today for a follow up from the ER for a cyst. Got an appt quick and with  a male doctor.  Would have preferred  a female but I wanted  in soon. Signed in and wasn't greeted. Did not recieve new patient  paperwork. Then I got called up to register and they got annoyed no one gave it to me. The medical assistant didn't  say who she was nor ask for the paperwork. Appointment went okay. He educated me and ordered  test. Then told me to hold on and never came back. The medical assistant  came back to have me sign paperwork and said some one would call me to schedule  an ultrasound and she walked  out. Huge office. Didn't  show me where the exit was. It was very unprofessional. I work  in the medical field and i dont know if i wanna go back.
This taco bell was friendly and the food was good but i didnt like the way place looked inside. Could havw been cleaner i guess.
I am not impressed with the new store. The hot buffet food seems over cooked and not appetizing.  Prices are higher than other Giant Eagle stores and the staff is not helpful. The cafe is nice  and they have a large wine selection.
I was simply lied to. I took my car in for an explicit rattle in the passenger door. Rusty, the service guy stated "oh yeah this is covered under warranty". I had to pay for a loaner car and he told meater in the day that the techs couldn't find anything. I left a voicemail that was never returned and I had no update. We agreed I would come back the next morning. I talked to an actual tech who told me that the warranty only covers rattles for 12/12000 which I was NEVER informed of. Moral of the story is don't take their word on anything. Funny when the service advisor was caught in the lie, he bolted.
Uggg.  All Lee's are not created equal.  I guess I'm a little bit of a Lee's snob after having worked in San Jose for 3 weeks and eating it almost every day.  I got the grilled pork and I think it was just cut up cheap ham.  I was horrified at this abomination of a Lee's after having talked so much shit to my wife about how good it was.  It was painfully all right.  No green waffles, no chuoi nep nuong, no assorted treats layed out just so.  Not a young coconut in site.  They did have the fresh squeezed sugarcane juice I have come to love.  But it still has nothing on Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu's sugarcane and kumquat explosion.  I sadly went away with a large baguette and the hopelessness of knowing Arizona is missing out big on the REAL Lee's Sandwiches experience and that is a mofo shame...
I would give one star but I felt our server and the pizza was great. The thing that threw us off is that we found a hair in our Brussels. We have no intention of getting over on the place but the manager said he inspected the hair and mentioned that none of the workers had that blond strand so maybe it was either my wife's, or it was flying and landed in it due to the ventilation. He didn't charge us for the dish, but he did make us feel uncomfortable like we had intention of getting over on the place, in which we didn't. I may give this place a second chance, of course with only the pizza and beer.
I went here last Wed for a gel manicure and a pedicure. I got there around 11am and there were only 2 other customers. I still waited about 30 mins before anyone started my pedicure. Pedicure was average. Before they put polish on my toes they had me get up and move to a table for my nails. I was impressed with the large selection of colors they have, but the manicure was terrible. After they finished my mani, they had me go back over to the pedicure chairs  to finish my toes. My manicure was way too thick, and pained over my cuticles. It was peeling off just 5 days later. The picture I included was taken exactly 5 days after I got the manicure, I took the rest of the polish off myself that night.
I absolutely LOVE Korean BBQ and sadly did NOT LOVE dining here for Mother's Day. Our experience sort of ruined a supposed special day for my mom and here's why: The restaurant is clean, the lighting is bright and the place is very well-decorated but Lee's has the most disappointing prices, grills on the tables and customer service! It was Mother's Day and you'd think they'd be prepared for a huge crowd but I suppose not. We were seated promptly but did not get help for the next 20 or so minutes. We were a party of 8 and it was our first time dining at Lee's. We finally put in our orders and the first batch of food was delicious. The meats were flavorful and spicy. We were ready for round 2 and when we politely asked the server if we are able to order, she brushed us off rudely saying, "Hold on! I'm the only server!" Sheesh, sorry for being an inconvenience! This happened several times during lunch and really rubbed us the wrong way. We asked for food, waters, sides, napkins.. things that are normally asked for but we felt like we shouldn't or couldn't ask for them. One example is we asked for one more Steamed Egg and Soup and she goes, "You already have two." Yes, we are aware of that. But they're delicious, it's AYCE and there were 8 of us so.. I mean.. we thought we could ask for more. We asked for chicken because she walked away before we could finish our order and she said, "Finish your meats first then I'll bring it."Honestly, the delicious food does not compensate for the extremely poor customer service.  We had one grill on our table that was located to the very right of the table so the patrons seated on the left had to wait for the cooked meats from the people seated on the right side. The prices are ridiculous for the horrible treatment you get from the workers. The server eventually got nicer at the end when it got less busy and by that time, we were ready to depart already.All in all, that will be my first and last time at Lee's. I'd rather eat Korean BBQ from somewhere else after my experience.
Not the worst Walmart I have ever been to, but by far not the best.  No one in the store knows where anything is or knows how mix paint either.  The lines are very very long so you better bring a book.  Unfortunately Walmart has a monopoly so we as Americans really have no choice but to use their store.
So Ive been to this place twice. I didnt like it the first time I went I had the Dan Dan Noodles way too salty and l like salt I threw it out. I also ordered the House Fried Rice and it had no flavor, two of their Special Rolls both were flavorless and mushy. I threw away all of the food it was just tastless. I really push for people to support local businesses I thought well maybe they were having a bad day all of the reviews were great and maybe it was just me. So I waited another month and tried again same exact order and it tasted the same. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I still believe you should support local businesses just mybe not this one.**Ok so to answer the businesses questions I got take out the first time and ate in the second time thinking that maybe I did not get it home in time. I'm not sure what cost has to do with anything. In MY OPINION I did not like your food. I don't want my money back I pay with cash btw, I got the food and I ate some of it, It was my choice to go back and try again. Good luck with your business and enjoy all of your positive reviews
20 mins for a milkshake when there's nobody here. The wait staff seemed to be having fun taking pics of the other drinks they made (for themselves). I asked if there was butter or jam for my scone and was totally ignored while they were talking. Pretty expensive & the staff could use a dose of customer service training.
This place could be great, really.  Unfortunately the place as rather unattractive, the decor was sparse and forgettable, the only sounds were the people talking and the annoying television, and the waitress was shy, not very talkative, and wasn't great at helping you decide what to get.The menu is rough-looking, has nothing to describe the food at all, and doesn't really appeal to a first-timer for Peruvian food.  It lacks the polish of a good restaurant, really.  The food, you ask?  Decent.  The food on the menu is just a bunch of names, and how those names relate to the food at all is a mystery to the uninformed, so you have to ask your server.  As I stated earlier, the server has not forthcoming with explanations, so you had to just pick whatever you thought sounded nice.  The Chinese is lackluster and in fact a little more pricey than other Chinese-only places.  Don't come here for that.  The Peruvian food has more character, but even so, it's so hit-or-miss that it's not even worth the time and effort.Suggestions for improvement?  They need to put a bit more capital into the decor, take the TV out of there, lower the amount of light and get indirect lighting.  Drop the Chinese completely, and change the name to an exotic, Peruvian-sounding name.  Play to your uniqueness, and you'll get much better attention.  If you feel you must have Chinese food there, due to Chinese immigrant influence on Peru's cuisine, then add it as "Asian-Influenced" or something to the otherwise Peruvian menu.  Add some photos of the dishes, as well as a description for each and every item.  For a non-Spanish speaker, the food on the menu might as well have been gibberish.This could've been great, but as it stands, it's kind of dismal and not worth your time.
I stop by this location every now and then on my way to work on weekends. That pretty much means I'm too lazy to cook a good breakfast, but want something more than cereal. I've never had the major issues other people are yelping about. Perhaps things have improved since then. I find that If you stick to a bagel and cream cheese, all is well. But (and I find this the case with most Einsteins) if you try to order anything hot, you're about to get what tastes like an over priced frozen microwave meal.
Utterly disappointed, I know this place has bad reviews but this is very infuriating that I drove 30 minutes to have some late night desert and they advertise they close at 1 but got denied any service and it wasn't even past 12:30am. Are the workers here being lazy? You're suppose to be serving up until you're closed. Not until how you feel like it. Only giving this place a 2 star because of sympathy. I've been here before desert isn't the greatest but it'll satisfy your cravings if you can even eat it... Maybe not.
mehhhh...i stayed at the hard rock and saw an ad for $1 tacos (mon-thurs) with a players card. so we decided to go to check it outthey give you free chips and salsa (meh)and the tacos were less than average. i wouldnt go back.
We may have come during a really bad day here. We came here for a Father's Day brunch and we were probably the 5th party in the restaurant (there were 6 of us including 2 children). They had 2 servers for the restaurant and they both appeared to be struggling to keep up with their customers. We were seated and roughly a little over 20 minutes later they came to take our order (they served 2 parties that came in after us before they served our party). Our food arrived 33 minutes later and the serving of eggs both on my husbands plate as well as the side of eggs had hair in both. I did however order the French toast and it tasted good. While the food I had may have tasted good, the experience was overshadowed by poor service. I hope things get better here.
We tried Georges for Charlotte Restaurant Week since we hadn't had a chance to get there and thought this to be an opportune time to try and share multiple courses. Upon arrival, we were told that they were running a bit behind and they recommended that we sit at the bar while we waited. Our reservation was for 7:30pm and, after enjoying a glass of wine, we checked back with the hostess at 8pm to get a status. She let us know that it would only be a bit longer and that they knew where we were sitting at the bar and would come fetch our party when our table was ready. After another 30 minutes passed, we checked in with the hostess again at 830pm only to be told that they gave our table to another party in error and would work to get a table cleared for us asap. Once seated, the manager came over and offered us a bottle of champagne to make up for the mix-up. We understood that it was a busy night and that sometimes Restaurant Week can result in diminished service/food quality due to higher volumes of guests than usual. That being said, it was a nice touch to have the management attempt to rectify our wait time.Our waiter came by the table to take our order soon after we were seated--we each ordered off of the Queen's Feast menu and also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Within 10 minutes of ordering, runners were at our table with their arms full of plated entrees. After telling them that we hadn't yet received our first course, so they must be for another table, they walked back to the kitchen--only to return a second time 60 seconds later. With the plates in their hands, they informed us that there was a mix-up and they had fired our entrees prior to starters and asked what we wanted them to do, rather than just taking the plates back and either trashing them or bringing them to another table (during restaurant week, we assumed there were multiple others waiting on the same dishes). When we asked if they could bring our starters and start over, they informed us that they would be putting our entrees under a heat lamp in the back--something even less desirable than just eating them early, so we ended up taking them without the first course having been served. They then asked if we even wanted our starters, which we did since we were paying for them regardless. A manager was sent out after the starters were delivered (now each of us had 2 courses at once and no chance of preserving the heat in both at the same time) who offered us no apologies, just the statement that they were "doing the best they could" and offering to cover the cost of our bottle of wine. This was certainly a pleasant gesture but, being raised in the restaurant industry, not a replacement for a proper apology. The server avoided us for the most part after these mix-ups and, when he returned to clear plates, he cleared some dishes that we were still in the process of finishing without asking or staying for long enough for us to ask for them to be left. Restaurant weeks are typically a time for diners to try places for the first time and, hopefully, enjoy the experience enough to return. We eat out at restaurants at and above the level of Georges on a regular basis including casual weeknight dinners out, we were there to test out the restaurant, not to get a deal or look for handouts. That being said, the service was appalling and the manner in which the night was handled (avoidance, no apologies, and general lack of professionalism) was inexcusable. We will not be returning to Georges any time soon and hope that they use this as a moment to coach their staff on customer service and respect especially since the food was decent, but tainted by the generally unacceptable experience.
I always go to this panera, and it's usually fine when I eat there. Carry out is a different story.... the employees work ethic is not very good, and seem to take their time with everything. If you ever want to get a to go, then do rapid pick up because I'm sick of always waiting long for such a small order.
What a "great" first impression when you walk in, wait 20 minutes for customer service, and have to talk to a rather rude customer service representative.
I came into Toni and Guy wanting to get partial highlights and because my sister recommended them. Mind you, I have been to several different, great hairdressers who have done a fantastic job with my hair. I only came here because they have a reasonable price for what I wanted. After arriving, I was approached by Jen, my colorist, and she took me back to get started. Long story short, the highlights came out okay. She quickly foiled me and I was waiting for probably a good 45 minutes before she washed them out. Not to mention, I have never seen employees push their product on their customers as much as these people! Every minute, she was trying to sell me something and wanted me to come back in another 8 weeks for a full highlight. My hair was already damaged enough as is and a good hairstylist would've recommended a break and a good product to repair my breakage. The highlights are some of the worst I have had. Very patchy and some parts of my hair aren't toned, which is very upsetting. I will definitely not be returning. They are such a franchised salon that the quality and individuality have disappeared.
Probably the worst red bean sherbet a.k.a. Patbingsu I've had anywhere. Who puts Corn flakes in a red bean sherbet? just bad.There were few fruits; and some of them didn't taste very fresh. They could have added more variety of fruits and jellies. Shaved ice was already melting when I took the first scoop. Ice cream was okay. I could have made a better Patbingsu at home. Just a note: they charge you $2.50 for playing board games. It would have been better if they had a sign up saying so or told us before we got a board game. We thought they were abandoned by previous customers. Not that $2.50 is a lot of money for playing board games; they had a very limited selection of only three board games and some of them looked worn out.I had visited this place before, and I remember having a drink here and leaving with no complaints. I probably won't come back here again though except for a cup of tea or something that would be very difficult to get wrong. I was here on a Friday night but the place was not very busy. They don't accept credit cards; be prepared to pay by debit or cash. Good things: couches, cute paper heart decorations, and some chairs fitting for the princess/prince theme.
Way too expensive for mediocre pizza and small portioned food. Sorry, but you can spend your money elsewhere.
I'll give it to Taste of Chicago, it looks the part.  Chicago sports stuff- check!  And that's where the Chicago similarities end.As I must do for any place that claims "Chicago", I tried the Italian beef.  Hmmmm.... notsomuch.  Pretty bland, overly chewy, too thickly sliced.  Wait.  Is this store bought?  You really shouldn't have to wonder that.
Ok Brian came out and showed me that the balister was in fact not broke it just simply needed to be screwed in tighter.  It's good that Brian stands behind his product and will come out to fix it...... eventually. Last year I hired him to replace stair railing in my home. The contract stated 4 to 7 days. The job took over 6 weeks. This was largely due to the fact that he would stop in now and then work an hour or two then go to another job, thus dragging mine out way longer. Fortunately I had yet to move in my house I purchased but Brian demanded the A.C. left on low 70s so that he could work in comfort. I asked him could he please turn the A.C. off when he left since sometimes he wouldn't come back for 4 plus days and he said no, I like it to be cool in the house when I walk in and I don't want to wait for it to kick on and have to cool the house down. I thought this was terrible since I knew he was only staying there most days for an hour or two and at the end of the month I had a $400 utility bill  even though I didn't even live in the house just from keeping the air conditioner running for him to stay in comfort.  Not cool.Next was the trash that was left around the house constantly there was candy bar wrappers potato-chip chip bags fast food bags  left scattered around. His price was $200 cheaper then Titan stairs and offered a couple designs beyond what they could provide. The finished product looks good but it was irritating to go over and see my new house that I just purchase littered with trash and paying to cool a home for whenever he decided to show up. In short I am satisfied with the finished product but business needs to be done in a much more professional manner.
My friend and I stopped by on our way out of Phoenix Fashion week.  I ordered a calzone with lots of veggies.  Point off for not offering marinara sauce and the calzone was just ok.  I must say tho that the seasoned fries were tasty!  I just wasn't blown away by anything.  Be careful if you're dining in, it's smack dab in the middle of the casino, so the smoke will getcha!
And to think I was pretty excited to go here.So many dining choices and we drive off the strip to come here.At least it wasn't full at all, really thought there would be a wait, but we were there pretty early for dinner.Happy hour only at the bar which we could not sit at with a kid, so we were off to paying double as everyone else there as we were the only ones at a table, they could have really made an exception.Tried to talk my husband into ordering the 3 lb $25 burrito, he went with the $18 regular instead.I had the fish tacos ($14), my son the quesadilla ($11)The prices are INSANE for what you get!The $18 burrito smaller than any other that you can get for a third that price, grizzly meat, served with black beans and salad, not rice and refried as stated in the menu.Unhappy camper.The quesadilla a sorry presentation, very lackluster in taste, $11 they should really be ashamed!!!!! Just cheese, no sides, no garnish, I was pissed!My fishtacos, 2 for $14 were ok, the second time.FIrst time they brought  me cold fried fish on corn shells when I ordered grilled on flour.Servers mistake, he brought someone else's plate that had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile.By the time my order came out the guys were done eating, so they sat and stared while I ate,  not fun.Fish tacos were fine, not stellar, neither was rice and beans.$60 for something I would have paid around $10 for in SoCal and didn't even taste good, very disappointed Pink Taco!
Stopped in here for some drinks and snacks last week and was pretty disappointed. The service was SUPER SLOW, and our server didn't even bring us glasses for our boilermakers. I ordered a hot pretzel with beer cheese sauce - the pretzel tasted like Pillsbury crescent roll dough, and the "beer cheese sauce" tasted like french onion soup mix dip. I will not be back!
The cupcakes are colossal, but bland. We had a shamrock cupcake that was supposed to have mint frosting - completely tasteless. The yellow cake has no flavor. The chocolate cupcake was the only thing that had flavor. Never again.
I just had lunch at the restaurant; they make good food and the prices are fair; the waitress started pressuring us to leave after 45 minutes indirectly; finally the hostess came over and asked us to leave.We were there a total of 1 hour and had already tipped over 20%.  Good lesson in business---your lack of space became my problem; also, if you had asked rather than bully us out of the place, you would probably have a customer willing to return.  Instead, you will get the opposite. First time I have ever been asked to leave a restaurant.  It was weird!
Before I get into the review, I want to say that I really really really wanted to like this place. My husband had been discouraging in trying the place out and I insisted that with so many raving reviews on Yelp, the restaurant surely had to be doing something right. SO we went on a Saturday night after making online reservations for 3. We were seated at the window overlooking East Blvd, with a street lamp glaring in our face from across the street (Perhaps some sheers will help this?) We placed our drink orders and then a secondary waiter gave the complimentary hot and fluffy naan w/ chutney tray. We then ordered a salad and the samosa potli (pouch). The salad was average and plentiful, however the samosa was tasty yet very small portioned. Both were $7.Next we ordered our entrees: 2 'modern' vegetarian dishes and 1 non-veg. The goat cheese malai kofta was not flavored or seasoned. The only taste was of the goat cheese. The other veg dish was a tomato-potato dish. This was also the same way. According to the Yelp reviews, the chicken tikka was a must-order. I couldn't differ more on that opinion. The dish was wayy too creamy and not flavored at all. Add to the fact that you can only make the tikka more spicy and not the veg dishes because it's already prepped?! What Indian restaurant has that policy?Needless to say, the only things above average were the naan and the secondary waiter's service. Below average was the tasteless food. Copper, please don't insult the Indian diner by serving this food that you call "authentic and modern." And this is before I even got to the price point of the food. Simply highway robbery when you charge customers that much for flavorless entrees.  I would not recommend this place to even a person trying Indian food time for the first time.
The location is ok but just the atmosphere is different then other angry crabs, not as exciting, music is way to loud and felt like a DMV location. The main problem is the po boy sandwitches, the portions are great but on a dry white sub and DRY!! No flavor at all, don't even think they used salt!  They should really toast the sub, add some more ingredients and make is moist!! It was something my 10 year old put together!! Very disappointed!!
They will give you proper value for your car if you want to sell it to them, or you can use their quote as leverage for other places.The process that occurred from the time of claim to gap insurance payment went really well and the finance department does a lot to make it easier on you.The no haggle thing is stress free but it's not for everyone. It depends on what you want I guess.I would say that the finance rate posted on the windows of their cars seems disproportionately high, and researched I shopped around and checked to be sure. My friend got 4 percent lower APR with Carvana.My negative experience:Vehicle caught fire right after electrical service and they don't honor what they tell you.The representatives you talk with seem like good people and genuinely concerned with your issue... but the supervisors sound condescending and unhelpful.The service department sends your car all over the place, or so they did with mine anyway. A while back I had a vehicle in their shop for 30 days, and 2 days after getting it back, it freaking CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE DRIVING. The fire department was called and in putting it out, the car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company. I was told by the service dept. that I would get a service refund since i had the car only two days before it caught on fire. They were very apologetic. They said they would mail it. I never got it. The fire was an electrical fire and originated in an area that was DIRECTLY worked on by Carmax and friends. My insurance did not go after them because they transferred my car to two other shops and figured it would cost more in court costs than would be worth it. The claim adjuster stated that the three service shops would just point the finger at each other until the case dragged out past the point of value.There was miscommunication on the final payment after the gap insurance company covered what they did. It's partly my fault as I wasn't aware that the payment schedule would go back to normal after the gap process. I thought the normal payment schedule was over and I could work with them on what's left. Regardless, they didn't care either way. Details:I was told by a representative,after asking, that the final loan total that gap didn't cover can be split in half and allowed over two months. There was no talk of my payment being considered negative, and considering that they worked with me so much during the gap claim with extensions and whatnot, I didn't think it would be an issue, especially since they had honored what they had told me at every other instance except for the service refund.This ended up biting me as I received a call on the 31st day (after Oct. due date) stating that my payment was late. I explained the agreement, with confidence, and was transferred to the supervisor.The supervisor didn't care about my agreement made and said it was late and I needed to pay the remaining monthly payment. I set up the rest of the payment that would cover my usual car payment to be scheduled that very minute. I was told that despite it being 1 day over the 30 day grace (for negative reporting) it shouldn't be reported late and will be posted that day. Him and I then verified the final payment of loan and the date it was due. THE NEXT CALL WAS THE MOST CRAP SERVICE EVER:I checked credit report and there it was, a negative mark anyway. I called and explained my last call and was transferred to another apathetic supervisor. She said she would listen to my last call. She called me back saying they did nothing wrong despite all that I was told and that my payments and dates previously discussed were pertaining to the final payment to be made instead of the partial payment that would have finished my last payment. I told her she misinterpreted the call as we discussed both of those things at that time. Instead of seeing a miscommunication, which is what it clearly was, she didn't care and basically was being a smart ass. I was infuriated. I told her I wouldn't had even set up the final partial payment that day if I knew it would go on the report as negative anyway. I would have just paid it all and not bothered asking to have it split. She said that maybe next time, I only ask ONE question and not TWO questions (as in questions about two different payments) next time I talk to someone so that everyone can have clarity. WHAT! I'm only allowed to ask one question? I gave my permission for the final payment to set up. She then asked if I had other questions, but why bother if I'm only allowed one?!?!Update: 8-26-17 In hindsight, I shouldn't have had to pay any extra after the car caught fire and should have sued for a list of things I could have sued for. I am wiser now. If shopping for a car again, this place may be an option if the right deal is there. I would likely not use their finance company, and would document every communication extensively. I doubt I'd be unlucky enough to have another car catch fire.
Much more casual than expected.  (Everything is served on paper/styro plates/bowls.)  The food is very average.  None of it is bad, but not great either.  I had a Greek Chicken pita.  It was somewhat dry and bland and pretty small for $8.  The cole slaw was unique, but good.  Service was very average as well...not overly friendly by any means.  My wife got the salad sampler with chicken salad.  It was just okay as it didn't have a lot of flavor.  Overall, Zoe's was very average and slightly over priced for what you receive.  For close to $20 for 2, I would much rather got to Pita Jungle for healthy wraps and pitas.
This motel is convenient location to ASU and Gina the day manager is a very pleasant person most helpful. The lobby is clean and welcoming. BUT. the rooms need attention ,they are tired , bed was very uncomfortable ,and the pillows squish up to nothing. The no smoking room we were in smelled of smoke in spite of using half a can of fabreeze. The price was reasonable but this place is worse than when we were here two years ago. It just looks seedy.
