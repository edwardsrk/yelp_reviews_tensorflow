b'Horrible, dishonest and zero accountability for their screw ups. I had an oil change done and immediately after driving away, I noticed my car didn\'t sound the same. I brought my car back and they denied there was a problem.  6 guys standing around my car and they couldn\'t pin point the problem so naturally, they said I must\'ve hit something and there was nothing they could do to fix it since "i caused the problem".  Frustrated, I left and when i got home, I popped my hood only to realize they did not close my air filter cover properly. 6 guys couldn\'t figure this out and instead of trying to fix the problem, they immediately blamed me. I wouldn\'t recommend them to anyone.'
