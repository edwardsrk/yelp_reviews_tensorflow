b"Food was fine, but WOW the service.  There is just not a friendly vibe here.  We've noticed the same at Gallo, but not as bad as the waitress we had last night at Otro.   Drinks were slow to get to us.  The blond waitress last night seemed like we were almost inconveniencing her by being there.  At one point my husband asked for hot sauce or a spicy salsa to accompany his tacos and she seriously ROLLED HER EYES!  What are you 12?  Disappointed and won't be back.  There is too much competition popping up in this neighborhood for management to tolerate snotty waitresses.  Will stick with Urban Taco.  The owner comes out multiple times to check how things are, it's a warmer atmosphere and their food is just better."
