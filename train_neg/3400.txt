b'I had such an awful experience. I\'ve never been here before or had their food. I ordered through the phone for pick up. I was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before I could even ask for the total amount (since I don\'t know the total with tax). I went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. I tell this balding older man I\'m here for a pick up. He asks, "The two pizzas?" I said yes with a salad. He then cuts me off mid sentence to say, "yeah yeah whatever." He goes to the back to get the salad so I look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, "move where I can see you." I will never come here again. This serve was down right awful and what made it worse, I was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. The pizza is not even that good!'
