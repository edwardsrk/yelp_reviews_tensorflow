b'In Las Vegas and this is by far my worst shuttle experience. We waited almost an hour for our shuttle to come! Then when it comes time to load up and head out, the driver takes his precious time counting and collecting luggages. He had us wait outside, which was absolutely ridiculous when he could\'ve simply opened the door to let us sit in there and wait for him to check us in. Not only was it already HOT, but now we also had major hot air blowing at us from under his bus! He checked us on the bus one by one, again, taking his precious time! I can go on, but I\'m already too pissed off so in short, we were the last ones dropped off and the "dropping off" of people was not efficient AT ALL!! It was RIDICULOUS!!'
