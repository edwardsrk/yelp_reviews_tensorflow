b"This gym is extremely overcrowded and I have often had people hovering over me when I have been lifting waiting to use the machine I am on.  The front desk staff is not friendly at all.  Whether it's 5am or 3pm instead of saying hello and scanning your key pass, they just stick the key scanner on the counter and put their head down.  There are many times that there are 2 people at the front desk.  Instead of being attentive and scanning your key, they are more concerned about the conversation the two of them are engaged in.  This is when I wish they would just revert back to ignoring you and putting the key scanner on the counter.  I have often asked questions at the front desk about hours, such as a holiday and have been given the cold shoulder.  I feel management needs to train their staff better.  After all if it wasn't for people and their memberships, none of them would have a job.  Another issue is all the women take the smaller pound free weights into the fitness classes and so we are left without any on the racks.  A friendly hello and goodbye would be nice and some attention to the facility.  Also, the spin classes on Sat are ridiculous! You have to get there almost 45min prior to the class starting.  The people that have attended the 1st spin class sign up for the 2nd spin class so there are people that do not get a chance to even attend 1 class.  Then when you do get into a spin class people save bikes and you don't have a choice when you are one of the first ones that got there.  I think management needs to monitor things more.  I could not even tell you who management is.  You never see them or even know they are there.  With all the money we spend for our memberships, there should be more attention to things that need to be changed."
