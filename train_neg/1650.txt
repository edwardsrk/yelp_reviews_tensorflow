b"This place is always busy. The wait is not worth it at all. the food is not well prepared. It's as if the cooks are so busy that they dont care if they overcook or undercook. The last time i was there the eggs had way too much oil/butter and the has browns where undercooked. Just go somewhere else. Vegas is full of places to eat, this is the worst."
