b"Well had heard from my friend that this was the best Italian in the city.  I was very excited.  It didn't take long after arriving to realise that this wasn't up my alley.  Their menu is very weird or uses unusual ingredients.  actually ingredients that not long ago were considered low end.   Beef tongue,  lamb brains, beef heart tartare and blood sausage!  Why try and make inferior cuts edible.  Are they afraid of competition from the many more competent restaurants?  Anyway we ordered the Nordini and some pizza with sausage and dandelions on it.  Then we ordered a $95 steak,  it takes an hour to cook and comes basically raw in the middle.   Barely brown on the outside.   Really under done for me and nothing special to speak of at all.   I have had way better and at half the price.   The pizza was tasty,  but some of them are as much as $25,  seems crazy to me.Not a very good meal,  and I certainly won't be going back or sending anyone I know there.   Definitely over rated and hyped.   There is way better Italian in Toronto than this."
