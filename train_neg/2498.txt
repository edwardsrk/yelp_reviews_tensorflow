b"I have been to Destihl a handful of times, and every time I am disappointed. The restaurant decor is very modern and the menu is impressive - often offering delectable-sounding dishes and impressive combinations. That said, you may be disappointed upon arrival of your meal. The presentation is beautiful, but the taste is so bland. The first time I had a featured soup and sandwich - both just okay. The second time, I had their Rancher burger, which was wayyy overcooked (I asked for medium-rare and got very well done) and the fries were pretty bland. Some words about leftovers from Destihl: you don't want them. They are terrible as next-day meals. Overall, you'll have better luck for your taste buds and wallet by making a trip down the street to Dublin's."
