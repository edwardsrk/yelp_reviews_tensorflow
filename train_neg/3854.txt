b"Not impressed with this place at all!I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  I would pass on this one."
