b'This is one of the worst experiences I\'ve had at a restaurants. We ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. After over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. He said he was too busy to help us. He said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. If we didn\'t want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. Who treats customers like that? I told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. She just shrugged her shoulders and said "do what you have to". I don\'t think I gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. The management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. What a disappointment.'
