b'Worst experience ever! Joy is the manager on duty and she wouldn\'t honor the 5% discount on Yelp! She said it can\'t be applied because it\'s not on the reservation but you have to Check In on Yelp in order to do so. The manager special is for a compact car "Nissan versa, etc" and Sharron, the rep, tried to up sell us to a full size for $10 more per day. We declined and all of a sudden they\'re sold out of all cars and put us in a mini van which is going to be more gas. Joy wouldn\'t even come from the back to talk to us. What an experience.'
