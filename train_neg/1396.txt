b'We stopped here for lunch yesterday (8/23/14).  We were seated in a booth, and waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, a young woman came by and said "I\'ll be right back".  Then she proceeded to go to the hostess stand, look at something, stand there awhile; when the hostess came back, she started a conversation with her - and never even acknowledging us again.  Not even a glass of water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for something to happen (and they were not crowded, there were only about 10-12 tables filled in the entire restaurant).  Finally, since she decided her conversation was more important, we left.  She saw us leave (after all, she was conversing with the hostess) and didn\'t even apologize.  There is no excuse for bad service in ANY restaurant.  Guess there wasn\'t a manager on duty to monitor.'
