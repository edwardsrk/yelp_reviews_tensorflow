b'Went here for a birthday dinner because I wanted to experience Schnitzel...and I am still on the hunt for a proper Schnitzel. Wurst is a good looking place which tries to cover the fact that there food is not so up to par. I mentioned to one of the staff that I did not enjoy my meal and she just shrugged it off trying to defend the place. The portion sizes are not that great either for a "German" bar restaurant, so don\'t go if you are looking for a good German meal. The service  was great though.'
