b"For the love of God, DO NOT order any fancy drinks here. The bartender will get really angry with you and act like you've grown two heads. I honestly didn't think an appletini was a high society drink. Clearly I was wrong. Anything made with vodka is kind of vile as they use Kamchatka. You are much better off ordering a beer or sticking with Coke. It's basically a blue collar bar plain and simple."
