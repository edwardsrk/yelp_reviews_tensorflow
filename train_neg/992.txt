b"Although our server was very cordial and apologetic, service as a whole was still pretty atrocious during our experience. My friend had ordered the shrimp from the appetizer menu as her entree and ordered a side of rice to go along with it, and I ordered the braised pork which already comes with the rice. 20 minutes or so pass by and our waiter brings my friend's shrimp to the table, no rice, at this time my waiter finally remembers to bring me my beer order. We inquire about my friend's missing rice, he brings it over, then shortly after I too get my entree... no rice. I get our waiter's attention once again to inquire about my rice, about 10 minutes later my rice finally makes it to the table, but at this time my entree is no longer hot. Our food was tasty, it was a nice intimate atmosphere, they had a tiny but decent beer selection, but If you're planning on dining here better take a lot of patience with you, (probably not worth a second trip in my opinion) unless they perhaps, get a clue from other yelpers and improve on what seems to be some major communication issues within their staff?"
