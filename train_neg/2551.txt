b"This is such an over priced establishment it's insane how this is a chain. In terms of price no way is it in the right ballpark, the burgers were super small and buying everything separate really sucks because you end up spending way more than with a combo.Service sucked the employees weren't very friendly or caring about a question I asked regarding the food. The manager seemed to be friendly when she was doing refills though.I will say the burger was pretty decent, I was just shocked by how small it was, especially for 6$. The shakes were absolutely abysmal. If I knew that the red velvet shake was just a strawberry shake with red velvet cake chunks in it I probably would've passed, but I guess you have to learn the hard way. This place is just a combination of Smash Burger and Steak n Shake just double the price for not really adding anything new or exciting into the mix. Really disappointed I didn't go elsewhere."
