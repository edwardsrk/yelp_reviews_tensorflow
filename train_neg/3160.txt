b"This place used to do a mean smoked salmon eggs Benedict, but today I discovered it is no longer a good breakfast place. For $15 for eggs Benedict I expect runny poached eggs and actual smoked salmon. But not this one, I had actual canned salmon, a smear of avocado, and hard poached eggs. The waitress didn't even ask for how my eggs were to be done. I will not be returning."
