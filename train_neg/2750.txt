b"This was my first visit EVER to Smashburger. The cooks did a great job. The food was very good, and the girl working the register was very kind. Although the food is a big part of the experience, the customer service is of equal importance. The mod, who I believe was named Matthew, however was VERY unfriendly and not only to the customer, but also to the other employees. I couldn't help but notice him repeatedly give the cashier dirty looks when she walked by. What kind of manager is that? One that makes the customers and other employees uncomfortable? One who makes you feel unwelcome? If you're having a bad day leave it out the door before you come to work.... I can only imagine how he treats his coworkers when the customers aren't around. Unprofessional, unfriendly, cell phone in hand texting..... I don't understand how these unprofessional teenage jerks get hired for management."
