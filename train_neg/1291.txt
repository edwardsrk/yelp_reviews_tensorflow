b"Last Sunday I ordered the Hawaiian Burger, I cut it in half and noticed it was pretty pink on the inside of the patty. Unfortunately I ate it anyway without knowing I could get sick from uncooked beef I figured it was cooked just not thoroughly, well long story short I've had food poisoning since Sunday night & had to get my stomach pumped.I'll never eat here again nor will I refer this restaurant to anyone. I shouldn't have to think twice about if my beef is cooked all the way. I would think that ordering a burger from a 50's styled restaurant would be a safe choice, but I guess not."
