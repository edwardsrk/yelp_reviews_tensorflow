b"We only stopped into the bar and didn't see the evening show. Sitting in the bar area, our server was friendly, and we all ordered a round of sugary frozen cocktails (covered by a Groupon). All of the drinks were quite sweet, which I guess is expected. The frozen lime margarita was okay, but the strawberry was almost undrinkable due to being saccharine sweet, but I guess that is typically of slushy-machine drink. They were out of Mango, which was really disappointing to 3 of our group.  We ordered 2 appetizers also, so combat the sugar rush. The hummus was ok, but came with very few flatbread. The artichoke dip was just ok. Overall, maybe I'd come back for the evening show, but I wouldn't come for drink or food again."
