b"Grossest Chinese food I've ever had. I ordered the PuPu Platter last night and all the appetizers were overcooked. (The egg rolls were almost burnt). I also ordered teriyaki chicken. It looked like no teriyaki chicken I've ever seen. The chicken wasn't pre-marinated and had a sauce the consistency of water that stank. I couldn't eat it. Hugely disappointed and wast of $30 (including delivery fee, tax, tip, etc)."
