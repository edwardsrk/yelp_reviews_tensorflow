b'Another place that goes downhill. This place has gone down from 5 stars to 1 star. Food quality is not the same anymore. Dried overcooked meats is just a no no. It seems they keep everything precooked in the fridge and just heat it up. Not the same quality from 10 months ago. Seems they have tried to save money and its costing them points on the taste department. And the service...JUST HORRIBLE. Crancky ladies taking orders. Give you attitude and make you hesitate to ask for something. That itself makes this a 1 star. Bring back the quality and employees from before!!'
