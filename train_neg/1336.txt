b"This place was decent until I saw them on Dirty Dining. Yes, they got demerits from the health department for not being very clean. I won't be back. I don't believe in giving these places a second chance because after the health department goes away they'll be back to their unclean ways in time. It's too bad, though, because I really liked their mixed won ton soup. Now, no telling where they chopped the vegetables...on top of the garage can?? My health is more important!"
