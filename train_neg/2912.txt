b"If you are going strictly for the quality of food and have an unlimited amount of time to spend- then this restaurant is awesome. However, of you have anything else to do in a day, maybe you'd want to go some place else. I believe we were forgotten about; sat at our table without being checked on for 40 minutes. When I asked if we could have our lunch to go because we needed to get back to work, it still took another 20 plus minutes for that to happen. I believe that they forgot to put in our order until I asked to make it to go. There was never an apology; I'm sorry that took so long, we messed up, or anything.. that is disappointing - as I am empathic to being busy and making mistakes- everyone is human and the food is good. But due to their lack of awareness, empathy or basic customer service; and borderline annoyance of being asked about the side order of kimchi (we were told it was in the ramen bowl, but not visible), I (nor the friends I was with) will not be going back to this establishment."
