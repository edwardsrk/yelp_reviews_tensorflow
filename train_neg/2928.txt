b"I ordered a simple cake for a friend's birthday. I was very specific with the way I wanted the words written on the side of the cake. I also asked for the cake to be ready by 2pm today. When I went to pick up the cake at 3pm the clerk told me that he was going to put the message on the cake. Why wasn't that already done?  When he finally brought it out, he had put the message on the cardboard that the cake sat on.  This is the same person who took the order. I didn't have time to wait for him to redo the icing to add the words to the cake. I was embarrassed to explain to my friend how cute the cake could have been but wasn't.  I specifically went to this bakery to support a local business. Next time, I'll go back to Publix."
