b"If you want a company that no-shows, doesn't call, 2 days in a row, then calls you when they already know you're at work, this is your place.  Throw in the fact that when I called them the first day they were supposed to show up, I left a message and the girl that called me back said they had to reschedule for the next day and she left a message on my wifes phone.  My wife did get a message- AFTER I CALLED TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE FIRST NO-SHOW- She was just covering her back!  Not a company to do business with, shady tactics and they have no problem wasting your time.   This was all through a home warranty, I'd rather pay full price for service than get jerked around just because of what MIGHT be covered under a home warranty."
