b"Was excited to try this new Indian fusion restaurant in Dormont. To start off, my one friend and I split the plate of lamb chops. They were quite overpriced as two  lamb chops were $13. In addition, my friend had the vegetarian curry and was not impressed. It was a dish, but not substantial at all. He is vegan, so he was really disappointed when he could tell that the meal had been contaminated by oil used in meat. He barely touched it and they didn't even take it back or get another option. After a lot of back and forth, they finally took off the vegetable curry. I had the tikka masala grilled cheese, which was fine. The grilled cheese was good and the soup had some hints of Indian spices. My friends enjoyed their tikka masala. Throughout the duration of our meal, three of us never even got refills on water. Towards the end our waitress became apparently hostile. Overall, their food is overpriced for the quality and quantity and their management was just not accommodating. Unfortunately, we will not be back."
