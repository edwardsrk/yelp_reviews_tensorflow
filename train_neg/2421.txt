b"Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  Why a twenty minute range for pickup?  I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.  Hilarious!"
