b"I came here on 9/22  for the Oddball Comedy Festival.  My friend and I felt duped!  Our tickets said 5:00pm. So we thought that was the start time of the show.  I'm not sure if it's Tickmasters fault or Ak-Chin Pavilion, but boy were we mislead. The show didn't start until 7:00pm.  So for two hours we had to kill time with medicore-at-best food with ridiculously expensive drinks( $4.50 for water and $13 for 20oz beer). Thankfully they didn't charge for parking, but I would rather pay for parking and eat at a restaurant with better food than be forced to buy food/drink at the Ak-Chin Pavilion.The sound was decent.  My friend and I sat fairly close in hard plastic chairs. With the show starting at 7 and not ending until 11, the chairs were definitely not comfortable by the end of the night.  Also, like another reviewer stated the huge overhead fans were nice at the beginning of the show, but as the evening progressed and the wind picked up I became very cold in my seat.I don't plan on returning to a venue at the Ak-Chin Pavilion"
