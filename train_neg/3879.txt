b"I went to here for the first time. My bf got out from hospital. We want to get something to eat. We decided to go here because the food looks so good but it actually not good at all. I was really disappointed and i give them a chance once i ordered rice with steak and eggs for to go. When i arrived home to open it. There was not steak in it and the food smell bad! I CAN'T BELIVE IT!"
