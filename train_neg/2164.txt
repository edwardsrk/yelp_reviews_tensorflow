b"Decided to step out from the usual Montana type restaurants and try a more up market place,  tried Falco's with my wife had spaghetti and meatballs which was nice but nothing special she had the white fish with pasta. Food was ok and the food came slow even though only about 4 couples in there but service was good until I had to go ask to pay as server had disappeared talking. Then the bill with tip over 80 bucks.  Half that price  maybe would of let it go but 80?   So won't be repeating."
