b"I am not surprised about the reviews on here as Armenian Kitchen is pretty inconsistent. If I am in the area I might go there for lunch; I have tried them many times over a span of 10 years.I have been to Armenian Kitchen when they served me fresh-made food and it was wonderful.   However, there has been times when it wasn't as good and one time I went there and they served me falafel out of a tupperware that was re-heated in the microwave.  But it wasn't the usual guy that cooks there that did that.Hopefully, they will work things out so they could be good all of the time.I agree with one of the comments on here.   There's a waitress there who is a total ditz."
