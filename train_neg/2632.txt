b"Okay, I've eaten here a number of times, and can truly say that I am un-impressed.  Once you get over the hype/ theme of the restaurant, you will quickly come to learn that the food here can be easily made at home.  Now here is my criticism :1. The food lacked flavor 2. The price for just a single pancake ($7.99) is outrageous 3. The food is never hot4. The coffee is always closed 5. The only free refillable drink here is waterOverall,  my brother enjoys this place but I can definitely miss this."
