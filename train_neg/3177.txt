b"I came here on a busy day and got seated immediately. I didn't find it necessary to be seated immediately if my sushi came an hour later. Their beef sashimi is not authentic . They use raw beef that looks like the ones you would hot pot(sliced). I came here twice and I was happy from my first experience but I guess I was too hungry to truly realize the quality of their food and service. I guess you can't expect much from an all you can eat sushi place."
