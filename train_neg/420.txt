b"the manager of megatunes breathes down my neck every tme i go in. i'm not sure whether he thinks i'm a shoplifter or what, but it's irritating.this store does have more good music than most else in calgary, but frankly i've been feeling a little cheated since i saw the edmonton megatunes! way nicer. no fair! regardless, i check sloth first and buy cds there when i can."
