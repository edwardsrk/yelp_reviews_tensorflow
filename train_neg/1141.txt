b'I Live Right on Parc Avenue, just beside parc metro. I called in for their service after I was pleased with their food and delivery the first time. But this time, they were just rude. Told me that they do not and will not deliver that far. I even told them that I will try and tip the driver a hefty amount, but they just hanged up on me. This is how they start treating their customers when they have the amount they need. Great business mentality you have going on there. I wish you well, but I will not be calling for their service anytime soon.'
