b"Never had a pedicure and it's been years since I had a manicure. Thought I'd do both before my sons wedding. The pedi was great! The manicure left a lot to be desired. I left with dry cuticle untrimmed around each nail and had uneven edges on each nail that needed re shaping. Came home and trimmed cuticle and filed my nails to get rid of the rough edges! Place was clean, staff friendly, but don't see myself returning any time soon!"
