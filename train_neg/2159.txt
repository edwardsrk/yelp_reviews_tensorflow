b"I have to say, after coming back from Korea I figured that Toronto would be able to get their pitas right. You can only imagine how excited I was to move just down the street from a pita place!Turns out it's not so hot. If I'm there I either get unfriendly service or indifferent service. It's not really the most difficult food service job in the world, so skipping on the annoyed attitude or putting on a smile shouldn't be that difficult.The food itself is fairly bland. My pita was stale but I can forgive that if the meat isn't stale. But nope, during my multiple visits I've been greeted with super stale meat to old meat. It's really disappointing to have slightly cardboard-like meat. The pickled veg and peppers are delicious though!I will admit that I have gone on off-lunch hours. So I can understand why food may not be as fresh due to the hours I go in. But that doesn't excuse the service and I'm not too convinced  that mid-afternoon or evening food should be of that quality.I hate handing out poor reviews. I would love it if this store to try to improve themselves a bit and train their workers a bit better, as I don't think it deserves to go under."
