b'A year later still the worst place ever. I went back cuz it\'s close to my place and I was in a hurry. Jason greeted me and said he\'d be doing my gel mani. Since I was going on a 2week vacation I simply said, I need a good job done since I had never had him before. So after polish removal, he starts cutting the heck out of my cuticles and I pulled my hand back and said, please very little cuticle cutting.  He pulled my hand back toward him and said loudly moving his face in my face, "you want a good job?"  WTHell Dude!!! I was so shocked. I\'m sorry for Jason that he hasn\'t met his career goals and is doing nails but since when in North America do I have to have my cuticles cut when I don\'t want to????    He was rough and rude and angry. It was an even worse experience than I had a year before. Never again, no matter what.'
