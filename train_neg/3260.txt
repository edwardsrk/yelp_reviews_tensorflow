b'We were encouraged by the crowd, but unfortunately it was disappointing.  We were seated promptly enough, but waited five minutes for someone to realize we had no coffee or  water. We immediately placed our order while we had the waitresses\' attention.  It was 25 minutes later that we were served a cold waffle and "heat lamp" bacon.  My Husband\'s meal was warm so that\'s why I gave two stars rather than one.  With the food\'s flavor being nothing special and the service being average, we won\'t be back.'
