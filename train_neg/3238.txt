b"Inferior walnut cakes.  Tasteless chocolate chip cookies.  Will not return.  I would probably think the walnut cakes were ok if I'd never been to Hodo Kwaja but ... I have.  The custard filling was lacking in quantity - and it didn't taste that good anyways.  Prices a bit more expensive than Hodo Kwaja.  I'll allow that I got these 4 hours or so after baking but I don't think I'll bother giving a re-try - the smallest amount you can buy is 10 which is more than I'd like to make available to myself to eat.The chocolate chip cookies weren't good.  That's really all I can say about them.  Good amount for $5.  Maybe that's why quality was not so great."
