b"They would get a much lower score if possible. If you are looking to visit a JITB, drive another mile and go to another one. I was appalled at the lack of service and the inaccuracy of the order. Sauces were left off a burrito, food was burned, incorrect condiments given, SLOW service, and a group of workers that could not get their act together. It is a dirty store outside (I went through the drive through). When I complained to JITB through their survey, they couldn't even get that right! Never again!"
