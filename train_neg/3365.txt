b"Just a few words to describe our recent visit. You'll be leaving this place hoping you never stepped foot inside. My first impressions were fantastic, that is, if I wanted to have an extra pretentious dinner...The service staff were about as friendly as a Waffle House in New Jersey, and if you're not from the shores, allowed me to explain....they're not. Food is definitely subpar. If there was a bar or some sort of standard of quality and taste, they definitely lowered it underground to allow such restaurant to remain in existence. Yelp should allow the ratings of negative stars in cases of such extreme substandards. This is one of those cases. Clever Koi...clever not to come out to this place maybe. Good atmosphere. Crappy service, except for the manager, maybe too much attention was paid to our party...oh well...that ship has sailed. Food could not be any worse. Enough said...Only rating 2 stars for the beautiful host!"
