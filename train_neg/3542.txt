b'Dr Nasim McDermott, Internist was fine, but office and her staff need help. I prepped for colonoscopy and then got word the wrong insurance was filed from my insurance company., Had to cancel procedure.  Also Dr. requested prior copies of colonoscopies.  I located them, but could not get office to respond to send a cover letter and fax to request them. Gave up after 2 weeks of unreturned phone calls.  I had to make a visit to see the office staff to reschedule colonoscopy because they do not answer phones.  Never respond!!!! POOR POOR SERVICE.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE.  By the way, I was told by procedure/surgical center this is a common complaint with this office.'
