b'If i could rate a 0 I would. My wife and I dined in and sat there and waited for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I had to get up and ask who was in charge of the area where i was sitting. The woman came and brought us water took our order and left to not be seen again for 15-20 min. The sushi rolls were bland and flavorless. We only went there because someone gave us a giftcard to that place...thank goodness it was free, I would never pay to eat at that dump. Please dont waste your money, there are better options.'
