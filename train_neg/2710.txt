b"Dr. Jordan is great so I hate to write a negative review but the staff is pretty bad. With the exception of Cindy who has been very helpful. I've called with questions multiple times and when the person who answered the phone didn't know how to answer my question they told me someone would call back in a few minutes with an answer. No one ever called back. I recently received an email saying I'm due for an exam with an option to request an appointment online, which I chose. It asked me to put in 3 options for dates and times, then told me none of them were available and someone from the office would contact me. 4 business days later & no contact. I called and told the woman who answered I'd like to make an appointment for an exam and that I've been there before. She couldn't find my information and started entering me as a new patient. Then told me my insurance didn't cover contacts, which isn't correct. When I questioned that she asked again if I had been there before & then was able to find my information and tell me I wasn't covered for another month. Why am I getting notices if my insurance isn't covering anything for another month? Apparently I've had a different experience than most reviewers here & if it were a one time thing I wouldn't be bothered. Unfortunately it happened a few times with phone calls and the most recent appointment experience leave me wanting a new office..."
