b"I went with the ziti. Just as I remembered, the sauce was awful. The pasta was in a pool of water and the sauce had zero flavor. I just feel like a sauce can make or break the meal, and it was tasteless-- no garlic, onion, wine, basil.. Nothing. The portion was also quite small for the price. It was clearly boxed pasta and not homemade, so why so stingy? I'm surprised there are such high reviews on here actually as my experience and my family's experience wasn't great. I guess it's a decent place for families, but I would definitely go to a different Italian restaurant if you're looking for good food."
