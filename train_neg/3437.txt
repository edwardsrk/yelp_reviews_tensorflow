b"Went for quick breakfast solo at 8am.  Setting - Simple location, somewhat sterile and bordering on warm.  Nice bar seating a window tables.  Tucked in the west corner of Piedmont Row shops.  Parking was easy in the adjacent parking deck.Food - They have waffles.  The waffles, being pre-made earlier, don't really have that freshness.  The consistency goes slightly chewy.  But dang, the offering are a diabetics worst nightmare.  Maple, bacon, quadruple berry, chocolate everything.  I just wanted a waffle with some fruit, so I went with the berry.  It was kind of a compote, with really think syrup.  My teeth just itched.  And I don't need the dollop of whipped cream to be bigger than the waffle.  This was dessert, not breakfast.Coffee was alright.Service - It was empty, so I got prompt service, and received my food at the counter in about 4 minutes.  I wouldn't go so far as to see the employee was warm or engaging, but hey, they weren't rude.Price - $7.50 for a waffle the size of my hand and a cup of coffee.  Not outrageous.I'm glad I went to check it out, but I'll stick to Original Pancake House or Terrace Cafe."
