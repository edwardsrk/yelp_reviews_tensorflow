b'I ordered a pizza at 4:49. Got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. Called the store. They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD.'
