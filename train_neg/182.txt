b"I came here Christmas Day 2017 to grab a few items the cashier didn't acknowledge me I asked how she was doing she ignored me was absolutely disrespectful. And I came back 15-mins later to return one of the items I bought, I  was with a new cashier and the original cashier made a scene asking if I was ok I had been sniffing my nose but her co-worker who was making a purchase tells me that the original cashier who rung me out says I looked tense. It was humiliating, customers began to stare and I got the manager involved. I was in tears over this. NOT everyone who does returns is a criminal."
