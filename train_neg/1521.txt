b'They just keep making this place worse. Now TSA checkpoint A is a narrow (extremely narrow) hallway that has absolutely no utility, except to bypass a larger screening area where TSA agents just stand around and do nothing. While the vast majority of passengers are sent down the narrow corridor of hell. Really great job Cleveland!'
