b'WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER! I GOT SHRIMP A LA PUBE HAIR. So I just left this roach motel and I am sick so I am letting people know. I went there because my co-worker heard it was ok. Unfortunately for me I paid before eating so the chairs all have holes in them and the place looks creepy and no one, and I do mean no one, speaks English, which would not have been a problem  had not pulled hair from my food! I had not eaten very much when I asked for the manager, who I now refer to as, "Chow Mein". She was the rudest monster I have ever seen, and I watch horror films. Chow Mein screamed at me in Chinese and refused to do anything. Unfortunately, since I had paid already ofcourse she would not give me back my money or do anything to make up for the fact that her hair was in my food. All she did was scream at me. The waitress even told her that I did not eat and was there to witness me pull the hair from my food and Chow Mein was mad at the waitress for admitting it was in my food. Needless to say I urge you to eat anywhere else but here! i am sick and I may leave work early because my stomach is so upset.'
