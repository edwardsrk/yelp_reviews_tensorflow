b'I\'ve been here twice, once with my guy and once with my mom. They bring out really yummy hot bread with butter before the meal, and even as a bleu cheese hater, I stole some of my mom\'s dressing because it was homemade and delicious. So, 2 stars for salad and bread.I\'m not picky about where I sit in a restaurant (I\'m not that jerk who insists on a booth with my nose turned up when I walk in) but the tables in this place are super impersonal and small. I felt kind of... crunchy and exposed to the group of loud men sitting 7 inches away from my table at the next table.The first time I ate here I had a meatball sandwich. The second time, spaghetti with meat sauce (which turned out to be crumbled meatballs mixed in with the sauce.) both times it was good, but even as a garlic lover, the garlic is overwhelming. Seriously, guys, those meatballs are a nuclear threat if the imbiber utters an H word. Your date will be giving you the side face ALL NIGHT LONG. You will reek of garlic for a month. Go ahead, argue with me that this won\'t happen because you love garlic and eat heads of it as a snack. try the meatballs. I DARE YOU. I thought the meat sauce would not have the garlic permeation of the meatballs, but the crumpled meatballs threw me for a loop. So here I sit, in a cloud of garlic odor... :) not getting any kisses tonight.The service the first time I went in, was strange. Some guy was behind the counter and I told him I needed a second to order. So he sat 2 tables away watching me. Then asked 25 seconds later if I was ready. No. 20 seconds later, are you ready? jeez, I guess I\'d better be... This time, the service was better although the server was having a hard time with a family who\'d ordered 1 sandwich for 4 people and insisted on a free meal because the sandwich was "wrong." So she was flustered and unable to get to my table to check on us. which I understand.I just probably won\'t be back.'
