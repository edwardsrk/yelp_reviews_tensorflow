b'The Absolute worst store!!!!!!! This is the 3rd time that they have screwed up my order and have done nothing about it. This time was really bad. I did an online order, clearly spelled out with what I wanted. Salad and smoothie. I sent my receptionist to pick up and she came back with a smoothie only and it was the wrong smoothie. I called in and let them know. The guy Billy that picked up was to say the least an idiot. He had no idea how to handle it and blamed it on me and the online order. I was charged twice for this and got nothing that I actually ordered and no food. So I paid $32 for a smoothie that tasted like crap. It was made poorly and had to be thrown out. It was that badly prepared. When I called back in the other guy was rude and had no idea how to seal with it and said a manager would have to call me after 3:00 because they did not know how to refund or do anything for that matter. I normally go to this location during the summer for breakfast and I can honestly say you have list my business over this. I will never go this Tropical smoothie again. I will travel down the way to Jamba Juice, they do not mess up my orders. My opinion is the 2 guys there need to be fired, they really do suck!'
