b"The super market is ok.  I ordered bibimnengmyun at seoul korean food.  The portion isn't what I'm used to.  Very little for the price i paid.  The lady there wears gloves to handle cash then handles food.  I was so grossed out. I couldnt enjoy my food. I mean what's the point in wearing gloves then.  My egg looked like it was peeled by a noob.  Parts of the egg were missing... Ewwww and it tastes so bad.  Flavor was lacking. Spice was lacking.  I did get a side of kim chi. But... Not worth what i experienced.I'm sad. I want my money back."
