b"I went to your store yesterday to buy Malibu! But an employee of your store, I forgot his name? Bald, with glasses, like an Asian! I don't know if it is the person in charge! He didn't want to sell the car to me! ! ! His service is very poor! ! ! If the price I said is unacceptable! We can discuss it again! But the Asian employee refused! Let me cancel the plan to buy a car! I originally wanted a fullpayment! But still thanks to Rachel for helping me with great patience!"
