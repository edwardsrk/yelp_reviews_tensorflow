b"I love a good prime rib and had such high expectations based on other reviews that I was disappointed to find the food very bland.  There service is exceptional and decor is straight from the 40's which made it a fun place.   It was a weird to me that the waitresses wear uniforms from the 40's.  They actually look like nurses.  It wasn't too far from the strip but unless someone else pays their high prices we won't be coming back.  Still in search of that elusive good steak in Vegas."
