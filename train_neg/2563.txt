b'Nothing to write home about. The ambience was nice and the service was friendly. We ordered take out. I got The Rebel, my husband got the Spicy Salmon Nabemono and my friend for the mix-n-match. The flavor was good. Not great but good. You can definitely taste that there are high quality ingredients used but it was nothing stellar. Now for the portion sizes. I would give that one star. All three of us joked about going out to dinner AFTER we had finished. The portion sizes are small and do not warrant the high price tag. After all My wrap plus iced tea was $17 without tax! Not something you expect to pay for a wrap a few pieces of lettuce and an iced tea.  We will not be back. We feel like FOX concepts struck out on this one. If you want great flavor, high quality and better portions do take out or eat in at True Food Kitchen.'
