b"Do not waste your hard earned money here, there are several other country bars around, go to them!My husband and I's 2nd trip here this past Friday has me determined never to return as well as to spread the word of how horrible the service, food and management was! We waited over 15 minutes to be served, my order was not only wrong but RAW! The management staff was so ignorant to comment that I'll be fine as people consume raw fish all the time. The gal serving asked if we needed a to go box as my husband pointed at both I nodded and she removed my plate and threw it away! This was a FULL plate of food, I had probably 3 bites no joke. She then insisted ONLY my husband asked for a to-go box although he pointed and I nodded. Not only that, but our tab, HA! Nothing done, no offer for dessert either. This was the 2nd trip - both a waste of time and money. So disappointed in the brand altogether. Stay away! I know others who have gotten sick too!"
