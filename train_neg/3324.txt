b"Slow service, the branch manger who is an older blonde lady with glasses is very rude.If it wasn't for member rep Keri I would have given this place a zero. The branch manager could learn how to treat customer from her member reps. There were about 7 people in line and 2 tellers. HAd to wait forever to get service in lobby from a banker though"
