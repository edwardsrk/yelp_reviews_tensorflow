b'Ok, so I will start with the service was good. I did have to ask for more water but, I can deal with that. A co-worker and I went for lunch as its next to the new Denny\'s on Fremont Street and wanted to try somewhere new. We ordered the calamari and caprese salad for the appettizers. The calamari was good but, the sauce could have used some "umf" to it. The caprese was really good. I would have liked a little balsamic for it but, I just added some salt. I ordered the spaghetti ai pomodorini. My only request was no tomatoes (not fond of cooked ones) and to use angel hair instead. What I got was angel hair in butter. No flavor what so ever. There was hardly any basil or garlic. So basically, we had an expensive work lunch ($50 for both of us) and it had no taste. Now I\'m not a cheapskate but, I want what I pay for. I won\'t say I wouldn\'t try it again but, maybe next time I\'ll do a dinner and see if its any better.'
