b"I have  been using their oil/lube shop for some time.  I actually take 2 cars for oil changes.  Now that it is winter, I decided to give their car wash a try.  I printed a coupon from their web site and was appalled when they would not accept it.  When I asked them to explain this, I WAS CALLED AN 'ASSHOLE' IN FRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS.  There is no reasoning with the people who own this operation.  They recognize me from my oil change visits, yet seemed OK to insult me and simply act in an explainable way.  My suggestion to anyone who visits this shop/carwash is to stay away! They do not deserve your business. AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT FAIR AND REPUTABLE BUSINESS PRACTICE.  STAY AWAY!"
