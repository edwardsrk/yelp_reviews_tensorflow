b'I have had three experiences with little snips, one meh, one not-so-good and one downright terrible. My first time in I was just attempting to make an appointment, I stood there for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence, only then to be told someone would come help me soon. After another 5 minutes I decided it wasn\'t worth my time to wait around, it didn\'t seem like anyone cared that I was there. My second experience I actually got an appointment but the lady was snippy because we were a few minutes late. Ok fine, sorry I was a little late, but this set my two year old off on the wrong foot. We want this to be a positive experience for him and are expecting that out of a children\'s salon. He could totally read her negativity and was afraid to get in the chair, normally he is very good about haircuts. My third and final attempt to go to Little Snips I made an appointment and showed up on time only to discover a closed sign on the door. The sign said "will return at 1", my appointment was for 12:30. Luckily instead of just waiting I decided to call and the message on the answering machine said they decided to close for the day due to weather. Thanks a lot for calling and letting me know!!! I had no problem loading up my two kids and making it there on time, so I really don\'t understand why they closed. It is however, in my opinion, fine to close your store... but it is absolutely not ok to not let your clients with appointments know about it! Terrible customer service at this place! I won\'t be back.'
