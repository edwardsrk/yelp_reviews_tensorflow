b'Husband was going to take me to a pricy French restaurant for date night.  I didn\'t like the menu choices so I made a reservation at Mariner\'s Inn.  I\'ve heard soooo many rave reviews, and how fabulous the seafood is. We were extremely  disappointed.  First, the decor is very dated and dirty.  The wait staff was pleasant. Appetizer was the stuffed seafood mushrooms and they were better then they looked.  However, my steak and lobster was way over priced, had no taste almost like it wasn\'t seasoned at all and the "famous" hash browns sat in a pool of grease.  We will not be back and unless they revamp the whole place, chef included I don\'t see how the will stay open.'
