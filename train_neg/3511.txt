b'Very clean hotel.jacuzzi is very huge,shower and bathroom are huge and clean.view was nice although it was the back of the hotel.lobby was nice and valet was great.now the bad.tv kept freezing every few hours for several minutes at a time.we were on the 55th floor and heard the train EVERY night all thruout the night loud and clearly.im a freight train engineer for u.p. and thats the last thing i want waking me up away from work,so that makes 6 nights of broken sleep all night,never good.i would not stay here again as we all know in vegas most people are in their hotel only to sleep.'
