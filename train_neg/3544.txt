b'I had been dying to try this restaurant since it opened, and finally decided to check it out for Sunday morning brunch. It was extremely crowded, there were no tables, and the line took forever. But, okay, that\'s fine, I\'m a patient person. I was ordering for three people- I got two biscuits- add fried eggs for $1 each, a fancy drink for me, and oatmeal plus a biscuit with jam for my husband. So we finally get to sit down and the waitress comes out and says they are out of oatmeal and asked my husband to pick something else. He gets grits and they came out first. We wait a bit and our biscuit sandwiches come out but no biscuit for him. The guy asks if we have everything and we let him know the biscuit is missing. He says he\'ll go get one but then he never came back. I start to eat and realize there\'s no egg on my sandwich. My mom says she didn\'t get her egg either. So we grab the waitress and tell her we still don\'t have my husband\'s biscuit and neither of us got eggs. I say it\'s no big deal, just bring the biscuit and can I just get my money back for the eggs. She goes "it\'s only $2 dollars plus tax. Do you really care about getting $2 back?"  Ummm, yes, I do. I say that I would like my $2 back, it may only be $2 but I paid for something I didn\'t get. She says "I don\'t think $2 is a big deal but I can get it for you, it\'s fine." Hello, Rude. So she walks away and at this point I realize I\'m thirsty- I never got my drink!" So I just go inside and say I never got my drink. The cashier tells me I should have gotten it when I ordered. Okay, well I didn\'t, no one offered it to me or told me I needed to wait for it. So I FINALLY get my drink and I asked her for my money for the eggs, and I see the waitress coming out of the back with my husband\'s biscuit. She asked me to take it to him, lol. The service was terrible but the food was pretty good. I doubt I\'ll be back, though.'
