b'Service-Brand disconnect @Biltmore. Others have commented on the beauty and layout of this store, it\'s true: very nice. But recent experience not so great. Went in to buy a beautiful Chan Luu scarf in orange I saw a week ago. Couldn\'t stop thinking about it: a good sign I should buy it. It was gone. Seeing my disappointment, the sales woman offered to get it from another store. Perfect. She took me back to the "behind the wall" scruffy service area (wow, Saks, might need a paint job back there if you intend customers to see it), and proceeded to take my address info and credit card. At the end of the transaction, I asked her if she was sure she ordered the orange scarf. She assured me yes, although could not show me on the order that it was indeed the orange one. "Well, it has to be the one they call \'melon.\' There really was no other option." Hmmm. Then, I noticed a $15 "ground" charge. This was a shock. "I\'m paying $15 in shipping?" I asked. "Yes, unless you use your Saks card, you pay shipping." A) You\'ve got to be kidding me, I would have gone down to Scottsdale Fashion Mall myself. B) You assess this charge without even letting a customer know that would be the case? C) $15 to ship a wispy scarf?  Not your best, Saks. Definitely a brand disconnect from a customer experience view.'
