b"I haven't been here in a while because eating here was like highway robbery.  Most of my family lives on the West Coast where the frozen yogurt craze started.  There's a system that is exactly the same at each yogurt store and no one differentiates from it.  Because it works.  Customers get their cup, pick their yogurt, scoop on their own toppings and pay per weight.  Usually you can get a decent sized cup with more than enough toppings for about 3-4 bucks.  I don't think I've walked out of Spoon Me spending less than 5 bucks after all was said and done.  Unless I want a small yogurt with no toppings.  Everything is ala carte.  Toppings..extra.  Fresh fruit...even more.   The yogurt tastes pretty good and I know it's not bad for you but with more and more yogurt places opening around here I probably won't take time out to stop."
