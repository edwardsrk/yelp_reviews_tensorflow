b'Very disappointed in this company. They called and told me they would be there between 7am and 1pm. When it was 1:30pm I called them to see where they were and they said they told me 1pm-7pm was the window. Which was not true, but fine. They\'re employee showed up at 4pm and took one look at my water heater and said, "Oh. It\'s a Kenmore. We don\'t work on Kenmore\'s." NOW WOULDN\'T THAT BE A QUESTION THEY SHOULD\'VE ASKED BEFORE THEY SENT SOMEONE? Of course, one could argue I could\'ve also asked that... but my job isn\'t to repair water heaters. And my business isn\'t specializing in plumbing, heating and HVAC and appliances and repairs as they say theirs is. I would not recommend this company, and further more if my home owners insurance requests them again, I will ask for another company.'
