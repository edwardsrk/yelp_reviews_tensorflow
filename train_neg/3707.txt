b'Supposedly the "premier" dining venue of the Arizona Biltmore, the "premier" part was missing. The waiter was a bit too casual in his style in this type of venue and was never around when you needed a new drink or had a question. Their version of Onion Soup was a slice of cheese in the middle of a large shallow bowl containing a fairly bland broth. The lamb sirloin on black garlic risotto was tough and tasteless. The risotto was undercooked. The halibut Oscar did not have much flavor. We don\'t mind paying for a really nice meal. This was not a really nice meal and was therefore way overpriced.'
