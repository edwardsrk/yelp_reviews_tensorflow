b'Basing this review on the service. We sat for almost 10 minutes with no one approaching us. A table was sat next to us, then a guy comes by and asks for our order. The server to the table next to us, brought this chalkboard with specials on it, which I never saw, they also got their order in within minutes of sitting. Food was good, but I work in the industry. This was awful.'
