b"yo, this location is as bad as these other reviews make it out-staff didn't know menu/ specials that we came for-dropped one of our orders on the floor in front of us -packed so that my food all fell out of containers into bag anyway-one order of mashed potatoes didn't even have gravy-lobby a mess-watched someone order and pay for a large order of spicy only to be told they don't have any -no napkins/ utensilsall of these seem minor but all in the course of a 3 minute stop? naw. just go to a different location. this one apparently doesn't even participate in the monthly specials/ promotions which is the reason I go to this chain in the first place"
