b"As I was looking for a doctor that specializes in tonsils for children I came across Valley ENT. The reviews are great and everything seemed OK I make a call in at 4:45 I'm on hold for a while. The lady who help me on the other line sounded like she was more into what she was chewing what she had in her mouth then talking to me. I was asking certain questions like do they take my insurance? When's the soonest the doctor has an opening? Are they good with children? She seemed to blow off every question I was asking her. I asked if they took my insurance and she says that we would have to call them ourselves to make sure that they are in network they take other Blue Cross Blue Shield but was unsure if they took the Michigan one. I didn't have a problem calling my insurance company but when I asked to please schedule since it was almost 4 weeks out until I can get my daughter in she hangs up on me! I try I try to call back at that time it was 5 PM and I got the answering service, it is so frustrating I wish I got her name so I could call the office manager in the morning. I will definitely be looking for another place to take my daughter to because obviously they don't care about customer service or building the patient relationship what kind of office is this? If I were you I would look at other resources than this office."
