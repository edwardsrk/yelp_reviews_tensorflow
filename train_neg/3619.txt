b"Hmm, not sure if its just this time that I wasn't impressed, but this is a cafe I don't regularly come to. Gotta say, it was an underwhelming experience. First off, the wait on a Saturday was a bit long for a cafe like that, but at the same time, not surprising considering the location. Upon sitting down, they moved us to another table. A bit annoying, but okay since we moved to a more comfortable table.We ordered the BBQ Pork and Curry Beef Tendons, but both were a bit off. The BBQ was all overcooked, making the meat a bit tough. I personally like my BBQ pork tender with some fat on it, so it was a bit hard to eat. The curry was too sweet, as the balance of flavours was off. With too much sweetness and not even saltiness/spice, it made the curry unbearable. Thankfully, the Milk Tea was quite good, making it the best part of the meal. Service wasn't all that great either. I understand working quickly/efficiently to have a faster turnover rate of customers, but you can also be a little nicer. One server was just kinda bitchy when she took our orders. Not the best cafe I've been to, and don't plan on going back anytime soon. Ended up here on a secondary option, so it's not an ideal situation anyways."
