b"On Veterans Day we were dinning at Denny's next door. They came in yelling that if anyone had parked in their parking lot they had tow trucks coming.  Apparently whoever was managing that day was making sure that people were getting towed if they felt the vets were not at Wendy's but Denny's. Not that I don't agree that if it happens on a regular basis it should be addressed.  I mean it's one day a year.  All the times I've gone through there NO ONE was searching for parking in order to go eat at Wendy's. No better way to not get people to frequent your establishment then throwing a fit! GREAT JOB MANAGER! I actually use to work for Wendy's when I was a kid but I find this behavior disgusting. Also to be noted I had ordered from this location previously had they'd gotten it wrong a few times. The unpatriotic behavior just sealed the deal and I will no longer be going to any Wendy's establishment. I'm sure the gaggle of vets that were there will no longer be purchasing anything from their either."
