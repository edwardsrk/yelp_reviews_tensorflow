b"The diner in the Silver Nugget is Hometown kitchen and let me tell you it was not the business when it came time to eat . You would have had better luck at AM/ PM or 7-11.  A party of 3 ( Us ) walk in and we are seated the waitress comes brings us water as we requested then came back and took out order .  She comes back to tell E she can't sub the sides to what I ordered ??  Ot would be a full charge to do that .. Why ??  I may be  the only person to not like okra ??  Any ways I change my order and then we wait ... person 1 & 2 ordered a Salisbury steak medium ,  with 2 sides a veggie blend and a baked potato  what comes out is a hamburger patty burnt cold mixed veggies and a cold baked potatoes  person 3 ordered a Rib eye  what comes out ?? A T - bone .. the manager who came out was dressed in street clothes . For all I know he could have been a customer.  He did not address the problem just laughed it off and said oh well the cook is new ... and the waitress didn't know what she was serving ... just bad allAround   I would not give a start if I didn't have to"
