b"hi, went to anthonys last thurs. night with a party of seven. We were celebrating an anniversary , we all dressed up to the nines ! ! wanted to have a fun nite out ! the food is good, very high end .  2 of us ordered the prime rib, 2 others ordered filet, 3 others steak, plus apps of sashimi, tator tots, mashed potatoes, spinach, lobster bisques for all, they do charge extra for everything... so watch out,we sat outside it is a nice view..... now the bad part... our waiter, Fabio. I don't like to be disrespectful to our food servers here in Vegas cuz they do work hard, but Fabio isvery rude, rushed us during our ordering, did not want to explain the specials after my uncle asked a question, he said he did not know, did not bring our drinks until after our dinner was served by someone else, he was very rude when we asked for another martini and never brought it. he also did not bring water until we asked four times cuz we passed on the bubbles water, he also tried to take out plates before we were done ! the place was empty, three times he wanted to take my plate with food on it ...jeeeez..... Anthonys please he needs more training on how to treat customers :("
