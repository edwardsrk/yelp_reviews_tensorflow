b'I\'ve been coming here for years. But after today I won\'t be coming back. They sat us down, gave us our menus and never can back.we waited for 20min until we finally gave in a flagged a random waiter. He took our order, brought us water and never came back. Another 30min went by and the people who came after us got their food first. We finally decided to leave and go somewhere else. I went as talked to the manager who offered us the meals on the house but we were done by that point. One of the waiters decided he\'d join the conversation and he  explained that and I quote " we are busy and the large party ahead of you took extra care, everyone has to wait". So don\'t go during peak hours because they can\'t handle it and stopping by your table to let you know the situation is above the customer service they can offer. I was glad he said that because then it became clear they don\'t care. FOOD: The food is  average and decently priced. The combination pho is probably the best and they have various sizes depending on how much you want. They have a good and varied drink selection. I\'d give a try to one of their house specialty drink that are always changing.'
