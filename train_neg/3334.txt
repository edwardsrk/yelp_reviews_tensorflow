b"Such a shame, could be outstanding but ends up flat. A great location cool old building with great bones. That's where it ends the music was extremely loud for a dinner time setting. The service was terrible we ordered cocktails 5 min before our dinner was ordered and our entrees came out before the drinks did. The Manhattan was average (coming from a former bartender that's being generous). As for the meal, my wife ordered the quesadilla and it was above average. I ordered the London broil which is one of my favorite dishes and was disappointed, the marinade was bland the meat was undercooked and cut incorrectly.   Overall we would not return which is a shame because we are in this area often for shows at the music factory."
