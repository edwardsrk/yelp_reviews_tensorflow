b'I see all the 5 star reviews and wonder "Why?" If they\'re going to make me wait an hour and a half for an oil change (with an appointment), at least have comfortable seating and decent wifi. Maybe they treat you better when you don\'t have a discount card. Will not return but I\'m sure they couldn\'t care less.'
