b'I had a couple of gripes about this place, that left me unimpressed. For one, it took them 20 mins to finish our order...this seemed long for a sandwich place with ~4 lady\'s working. But, my major issue was when I got home I saw they had switched up our order too, totally wrong sandwich for me and they put mayo on mine despite my specific request to not have it. I know mistakes happen so...I called them about it and the worker who answered the phone had no phone etiquette. After hearing my complaint she shouts to her coworkers "who made the firehouse sub? You messed up, ya, you give her the wrong sandwich. (Loud sigh) let me talk to my manager, hey this lady is calling cause we gave her the wrong sub, ya I know it was ___ she knows she messed up." SO Awkward. I decided to not go back after that weird interaction even though they offered to replace it.'
