b'I had the worse service at this location yesterday. After my car got hit in a parking lot while it was parked while I was working. I had to take my car in for collision repair. The collision place called this location for me and they came and picked me up. Ok so then after going through the whole entire transaction and being told that it was a 50.00 deposit and a hold would be placed on my debit card. I had to transfer money from one account to another. I was then told that my card didn\'t go through as it was not the 50.00 hold it would be 52.00 and due to the fact that I had already transferred what was supposed to be enough it was 2 dollars more. They could not use my card again until 24 hours went by to redo the transaction. This is one stupid procedure that kept me from getting a rental that I needed. She showed no interest in helping me or even bending the rules a bit to get me a vehicle. The person that was doing the transaction was stupid and the so called manager was dumb as hell and wouldn\'t not come from the back of the room. She just sent some little lame stupid guy to stop me from doing what they think all blacks do is get "Violent" which I do not do. Horrible service, a great deal of racial profiling in this location. Stay away from this location at all cost. I proceeded to walk over to Enterprise Rental and got a car and was out of their in 30 minutes at the Autoplex center.'
