b"Bad location right on main road with cars buzzing by. Poor on street parking. Subpar beers. Had about 5 IPA's. No variety. Food was poor. Chicken sandich with avocado was terrible. I was looking forward to some creamy avocado, but bit down into som w thing very hard, harder than raw carrots. It was the avocado s. The cook should know his produce and never sent that out. Customer service is poor."
