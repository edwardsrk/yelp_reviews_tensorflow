b"So I'm a food blogger and I have my own website where people can see all the places I've traveled to and criticize the food. Unfortunately, this place didn't make it on my list .. It's a new place & my boyfriend and I came in thinking it would be really great. There was a woman that seated us but was not at all friendly. We felt as if we were being rushed and there no great customer service at all what so ever. The male servers were kind at least. Ramen was okay. We both ordered the miso ramen. They say it's thick noodles but it seems thin? It isn't as good as jinya, monta or Fukiramen. But this place is new so hopefully it gets better! They just need to work on those few things. At least we have this place a chance."
