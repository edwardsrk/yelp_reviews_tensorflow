b'Giordano\'s is a well known Chicago Restaurant that\'s famous for their Chicago Style Stuffed Deep Dish Pizza. They also offer Hand Stretched Thin Crust Pizza and Crispy Extra Thin Pizza. On the menu are appetizers, salads, sandwiches, pasta and more.On Yelp I read about the long wait times so I planned to try them when they opened. At that time parking was easy and we got sat pretty much right away. We were soon greeted by our waiter who informed us that the pizzas take 45-60 minutes to prepare. We shared an entree sized Harvest Salad. The salad contained fresh mixed greens, dried mix fruit, candied walnuts and lots of blue cheese. This salad runs on the bitter side from all the radicchio in it.During our wait for the pizzas at least three servers besides our waiter checked on us and offered more beverages, ice for my tea and other things. I found it refreshing that the staff worked as a team and showed great hospitality.Just like our waiter promised we received our pizzas in about 50 minutes after ordering.I received my individual stuffed plain pizza. The pizza wasn\'t sliced all the way through and I found it difficult to cut a slice as the crust was xtra dense, hard and thick. Kinda like a rock. The crust was filled with a very large molten disk of blended cheese that was topped with a oregano laced tomato sauce. The very top of the crust was bitter and burnt tasting. Although I found the cheese tasty and the sauce ok in the end it was the crust that I found inedible. I don\'t know if the crust I received is typical of Giordano\'s or not. My husband somehow ate his pizza crust and all. He said that he was glad that he wasn\'t hungry afterwards and yes he said the crust was awful but he ate it anyway. He did say that the sausage was much better than the lean sausage the "Other" Chicago place uses.I really liked the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the well trained servers I encountered.I would never go back for the pizza I received.'
