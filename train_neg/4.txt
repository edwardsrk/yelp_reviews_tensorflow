b"Tried to have my car repaired.  Even made an appointment.  I was told that all my appointment was for is to meet the service advisor, not get any work completed on my car.  Such a waste of time.  Even talked to the Service Manager, he didn't care.  Since that was the attitude of the service department, I can only expect that from the mechanics that would have worked on my car.  Went to another dealership, made an appointment and my car went in to be repaired.  Not told to come back later and they might get to my car. Very poor service."
