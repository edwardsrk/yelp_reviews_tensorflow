b'I would Never coming back here ever!!!! Make a appointment with my regular tech. They said she is not here today but the truth is she no longer work there. The girl Jantra that did my nails did a horrible job. My nails were very ugly , crooked, and misshaped.  Come on it is a fill!!!  She told me that the owner and the employees there is treating her very poorly. I was so shocked to hear her  talked about one of her coworker (the lady that sit in the front). After that she ask for my phone number saying that she is gonna to rent a station soon and would call me to make a nail appointment with her.THIS place is very expensive and they are treated the clients very rudely. I miss all the people that work there before the new ownership.'
