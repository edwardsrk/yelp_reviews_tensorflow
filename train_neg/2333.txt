b"We dined here on 06/05/14.Was super excited to celebrate my husband's birthday at this restaurant. The waiter was extremely pushy regarding the drinks and I felt as though he was constantly rushing us through ordering and our meal.Appetizers were blue corn pancake with duck & blue corn lobster tacos. Both were OK. The duck was covered in a lot of sauce for my personal taste buds and was a touch boring. The taco was OK but very underwhelmed.I ordered the filet medium and husband ordered the NY strip medium. It was explained to us that medium was PINK. My steak was medium rare. I told the waiter and he said that was what he told me. OK waiter person, whatever you say. I just wasn't in the mood to fight with him.The sides were very good. The horseradish twice baked potato and the corn cojita.Was disappointed in the dessert after just one bite.Credit Card was authorized for the total of the bill $194.00.After tip the total was $244.00 and that was also authorized on the credit card.The $244.00 was charged on 06/09/14.The authorization for $194.00 is still on my credit card as of 06/11/14.Grrr..."
