b"The hotel is in a not great part of town. I walked into the lobby and it was so stuffy and hot. The room itself was okay, it was clean, except for in the bathtub there was mold on the faucet. The breakfast in the morning was decent. but the feeling of the lobby and hallways were very uncomfortable because there's no air flowing through."
