b'This is an atrocity of shuttle service.  Bought roundtrip tickets from airport to hotel.  Waited about 15 minutes on the airport, which is ok considering this is a pooled shuttle.  However, the returning trip was horrible.  I waited 15 minutes, didn\'t see the bus, so I called and they made some excuse about the "strip being closed".  Seriously?  Why do I see other shuttles coming to the hotel?  The guy said the bus will be here in an hour.  I decided to take one of the other shuttles that were coming and got in their line.  About 20 minutes later, the original bus showed up.So the shuttle was about 40 minutes late, and they some excuse that it will be 1.25 hours late.'
