b"Positives: - good location - staff reasonably friendlyNegatives: - they don't do the dry manis/pedis they advertise on their website (so why not update their site)?- base coat & top coat blobbed on without much attention - the top coat didn't cover about 25% of the color on each nail- nails filed totally random lenths and shapes - some shorter than the end of my fingers, some longer- during the pedi, the woman wasn't paying attention and ended up filing my skin so much I bled- they have a cute tea menu, but they never offer you anything- definitely expensive for what you're getting - they don't answer the phone often- the pedi station isn't that comfortable - it's a slightly padded benchOther notes:- the staff always looks surprised and not sure what to do when I come in (sometimes they don't even say hi, and you have to ask if they work there)"
