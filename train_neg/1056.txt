b'I will never rented from them.My friend lost the key in the car and we were locked out of the car.I called them but they let us wait for 2 hours and just transfer a key company.That company required us a annual fee for one time unlocked.Finally, we ended up to talk hotel and they called a local key company.Also, we made reservation a middle car for $120, but last day, they required $210 which include insurance.Even when I called for unlocking key, they said we do not have insurance.Be careful about total fee and I do not recommend ask them to rent a car.'
