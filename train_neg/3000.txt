b"If you stay a place off the strip, expect it to be dead. If you want any late night bites or drinks, be prepared to leave the hotel because nothing is happening here. If you go to the pool, don't expect an infinity pool, a wave pool, or a river pool. You get a rectangular community center pool. The rooms, however, are pretty nice and come with a kitchenette. And a stove. They really shouldn't have given us a stove. The third day of our stay, I woke up drowsily in the morning to the smell of roasting chestnuts, reminding me simultaneously of Christmas and chestnuts sold on the streets in Hong Kong. Pleasant. It looked hazy in the room. I must've been really tired; this is a sign to sleep some more. I half wake again. Chestnuts going strong. Hazier now. Smoky, really. I sit up. The room looks like we hotboxed for 8 hours. Long story short, a towel burned in a pot throughout the night and we got charged $200 for smoke damage. Nuts."
