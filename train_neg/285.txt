b"I ventured here about 6 months ago.  The atmosphere was nice, albeit a bit loud. There is plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs inside, though outside it's very tight and the tables are all very high.  The parking was ok, though I always seem to have to valet since I meet my friends right after work across town, and parking is gone around 7pm. I ordered a couple of the appetizers, the chicken lettuce wraps, which was putrid. So bad.  I left it. The other was dumplings, which could've been reheated. I read some pretty bad reviews on here about the food so, I had very low expectations but, a friend of mine likes the spot, so I went along with it.  Truly though, this is one and done for me.  I can't recommend it with so many other nice options in the area."
