b'I have to say my visit to the flamingo was not a pleasant one by any means. the only positive part about our stay is it was in the middle of the strip, so it was easy the get from one end to the other. Margaritaville upstairs is always fun and a nice view as well. it was a friends bachlorette, and from the moment we got there, she was in tears because she had been promised a room that was not the standards she agreed to. we were promised to sleep 8 with a pull out couch and had to beg for free cots. the staff was very direspectful and not accomidating what so ever. we were re issued about 10 keys because none of them work and couldnt even get into our second room for a long while. when we searched for the ice machine, we had to go to 3 different floors because none of them had working machines. when we asked about it, they simply said "did you check all the floors" which was extremely rude considering. we should not have to search all floors obviously; but instead quoted us $8 for ice to be brought to our room. They could not even tell us what floors were working. i blame our bad experience to the lack of accomidation by the staff. I will not be staying there again to risk another bad experience in such a fun city!'
