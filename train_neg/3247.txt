b'The average wait times here are just laughable. I\'ve never once been "in and out" and on average spent 45 minutes just waiting for my daughter to be seen. This is after I was informed on our 1st visit that if we were more than 15 minutes late our appointment would be cancelled. Our first visit should have been our first clue when we were there an hour and a half before the doctor even came in. I absolutely love Candace but I can\'t justify waiting like that. I\'ve tried 3 times now to make our next appointment for a day when both daddy and I could be there with no luck. After asking the scheduler if we were going to be forced to wait again if I took the only appointment they had available over 2 weeks out, she got extremely rude with me. I\'m sorry but that is unacceptable. We have received a referral for another pediatrician and was able to get an appointment for the exact day we wanted AND the woman was actually friendly. This is how it should be!'
