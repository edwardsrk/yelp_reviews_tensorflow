b'Worst bar ever. Bartenders stand around chatting and when I waved one over finally and said how long we were waiting the manager tells me I should leave. I ignored him since we were w a group and got my drink.  The female bartender did comp me that glass but every drink for everyone was a 5 to 10 minute wait. Guys at bar drinking were also annoyed.  Mind you there were 3 people behind bar and probably 30 people max in the bar.  The owner should restaurant spy his staff for sure!  Manager is a train wreck.'
