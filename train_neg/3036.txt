b"While this location is much  closer to me, I find myself preferring to travel to further ones as the service here is far too slow and poorly managed. Always running out of tapioca etc and averaging 25+ mins for one drink? It would be faster for me to drive to highway 7 and back. It's been open for almost 2 years now. No more excuses."
