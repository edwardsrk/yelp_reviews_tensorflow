b"Not listening to a fellow Yelp'r (Tiffany N.) I took it upon myself to try this place out hoping for the best.  But....it fell flat.  First off, I prefer the do it yourself style of TCBY and a few other places.  Also, there were only like 5-6 flavors?  Meh.  Another no-no for me was that this is another fro yo place that is based on the tart style yogurt that I am not a fan of.  All things being equal I have to say the salty caramel flavor I tried wasn't half bad but it was like choosing the lesser of two evils.I will say I do like this location though, nice fountain outside to sit and enjoy your yogurt at the end of the day."
