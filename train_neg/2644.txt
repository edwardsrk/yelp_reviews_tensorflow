b"I give beer 4 stars.. The food 3 stars... And the service 2 stars.  It took almost 30 minutes to get an order of wiener dogs at a time when no one was inside and only three other tables were taken outside (so they weren't busy).The beer I order also took 20 minutes to get after ordering. The food was pretty good, but I really thought the chef went a little crazy trying to make everything unique with unusual ingredients.Overall I don't think I would come back here."
