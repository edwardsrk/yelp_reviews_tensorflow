b"First off, long wait for a table even though there were many empty. They said they had reservations for them but they were never filled the whole time we were there. Atmosphere what fun though, and George had a great personality. They get the whole restaurant(not a huge dining room, very intimate) involved when yelling opa or singing happy birthday. The food is, well some was good, some was bad. The dolmas were amazing, and spanakopita was baked nicely and tasty. The gyro meat was quite flavorful but the onions they put on it was chopped horrible and fell right out. The mousaka and pasteesto were very overcooked and just mush, no texture at all. The vegetables were unseasoned and overcooked as well. Received the snapper in clam sauce and although the flavor was spot on, my dish was microwaved, or as it seemed. The fish had great flavor but again was mush, and came out so hot that you know it didn't come out of a Saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Our tab was eighty dollars without any alcohol and the dishes were subpar. For that price I expected properly cooked food, on clean plates. Not microwaved fish and dirty rims. I would like to say I would come back and give another try, but we drove out to this side of town just to try it and can't envision myself doing that again. Maybe if I'm in the area. Great service, cute restaurant, disappointing entrees with a hefty price tag."
