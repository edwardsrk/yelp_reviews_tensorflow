b"They have messed up two of my online orders now. This time I didn't ask for it to be re-delivered, but I called to speak to a manager to at least let them know. I mean I would want to know that my employees can't read. He didn't give two s***ts about it and didn't even apologize. Sorry goes a long way, but by the look at these other reviews, these guys just do not care. Lost my business."
