b"Horrible I went there tonight! Waited in drive thru for about 10-15 minutes .Ordered 2 orders of mash potatoes and gravy and 6 biscuits....I asked if everything was in the bag and honey and butter she said oh I got you.Needless to say I spend 12 bucks on 6 biscuits one thing of potatoes and gravy. Called to tell me he fumbled with the phone then questioned someone because I wanted to talk to a manager. Then said oh I'll put them on hold, told me they would be with me in a minute . I waited 5 because they never put me on hold just put phone down.The line has been busy for 26 minutes to call back"
