b"Entered restaurant and it was 60 percent full for a small restaurant.  Waitresses seem disorganized. Tables were gritty.  Food took a long time to come out.  Boneless wings were Refried and had to be sent back. Nacho app, poutine, and loaded potato skins came after wings were long finished.  They forgot my son's hot dog order too.  Things have really changed.  Seems like they just took over this restaurant."
