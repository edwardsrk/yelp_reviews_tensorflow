b'I bought a audi 4 and it was the worst car I ever bought...check engine light consistently keeps back on, the owner  Jacob "tried " fixing but couldn\'t,so I end up fixing it myself with a little research. The car came with a spare tire that was flat,less then a year the rear back window went out,glove compartment hinges broke,fuel gas leak and til now check light still lighting up . Before you buy any car,trucks or SUV make sure you check every single details on the vehicles and ask for carfax or call your car insurance for a carfax. The audi a4 I bought is a lemon car.'
