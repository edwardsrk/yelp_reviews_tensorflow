b"Def need to watch what they charge you for. I ordered a salad and then (since it was Tuesday) asked if taco was just $1.95? Employee told me yes so I added a taco. She asked if I wanted lettuce, beans, rice and pico with it? I told her no pico. On my salad, the lettuce wasnt really cut up, like it's just ripped a leaf in half- need knife to cut it up. While getting good bagged to go, cashier gives me a cup. I told her I wasnt ordering a drink and she says it comes with the taco. I asked isn't the taco just $1.95? She said yes. Look at bill and they charged me for rice and beans....last time I was here they also charged me sour cream when I said no to having it but the girl still put it on there. Last time I'll be at this location."
