b"I used to see Lynn Kasch, whom I liked very much.  Unfortunately, he retired.  A day or two before he retired, I called his office asking for a referral for a specialist because I was having a very serious issue going on.  Since mid September, I've made several calls to his office asking when I could expect the referral, only to be told it will be mailed to you.  Today is Oct 24, 2017 and I still have yet to get the referral.  Really disappointed with the staff there.  The doctors are double booked and over worked.  Will not be going back, ever.  They obviously do not care about their patients health or well being."
