b"The staff here is very friendly but my main complaint is this place is always packed and busy! There's people standing everywhere and it takes about 2hrs with an appointment to see a doctor. They mix the walk ins with ppl with apmt so what's the point of making an appointment when you are not first priority ? Please get it together here. You should seperate the walkins and give people with appointments the attention they deserve without these outrageous wait times. The worst part is after I waited 2hrs I saw a tech not even a dr! WTF"
