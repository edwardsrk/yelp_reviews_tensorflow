b'Higher prices that some of the other locations.  Awkward layout.  You pay and go through the wash, exit and get wiped down by one guy, then get directed to a garage, exit the vehicle, walk down a small hill, wait at a table outside, and the vacuum person drives your car around to the other side of the convenience store.  WEIRD!  The car cleaning was okay, nothing special, still dust in corners inside and smear marks on the outside with tons of lint left by the dirty rags.'
