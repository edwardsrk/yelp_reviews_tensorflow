b"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!! Beware!!!! I have never left a yelp review before, but I could not in good conscience let it go without a warning to everyone. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and quite possibly taking legal action in the near future. Their Plummer came out and did an estimate on my hot water heater for my home warranty company. He decided that it was a ruptured tank and would be covered under the home warranty he started disconnecting all the gas lines and put a jumper in the waterline saying that it would be quicker if he got this done now so when he brought a new tank back the next day. It leaked all night from the jumper he installed and then they sent out their water restoration and damage specialist the next morning. Now their company is claiming that they need to file a home insurance claim for water damage. The water damage they caused. Then the company called me and told me that they couldn't install the new heater until we filed the claim so they held me hostage to file a claim with my insurance company to get extra money for damages they caused. Please be advised to use any other company you can find besides this one."
