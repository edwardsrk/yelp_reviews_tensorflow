b"I don't like gristle in my hamburger so that did it for me. I doubt I will ever return. I don't mind paying $10+ for a burger if it is good quality. Also, way too much gunk on my burger. I like to be able to taste the meat. We shared onion rings. They were wet with grease but they didn't taste greasy nor did they give me stomach issues later. I'm more a fan of batter dipped rings than breaded but I liked these."
