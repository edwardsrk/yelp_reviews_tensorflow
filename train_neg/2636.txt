b"I was excited to dine here... Until I dined. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food--simply mediocre and along the same line of Chinese food I could get for $40 rather than $240. The dim sum was decent but the snapper was dry and the prawns and curry just didn't work for me. The nightclub, to add, felt like a cave and my party and I left shortly after being escorted in. I will say, however, service at the restaurant was excellent."
