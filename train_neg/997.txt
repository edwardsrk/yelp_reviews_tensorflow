b"The food here I will admit is great SOMETIMES. Last time I order Chicken Fried Rice it was basically rotten BUT what is worse is their customer service, it is disgusting. If you order on the phone they change the price as they so choose. They have insulted me on the phone multitude of times and if you actually go into the store itself it is DIRTY. The owner himself is very rude and the lady is even worse and she has insulted so many people even in store. Their company should be closed down because they don't know how to treat people at all.If I could rate it in negatives I would..repulsive customer service and haphazard food. After 2 years of ordering from them I will NEVER order from there ever again"
