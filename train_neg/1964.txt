b"That had to of been one of the saddest sandwich experiences of my life. First off it took an inordinate amount of time to go through the drive-through. It was 10 bucks for a sandwich with chips and a drink. They totally skipped on the protein of the sandwich and it was basically a giant piece of bread with a lot of veggies. Mine was supposed to have pesto on it and I didn't get even a hint of pesto.  I'll be heading back to Jimmy John's where they don't skimp on the protein in the sandwich."
