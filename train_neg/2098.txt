b"Things I liked: The homemade chips (mmm), the red salsa, the tender chicken pieces in my enchiladas and the service.Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well. Perhaps it is my lack of familiarity with New Mexican cuisine, but I was not impressed."
