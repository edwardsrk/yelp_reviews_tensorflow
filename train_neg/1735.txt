b'On October 6th me and my husband went to this H&M in the evening. He went to try to some sweaters in the fitting room and I followed him in there. There was a guy who was working the fitting rooms at that time and watched us walk in there without saying anything. About ten minutes later we heard a loud voice yelling at us over all the fitting rooms that only one person was allowed in the dressing room at one time due to \'fire hazards\' and she was going to "stand outside until the second person came out and sat on the bench."  I understand now that the policy of H&M is that only one person is allowed in the fitting rooms and I would have happily followed it had someone knocked on the door and told us that or if the guy who was working there in the first place had told us. We felt very embarrassed and disrespected. We didn\'t even want to buy any clothes at all. This H&M needs to really rethink the people they are hiring because we will NOT be going back to this store and I will definitely be telling my family and friends about our terrible experience. The employee who rudely yelled at us was the only girl I saw working on the H&M men floor. I didn\'t get her name but she had a dress on, her hair was in a bun and she acted like she might be a manager of some sort.'
