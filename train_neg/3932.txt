b"Food was good. Not complaining about the tacos. They were good. Got the guacamole as an app. It was good too. We were convinced by the server to add beans, candied jalape\xc3\xb1os, bacon and goat cheese. Sounds yummy, right? It was. Except we got 1 candied jalape\xc3\xb1o. That's right 1 ring. For $.50.  Ok. 5 pieces of bacon for $1.00.  I'm talking bacon bits. Like you took a 1x1 inch piece of bacon and cut it into 5 pieces. And the $1.00 of goat cheese - maybe 1 teaspoon. Probably more like 1/2 teaspoon. Long story short, don't get the guac add ons. You'll be disappointed."
