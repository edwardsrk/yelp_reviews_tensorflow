b"Used to love this place but it's changing with time. Perhaps they still ok with fake nails but they cannot do a good manicure if life depends on it. Used so much drying chemicals on my cuticle that it flaked the skin around the nail. All nail polish bottles are empty and diluted with alcohol, they look old and  gross. Had to repaint nails three times cuz nail polish wouldn't lay evenly. The station where you would dry the nails is covered with grime and gunk - no way I'm placing my hands there Here's the pic of the finish job - the lady didn't even bother putting lotion on cuticles or cleaning the smudges of polish cuz she was in such a hurry. Nails also not even painted evenly."
