b"I needed my holding tanks serviced while I was in Vegas last December and Daisy Fresh had some good reviews so I called and set up an appointment. Robert is a very likable man no doubt! What I didn't like was paying before he told me that he didn't have the equipment needed to clean my gray tanks!  So after the $ I spent with Daisy Fresh, I still had to find someone that could hydro-flush my gray tanks using the most modern methods of going up through the drain tubes. He flushed my black tank by going through the toliet, and after he did this I had problems with my toilet seal leaking.  Because of this I cannot recommend his services."
