b"Service is ridiculous, the ladies behind the counter were rude and seemed annoyed to have to perform their duties. My friend asked for the green salad without dressing, the employee grabbed the oiled lettuce. My friend says again that she's like the non-oily salad. The woman acted offended and put out. Then I stood and watched her dump part of the food that my friend didn't want back into the buffet style bar, huffing and puffing with anger. My friend asks for cucumbers on her salad, the lady ignores her and slides the plate to the next employee, then my friend again says to her she's like cucumbers. I thought the employee was going to flip out. She threw some cucumbers on top of her salad.The food was overly salted in my opinion, nothing special at all. Wouldn't return."
