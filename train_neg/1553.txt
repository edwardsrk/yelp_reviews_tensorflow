b'Unorganized mess! You make an appointment, only to show up & wait a hour. Then wait another two hours to see them, and another hour to get the CD with all your photos. This was an all day event, and no fun! Pictures aren\'t the best, and for the price you pay, you might as well just hire a professional photographer for an hour! Not wasting my time or money here again. "No sitting fee" is correct, but the prints are 10 times more expensive then any other print you will buy elsewhere.'
