b'This paper is awful and its internet version azcentral.com is even worse. I will glimpse through the web-version solely for the purpose of reading local news and might pick up a physical copy for the crossword. It does, however, defy two stereotypes associated with a major newspaper. Firstly, it seemingly has a policy against ground-breaking journalism and discourages its reporters from "getting the scoop." Secondly, that whole "liberal media" characteristic does not apply to this paper at all. Every election it endorses campaigning politicians, though almost always backs the conservative. Letters to the editor are largely conservative and are little more than toned-down hate speech. However, simply visit their website, which is available to the public with a thread format, and you will see the unbridled hate speech, borderline clinically-insane comments faithful readers leave, that this media outlet does not monitor. Politics aside, the paper is full of spelling and grammatical errors, lags behind other Valley print media sources in content and could stand a massive restructuring from within, as in the business and policy side of this organization needs to be completely gutted and rebuilt properly.'
