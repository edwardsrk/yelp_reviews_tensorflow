b"Spent the weekend at the Trump Hotel in Vegas across the street from the Fashion Show Mall. While in the mall I noticed Grimaldi's Pizzeria. A sign in front said it was voted best pizza by the Food Network. Not sure if that's true, but that's what it said. I couldn't wait to try it out, so I ordered a pizza to take back to the hotel room. Boy, was I underwelmed. Not even close to the best pizza I ever had. I think I should stay open-minded about this and maybe visit another location. But at this point, it wouldn't even make my top twenty list. I do have to say the service was good. The bartender who took my order was very busy, but still took the time to walk back to the kitchen to check on my order."
