b"Four Sons Chevron is the closest gas station / market to me and the only one within about a mile and a half. They are a neighborhood market,  located on the same block as Marley Park and have marketed themselves as such. It is so disappointing that over the 5 or six hundred times I have been inside to purchase something, there is almost always a line of 6 to 8 people. Nor a big deal if there were more then one cashier working, but, if is true that one cashier is behind the counter. I'm not talking about 3 in the morning, I'm talking about 7 or 8 in the morning or at 9 on a Friday night  Its amazing how much traffic this place gets and they skimp on the cashiers. If there is someone else there, they are smoking, in the back doing something or just in the office... no one calls for help. I don't think they pay enough attention to individuals who hang out in the front. I've seen anything from beggars to a person selling watches and others eyeballing cars people just got out of... and they probably think that because it takes so long to buy a candy bar, why not look inside the car, just not a safe place at night after 10 ish. The store is clean, bathrooms are clean and they make sure they keep the shelves full of chips or whatever. Gas prices are always higher then competitors. Speaking of competitors, a QT station, 4 sons is not."
