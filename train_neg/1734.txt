b'I really wanted to like this place. I was so excited to check it out. I even held off on purchasing my bow because I wanted to support local businesses and also figured I would get better service and advice from a place like this rather than a big box store like bass. I finally made it in to the store today with plans of purchasing a new hoyt as well as a sight, rest and everything else I needed to be hunt ready. I also brought my 8 year old daughter to sign her up for lessons as she has been showing interest in archery lately. When we walked in we were greeted by nobody. Checked out the thin inventory on their wall and was finally asked what we needed by an employee. I told him I would like to buy a new bow. He said give me a minute. I have him 30 minutes and finally my daughter and I decided to leave. He watched us walk out and did not say a word.  Crazy. Afterwards I was so distraught I reached out to them with a comment on social media describing my experience and my comment was soon after deleted with no response and no message to me. No concern whatsoever. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this place and planned on frequenting there. Looks like my hunt continues for a good spot.'
