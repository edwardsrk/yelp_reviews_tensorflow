b"We drive by Fruits and Roots almost daily and we finally decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the only good thing I have to say about the place is it has nice decor. We walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. We assumed she would explain the menu but nope! My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so aswe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. Tome the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!"
