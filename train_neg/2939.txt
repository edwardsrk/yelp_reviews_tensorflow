b"I had been really excited to try The Gallery for a few months now, but unfortunately I had a pretty mediocre experience. A younger man and woman at the counter greeted me and asked to take my order. I said that I would like an iced latte and asked if they had any flavor syrups to add. The woman said yes but had to look up in the computer which kinds they had. As she was naming them off she mentioned coconut so I said coconut would be great! Neither one of them seemed very confident in what they were doing, as they kept looking nervously at eachother and were quietly questioning each step of the latte making process. Soon after I see that they've just made me an iced latte with coconut MILK. I took it anyway since I was running late, but I'm not impressed."
