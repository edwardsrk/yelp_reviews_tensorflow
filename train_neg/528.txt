b'Horrible experience at the storeStuff member occupied family washroom for a long time( she does not look like pregnant at all) The stuff member was holding the wash door and yelling at my wife and baby.  Yes she totally freaked my wife and babyWhen I talked to the front desk. No apology but all protective speech.I regarded that we spend thousands each year there now'
