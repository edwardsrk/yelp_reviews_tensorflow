b'Unbelievably noisy in the restaurant, we could barely talk amongst our group. I am not sure why but I suspect it is because of all the hard surfaces including the ceiling, it reflected all the sounds back. The food was just okay not good enough to make up for the noise. Crossed off the list of places to revisit.'
