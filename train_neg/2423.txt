b'Its a store with lots of variety. But for a 2nd hand shop, I found it ridiculously overpriced. A 3T snowsuit for $35-50! I got 3 sets of 2nd hand snow suits for only $15 each on kijiji and 1 set included some really good snow boots. If you want an actual store to buy from instead of kijiji, Prices are better at Goodwill, salvation army or value village.'
