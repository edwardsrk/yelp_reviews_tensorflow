b'We live in the neighborhood and went for beers and appetizers to watch a basketball game.  Ordered chicken nachos which were good.  However, we got there a couple minutes before 5:00 for a 5:00 game.  Asked to have TV by us switched to ESPN2.  Waited 15 minutes before they turned it to ESPN.  My wife went up to bartender who was the only one the waitress said could turn the channel.  He told her he would change it went "he had time."  Waited another 6 minutes until I went up and complained.  They finally changed it with 8 minutes left in first half.  By that time we got our check so we could go watch somewhere else.  We will stick with Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers in our neighborhood instead of here.  Very disappointed.'
