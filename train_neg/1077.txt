b'I have been going to this cleaners for years. I will never step foot in there again. I dropped off a pair of "dry clean only" pants at a dry cleaners. Seems simple enough. I went to pick them up a day after they were due & I was told they weren\'t ready. I said I needed them for that night. Next thing I know, the female owner hands me a cell phone & tells me to speak to her husband.He tells me that the pants were defective. I need to seek reimbursement from the store where I purchased. He would not offer me any reimbursement for the pants, which are quite expensive. I ask for the pants back. They were two tones, black & white. The white is now black. It appears that they were laundered, rather than dry cleaned.Had the owner offered to pay for the pants, I could move on. Shifting the blame to the manufacturer & expecting the 3rd party department store to refund me is ridiculous.I will never return to new select cleaners & advise you to stay away.'
