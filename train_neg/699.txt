b"If I could give a worse rating trust me I would. They have 10$ piercings and tattoos thought I'd go check it out . ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLY RUDE! I want to make sure the area and needles and equipment for a tattoo is clean and new ones used and when I asked questions the owner and all artists and an underage child working the front were incredibly rude and when I asked if I could speak to the artist they said it's a closed shop and you have to want a tattoo to go back and talk to the artist. They were insanely rude and to top it off the artist isn't worth your time. Please research your shops before you come here. Spend the money on a good tattoo, shop, and artist."
