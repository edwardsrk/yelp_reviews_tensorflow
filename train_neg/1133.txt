b'Not very happy with the pharmacy. Dropped off my sick son\'s medicine at 3pm. Went through the the drive thru after 7pm and nobody could find the prescription anywhere. After 10 minutes it was "found lost in the system" I was a told to come back after they filled it. I guess my sick child is of no importance to them. I\'ll try CVS next time.'
