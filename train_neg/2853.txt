b'Came here for the ayce seafood buffet what a disappointment.the crab lags,muscles,and crawl fish was served over a bed of ice the crab was almost frozen and mush.the clams was ok. The only redeeming part of this was the cook that was making fresh seafood pasta.other then that if you are coming for the seafood buffet save your money their are other places that will cook it for you and not short cut it. Oh and service was less the Desirable'
