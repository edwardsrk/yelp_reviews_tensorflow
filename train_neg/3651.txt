b"Not for me- I like Wonton Soup and many people seem to like this place but my soup tasted like the water used to boil the noodles in - no flavour..... For the price no thank you, I can go anywhere else for more soup with more wonton and less noodles and more flavour.My veggies were hard the meat didn't taste fresh kind of ... Dusty almost, the wontons themselves we're fine but I didn't see much value in the soup at all. Sorry Wonton King ... I tried."
