b"We just got back from staying 4 nights at The Flamingo and we were very disappointed!  There were 6 people and all of us have stayed at better hotels in Vegas!  The only good thing about it was the location, being in the middle of the strip was ideal so was having the monorail nearby and also the Fashion Show Mall was in walking distance.  The rooms and bathrooms were ugly, I would never take a bath in the bathtub we got.  The hallways were ugly, may have been just the area we saw but still not impressed.  Our taps both leaked all the time we had to wrap towels around everything!  It was bad.  I will never stay there again and would not recommend it to anyone.  The pool opens to the public so it gets super busy and so I didn't even bother to go.  Next time I may try the Linq which is right beside it."
