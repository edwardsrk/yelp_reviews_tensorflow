b"Went to Blue Hound for brunch today and I left  disappointed. I ordered the the brioche french toast ($12) and received one piece of toast that was marginal at best. If I am paying $12 for a piece of toast it better be exceptional, which was not at the case here. My husband ordered the spanish omelette which was decent, both portion size and taste wise, but the taste was still nothing great. His biggest complaint was that his coffee was not offered to be refilled one time. Service wasn't terrible but it was lacking, just as the food was. I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately I won't be going back."
