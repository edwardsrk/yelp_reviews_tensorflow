b"When my grandmother passed, the hospital recommended this place. They said it would take about a week. After 2 weeks of hearing nothing from them we called and they said that there had been a hold placed by the medical examiner and never called to inform us of this. They then became very rude and said if we have a problem with it we could go pick her up. We called the medical examiner and they said there was no hold and they have no idea why there would be an issue. We are shock by the conduct of this place, especially being that we dealt with another death just moths before and the other funeral home we used (a wise choice funeral home) had everything done in under a week with no issue. Do NOT use this place. The manager (Andrew) is rude, unprofessional, and they have no responsibility. This isn't some retail shop, it's a funeral home, you need to act a certain way when dealing with peoples loved ones and they failed"
