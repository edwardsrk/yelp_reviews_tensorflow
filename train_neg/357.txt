b'This place has gradually gone downhill. Tonight was the last straw. We ordered 2 Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. The tracker indicated  it was out of the oven at least 15 minutes before the driver headed out. The sandwiches were horrible. The bread was hard, there was very little meat on the sandwich and what was there was leathery and hard. We threw the food out. I have requested a refund but have not heard from the store.Sherry Weaver#neveragain'
