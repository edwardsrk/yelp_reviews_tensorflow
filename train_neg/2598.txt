b'A disappointing meal here today.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, medium spicy.  It arrived not spicy at all, with about 3 peanuts, a handful of chicken and mostly water chesnuts.  What bothered me most was the quality of the chicken.  It did not seem fresh cooked and had a weird, spongy texture.  This place used to be great.  Not anymore.'
