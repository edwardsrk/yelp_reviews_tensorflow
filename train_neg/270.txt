b"Took my friend here after her grandmother passed away. She wanted to get her feet done, the lady ran her water too hot and never adjusted her temperature when asked. After 20min of waiting another customer walked in and she made my friend get up to do the other girls feet. It was a very uncomfortable feeling for me being that I was already getting my feet done and she wasn't."
