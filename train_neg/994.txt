b'An update to my prior review... I finally after two hours heard back from the salesman only to find out that my linoleum was at the warehouse not at the store is it was supposed to be, and it had a hole three foot in which made it impossible for me to be able two use it. I requested a refund of my money set that I was not going to do business with them. they did refund my money and I will look elsewhere for flooring. the sales people are courteous and nice but the service from the business is terrible I would not recommend this place'
