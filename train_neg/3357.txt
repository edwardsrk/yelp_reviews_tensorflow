b"So it was our first time here, it was pretty quiet...like  eerily quiet. We were seated right away, waitress was friendly. There were only a handful of customers and looked like 3 employees. The wait was long for our food, or to get refills it took forever to get her attention. In all honesty I think she was helping in the back because she would disappear for a long time and reappear with someone's food. It really seemed like the staff was missing. The food was just ok but the overall experience was just off and not good."
