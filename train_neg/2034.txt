b"The service was friendly and attentive! However, a San Diegan is familiar with Mexican food and this isn't. Margaritas shouldn't be made with sour mix, nachos aren't 4 large chips with toppings on each of them, and no one should need to salt their food when it comes to the table.With all the superb dining in Vegas it's disappointing when you dine out and have a subpar experience."
