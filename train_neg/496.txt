b"Went to the gadgets and games to get a kids smart tablet, nubi, the guy told me they were out of them and weren't getting any until June. Why are they on display if they don't have any?? And aren't getting any for 6 months?? Then went to get the kindle fire for kids, they had a blue and pink option, and the blue was out. So he offered for us to get the pink one instead and then buy a blue case, but oh, they had no blue cases and suggested we get it on amazon instead. Word of advice, don't go, or at least call to make sure thru have the exact same thing you are looking for. Nothing against the employee, but his manager needs to start doing his job."
