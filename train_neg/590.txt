b"Went to sit and eat ordered the breaded mushrooms they were more breading than mushroom my friend ordered pickled Willy's she said they Were the worst she's ever tried then I ordered the eight chicken wings in the honey garlic sauce and fries with gravy I never got my gravy and the fries tasted like they were out of the bag and just like fried they tasted like they were stale and the chicken wings were good but they were very small the sauce was really good though and my friend ordered the pasta and she said it was so dry and tasteless will never be returning again"
