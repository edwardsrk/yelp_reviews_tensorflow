b"Terrible car wash tried to get my windshield replaced there and they said they had to order the molding. They contacted me next day setting up an appointment at my home a month later I'm having to have my windshield replaced again because they didn't really order new molding they flipped over the old molding leaving a gap for water to get into my car"
