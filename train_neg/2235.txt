b"It seems like every Ross is a cesspool for the mom buying all her kids clothes for the year.Typical Ross shopper. Mother. Father (usually absent) 4-5 children in tow. Shopping cart full of s#!t. Also makes final decisions at the cash register.Come on on dude. I only wanna buy 2 things!There are 2 registers by each end of this store, but that doesn't stop the terrible feeling of being stuck behind this family or other people paying with cash. Seriously? Who does this still?I added a star because if you're in dire need of something (belt or shoes) then this place is for you.I came here to buy dress shoes because you know dress codes are always enforced in Vegas and I forgot mine at home.Instead of driving back home for 5 hours I decided to just buy a pair here.This store is also big as hell. I dare you not to find something here you wanna walk awway with."
