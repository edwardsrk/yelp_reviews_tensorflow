b'The place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy. The waitress was nice, but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary. The food was overpriced for the quality that you received. I LOVE indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard. I would never recommend this place to anyone.'
