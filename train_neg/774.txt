b'Be warned! We stopped here today from out of town for a quick restroom break and refresh on sodas. The restroom break included a brief walk on her leash for our 11.2 lb 14 yr old dog, who is well behaved well groomed and current on her vaccinations. I took her to the front of the restaurant under some trees into the grass and mulch. I was quickly called over by a employee and told, "this isn\'t a dog park I couldn\'t walk her in front of the restaurant. The park is around the corner." I explained the purpose of our stop and that I was well prepared to cleanup after my dog, biodegradable pooh bags attached to leash ready to go when needed! He didn\'t care and restated the location of the park. 1) if this location has a zero pet policy on their property- then post it.2) In almost 16 yrs of traveling with a dog across thousands of miles, I\'ve never had such a encounter.'
