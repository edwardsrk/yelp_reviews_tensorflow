b'Long story short, I ordered 2 dinners from Uber Eats and got a confirmation saying that the orders were accepted and should be delivered. When I received my food, a whole order was missing.. I called 5 times before the manager "Jackie" got on the phone. She said there was no order for 2 dinner plates only 1. I let her know that I was charged for 2 and was expecting 2 as my confirmation receipt shows, she said for the inconvenience I can pick up a new order. I let her know that I was unable to pick up, hence why I utilized Uber Eats, she was totally unapologetic, didn\'t even offer to reimburse me for their mistake, just said "We can\'t deliver the food you can pick it up" Will never order from here again, should have took the bad reviews as a hint! I will be contacting Uber eats to get my money back; if not I will be paying Jackie a visit!'
