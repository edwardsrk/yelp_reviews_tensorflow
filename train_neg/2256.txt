b"Their food is great. The problem is they cheat with their lobsters. When you order two lobster special, the lobsters only have one hand. The dish came with two hands instead of four. Why??? I asked manager and she said sometimes lobster came with one hand. Ok, get it. I have seen some lobsters in the past. But both lobsters? I asked another waiter and he told me all the special lobsters have only one hand. So that's how SPECIAL their lobsters are here!"
