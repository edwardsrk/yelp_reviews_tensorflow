b"I heard a lot of excitement over this place so decided to give it a try.   I heard it was the In and Out of the east coast.    The burger was good, on par with In and Out, Smashburger and 5 Guys.  The main difference is the price.   Holy shnikes.  Over $15 for a burger, fries and drink.    I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for food and 1 star for price."
