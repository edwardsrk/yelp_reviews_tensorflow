b"Took my daughter here for dinner on a Thursday early night. We got a table really quick, but had to wait for an over extended period of time for our waiter to show up to take our drink orders (20 min). We got our drinks again in an over extended period of time (10 min). We finally got our waiter back to take our orders, my daughter ordered the Salmon, and I ordered the steak ( medium rare and added a side of shrimp for $6.00).  The food took a bit longer than expected, but within a reasonable amount of time. Once we received our food, the disappointment hit! My steak was well done, not med rare, and the $6.00 side of shrimp were VERY TINY....  it was all just mediocre, in general but so NOT worth spending $50 on two drinks (1 alcoholic and 1 soda) for mediocre food and crappy service! Don't waste your money!"
