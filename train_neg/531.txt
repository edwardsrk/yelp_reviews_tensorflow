b"HORRIBLE!!! I'm not one to write reviews on my experience because in a business I understand there are good and bad experiences But this place tops a bad experience..... Starting with the awful customer service skills of the receptionist who probably got it from her unethical nonchalant boss, and then pours over to the untrained ,pounding, harsh handling therapist, and then to top it off the gooey chocolate and dated fruit they serve with a Bon Appetit......Please stay away....I spent 139.0(Groupon) on the couples massage and was given a low class training class experience more worth maybe $30 And of course the manager explained I better be glad I didn't spend $230.0 for the full price I really should sue this place and get 230.0 + for creating such a AWFUL experience for my husband and I on Valentines Day weekend Don't spend your time or money here They placed needs to be Reported"
