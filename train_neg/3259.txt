b"The DQ located on 2654 Horizon Ridge Pkwy, Henderson, NV I am not happy the way every time I have to call up for an issue that when I get a call they say someone will get back to me and here it's been from weeks to months I don't hear from anyone anymore. I know that location has closed now and has moved to new location a lot closer to me but that doesn't give them excuse to not call and apologize to me for what happened there in the summer of Jul 2017. Earlier, I came twice with my coupon for a smoothie and their machine would not be operating then they would overcharge me few cents using a card. What would be the reason at the time to send coupons in the mail if that DQ was not fully functional in the first place?"
