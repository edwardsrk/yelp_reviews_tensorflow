b'Delightful location with lots of promise, but overall, this place fails to deliver.   Located near UWMadison and the Madison Zoo, ZuZu is ideally situated.   The place has ample outdoor seating and is very kid friendly (sandbox, activities for kids, etc).  Even the menu (PBJ\'s) and signage ("for everyone\'s Safety park your strollers outside).  Let\'s start with service - this was off the moon rush and I counted 6 employees.  2 were mostly staring, one was taking orders, not sure what the other folks were doing, but service was pretty slow.  Food - ordered the Drake (a slice turkey meat sandwich) and the Randall (roast beef).  The sauce of mayo/mustard in the Drake was so overdone it was oozing out the sides and overwhelmed the sandwich.  The Roast Beef was tasty enough but it was the kind of cured meat that happens to \'stay with you\' the rest of the day.  All in all, maybe it was just an off day for the staff -- not sure, but not a place to visit twice.'
