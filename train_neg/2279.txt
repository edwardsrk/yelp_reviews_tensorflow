b"Unfortunately, for all the food is pretty good, the service is terrible. We've given this a good couple tries now and don't think we will be coming back. Our food order is incorrect more often than not, they advertise some food that I have yet to see available, and despite closing in the middle of the day to clean and restock ... they seem to use an awful lot of pre-packaged vegetables, can't quite keep things in stock, and don't appear to have the time to train employees on ingredients to answer questions when asked or, especially after our last experience just tonight, on customer service either. A lot of people seem to love it here, and regretfully ... I cannot figure out why."
