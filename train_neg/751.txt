b"Had the chicken and waffles. Price-wise, definitely not worth the high price of $19. You get one piece of chicken, and its a small thigh. On top of that, chicken was undercooked. Basically pink inside and the skin under the batter was still very raw and gooey. Kind of disgusting. There was close to no syrup as well. The eggs benny was another disappointment. You'd expect a nice runny poached egg but these yolks were hard. It seemed like the chef didn't put much effort into the cooking."
