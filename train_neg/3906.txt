b"Swiss Chalet got nothing on Portuguese Chicken! It's been about nine years since my last visit here and now I remember why it's taken me this long to go back. The last time I was here I remember it being so ghetto kinda like a cafeteria setting almost and now it looks more like a food court setting you'd see at a mall. My little beef with the seating arrangement is that you are so close to other people that it kinda ruins your meal a little. For one I'm not one to ease drop on someone elses conversation or do I like hearing other peoples conversation but it's impossible not to ignore it b/c you are that damn close to other people. Besides the seating arrangement the interior looked very nice and clean. The bar area adds a nice touch to it with sports, mostly soccer, playing on the screens. I wanna come back here just to see what it is like during the World Cup! I betcha this place would be crazy during that time. The one item that stands out here is the BBQ chicken. The chicken is very well done, cooked properly and the flavour was nice. But when you add that hot sauce that they supply it makes the chicken so much sweeter. The white meat on the chicken was very good not dry at all like almost every other place I've been to. The one item not to get is the sausage. Presentation wise it's served on a pig that's on fire, very wonderful site to see where it gets everyones attention. There is alot of meat in that sausage but the flavour wasn't the greatest and it was very dry that we didn't even finish half of it. I don't know when the next time I'll come back here maybe another 9 years but who knows if I happen to be craving Portuguese chicken and I happen to be around the area I'll grab some for take out. Items to definitely get: - BBQ Chicken"
