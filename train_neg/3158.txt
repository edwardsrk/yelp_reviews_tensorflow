b"The Service:Friendly and prompt. Awesome job.The Setting:Looks like a fast food place with a bar and Asian-ish touch. It has TV and clean restrooms.The Food we ate:-Love how the salad was crispy fresh...but the salad dressing ruined it...ick.-The calamari looked different (like puffballs), but they actually tasted better than I expected. The sauce that came with it complemented it.-The summer roll and its sauce was ok...not that good, but not that bad either.-My teriyaki chicken was a bit a bit dry with very little sauce on it. If they added a bit more sauce, it would've been perfect. It still tastes good though. The veggies that came with it was perfect.-My hubby's basil beef tasted like a regular stir fry. And let's just say we shared my teriyaki chicken instead."
