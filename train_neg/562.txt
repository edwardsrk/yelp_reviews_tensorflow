b"Only one star necause i had to, otherwise a ZERO star day. So after 12 years of loyalty it's time to move on.  Bought a Groupon and went on line to make an appointment when I forgot some information I decided to call. Tyler told me that the website is wrong and that they don't use it. I told him it said that to call if within a two hour period, he said he doesn't care what it says and they only take appointments until 3 and to call back after 3 to see if he could get me in.I did and he said they were to busy to take any other cars.Today, Thursday, I took off early to drive in to get into the midas, he sad it would be until 5 told him I would wait (2 hours).  I showed him the Groupon and he said they don't take them for synthetic oils, they only for conventional oils. I showed him the fine print.  I don't care what it says we don't take it, I can only give $15 credit. Told him unacceptable and walked out furiously.Went home and called another midas and he said that he could do until he found out it was for the midas that wouldn't take the groupon. Told him what had happened.   He said they had to take it, he took my name and number.  Nick from midas tempe autoplex called back and said that they would take my car right away at this Midas and give me the up charge while using my groupon.Oh by the way groupon was called as well and made aware of the problem as well."
