b"I've never been a big buffet guy but decided to try this for lunch with some coworkers. I was very disappointed, with both the food and the service. The waitresses were up my ass the entire time, as soon as I drank half of my water, they were ready to refill it.        I wasn't able to even hold a five minute conversation without being rudely interrupted. As for the food, the chicken was a bit dry as well as the pizza. Food seemed like it had been sitting all day.    Only positive I came out with was the decor of the restaurant, authentic Chinese designs and bridge lead you into the dining room. Also live fish also fill the pond in the restaurant. Overall disappointing food, unless you're going here to take snapshots, which I doubt then you should probably stay away."
