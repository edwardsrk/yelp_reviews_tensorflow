b'I attempted to eat here tonight for the first time. I only ate a couple bites of my dinner. After ordering and looking around deeper, I saw half bottles of alcohol stored on the floor on a moldy tile covered wood shelf that was molding. Then when my Mail came, it tasted like the cheese or something was spoiled. I would not recommend.'
