b"I used to love this place until today - I called and made a reservation for 3 one week in advance only to be told when I got there that my name is not on the list When I said that I was told this was a confirmed reservation, the rude hostess said that since I didn't get a call it meant it was a no goI think this place has started thinking way highly about themselves with really poor form of dealing with their customers RUDE"
