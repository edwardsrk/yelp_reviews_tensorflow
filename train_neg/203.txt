b"AMC Westgate, it is really disappointing on how you defuse a bully!!!!SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We arrived 35minutes early for the movie, & after the movie started this man & his wife came & wanted us to move from our seats so he & his wife could sit there.We said no!The man started threatening us.I got security, explained the scenario, they came  & let me say.... They asked us to move so the other couple could sit there, & since we didn't, they were offered movie tickets for there inconvenience.The guy sat next to my husband and kept shoving himself into his space of the seat, it was either leave or this guy getting hurt!Management gave us a hard time on getting reimbursement......WE WERE NOT REIMBURSED OUR FULL AMOUNT!We should have moved, so what that we got there early for a seat.It was Unbelievable!SHAME ON YOU!"
