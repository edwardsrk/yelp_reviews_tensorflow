b'Not the best gym to have so many around. It is not the facility or equipment that rates this a two but the piss poor customer service and money hungry employees. Nice, helpful and very friendly when signing you up. Once that is done..no one has time for you. You can clearly see what their goals are. Reminds me of people working for commission. Billing department is worse. I have seen several employees personal life come into the gym not in a good way. Staff and managers about to fight in front of a full gym of customers trying to work out.Facility is lovely with a dry sauna, indoor pool, different classes and cardio machine inside a movie theater upstairs and down. 95% of their machines are operational. They made this place 10x better when they got rid of the  fitness sback place. They were another problem. Unfortunately still have kids working and over zealous employees. Came back to see a lot of changes but even with a different staff they hire the same kind of people who have poor customer service. I waited 30 mins just to get info while young men are watching women come in and out, joking like young teenagers. One of these young men helped me when he realized I was the customer waiting. It was actually disappointing to see and no supervisor to discourage this behavior. It can be considered a form of sexual harrassment and may make women not feel welcomed. This was the same behavior 2 years ago and sad to see when i try to return ...no change in employees professionalism. This was on a Tuesday at 1pm when i came. I can only imagine after 5pm or weekends. Seems like high school or fraternity running a gym. I do not recommend this gym. You will think you can get over it because of the great facility but trust me the employees will cause you to leave. Easy fix...hire right employees to help and be a real gym..not immature young men who sexual harass women in the gym.'
