b"I guess I have to leave a 1star minimum EVEN THOUGH I was ridiculed, for being there during open hours and had cash stolen from me by Lamonte the smog attendant who lied to my fiance's face and stole my money. I showed up at 5:29 knowing they're open until 6 p.m. . Lamonta comes out shaking his head looks at me and says you're what I call a do it at the very end of the day kind of guy, a last-minute guy. I said I apologize I worked 10 hours today and this was the only time I could come by. However your website and sign says that you're open until 6pm He then looked at my car and shook his head again and complained that my car, a 94 Honda Accord was the kind of car that required a tailpipe test he clearly did not want to do that. He then stomped around my car opening and closing doors and gas cap door making every check possible to try and fail my car which it did not my car passed as it always does.  I had a coupon and gave it to him along with the $20 bill when he told me it was $17. I said here is another 20 to use on my fiance's vehicle, her minivan was behind me online and according to lamonta she was another last minute person, she has a coupon as well when you're done give her the $6 in change. When her vehicle was done my fiance asked for the change and he said no and kept it or rather, STOLE IT. In addition A car pulled up and by this time it's only 5:45 and he turned him away. This guy is a criminal, lazy and cannot be trusted. I've since called the general managers number three times and left messages to no end and no response DO NOT take your car to this place they're rip offs and thieves !!!"
