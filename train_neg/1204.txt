b'I don\'t know why people eat here and think it\'s good?we had a 2 for one coupon and ate here.we sat down and after 5 minutes had to flag girl down to get something to drink.terrible service.we ordered their benny\'s.we knew from last time not to order their diablo potatoes they taste like eating cardboard so got hashbrowns.our breakfast comes the hashbrowns are frozen cakes like ya get from mcdonalds or arbys!!!! this is suppossed to be a restaurant not fast food. the "eggs benedict" canadian bacon was thick and from a can!!!! worst eggs benedict I have ever eaten!!!! we knew not to order any mexican eggs cause we both remember how bad they were.even with the 2 for one coupon wasn\'t worth it.we will never go back.there is nothing on the menu that we think is any good.ingredients they use is same as fast food and that\'s better and cheaper. lousy restaurant'
