b"Was once the best...Now that the previous owner sold it, the new owners have managed to trash the food. They said the same cook but I can't believe that's true. Went last night and found the vibe totally different, the food bordering on flavorless (the wings now just taste like salt, fake crab and tasteless fishballs in the pho), the waitress bordering on nasty and the whole deal made it so I'll never return. Farewell Sidestreet....Anyone have any idea where Ken landed?"
