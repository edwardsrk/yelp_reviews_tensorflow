b"My wife is Brazilian and wanted to show me Brazilian BBQ.  She searched around and was told this is 'the' place to go for BBQ.Unless you're going to fill up on side dishes, don't expect to get any value for your money at all.  The place suffers from an identity crisis, part night club part overpriced buffet.The food is entirely average, nothing spectacular but what absolutely stands out is the fact that every portion of meat I was given was entirely bite size, I literally had already eaten the meat given to me before the guy had even left the table.  I often had to wait 5-10 minutes between 'bites' as they were very busy.The meat was either extremely overcooked or border line raw (I like rare, this was nearly blue).  As I'm from Texas, I've eaten a substantial amount of cornbread and I can honestly say this was sugar with food colouring and a tea spoon of cornmeal.We ordered caipirinha's and it was like drinking lime flavoured water with ice and a 1/4 shot of Chacas.What really gets me, is the $43 per person price tag they charged us for this.  I honestly walked away feeling like I just made a charitable donation to the restaurant on my way to McDonald's."
