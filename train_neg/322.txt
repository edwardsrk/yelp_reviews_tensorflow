b'A bunch of people came together and said, "what can I include in this show to make it look like we\'re trying too hard? Let\'s just add sex and penis jokes with zombies because people love zombies and sex!" Who though this would be a good idea? Tacky middle school penis jokes, unoriginal racist blacks and asian jokes, and overall poor storyline. The host is supposed to carry the show along, but instead I felt he stalled the momentum of the show. There were times I seriously wanted to shout out, "Get on with it! We get it, they have a penis!\'\' They poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. They created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. Zombies loves sex. Zombies love sex. There, I just told you the whole show. I honestly couldn\'t understand the singing. I don\'t know if it\'s because of my seat but I had to seriously concentrate to understand what they were singing about, especially the host. Fast talking and slurred singing doesn\'t make for a good show. I\'ve been to multiple musicals and shows, I\'ve never had to concentrate so hard. The storyline was lost on me. The theater is a long rectangle so the seat just continually goes upward instead of outward like most theaters. If you get stuck near the back and at the left end of the row, there\'s a huge block of wall that juts out blocking your view. You\'ll have to encroach on the people to your right to get a better view. The only good thing about the show was that they had a live band. I\'d rather listen to the live band play for 90 minutes than slurred singing and overused sex jokes.'
