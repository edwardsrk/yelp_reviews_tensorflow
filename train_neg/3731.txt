b"A group of friends and I went here to watch an MMA fight. I knew that it was going to be crowded, but I didn't expect that they would keep letting people in AFTER they told us that they have to let 24 people out to be compliant with fire safety. We were sitting in the bar area and there were so many people, we ended up watching the last of the fights at the front by the main doors. It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to come take our order, but our food arrived shortly after, and it was alright. Nothing too special, but it wasn't horrible. Do not expect anything but typical bar food. It's also kind of on the more expensive side - given the quality & quantity of it. Overall, it seems like an alright spot to watch games and fights (clean, a ton of TV's) but they need to become aware of how many people they are letting in versus going out - it's a huge safety hazard. I understand that they are trying to make money, but it's alright to tell people that the restaurant is full. It made myself and many people around me extremely uncomfortable to not even be able to move around at our table without bumping into people."
