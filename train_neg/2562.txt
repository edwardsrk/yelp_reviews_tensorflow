b"Came here for lunch with my friend and her boyfriend. I ordered gluten-free tomato basil penne, which is a new menu item and my friend got the buffalo chicken potato skins which was a new flavour as there were other potato skins on the menu previously. We shared a dessert which was go nuts donuts, which is warm donuts stuffed with Nutella and sprinkled with icing sugar. The waiter was nice enough to bring us both the English toffee caramel sauce and peanut butter sauce when we asked for both since we could not decide which one was better.I did like the food, but everything on the menu looked quite expensive for lunch, I didn't really see any lunch specials and there was a lack of vegetarian options. There were vegetarian dishes, but it was severely limited, so you'd be stuck with whatever they offer on that option rather than having anything to pick from. The restaurant is very focused on meat, all four salads on the menu contained a heavy amount of meat. If they could improve their menus, I think I'd give it a better rating. Also, I was looking forward to trying some new advertised dishes on a Kelsey's promo that I got in the mail, but almost none of those items were available at this location, so I was disappointed because I already knew what I wanted to order thinking they'd have it. I've been here numerous times as I live close by and I even once held a birthday party in the past here, in which the experience was quite pleasant. It's nice to come here at night whether for dinner or late night appetizers with a drink. I would return and would recommend it to others, but would not specifically recommend."
