b"THEY ARE RACIST AND DISCRIMINATE AGAINST Non-ASIAN CUSTOMERS.  I had been here in the past and was disappointed with the service.  Today I was in a hurry and was passing by so I thought I'd give it another try.  My experience has taught me that the best Chinese restaurants around are frequented by Asians.  Look no further than Cravings and Golden Harbor to see this.  They are outstanding establishments with the best Chinese food in town.  Evo also has a strong Asian following; however, if you are not Asian you will get different service, which is what I experienced.  The employees were short with me and gave me a fraction of the food that they had given Asian students in front of me.  Outside of this post I will not make a stink about this.  I will just choose not to eat there."
