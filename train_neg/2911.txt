b"I never like to write a bad review....but if I experience bad service for the money that I have spent with you, then you're gonna get it.Only 4-6 people were actually inside dining- I stood at the bar for nearly 5 minutes to pick up food before receiving the first 'hello.'Food wasn't that bad, actually even better the next day as left-oversBut for the $$$ spent, I'll stick with my other favorites...will give it another shot someday when its nice outside and I can take advantage of their outdoor seating."
