b'If I could give negative stars I would! These people are very nasty, rude, uncivilized scum of the earth. They towed my sons vehicle and he is a MARINE OVER SEAS I got the paperwork they requested and they still will not let me get my sons vehicle back! Trying to charge me almost $900.00 and it increases daily! I can not even start to tell you how horrible these scum bags are! I am filing several complaints against them with who ever will listen, DO NOT TRUST THEM!'
