b'I would give negative stars if I could. They are 100% helpful if you are going to buy something there, but not when you have problems with your apple products. I had battery problem with my iPhone 6s and went there for help. One staff came and check some information with me, and told me a TECHNICIAN would come to help me 1.5 hrs later.  Actually there was no technician there and the guy who finally came to help me was already there during that 1.5 hrs!! He had a basic diagnosis and told me they would change the battery for free (the phone is still under warranty ). Sure. When I arrived there the next day, another lady picked up my phone and told me I had to pay ~80$ for the repair because the warranty had expired. Excuse me?? I know when I bought the phone and it should be under warranty. Good that she went back and figured it out.This was not the professional customer service I was expecting. Totally disappointment.'
