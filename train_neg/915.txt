b"I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box.  The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM? We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  Good meat and tangy sauce.Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back."
