b"Worse experience ever!!!!! And I'm from the east coast!!! I would never treat anyone how the 2 people the young lady and guy working treated me . I wanted to like this place sooo bad I walk in I got totally ignored! Not only did the hostess young lady ignore me she didn't even say hello welcome to such and such nor did the other guy . Did ask if I had any questions she found tons of stuff to do while I  waited for just her to notice me . Extremely rude I'm the kind of person that when I find a good east coast place I tell my east coast friends but that will never happen extremely rude and I WILL NEVER RETURN and tell everyone to not go to your establishment !!!! Find better staff that don't mind being social with every race !"
