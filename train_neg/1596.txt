b"Do not visit Maya, that is unless you'd like to see racial discrimination and pure Scottsdale douchbaggery in play. Myself and a friend went on a Saturday night. There were maybe 10 people in line in front of us and we waited 15-20 minutes. That part wasn't bad. Our friends were inside and had clearly stated they paid $10 cover. When we got inside, the girls in front of us paid $10. When it was our turn, they said cover was $30 each. My male friend and I were shocked and asked how this happened when the girls in front paid $10. Basically they said their GM changes prices whenever he wants. Their GM, Jason, came to speak to us and was extremely rude and unprofessional. When we asked again why the cover changed, he asked us to leave. By this point, we didn't want to stay anyway as his attitude was so condescending. He does not know how to provide customer service and did not want to answer our question in a straight forward manner. Be careful Jason. Treating your customers like this will only result in Maya ending up like Axis Radius across the street."
