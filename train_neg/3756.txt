b'Nanny connections was recommended to me by several friends and co-workers and, at first, things seemed to go well.  While the service is pricey, I appreciate the idea that candidates would be pre-screened, working legally, and had completed background checks.  Initially, Tiffanie sent us several good candidates but it wasn\'t clear how much "pre-screening" they really had outside of filling out Nanny Connection\'s online application.   However, after contacting our candidates references, we went ahead and hired what seemed like the perfect candidate.  Nanny Connections drew up the initial offer contact and coordinated the offer.  The contract was quite basic and did not include a clause about giving notice before quitting. It also didn\'t mention the need to be a U.S. Citizen or have a legal work permit.  We found out that both of those things mattered when our new Nanny quit via email in the middle of the night and gave us no notice.  Nanny Connections did offer some "back-up" Nanny help but the candidates they sent had varying levels of experience with infants.  The service was also suppose to help us find a new Nanny since the first quit w/in 90 days.  While Tiffanie did send a few more candidates and helped us find a new Nanny, I found her to be much less responsive the second time around -after I\'d already paid the full fee.  In sum, this service did help us find a Nanny but I\'m overall quite disappointed in the service and the overall experience.'
