b"The food is garbage - fast food Mediterranean at best. This place thinks its the Mediterranean Chipotle but doesn't come close to executing and the food quality isn't good at all.The food quality is poor on both quality and taste. If you're expecting all white meat chicken, you'' be disappointed. And fresh pitas? Nope, pulled straight out of a packaged bag right in front of you.There are definitely better alternatives available and there is no way I'll be going back to this place.  Very disappointing."
