b"DONT EVER GO TO THE SPA GUYS! As I was leaving I was approached by 2 security guards accusing me from two other guests that I was acting aggressively. I was upset and also uncomfortable. In the end I then proceeded to tell the security guards this is the last time I will come here. I told them that I felt very uncomfortable over accusations that were not true. DON'T EVER GO TO THE SPA AT LEXWORD MEN YOU MAY GET STOPPED BY SECURITY AND BE ACCUSED!"
