b"My wife enjoyed her meal, but I'm pretty picky when I experience the same style of food that I've had before, YC's in particular. After being seated, we grabbed our bowls and headed towards the food line. There were three rows of food and condiments. The third row was a little difficult to get to. None of the employees were paying attention to the food. You could see where people had gotten something and it spilled onto the edge of another container of food. The setup was totally inefficient. The selections were so-so. I was surprised that we could only order our noodles or rice at the end. For noodles, they used soba noodles which are a lot thicker than YC's and THEY control the portion. WHERE's THE NOODLES!! And that is one reason out of several, why I won't be back."
