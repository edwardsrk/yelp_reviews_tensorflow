b'Not at all up to its rating on Priceline of 4 stars. Heavy smoke smell in casino (poor ventilation)Garden Buffet food was good for the money.  Coronado Cafe was terrible.  My porterhouse steak was literally 1/4 inch thick! Rooms big but looking a bit dated and tired. Overall just low quality everywhere you look. Front desk manager terrible!  I asked to stay 30 minutes over check-out as I had a very early business meeting and needed a little rest before hitting the road. She refused me in an unsympathetic way on top of it!  It was just rude. There wasn\'t even a cleaning cart near my room.  I left for fear they would automatically charge me.  I wrote into the hotel and they sent back a "cut and paste" answer that said sometimes they are booked.   Would not stay there again.'
