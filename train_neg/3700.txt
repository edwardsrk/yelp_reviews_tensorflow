b"The gym is always crowded, always. In my opinion way oversold.  Early Saturday and Sunday mornings are the only chance you have at getting a workout done in a reasonable amount of time.  I've been a member since opening and it's only gotten worse not better.  I'm looking for a new gym now.  My wife enjoys the classes so she will keep her membership here.  And my son meets friends here so he'll keep his membership.  But I just want to be able to get through a workout without having to wait for anything to be available or constantly changing what I'm trying to do.The other thing that really bothers me about EOS is that I'm paying for a premium membership which is supposed to include access to additional areas like the cinema room, the tiny basketball court and the swimming pool, but there's no restrictions on who can use these areas.  Anyone can walk in.  So unless you want to access other EOS clubs, there's no reason to purchase anything but the basic membership.I would love this gym, but it's too crowded.  Would rather pay more and be able to complete a workout in a reasonable amount of time."
