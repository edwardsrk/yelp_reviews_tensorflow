b'Do not go here!  I support Jiffy Lube like you would not believe but I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO NOT GO HERE (NOT THIS JIFFY LUBE)!!!They purposely damaged my tire to spite me!!!Yesterday morning, when I got an oil change, I was encouraged to upgrade to a higher quality oil - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my air filer - I declined.  When I was encouraged to change my cabin air filer - I also declined.  It came to a point of forced upgrades where I literally said, "I just want an oil change and I have to go."This morning I noticed my front tire was WAY low of air (they checked it yesterday).  I filled it asap but noticed air seeping uncontrollably through the valve.  I took to to a Goodyear (on Indian School) and they said, "The only way this can happen is if someone loosens it.  There is no way it can come unloose by itself. The pressure is too high."  They even asked if I, "...had any enemies."  When I told them, "No, but I did get an oil change yesterday at the Jiffy Lube on 32nd they replied, "This isn\'t the first time dude.  About once every few months someone comes in with this issue from that Jiffy Lube."Enough said.I know corporate people at Shell Oil and jiffy Lube.  They are great people and they have supported my business.  I will always support Jiffy Lube but never (again) this franchise or their staff.  They put my family\'s safety at risk for juvenile redemption because I would not buy an extra air filter.  Do not go here - ever!P.S. When I went I went down and confronted the staff - predictable results.  Ignorance = minimum wage with poor management.'
