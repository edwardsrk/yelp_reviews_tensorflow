b"Dos Mas has to be one of the worst Mexican food restaurants we have ever been to. So where do I begin, we got the menu and there was not much of a selection. So we decided to order from the appetizer side and had the Mini Chimis, rice, beans anda quesadilla. The server brought us some chips and salsa. The chips tasted like old oil and the salsa was clumpy and watery. We got our quesadilla and Mini Chimis. The Mini Chimis had no flavor unless you call the taste of oil flavor. The beans also had no flavor and the rice was under cooked. I would like to say the only thing there that did taste good was the water but that was before the server put her finger in my cup to refill it. Can't say that we will ever make it back there.."
