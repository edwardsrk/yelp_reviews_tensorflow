b'I went to this place expecting it to be amazing since it was top rated in vegas but when my fiance and i went there on our recent vaction it soo was not what we expected the waiter didnt tell us any of the specials they had he gave us horrible food suggestions! for a place so "upscale" you would the food would be out of this world im very disappointed i went there the night before i went to CUT inside the PALAZZO/VENETIAN and that was the BEST place ever! it was also top rated in vegas.'
