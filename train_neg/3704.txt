b"I've been to this Zinburger a few times now. On opening weekend we went and I honestly had the best burger experience of my life. Every time I've been back it's been truly lackluster. My burgers always undercooked and under-seasoned. The service is continually poor, with a lot of staff standing around looking like they've never been trained before and have no manager. My appetizers always take ages to come out. In-N-Out is a cheaper and more reliable alternative."
