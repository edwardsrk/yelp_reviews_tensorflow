b"Just got back from Vegas...what an awesome fun time! Too bad I can't say the same for the customer service at the Flamingo Hotel on the strip! Let me first say during my experience with the front desk personnel I was completely sober...they just lack in tact and professionalism! People send a lot of money to enjoy their stay in Vegas and because of this they should get the professional help that they deserve! Won't be staying their again! I recommend the Luxor...that was a better experience!"
