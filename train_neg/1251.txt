b'Quantity over quality. The staff proved this to us over and over during our three-night stay in April. It started when we checked in. We booked 2 rooms for 6 people, but the Flamingo says these 2-queen rooms are for "double occupancy" so when we gave the three names of the people staying, we were charged extra. The pool is great, but everything else sucks.'
