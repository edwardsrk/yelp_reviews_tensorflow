b"After being a regular at Veggie House i thought it be cool to try Chef Kenny's. We went there a couple times and usually had a great experience until most recently we ordered spicy crispy beef and it came out cold and we told the waitress. All they do is bring you hotter rice but pretend not to hear you about your request. I called back to share my experience and was in shock. They actually put Chef Kenny on the phone which At first I thought was cool. Completely different than I expected, instead of being understanding the owner himself was very rude and told me next time I come in and of this happens to let him know but that's there's nothing more he can do because we already left. I'm sorry but there will not be a next time because I'm going back to Veggie house where they treat customers with respect. I also unfollowed Chef Kenny on Instagram as well."
