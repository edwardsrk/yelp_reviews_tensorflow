b'Do not come here if you are hungry.  We waited 10 minutes before someone sat us. After ordering our drinks it took 15 minutes to see our sever again to order food. After we ordered food it took 30 minutes for our appetizer to arrive. I have never waited 30 minutes for tortilla chips and spinach artichoke dip. The server warned me that the bowl was hot. The bowl was very hot but the center of the dip was still refrigerator cold...... I informed the server and she said she would be back with another.  15 minutes later she arrived with ANOTHER cold dip. I changed my order and waited.... after another 45 minutes without our entree we asked for a manager. After 10 minutes no manager showed up and we left without our food. If you own a tv and a microwave save your time and money, just cook at home. All these guys do is use a microwave and they cannot even handle that. I should also mention that the restaurant was not even half full. They will receive none of my business. ...'
