b"I am convinced that everyone giving this place good reviews must be confusing this with somewhere else, or its the same people that keep terrible places like Macayo's in business.  I ate here a while ago, and I thought I would give it a second chance last week. It was still bad. If a Mexican food place can't make refried beans well, I'm not sure what they can make. They taste like they are straight from the can. For a place that touts all of the other fresh items they serve, some effort on their beans would be nice.  The rice had little flavor. Tortilla was ok at best. The prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality. Also, not a huge deal but you need to pay 25 cents for a soda refill, this just bothers me.If you want great Mexican food in Surprise, go to Rito's on Reems and Greenway. Nothing in Surprise comes close, especially this place."
