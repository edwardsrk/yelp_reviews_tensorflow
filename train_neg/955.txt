b"This is a decent gym often over packed but for the price I would never complain. Until some donkey ass guys want to sit around the basketball court (not even playing basket ball), and be a sideline referee. He starts a whole big scene and then runs to the front desk to complain! How can he complain when he is only in there to start drama! The manager Claude Schutte I believe his name is (older white guy with black hair) gets so rattled at the situation he doesn't know what the hell to do. I never heard someone stutter so much who doesn't have a stuttering problem. He then proceeds to tell me he will cancel my membership if I don't calm down. He was able to muster that sentence. In the mean time the other guy is yelling at the background after he ran toThe from to tell. Lol so he makes us both leave for the day and nothing was done about the situation. Classic case of being rattled in a tough position. Get someManagement with experience to handle situations vs someone who can't handleAny situation with some aggression! I mean it's a gym what do you expect!"
