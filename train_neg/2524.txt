b"Went for the first time today. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and an order of the tempura green beans. The burgers where ok at best. Meat was good but the buns where so burnt and smashed down, making them super hard. Half way through the burger we both got tired of eating it and tossed the buns in the garbage. Tried letting management know about my experience but no one ever picks up. Shakes and green beans where good. I'll try them again sometime but so far I'm not impressed at all."
