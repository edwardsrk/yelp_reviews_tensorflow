b"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Let me say first that we didn't get the deep dish, I didn't realize that is what they were famous for. Also the staff were nice, not overly helpful but never rude. My daughter got their wings, super fatty (probably Tyson). There was a long blonde hair in it, she has dark brown hair. When we told our waiter he said OK then took the plate, no apology. They did bring her out new ones but like I said before they were to fatty to enjoy. They did not even offer to take them off our bill. Our thin crust pizza taste like it literally came from a box. I can't even remember the last time I have had thin pizza this BAD!! The ice cream cookie had generic tasting ice cream and I believe it was covered in the store bought Hershey's syrup. I have never written a bad review about a restaurant, only good ones. Nothing has ever been that disappointing that I felt the need to write one until now."
