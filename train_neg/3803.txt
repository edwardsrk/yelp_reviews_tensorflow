b'I wanted to like this place, but it has a LONG way to go to live up to it\'s potential.  Location: The location is awesome, if you sit outside on the deck overlooking the strip.  Unfortunately, that is about all it has going for it right now.  Food:  The chips and salsa were mediocre, at best.  My buddy and I both had fish tacos that were just so-so.  Drinks:  The margaritas were ok but too sugary.  Staff:  The staff seemed to consist primarily of bored and indifferent teenagers.Prices:  I expect to pay a bit of a premium when eating in a resort area, but the prices here seemed out of line.Come to think of it, Sammy\'s place at the Kaanapali airport sucks, too.  Overpriced and lousy service.  Coinkidink?  You be the judge.
