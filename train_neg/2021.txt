b"Parking is tough to get here so I don't get to go much. I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.Pro's:- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck- Good burgers- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcoholCon's:- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.- Really expensive hot dogs. - They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.I do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out."
