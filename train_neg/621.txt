b'Really bad experience here. Went in at 6pm for a drink and asked about dueling pianos. They start @ 8pm. Ok. We had two drinks and were hungry. Asked if we could get pizza from across the way and bring in. Yes that was fine. Get your hand stamped so u can come back in. We got pizza (worst ever) and were then told we could not bring it in. Had to sit outside and they were closing the bar for half an hour while they set up. Ate and then got in line to go back in. No charge since we had our hand stamped. Tried to fit at a table and were told NO we had to stand. The tables were reserved!  Nowhere did it state that we needed a reservation nor did the bartender tell us that. Total bullshit way to treat customers who spent $50 on two drinks each!  EXTREMELY disappointed. Sucks'
