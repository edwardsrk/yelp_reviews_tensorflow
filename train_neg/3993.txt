b"Will I go again? Nope.Wish I'd taken advantage of the Summerliciois menu so I wouldn't be out $100 from my pocket.Order: lobster octopus salad: mayo much?Black scabbered (white fish with black speckles- I probably ordered it for the weird factor) with saffron pea risotto- seriously making rice yellow is not the art of risotto. Appropriately creamy, but totally tasteless like the fish.Chocolate mousse- too decadent, nearly cake like. Loved the ambience, white linens, attentiveness. But if I wanted a memorable Portuguese fresh seafood dinner, this was not the place."
