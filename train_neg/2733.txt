b'Very nice staff! VERY NICE!! Not very helpful though. They don\'t know where their own items are located throughout the store, but they expect you to find it. I asked for specific items. She (and manager agreed) said "I don\'t know where that\'s at, because we move things around the store everyday. Just look towards the back of the store... " So I did.I Searched for quite a while. Never found items, or assistance. Thank goodness there\'s a Michaels around the corner.'
