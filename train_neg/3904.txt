b"Not your normal dining experience. If you are looking for an evening out to enjoy a great bottle of wine, you can get that bottle, you just can't enjoy it. Disappointed with the tasting only service. You will find yourself waiting too long for your next taste. Definitely a local favorite. Not someplace you would go out of your way for. Average food at best."
