b"40 minute wait, non full restaurant on a Friday night. Waiter, Mike, came right away, but just said hi, he didn't ask for drinks before leaving. Came back in 10 minutes to take order.  Had a sweet tea. Mid drink he topped it off with water.  I questioned him about it and he said it was tea.  Took his time with things, cleaning tables before even being our drinks initially.  Food was ok. Won't come back."
