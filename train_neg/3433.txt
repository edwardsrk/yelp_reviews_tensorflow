b"I like the apartment and the community except for one thing: THE AIR CONDITIONING. Holy crap, this is the most poorly implemented AC system I've ever had in an apartment. The master bedroom is always 6-7 degrees warmer than the rest of the apartment. We've made multiple service requests but there is nothing they can do except put a makeshift vent between the living room and the master, which did absolutely nothing (and talk about a lack of privacy in the master once there is a vent that allows noise through). One side of the house is freezing and the other is a hot box. Apparently, this has been a problem for many residents in this complex (That accidentally slipped out when we had a discussion with management). It's difficult to live here for this reason, and we're definitely not going to renew.It's unfortunate they have such a poor AC setup- this is an otherwise fine apartment. But AC is crucial in Arizona, and it's hard to just BE in the master, let alone sleep there. I've had many nights on the couch."
