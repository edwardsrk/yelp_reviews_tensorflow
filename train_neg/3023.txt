b'I have been going to this CVS pharmacy for 13 years, until recently. I was sad to part from them but I had no other choice. The staff morale has severely declined over the past year. It has been a very long time since I have gone here and actually been greeted kindly and with a smile. The staff is very rude and acts bothered every time I needed help. I was so sick of being treated like a burden for simply asking them to do their job and fill my prescription. I hope for the sake of all current and future customers of the pharmacy that they change their staff and build up morale again, but for now, I have no interest in ever returning.'
