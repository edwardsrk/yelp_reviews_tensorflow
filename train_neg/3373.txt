b"Tried for the first time about a year ago and did not like the cupcakes. Figured enough time had passed and I'd give it another go while downtown Sat evening. Unfortunately, the results were the same. Just not very good cupcakes at all.  Nobody in our party of 4 wanted to finish them. A couple stomachs, including my own regretted getting them. Too dense... something just not right about the taste.  Two stars only because the girls working were pleasant."
