b"Service is ok but Mercedes should be since it is at a2-3X premium versus regular quality shops. Sales is priced high and then they try to impose a ridiculous mandatory $695 admin(paperwork must be really tough in Charlotte?)fee and and sneak it by consumers!.? Fees like that are illegal in other states because they are exploiting customers. So I bought a Mercedes in Oh for thousands less and a reasonable $295 admin fee. I don't mind paying a fair price but refuse to pay and uninformed and inflated price."
