b"As a vegan I am pretty good at finding great food on menus at non vegan restaurants.  I was super disappointed last night when ordering the vegetable fajitas to find out you use butter to grill your vegetables and you put milk in your tortillas.  The waitress, who was super at her job, was only able to offer me a salad.  She said there wasn't any vegetable based oil in the kitchen to grill my vegetables.  Super frustrated for myself but the rest of the party really loved their non vegan choices and they will definitely be back.  Me, not so much."
