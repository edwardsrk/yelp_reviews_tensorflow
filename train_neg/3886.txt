b'Since it is new and we are always looking for good Chinese food, we tried Chef Panda.  Sorry we did!  It is obviously set up for take out, as they only 4 combination meals to eat in, if you wish to.  We ordered their House Chicken; it was served in a styrofoam take out container.  Admittedly it was full of fried rice and chicken (maybe enough to serve two), but both were essentially tasteless!  The kitchen looked like organized chaos!  We will NOT be returning!'
