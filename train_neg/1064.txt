b'"Was" excited to try this place.  Walked in....no hostess insight.....waited....waited....and waited to be seated.  Finally we just sat ourselves.  Place wasn\'t busy...maybe 4 tables.   Waitress came over and gave us menus.....a few minutes later...Hostess with purple hair shows up....glaring at us for 15 minutes.  Guess she was pissed we sat ourselves?  Anyway...we ordered chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes & corned beef sandwich with fries.  The chicken fried steak had so much gristle in it....you couldn\'t even chew it!!!  Gravy was cold....and CLEARLY potatoes...that weren\'t mashed after all....were old and cold from breakfast.  Mind you....we were their at around 3:30pm.  Then they had 5 burnt green beans on the plate as well.  Corned beef sandwich was ok....but the bread was an inch and a half thick!  So 3 inches of bread with a 1/4 inch of meat was like eating a rye bread sandwich.  Instead of slicing the corned beef....they pulled it going WITH the grain....witch gives you stringy meat.  The fries were coated with flour and were not hot.  I seriously don\'t see how this place makes it...without some BIG TIME CHANGES!  $45 later for this disappointment....is definitely NOT WORTH IT!  I won\'t be going back!'
