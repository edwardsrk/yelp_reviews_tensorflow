b"I have no idea why I keep booking flights with American...I always think the next trip just might be better. This trip will be my last to ever step foot on another one of their planes. Pushy staff and HORRIBLE service. I've currently been in this plane for 35 mins and I was just told it will be another 40 before we take off. This happens EVERY TIME with this airline. Please do yourself a favor and go Southwest or United."
