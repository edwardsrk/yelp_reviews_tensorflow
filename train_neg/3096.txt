b"Finally able to visit Perk Eatery after reading about their potato pancakes in a Phoenix magazine review. First off let me say the restaurant is a charming throwback to an old fashioned diner. The service was excellent. We were immediately greeted, shown a table by a window, and approached by a server who was very friendly and efficient. We went specifically to have breakfast and I ordered the potato pancakes with applesauce. My friend ordered an omelet with toast and coffee. Food arrived in a timely manner and looked great. I was disappointed in the pancakes which really had some potential, but they turned out to be  very limp and greasy, quite a difference from what was described in the magazine, which said they were crispy. The toast was burned, pretty badly. I'm not sure why a cook would serve that to a customer. We just didn't eat it. The coffee was really watery as well. I see other reviews here that are very positive. Perhaps it was an off day but I have had much better food at other breakfast chains so we probably won't return."
