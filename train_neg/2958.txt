b"Tonight was the second time going back. It was my friend's birthday and thought he would want to try something different and cool. Prior to our dinner, I spoke w one of the servers, and told them it's our friend's bday and if there's anything they can do In terms of dessert w candle. They said we can order a dessert, and they would have a small candle with it. So we did. We ordered the well known back ribs, as well as the chicken cheese platter. As the second order came to table, one of the servers already brought out the dessert, and eager to put on the table.  I stopped them immediately, and asked them why they would bring out the bday dessert now, when we haven't even begun our dinner ?!! Obviously the surprise was ruined. My friend saw the cake (and actually without candle), and we were disappointed. I spoke to the manager at the end to address this common sense issue we encountered, and also asked them to cancel the cake order. We ended up going somewhere else for dessert."
