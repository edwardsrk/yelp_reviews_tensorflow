b"Really bad first time experience here.  The prices are great, until you realize the cashier did not apply the sale price on nearly every item.  Paid 10 for lasagna that was priced at 5, 4 for potatoes that was priced at 2, and 7 for guac that was priced at 3.  Had to wait 20 mins at customer service just to get 7 dollars back.  Pretty sure we overpaid for a bunch of other items too just didn't have time to check everything in the car.  Not sure if the cashier was sleeping on the job and just didn't see the sale tag or its common practice for this grocery chain to overcharge customer's. Bad bad bad."
