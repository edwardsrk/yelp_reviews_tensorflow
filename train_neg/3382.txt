b'We have had mixed reviews about Cabo but it has just gone downhill recently. Took a special friend there last night and liteally had to wave our hostess down every time we needed something. The cabo roll was good but my whitefish tacos were COLD! I mean like cold tortilla, cold slaw, cold fish that had been sitting out. Did not complain because they did not seem to give a rats ass!'
