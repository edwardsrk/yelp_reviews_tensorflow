b"We live in Peters and were hoping to find a local spot that we could count on for a late bite to eat. We liked the atmosphere and the fact that we could be casual and watch sports. However after trying the McMurray Sharp Edge we will never go back. The service is so horrible it is beyond description. We were brought flat pop twice even after we sent it back. My fried fish came burnt....can't even believe a waiter would serve something looking like that. My husband ordered a salad that was supposed to have many different types of lettuces in it and it came with only Romaine and a few bits of veggies thrown in. The food took so long to come that on our last trip we left.........such a shame.....we would love to have a local pub to call our own."
