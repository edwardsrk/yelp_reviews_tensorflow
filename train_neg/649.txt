b"Safe to say I will never be going back here again! I'm now 14 weeks pregnant and have been coming to MomDoc since I was 5 weeks. They constantly are calling me to reschedule appointments, I understand that some doctors may not be in the office when they intended to be so at first it didn't really bother me. I had an appointment scheduled for today, one they had already rescheduled, I received a call in the morning and from them saying they need to reschedule AGAIN, and when i call them to reschedule they tell me they cant fit me in that day! Both myself and my partner had scheduled time off work for this appointment and for them to call the same day and tell me they couldn't give me an appointment it unacceptable.The only reason i originally went to MomDoc is because they say they're open till 8pm each day, however those appointments seem to be non existent!DO NOT GO HERE! You'll regret it if you do."
