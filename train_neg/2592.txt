b"I really wanted to like this place because, yes, I'm one of those people that loves a great chef.  Maybe it was tinted by the fact that we had a few days of such wonderful meals elsewhere (Craftsteak at MGM for dinner and MOZen at the Mandarin for Sunday brunch were awesome) but this was really mediocre. Lobster tacos were just fine, my husband had the salmon and had the same response. The best selection would be mine which was the vegetarian chili relleno and I'm not a vegetarian. It was very flavorful and crispy; we both liked it best. My $16 margarita was so tasteless I ended up not finishing it. We realize that when we come to Las Vegas it is expensive and we expect that. When we went to Craftsteak, we spent $300 including the tip (we don't drink much) and we felt it was well worth it. But we left Mesa after spending $150 with tip and felt robbed. The service was good though."
