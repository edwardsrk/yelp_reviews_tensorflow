b"Hmm.. I never write reviews on here, but I felt I had to with this place.First of all, it was expensive for the quantity that they give you. If the food was actually good and they had the atmosphere to match it would've made more sense to me. That was not the case - the restaurant was basic and to be honest, pretty run down for a restaurant on King West I'd expected better. The staff was rude with answering any questions and when the food came the ingredients were old and tasted like MOLD. I didn't even finish it before the waitress took it away and didn't think twice to ask why I left it (most staff will ask if you enjoyed the food at a good quality place - not here!) I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone in the area AND I agree with the post about food poisoning I was sick for two days after eating here!!! YUCK, disgusting. :("
