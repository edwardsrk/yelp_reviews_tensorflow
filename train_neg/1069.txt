b"1 star but it should be a - star option this place was the worst I have ever visited ..... We decided to go there because at other locations never had an issue but this one in particular the manager I forgot her name but she has red short hair she yells at you even if you are next to her saying your name with a bad attitude plus the service is not the best the coffe is COLD , no choice of creamers the table dirty when I got my cup of coffee it was dirty it had pink lipstick all over I had to ask for another cup even, the food ok  they never replace the coffee when I had to take my kid to the restroom the restroom was DIRTY  disgusting .... Smelly  when I payed they didn't ask how was our service or anything definitely NOT COMING BACK TO THIS LOCATION ......"
