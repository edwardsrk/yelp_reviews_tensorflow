b"I really hate giving bad reviews for small businesses but I wish I went to Harvey's :(  the people Are very friendly but they forgot my coleslaw and my gravy. When I got  to work to eat it they gave me malt vinegar for my halibut! No lemon wedges either. The fries are the only thing I can eat and they are nothing to brag about. The halibut is very greasy too"
