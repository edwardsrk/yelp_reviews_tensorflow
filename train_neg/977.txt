b'What a waster of time and money!  My regular ophthalmologist recommended I see the same doctor who performed my previous cataract surgery (which was here) for a followup procedure.  Step 1:  Repeat the same exam I had just received from my ophthalmologist at a cost of about $200.  Step 2: Go in for an evaluation with the Surgeon ... wait in 3 different waiting rooms for over 2 hours, then leave, since I myself had appointments. Leave having accomplished nothing as I never saw the doctor!  At no point did they indicate to me it would be over an hour delay and offer to reschedule or give me any indication of actually how long the wait would be. Feels more like a surgery factory than health CARE.  I have no intention of coming back to this facility.'
