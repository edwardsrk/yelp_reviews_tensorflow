b'I went there for the second time today and have downgraded my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars. I concentrated on the freshly prepared "Live Cooking" items and was not as impressed this time by their taste as I was on opening day. The show was good, but the food was bland. The rest of the Chinese food items available in the restaurant are inferior to the Mandarin and the sushi is inferior to AYCE restaurants such as 168 Sushi.'
