b"Went on a Monday night for trivia night. Had the burger and pint special. The burger was not great, pretty basic. The fries were good. There was about 6 groups for trivia night. Unfortunately the MC was disappointing. She didn't seem to understand the material and by the end, she was rushing through it like she had somewhere else to be. I expected better. She didn't really seem to get the vibe of trivia night."
