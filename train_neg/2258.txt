b"I can only speak for their brunch menu. I'll say that it was incredibly reasonably priced, and it sounded exciting. After much debate I decided on a traditional eggs Benedict, which is one of my favorite breakfast dishes. I had high hopes, and I was unfortunately disappointed. The eggs were over cooked, so it was more of boiled then poached egg. They were quite sparing with the under seasoned hollandaise sauce. The grits were a little on the watery side for my taste. I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't after I tried the brunch. If it was possible to give 2&1/2 stars I would, because the food wasn't terrible, but it was bland. The service was pretty decent."
