b"Got a response from the manager via Yelp. He asked for my phone number so he could talk to me.  I promptly responded and gave him my phone number to call me.  Well, it has been a few days and no one has called me.  Is this some sort of scam to get my phone number?  Or do they just don't give a shit about their diners' opinions of their restaurant?  Once again, I reiterate my point: this restaurant sucks big time in service and management."
