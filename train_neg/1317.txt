b"This company tried deliver flowers to our home- my son was home by himself and called me.  I had him keep me on the phone while he opened the front door (our security screen door was  locked though).  He told the gal that he was not going to open the door, that his mom (me) was on the phone and he asked the driver to call me, his mom.  The driver was very insistent about getting a signature and became argumentative.  My son kept saying, call my mom, she's on the phone now.  And she kept interrupting and insistent on a signature.  I told my son to close the door.  I then called the company and spoke with a Manager, Sara.  She understood my concern and said she would make sure the driver was trained on these situations.  Three days pass and I still don't have my flowers or a phone call.  I called and spoke with Sara and she had a completely different tone with me than previously.  She was very curt and tried to give me lots of excuses. I asked that the Owners call me.  Five days later, I've never received a call back from the Owner or my flowers.  I called to find out when one of the Owners would call back, and Linda told me it would be by Friday, which meant six days later than my initial request.  I told Linda that was pretty unreasonable and she told me that the Owners are busy and have several other businesses.  In my opinion, that's completely unacceptable- do yourself a favor and do not order from this Company.  They are very unprofessional and not very concerned about customer service."
