b'I\'m so upset.The first time I came here, I was super impressed with everything they did. I paid a pretty penny, but felt it was worth it with the results and customer service I had.Fast forward to about a month ago, I brought my car in. The guy I told what kinda wash I wanted was awkward and unsure how to talk to me which made me feel uncomfortable but I ignored it. He said, "It\'ll be ready by 5." It was 1:00 when I brought it in, I couldn\'t believe it would take four hours. I had stuff to do (I got married 3 days later). As I stayed in shock, I went in to the receptionist to pay. I asked her, "So he said it would be done by 5. If they are done sooner, will they call me and let me know?" She said "Absolutely!"So I try to kill time with what\'s around me since I\'m car-less and walking around. Hours go by and it\'s 4:15. So I walk over and lo and behold my car is sitting in the parking lot, done. I ask a guy for the keys and as he hands me my keys, he notices some nasty rag sitting on my hood and tries to grab it quickly. I get in and notice the seats are dry-- my car has been done for a long while and no one called me.I\'m so angry and hurt. I\'ve been trying to find a car wash that I could take my car to regularly. I thought I found it but was left disappointed. DON\'T GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS!'
