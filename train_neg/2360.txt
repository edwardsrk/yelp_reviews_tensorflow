b'If this past visit 1/29 was my first time - this might have gotten less stars. I hate hate hate giving bad reviews and I always try to seek out the things I like rather than the things I don\'t like - but I had a real "boner kill" experience this past time. I have gone here a few times in the past and had no problems and felt like everything was so quality. Today my boyfriend and I go after a long day and I order my fave - barn burner (add avocado) with zucchini and an extra little cup of ranch. We get our food, no avocado or extra ranch. Oh well, not a big deal! I check my receipt to triple check I paid for it - there it is! 1 x avocado $0.99! I go up to the front thinking it would be no big deal. I tell the sweet waitress, Erica, that I didn\'t get any avocado and ask if I can have some in a condiment cup. She says yes, asks the guy that\'s closest to her in the kitchen. He accuses me of lying, berates Erica and tells her he knows he put it on my burger. This dude must have issues - why the heck is he making a scene, saying I\'m lying and being rude to his coworker? I am so caught off guard by this. I look at Erica and tell her I\'ll show her my burger and my receipt. I do. She apologize and grabs me my dang avocado. Bottom line: waitress was so nice, food is good, cook guy is weird and I don\'t want to go to this location again. Food is 5/5 quality but cook guy 0/5'
