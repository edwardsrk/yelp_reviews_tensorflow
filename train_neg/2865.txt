b'Cute shop! Drove from the West Valley to pick up some sweets based on the reviews. There were very few items left in the case; however, it was the end of the day. Bought a few cupcakes and some cheesecakes. Tasted the Vanilla cupcake and it was less than noteworthy. There was nothing special about it and frankly tasted like box cake. The buttercream was horrible! It was cold, hardened and tasted like salted butter was used. Extremely disappointed! I definately will not be returning!!!'
