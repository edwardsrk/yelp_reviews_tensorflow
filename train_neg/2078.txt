b"Update: wasn't surprised to see CLE ranked dead last among medium sized airports in North America! I got a glimpse of the outside renovations/entrance and it looks good. Now just fix the shitty airport operations....------------------------------------------Hopefully the airport completes its rehab quickly... The check in area is in disarray... People walking all over the place with no clear indication/signs for where each airline ticketing location is... I agree construction can be a disruption but clear signage and airport staff guiding passengers will be helpful. Just a note: I have been flying out of CLE on a weekly basis for the past 2 months...To add to the chaos, TSA at CLE is the worst (not that they are good anywhere but you can't get through security in less than 30 mins). One Sunday evening the security line was all the way to the other end of the airport, and guess what there were 3 TSA Pre agents and no one for the regular line??? What were they thinking...Once you clear security check, the boarding area is clean and organized. Airline and restaurant staff are helpful and there are multiple flights leaving to all major hubs. There is a Starbucks right after clearing security and the line moves quick. They are open early am (5:30am) so you can get your fix. When landing, I recommend using the departures/ticketing level to exit as the arrivals level can get crowded pretty quick."
