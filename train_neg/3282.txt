b"The first time I went here for lane swim, they didn't update the online schedule to reflect that it had been cancelled and I only found out when I got to the building. The second time, I encountered rude staff at the front desk.The space itself is really nice (lots of sunlight). Change rooms and lockers are big and clean. The swimmers here go at a decent speed. Slow lane is slow; medium is just a tiny bit faster. Thank goodness the fast lane is exactly what I expect the speed to be. But one dude ruined my experience in what was otherwise a polite group of swimmers. Please, for the love of humanity, do not backstroke the entire length in a crowded fast lane without looking around to avoid whacking people."
