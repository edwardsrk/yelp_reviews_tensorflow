b"First time ordering from here, but was VERY disappointed. Delivery took almost an hour,  but I can forgive that on a Friday night. Food was generally terrible,  but maybe I just ordered poorly. Summary of my order:Tofu Pad Thai - bland and awful even with medium spicinessCrab Rangoon (cheese wontons) - not terrible, very cream cheesy. I prefer China One for theirs. Egg rolls - strange filling  (I wasn't a fan)Pot Stickers - Fair, but dry by the time they were delivered to me."
