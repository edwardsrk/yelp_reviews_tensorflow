b'If I had to rate this place on pizza alone, this review would be a lot different.First of all, I have had a $5 off an order of $20 or more coupon for.. well, I can\'t even tell you how long. Every time I call to place an order, they give me some new bs excuse as to why I can\'t use my coupon. ("Oh, we already ran your card" which, well, why the fuccccccc would you do that? And I\'m sure if I wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine. Or "Well, the you can\'t use that with the family deal," in which case, why the heck isn\'t that written on the coupon? That\'s really something that should be in the fine print.)Then tonight, my family in from out of state decides on pizza and wings... and regardless of the stupidity of their employees ("Well, the family deal DOES come with two two liters," "UH, no it doesn\'t... it comes with one..." "WELLL I am looking at it right here and it says TWO liters." REALLY? YES. ONE BOTTLE IS TWO LITERS. DERRRRRRP.) their pizza happens to be some of my fave. So we order pizza and wings, and we ask for medium wings with EXTRA wing hot sauce on the side. Instead, we get a vat of ranch and wings that are dryer than Betty White\'s.... well, yanno.'
