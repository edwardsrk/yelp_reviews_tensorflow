b"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had. We sat down around 6:20pm and it took over an hour to get our food. One table got up and left because it was soooo slow. The salad that was promised took 15 minutes to arrive and we never even got our breadsticks even though we were told 3 different times they were coming. Apparently there was only 1 person working the whole kitchen. I wish they would have said something before we wasted our time waiting. Honestly I've had better Italian food down the road. The service was sparse and not very friendly. I ordered Linguine and Meatballs. The meatballs were actually very good but the pasta was over cooked and there was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta given. I most likely won't be returning. I get better food and service at Olive Garden."
