b"Three strikes you're out: I gave this place three chances and all three times I had the same 3 sub-par experiences. Food is just okay, food is over-priced, and service leaves much to be desired. The first time I went it was brand new, so I tried again. Second experience, still fairly new but super busy, so I thought one more time.... but this time there was no excuse, particularly for the lack of enthusiasm by the wait staff. This is beer food at champagne prices."
