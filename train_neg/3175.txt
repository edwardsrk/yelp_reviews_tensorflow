b"This food... No. Ali Baba's usually pretty good for an average place. Meat quality is kind of bad... Great deal for 2 shawarmas but they don't taste that great. The veggies are fresh I guess, but the meat is what matters most. Really friendly and talkative owners. But would not make me come back."
