b'Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last night and as Crudo fans, we were hoping for awesome.  Unfortunately, it fell significantly short of awesome.  It was HOT in there and I really wanted to order a drink and pull up a chair for our server (who was sweet, kind, attentive and practically melting on her feet).  She said the AC hadn\'t been functioning well for weeks but management wasn\'t seeing it and customers weren\'t complaining.  (I saw at least five patrons including myself fanning themselves with menus.)    It was also extremely loud.  The acoustics are such that everything echos and it turned into Husband and I speaking loudly to each other.  Me: "Happy Anniversary!"Him: "We can\'t afford a new car."  The drinks were outstanding.  The food was...  meh.  I loved the hush puppies and goat cheese combo but Husband made the point that you shouldn\'t rely on condiments to make the meal.  He\'s right.  The little buggers were pretty dry.  I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and was underwhelmed.  I hate to say this but they were reminiscent of Sloppy Joes.  Husband had the pulled pork and as a BBQ fan, he was wasn\'t thrilled with it.  We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert.'
