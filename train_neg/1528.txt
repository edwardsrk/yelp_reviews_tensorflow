b"Visited this place on November 19th 2016, which is National Adoption Day, and the service was horrible. The cashier that helped me was okay, but i got her to open up and become more customer friendly. We had roughly 20 people with us as an adoption was finalized and we went there to celebrate. As we had been sitting there possibly 15 to 20 minutes, a woman is all black with dyed blond hair came and placed reserved signs on the tables we we occupied and told us that we didn't have to move just yet. At that time it was 1:40 pm and the reservation was for 2 pm and we haven't even received our food at the time. The food came out sporadically as we'd get chicken wings, then bread-sticks and pizza last. This place is going downhill and could be saved if the employees were more courteous to the customers as this is a consumer based business."
