b"In fact, I don't want to give any star for this restaurant. I am sorry for this while I think I have to tell you that. I placed my order through taste away about 40 minutes ago, and I went to pick up my order 20 mins ago. I gave the credit as my food was on time and ready to pick up when I arrived. My order according to menu is Gheyman Plate, as stated in its description: veal stew, includes rice or fries, and soup or salad.                           It does sounds good, but but but the food is just too bad. I'm not lying to you, the stew got 3-4 slices finger tip size meat and hardly identified as veal. The taste of the meat like stuff is so-dry & awfully weird. There is no way it is something stew. More than that, I found fries in my stew! Yeah, you hear me right and clear! They put fries in my stew. The stew comes along with fries literately! The taste of the soup in the stew is bad bad bad and I couldn't take a second sip.  Trust me, I can identify whether it is weird or simply bad.I strongly suggest you NOT go to this restaurant, if you do, DON'T order the stew like dishes at least.The people in the house doesn't looks as evil as the food though.Not to mention the fries from the house is no good, or the salad (I chose Coleslaw and my girlfriend just tried one bite of it then quit eating)."
