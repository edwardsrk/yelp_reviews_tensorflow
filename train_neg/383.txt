b"So I take my truck for a wash.  After they pull it out of the wash, it sits in the sun without being moved forward as cars ahead are completed.  Needless to say the truck was covered in sun-dried water spots.  I ask the have it run through again.  This time it's in the shade in line, but they take so long for get to it, it dried.   Once they do get to it, attendants do the windows, wheels, and inside oiling (I call it that because dash and arms rests are dripping with something oily).  The outside body of my truck didn't not get a wipe down.  Spotty, dirt, and bird droppings left on it that running through the wash didn't get.  Do not go here.  You'll be wasting your money and leaving disappointed."
