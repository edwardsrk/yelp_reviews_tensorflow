b"Terrible doesn't begin to describe it. We were on the VIP list, but were forced to wait in the general admission/regular list line. They refused to even check their list to see if we were on it when we first got there. After waiting an hour to get in while they let countless numbers of locals in without considering the people in line, we finally got in. We were both supposed to have free admission, and I was supposed to have free drinks until 12:30, but when we got to the cashier, she said the men's VIP list was full, even though my date had been put on it in advance, and that they weren't doing free drinks that night, even though I had been told by our promoter on the phone that they were. Needless to say, we were idiots and paid the $40 for him to get in. Once in, the bar was so crowded we couldn't find it, there was no actual dance floor, just people milling around, and the majority of the tables were empty, even though when we asked if we could get one while we were in line, they said they were booked. WTF. I would suggest NEVER bothering to go here. They were rude, and the club sucked."
