b"2.5 starMy experience with Arepa is limited...  aside from having the Venezuelan style  Arepa at Arepa Cafe http://www.yelp.ca/biz/arepa-cafe-toronto#hrid:Pxplj67nbkQA-VCbm8_93w/src:self which I thoroughly enjoyed. When my Yelp Friend suggested Arepiando, I am IN!Prices wise, Arepiando's Arepa is almost half of what Arepa Cafe is charging... but the location of course matters a lot!! Arepiando is located in a Latin American area up in North York, while Arepa Cafe is down in Queen St West. The set up of Arepiando is more like a takeout place where you can watch the cook/cashier/owner preparing your arepa through the glass window.Arepiando might serves really authentic Colombia Arepa, but I didn't enjoy the white corn arepa as much, I found that it was just too crunchy and chewy.  Since in Colombia, Arepa usually eaten as Breakfast or Afternoon snacks, so most of the Arepa here at Arepiando has cheese and eggs as the main ingredients!My Yelp Friend decided on: Arepa con Chicharron ($5) - Fried Pork Skin with Cheese- So chewy... so dried... I am glad I still have all my teeth if not I won't be able to eat the pork... but I might have problem digesting it though- taste wise, it was pretty bland, the hot sauce on the side was pretty weak, I tried to dip it in the dressing.....Arepa Ranchera ($4) - Eggs with Chorizo and Cheese- definitely a breakfast sandwich.. the scrambled eggs were really fluffy but unfortunately the sausages were on the dry sideLulo Juice Cocktail ($1.50) and Strawberry Soda ($1.50)- My first experience with Lulo was good which has a citrus flavour- My friend's Strawberry Soda tasted just like cough syrup!! But he like cough syrup!The lady was so nice, even gave us a chicken empanada to try... but the empanada was meh too... bland and dry...I really want to like Arepiando........ Maybe it is just me??"
