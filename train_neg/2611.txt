b"Eat N' Park is the type of restaurant where you can already sort of tell what's going to be good about it. They are big on the smiley cookies as well as the pies of the month. Those pies are delicious, and the strawberry one in particular stands out as one I have to have every so often.Why the two stars then? Well, when I have to actually go in and Park N' Eat (bad pun intended), my experience is much different. I've been here several times over the years, and service has ranged from fine to nonexistent. I've never had mean servers, but I have had aloof ones. I remember a couple years ago I had to wait 30 minutes between being seated and having my order/drinks taken with family, then another 30 until the food arrived. That could be forgiven if the place was packed, but it was just about empty. It may not be fair to add that to my opinion since it was not recent, but it's those memories of a place that stick with you.Onto the food, over the years the staple for the family and myself is the mile-high meatloaf. It helps that it's hard to screw up, but those have always been nice and hearty, not to mention filling. In recent months I have also had the chicken wraps. They are nothing special, though the buffalo one is much spicier than expected. I've had a couple of their seafood dishes as well, which I haven't cared for.I would not go out of my way to eat here, especially with two buffets in walking distance of the place. If someone was in the area and knew exactly what they wanted from there, however, then I'd go, since if you know what to get and are able to be a bit patient, it can be a fine experience. If not, it's going to drag."
