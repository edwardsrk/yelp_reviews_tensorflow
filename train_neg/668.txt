b"Terrible experience overall.Service was so poorly coordinated it ruined our entire dinner, though the staff attempted to be polite. We were seated after being asked to wait for a while (even though half the tables were not taken).I ordered coffee with me dessert, but they didn't serve it until I had finished my dessert (15 minutes after I ordered it). I simply asked them to take the coffee back.Seating for two can be very tight and you hear the entire conversation of the table next to us.Food is not bad, definitely overpriced."
