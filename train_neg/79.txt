b"BEWARE: There is a guy who works here, tall, glasses and painfully forgetful. I've gone here a total of three times in the past month for a quick fix with my siblings and he's gotten our order wrong each of those times. He must be new, but he does seem genuinely sorry after he adds or subtracts something from our order.Regardless, he's not why I give this McDonalds 1 star.This place is usually jam packed with teens by 1pm during the school year and during the summer, just can't catch a break. Location is usually messy and has THE LOUDEST DOOR EVER! Service is mediocre to the max, then again, this is McDonalds, no 5 star review here."
