b'Stars are because of the product. Lack of stars is for the customer service. When we walked in noone greeted us. I could see a lady (redhead) watching us through the door yawning then eventually came out front. She came out with an attitude like we interrupted their fun in the back. And I just found a hair in my bowl and just asked for our money back. Anyways back to the female employee. No customer service and was rude. When our bowls were done...she just said "here you guys are" and left our bowls on the counter not telling us which one was which. We had 3 bowls total in our group. If you dont like your job im sure there are other people who need a job and will make customers experience more pleasant. The other girl (blonde) was great as well as the assistant manager. This was our 2nd visit to this location and unfortunately our last. Just expected more especially from this location due to the type of clientele.'
