b"My wife and I have been customers forever and the lack of customer service received at this store was appalling. We went to this store, received nothing but attitude from the associate, Bianca when we were trading our phones in for the $200 credit we were promised by the GM himself. This credit was part of a promo given when we renewed our contract two weeks before, which we completed with the GM. We came back two weeks later to get our iPhones that were out of stock the first time we went in. Instead, she wanted to give us $38 (where that number was from, couldn't be answered from her either) for our trade. After telling her, her own boss promised us the full $200, she said that we were wrong. We asked to speak to someone else, she refused. We confronted another assoiate and told him that she said $38 and he even disagreed with her. We asked to speak to her manager, then magically she came back stated that her manager on duty would override and give us the $200 credit. She was completely unprofessional and rude and it made our experience at this store annoying and horrible."
