b'My boyfriend and I have heard great things about the food at this place and decided to try it out. I called around 630 to try and place an order for pick up. The girl I spoke to said they currently weren\'t doing take out orders. Before asking for a manager, the only answer to any of my questions was "I don\'t know" with an "I don\'t care" attitude. Supposedly they ran out of to - go containers (in the middle of downtown Cleveland..? Really..?) and were not able to take carry out orders. Poor planning and Very unprepared. I\'ve heard great things about the food at this place, but not about the service. Working in the service industry myself, I know that customer satisfaction is key to having a successful business. If the actual service is any reflection to the rude phone conversation I had with an employee then I\'m more then happy to take my business elsewhere.'
