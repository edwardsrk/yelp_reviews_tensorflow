b'As a bar = good.  As a restaurant = not so good.  This review is based on my "dining" experience...Love that this place opened in the neighborhood, but based on my experience, I will only go for drinks from now on.  Yes - it is very cool inside, and love the balcony looking over the city.  The menu looks great on paper but the execution and service needs to have some kinks worked out.  Hoping it is just the newness factor.  The staff kept bringing us the wrong table\'s food.  Most times we knew it - except the one time.... We ordered "spicy tuna" rolls - It looked like a mess when it came out (like I would have rolled it.) but had some avocado and extras in it.... After my date and I finished it, the waiter brought out the "spicy tuna rolls" and we realized we just finished the people next to us rolls.  The other stuff we ordered (grilled cheese panini, fries) tasted good - but how could you screw that up?  You can tell that the waitress was working hard and was still friendly to us, but it just seems like there was some execution issues going on.  Hope they get things worked out.'
