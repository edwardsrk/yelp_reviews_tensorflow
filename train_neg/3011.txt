b"Update:Ok. We have come here each year on this weekend, at least 2 times per visit for 3 years. I feel like a relative has died. This is no longer an English Gastropub. It's a mish mash of anything they can throw together. It's nothing more than any other generic bar with food now. It's owned by some conglomerate and the quality is down. They have PBR ON TAP!!!!  For 4$. They are just doing the same get the drunks to come in thing that everyone else does. The music in here is some weird mix that more correctly belongs in a dark jazzy club but not exactly. It does NOT belong in this space. Nothing is congruent. Nothing is unique. And it's bad. It's 7:13pm on a Thursday and there is no one here. Just me and my husband. These are death throws. Jack of all trades, master of none. Anthony Bourdain would turn on his heels and walk out. Way to go conglomerate. This is nothing more than an Applebee's. More shitty mediocre food in the sea of shitty mediocre food in downtown. I'm disappointed. And I'm not coming back."
