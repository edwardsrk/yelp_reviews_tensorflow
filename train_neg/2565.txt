b"Not what it use to be. We've had more than one bad experience. There are plenty of employees working, but somehow no one is doing the right thing. Waiting way to long to be seated, to long for water at the table, no one sure whose table it is. Brunch took 3 hours and not because we wanted it to. Terrible service. Gave a 2, because our food was good. Just took forever to come out. Just not acceptable. There is obviously a management issue, as there is plenty of staff and they are polite, eager and capable. They were not busy, lots of empty tables. I think there is misdirection. Obvious issues on many visits. Last visit for us."
