b'We really needed a pick me up so stopped in for some iced coffees.  We were all turned off by the burned fry oil smell right away...   and we smelled like that for the rest of the day... it was in our clothes, our hair... everything.   We asked the 2 girls working there what flavors for iced coffee there were... the answer we got was "anything you can imagine"  We asked if there was a list. They said no but to just mention a flavor and they would tell us if they had it.  The flavors we ended up getting didn\'t even change the taste of the coffee... I could have made a better coffee from my keurig at home.  It was very weak and bitter.We were even more upset when we found out the prices we were charged were over a dollar more than what is posted on the price list!!!! When we asked, all we were told was "I\'m sorry"'
