b'on 11/18 looks like the owner wrote a reply....what he said was a lie!!  If what he said was true then we would not have had to go to the Registrar of Contractors; who agreed the granite needed to be replaced due to the size of the grout lines, some were as large as 1/8" inch.  Nor would we still be unsatisfied after a 2nd counter tops was installed. They replaced the kitchen counter top last week2/26/15. The seams were raised, bumpy and rough. We called Mary, the manager who is unable to make a decision without speaking to someone else, and said we wanted the seams smoothed and polished. She brought over a sample of what  we should expect from the seams. The sample was smooth as can be with hardly a  noticeable seam. They came out on the 3rd and smoother the seams, Why didn\'t they do this in the first place. But now there about  a 6" width running along  each  seam where the granite is duller than the rest of the counter top.  We called Mary again and she was very doubtful of our complaint. Of course she has to confer with someone else. We have not heard back from her today. Why hasn\'t someone from their organization, who can make decisions, bothered to contact us. They could not even be bothered to show up for the meeting with the ROC.'
