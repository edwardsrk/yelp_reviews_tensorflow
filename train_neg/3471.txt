b"I really wanted to like this place because I live within walking distance and I love sushi. One problem: there were little bones in my sushi roll. If I'm paying $14 for a roll, I feel like there shouldn't be bones in it, call me crazy. Otherwise it was ok, a little pricey and the service was nothing special. Won't be coming back unless someone else really wants to."
