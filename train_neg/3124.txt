b"Stopped in after a long day of shopping and moving with a few friends. The overall cleanliness of the establishment was good. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a Red Chili burro plate - came with rice and side of beans - Lets just say I was very disappointed . The Rice was dry and bland - the Red Chili burro had no flavor at all, to top it off they wanted to charge you 25 cent for a refills! It's bad enough the fountain drinks were two or more dollars! tisk tisk."
