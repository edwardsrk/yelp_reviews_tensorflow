b'My pedicure was great but when I got my mani he totally skipped the lotion/massage part. When I asked he acted as if it wasn\'t part of it. No big deal right? I\'ll just make sure I\'m not paying for something I\'m not getting. We\'ll, it\'s supposed to be included. He said he gave it to me! Woman there said, "why would he lie?"  What?! Why would I lie? I felt embarrassed and a little annoyed. They took $5 off but I look forward to that part so can\'t get over the disappointment. I won\'t go back.'
