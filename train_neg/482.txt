b"My daughter bought a 250 scooter from a friend and we were hoping to get it checked out.  The guy was so rude, obviously doesn't realize that if you offer to help a young college student who just bought a foreign scooter (which he made clear was a piece of ___brand.), you might make a sale in the future,  especially when her parents are with her.  We ended up taking it to O'Reilly's Auto Parts and he help us with the part we needed for her mirror, NO CHARGE.  She thanked him and gave him a a card for free coffee at the coffee stand she works at.  I highly recommend going to a different scooter shop than Scooter Invasion.  No one deserves to be treated like that."
