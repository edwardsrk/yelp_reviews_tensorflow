b"I've had 2 bad experiences with them. My packages were coming from Kohls, when tracking it always says they had a failed delivery attempt and will redeliver next business day. It's odd because in those days UPS, Fed Ex, USPS managed to deliver my packages. They never delivered my package or updated the tracking info. I contacted their customer service which was  very unhelpful, was not able to update me on my package or reason why it wasn't delivered. Finally just contacted kohls who informed me that my package was already on the way back to their warehouse and I'd have to place another order if I actually wanted my stuff."
