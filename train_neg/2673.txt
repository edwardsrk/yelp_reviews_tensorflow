b"Let's face it.for 20 bucks, all you can eat, it is decent.the meat was ok fir the price, the spicy pork was a bit too hot, but still good.the problem was servers.I had to look for them every time we need more dishes and every time they came,always lower the fire.never asked first if we need any thing.I think I rather go to Hwaro on decatur.felt like ignored."
