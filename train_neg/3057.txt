b"NOTE: Yelp has two listings for this business but even after submitting edits, will not remove or merge them. The other page is under Jin Jin You Wei. Not sure what the deal is, or if that's just a translation. Former space occupied by Island Malaysian #2, in the same building as Ichiza.Now that that's out of the way...Went in to grab takeout, was the only customer for dinner at 7PM on a weekday. Small order took literally half an hour to come out and the food was mediocre.Ordered the steamed dumplings and lamb pancake. Dumplings were mushy, overcooked, and bland. Taste and appearance were identical to what you'd get frozen in a bag at the grocery store and boiling yourself. Pancake contained a small portion of flavorful lamb- too bad it was overshadowed by all the grease. Opened the takeout box to a puddle of oil. picked up the pancake and had it all over my hands, bit in and got a mouthful of it too. Gross!Service was dismal at best. As the only customer, the wait time was unacceptable and no excuse or apology was given. I found it frustrating that the dumplings only come 10/order and cannot be mixed and matched with other flavors or styles. I thought it was a reasonable request, and possibly one they should consider in light of their lack of customers as a new business. Server barely spoke to me, not even when dropping off or picking up my bill."
