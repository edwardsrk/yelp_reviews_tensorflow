b"Let's start with this. The food is great. Everything we ate was cooked to perfection-albeit stingy portions for the price. Not to say that it's easy but their style is all pretty much pre made. Nicely roasted chicken, rice, etc. So it should be pretty easy to keep it all smooth right? Well not in the slightest apparently. We were quickly seated, handed menus and offered drinks. Fifteen minutes later the bartender noticed nobody had brought them to us so he did himself. And took our order after noticing nobody had done so. Food came out and that was the last we heard from anyone there. I stopped a waitress and asked for a second drink. Never got it. Our plates sat empty for a good half hour as staff busily wandered with nothing in hand. We had to beg to get a check and then beg even more to pay it. I hope they get it together. The food was really good. But it won't last long if they don't."
