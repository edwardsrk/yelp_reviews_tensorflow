b"I wasn't impressed at all. The servers are helpful. But the freshly squeezed juices are horrible. If your going to charge me $4 it better taste freshly squeezed, hand picked, and good. As far as the crepes I wasn't too impressed. The omelets were dry. Plus the food was pricey. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place just doesn't cut it."
