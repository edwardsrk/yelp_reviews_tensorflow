b"This review is strictly for the happy hour at Chima.I love meat.  That's all there is to it.  And I don't eat meat very often at all, so when I go out, I like to order it to my heart's content and that's why we stopped by Chima for happy hour on a Friday (plus points).  I believe it lasts from 5-8PM, but i'm not quite sure, so don't quote me on that.The happy hour is only at the bar which is located up the stairs from the hostess table.But not everything on the menu is apart of the happy hour, so look for the *** that shows which are not.My two friends and I ordered drinks, regular priced because they did not have many drink specials.  (minus points, but I know that it is partially due to Charlotte's insanely stupid happy hour laws, who even has time to legislate happy hour laws!?!?)  anywho, we ordered 3 drinks, I got something with mango or strawberry and I did not even finish it, it was too sweet and not very good.  The others seemed to think their drinks were okay, one got a martini and the other ordered the latin mixed drink that starts with a C, I cannot recall the name.The food, we ordered carpaccio, which i really enjoyed, and some skewers.  One of them was filet with bacon, not that great and the other, which I cannot remember was not great either.So three drinks and three apps came out to $60.Not the best happy hour i've been to.  Bad drinks, mediocre food and slow service, try your time somewhere else."
