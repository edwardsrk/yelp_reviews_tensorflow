b"I was totally dis-satisfied with the service provided. The barber seemed to be in a hurry and it took a total of 15 minutes to walk-in, taking haircut, and making payment. I pointed out within 2 minutes of when haircut was started that he is making my hairs too short, and I don't want that. Instead of acknowledging and course correcting, he kept on arguing that he is professional and he knows how my haircut will look perfect in the end. When I said that he seems to be in a hurry, his argument was that he is a perfectionist and he doesn't waste client's time and judge him when he is done. Well, I am done with this shop and judging him now for his arrogance and behavior. Even at the payment table, when I said that I am not satisfied, the guy argued that he is a professional and he thinks that my hair looks perfect and I SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM. Well, you should first listen to your customer. I am not coming back for sure"
