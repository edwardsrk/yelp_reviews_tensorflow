b"Location: On the main, in the heart of the action - at least during the Mural festival. Street parking is available but metered. Your best bet is to use transit and/or walk over.The place: Bare with the quintessential minimalist look. I can't say the vibe is warm and inviting because really, it's rather sterile - perhaps they want to discourage lingerers? In any case, this attracts hipsters like a moth to light so it won't be in my top five coffee places to frequent. There's only so much pretentiousness I can stand.The goods: Not my favourite coffee. I found it bitter and unimpressive. I had high hopes but nope, it just didn't work for me. I had a Cortado and from what I tasted of the home made cashew milk, it had a nice flavour to it but the coffee roast just overpowered it. The croissant was fresh and pretty good.Service: Slow as f**k. There was some hipster douche bag who obviously knew the girl behind the counter and he just kept going on and ON about useless, superficial shit because HEY - no one else is waiting in line! Rather then move him along, the clerk just kept talking to him. Had I known the coffee would be so underwhelming, I would have gone to my usual spot. Price point: I think the Cortado was over $3, while the croissant was something like $2.25."
