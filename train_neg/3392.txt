b"This place is no longer was it once was. No more fun thrills and cheap food. I remember going in there it was ALWAYS crowded, even people overflowed onto the sidewalk. Their famous $2 Heinekens and $1 half pound hot dogs and shrimp coctails.. and the best of all were real dealers at the blackjack and roulette tables. It's all been replaced. Video blackjack and video roulette. Where's the fun in that? No more cheap beer or food either, just a subway and Nathan's. And worst of all it's deserted now.. it was one of the last old school feel places and now that feeling is gone!"
