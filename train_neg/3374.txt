b"The food was Terrible, everything seemed frozen and reheated in a microwave. I went for brunch so I tasted their breakfast it was disgusting and their lunch was the same. Not too much to choose from and what they have is not worth it not even the desserts were good. Don't waste your money here go to the one in Cesar palace is more expensive but it's so worth it you won't be sorry. This ones just leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth"
