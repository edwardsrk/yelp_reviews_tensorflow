b'I went to a Spring Training game here on Monday 3/17/14.  The stadium is just off the freeway so I arrived in the area about 75 minutes before the game.  The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.  I waited almost an hour to get to what I thought was the parking lot only to find out it was the parking for the local Marriott.  People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.Inside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.'
