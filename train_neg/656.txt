b'Having dealt with sub-standard contractors and spending hours on the phone trying to resolve issues with our Service Agreement (it\'s not a home WARRANTY, there\'s a difference!), I\'ve learned the hard way that the entire industry is a rip-off. 2-10\'s policy is to deny claims right off the bat, even those that are legitimately, undeniably covered. After you\'ve called back repeatedly, they may dispatch a contractor, but not the reputable kind that you would want to make repairs to your home, more like the fly-by-night companies who are only able to continue their existence because of Home "Warranty" companies. Avoid this predatory industry and hire your own contractors, in the end you\'ll have peace of mind knowing the repairs will be done right and end up saving money over paying the annual fees for a Service Agreement that isn\'t worth the time you\'ll spend scouring it to discover all the exclusions and limitations.'
