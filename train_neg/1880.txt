b"This place collected my keys and did successful inspection at move out and now 5 months later I've been contacted by collections for a cleaning fee and a water bill. When I called and spoke with the property manager Christina, she had no file with employee name who inspected my unit and took my forwarding address. When I asked her why they didn't call me if they failed to record my new address, she claimed that's not in their policy. She hung up on me after providing me her supervisors name and number. This is one more instance in the 10 months I lived there of the staff having no communication with each other pertaining to the business of their tenants. It's such a shame since I paid the last 2 months of my lease when I didn't live there, had carpet shampooed, scrubbed the bathroom and kitchen. This place is my worst nightmare come true."
