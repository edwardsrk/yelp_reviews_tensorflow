b"I love Mexican food and I was really excited when I found Hussong. They really didn't deliver when it came to great taste. The only things I enjoyed was the grilled corn and the margarita. The salsa was flavorless, the Chicken in the Chicken Fajitas barely had seasoning or flavor, and my boyfriend didn't enjoy his baja shrimp tacos. The service wasn't the greatest either. Food took forever to come and we felt rushed to leave. I wanted to take some chips to help me eat my leftovers since I ate all my tortilla but the busboy snatched them off the table before I could even put some in my box. For the money we spent, it wasn't worth it."
