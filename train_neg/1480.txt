b'We we there Saturday night with another couple. Food was very good so no complaints there. Service was terrible, they could not wait to turn over the table. Waiter stood against the wall glaring at us. Salad plates, bread plates were removed from table immediately upon finishing. We were not asked if we wanted another drink or if we wanted dessert. Waiter grimaced when we ordered dessert. It was not a relaxing , enjoyable evening. Will not return.'
