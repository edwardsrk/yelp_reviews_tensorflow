b"Waiter was over the top cheesy.  Talked too much.  A bit obnoxious.No gluten-free options for pizza or pasta (Ferro's on St. Clair offers gluten-free options that are amazing - go there instead if you eat gluten-free).One of the specials had risotto as a side so I asked if I could just have a small bowl of the risotto as my main and the waiter said no - didn't even go check with the kitchen - flat out no.  Treated me like I was asking them to make risotto from scratch.So I ordered a steak instead which was good but if I wanted steak would have gone to the keg in the first place.Marcello's is clearly stuck in the past....no variety for those with dietary restrictions."
