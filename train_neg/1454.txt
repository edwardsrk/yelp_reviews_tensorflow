b"Yes. Stay away.  Not only do they have bad customer service but are out right rude and don't really now what's going on.  So had them bend some rods for us before, which did not fit so we had to pay for it to be redone for us.  Now the second one was also not done properly.  So not only is it bad service but bad work as well."
