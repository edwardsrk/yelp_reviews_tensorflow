b"Hadn't been here in about two years and remembered that it was good so we went back. The place has gone downhill. They used to staff the place appropriately to keep the line moving but now it's excruciatingly slow. Ordered a Chicago style, asked if they knew how to make it and they said yes. They did not. The hot dog was literally half the size of the bun and it had hot sauce on it. I, at first, mistook it for ketchup and took it back. When they said it was hot sauce I asked why they put hot sauce on my hot dog and they just stared blankly. Husbands burger resembled a tiny hockey puck. They seem to clearly be cutting corners on staffing, ingredients, and training and it shows."
