b"Disappointed in their shoe return policy.  I will not shop for shoes there again.  Other high end stores will accept returns even after you have worn the shoes if they don't fit or cause blisters etc.  saks refused to accept a return for a defect in the shoes and doesnt even have a shoe repair person to atleast fix the defect."
