b'Well I thought I would give this place another chance It is obvious that if you come in alone you will be treated like crap .. I had just worked a very long shift at the hospital up the street and in wanted to finely get a bite to eat and use my gift card I had ..Well I was taken to my table and saw my waiter 2 times .. they had not gotten busy till I left .. I dont know maybe I should of told my waiter that even though I am alone I do tip well maybe that would of had him to give me a little bit more time ...It is really sad because I would of never treated him like that if he came into my place of employment.. and I did tip well on a 20.00 bill Sad to say I think I am totally done now and I should just give a whole new restaurant a chance to win me over Very sad and disappointed'
