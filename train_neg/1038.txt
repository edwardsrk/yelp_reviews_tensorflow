b"This place is horrible! Its so  close to the street that it feels like I'm sleeping on the sidewalk because of how loud it is! The apartment my boy friend got smells like a rodent cage! What a shitty place to move someone into a place that smells like crap! It's not far enough west so it's still in the ghetto I even seen some kids cussing each other out and fighting by the play area! I hate it here!"
