b'So went there with high hopes based upon reviews. Was really disappointed. The place itself was really nice with the decor and atmosphere. The first server that saw us came and sat us, then two other servers came and asked if we had been helped. That may seem like good customer service, but the way that they acted it was as if there was no server rotation. Watched the same server take the next two tables while the other servers were doing side work. As we were leaving two purple came in to eat at 1 pm and the same server we had said they closed in five minutes even though anything I saw said 2 pm.Now in regards to the food, a single mimosa shows on the menu as $5.95 but the actual price on the ticket was $6. That may not seem like a lot but when they sell thousands that adds up. The lemon poppyseed pancakes did not have any lemon flavor to them, I ordered a burger and it was bland and overcooked. The fries had no salt on them what so ever. Would not eat here again.'
