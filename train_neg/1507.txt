b'My wife and I went there for our anniversary.  Right after we were seated, someone came over to confirm our names.  (My father had called them to buy us a bottle of wine.)  The waiter knew this, but did not mention it until after we had both ordered very expensive cocktails.  Once we had these and had taken a sip, then he proudly announced the wine gift.  What a dick!  We would never have ordered the cocktails if we had know that we were being bought a bottle of wine!  Then the food was no way near worth the price.  Will never go back, bad move Dresslers..'
