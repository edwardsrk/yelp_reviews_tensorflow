b'We have gone to the buffer for years back when they had crab nightly and for us it was the best buffet ever. We always ate here one while visiting from SoCal The crab buffet  ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on Friday night so we wentWe waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm. They had several VIP lines and sat everyone in those lines before general public - very unfair. The crab legs were tiny baby crab no meat like before and poor tastingThis buffet went from the top of our choice to where we will never go back They are out of town in Henderson and used to worth the drive but  not anymore most other casinos have a better buffet and better service'
