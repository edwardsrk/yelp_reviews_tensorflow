b'This world is so frustrating sometimes. Went to Walmart to grab a pool float, well as I am walking down the aisle. I see a man and a stroller bent over with some pilers and a box. Well it made a noise and I booked it back, he threw down the pilers and put the box in the stroller. Leaving the security tag and the pilers . I followed him and went to security. Told him what the man was wearing. He said "oh people are watch the cameras they will get it if they see anything". So basically this guy walked off with what I\'m guessing is a cell phone without paying for it.  In my mind I was weary because he had his kid with him. But SERIOUSLY! What is wrong with people. Do nothing about criminal activity and let him get away. I only wonder what his child will learn from him. Smdh basically they do nothing when informed of someone stealing.
