b"Let me start by saying I've never been treated so bad at a restaurant. My husband and I sat at the bar and it took 5 min for the bartender to ask us if we wanted a drink. Mind you they were not busy at all there were only 3 other people in there. So after I got my water she said she would be back to take our order but walked around for 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing. When I asked for a server her terrible boss had an attitude while she rolled her eyes and kept running her smart ass mouth. Worse service hands down, no wonder they were empty. They get one star for the nice fish tank."
