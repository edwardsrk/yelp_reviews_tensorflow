b"We were pressed to find a reservation for 6 people at 7 pm on a Saturday, but Tonic was able to accommodate us. Our service was very good. However, the food was generic. The decor is seriously outdated. The paint on the walls was chipped. It's a shame that a restaurant at such a prime location with challenging competition puts up such a bad show."
