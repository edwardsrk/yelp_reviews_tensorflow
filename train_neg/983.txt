b'Just was not a fan. My wife and I were excited to try the place and left leaving our bowls more than half full.  Just thought flavors were off (bland), atmosphere was less than pleasant, and staff were very blah. Shocked by all the good reviews............maybe I will try it again and see if I was just delirious that day.'
