b'The steaks once received were for the most part great if the waitress was listening on the order. In our group of seven she apparently checked out on three of the orders. Outside of that if you have either a flare gun or road side flares then use them as that apparently is the only way to get service from the wait staff. One of our group did snag an employee passing by and asked if we could have our sides served to stave of delirium from hunger due to the pro-longed delay. No dice... Instead we got a kid in a suit advising us to not to "fill up on bread..." As our waitress shouted problems at him that we had brought up earlier.Steaks = greatExperience = badWait staff = terribleManagement = Pretentious... & covering for deficiencies!'
