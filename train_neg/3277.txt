b"THE worst and most unprofessional TSA workers in the nation.  I fly several times a month and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had.  It all starts with the hallway to TSA (see pic) which is hot, crammed and leads to two check stations that not only hand checked EVERY bag after being scanned but also acted like every task performed was a chore for them.  After tossing my bag on the table for a hand check, I was asked if I had sharp or breakable items.  Really???  Yes!  I have a glass ornament which is why I'm not checking my bag!  The airport itself is way outdated so no reason to go on about all its downfalls.  Save yourself the hassle and choose another city.  Keep it classy Cleveland"
