b"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, disappointing food. I had the salmon, which was well well done (they didn't ask for a temp). Came with 4 beet chunks and a spoonful of parsnip pur\xc3\xa9e. Way under seasoned, and no salt on the table. Other entrees were also meh, with the exception of the steak melt sandwich, which got rave reviews from my slightly drunk gma. Server was excellent, but the kitchen just wasn't on their game."
