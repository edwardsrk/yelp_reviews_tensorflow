b'5 for services; 1 for food! We ordered fried rice, Pho, and ramen. I could not believe they used instant noodle for Ramen. However, Waitresses were very nice, I wish food is a bit better. the "chef" should take some cooking courses on YouTube, it will help the business a lot since you already have good service'
