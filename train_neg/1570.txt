b'Thought we\'d try this theater on a trip back from Mesa. Sat for 40 minutes with audio--NO VIDEO!  Got up and went down the hall TWICE to tell management but they were too stupid to fix it.  "it\'s run by a computer....I sent a guy up there to look at it..." the manager said.  On the third trip to see management and hearing dumb excuses we asked for our money back.  Got our ticket prices refunded but were out $16.75 for popcorn and drinks..  They could care less that their customers were unhappy and that their equipment doesn\'t work.  We will never go back.  Bless you Dan Harkins for true movie experiences.  We are back to giving only you our attendance from now on!!'
