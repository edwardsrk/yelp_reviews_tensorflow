b"I defiantly don't recommend this place to eat on a weekend. I have been here many times during weekdays. I noticed the food is ok when the older gentle man is working during the week; it's in decent shape when he's around. I been here a few times during the weekend and all those times the food quality was not that good. I just had a meal here again this weekend; I mean I tried to, but couldn't eat any more. Had to garbage it since they would not refund me. The boneless chicken was very very dry and hard, and the noodles were so dry they looked black almost. I complained they just offered me Pasta, like seriously? I really should have snapped a photo. I can understand why they lack in business. IF, I repeat, IF, I come here again, it won't be on a weekend, but I doubt I'll be back again."
