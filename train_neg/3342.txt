b'Their service was not good.  I came here to pick out brides maids dresses... They were not helpful at all and ignored our presence the whole time.  Granted, they were pretty busy, but I wish they scheduled us for another day.  We pretty much picked out our dresses ourselves.  Unfortunately, it seem like everyone goes here to pick out their bridal dresses....'
