b"I love Einstein's Brothers Bagels and when they changed this location to a Caribou I was excited that they were keeping the Einstein's menu. However, the customer service here is nowhere near as good as when it was an Einstein's. Customers are not allowed to get their own coffee refills, and if you buy a $4 latte they charge you a full coffee price to get a drip refill, even when you are reusing your original cup. Some of the younger employees are quite nice and helpful, but overall the service is more in support of the corporation than the customers."
