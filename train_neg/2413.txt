b'Took entirely too long bring drinks, serve food, bring check.  No water refills, salad was too big and entree was too small.  This was for lunch and the place seemed to be severely understaffed. There was even a guy who sat down, and lost his patience and left after waiting for the waitress to stop by.Food was okay though.'
