b"We signed up through a deal they have with Costco. If you ever need to customer service expect wait times up to 45 minutes trying to get through. I was stood up twice for service on my cooler wasting valuable time and ended up being without a functional cooler for 4 weeks. I decided to cancel after a receiving an unacceptable canned reply by email with no phone call. Of course I was on hold for 45 minutes just to cancel my service. There was no attempt to make it right as is they didn't care. If you ever think you need service, don't expect to get it here. I hope management gets a clue as I appear not to be the only one giving poor ratings. Costco also needs to rethink their partner if they haven't already."
