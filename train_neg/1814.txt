b'This company does nothing but volume sell timeshare sales spots for the various timeshare locations in Las Vegas.  they get paid by how many people they bring in...and this is by promising what they don\'t deliver on.  They will bait and switch, for example initially offered The Jockey Club as the stay location ( where the timeshare is) then switched to another property, then to the substandard Riviera.  So it is basically a switch from a $250 updated property to long long lines for check in,tired $50 a night hotel. And they lie about other properties that are alternatives, then switch in the substandard hotel.  When I noticed that the Riviera even wanted to charge a "resort" fee, Resort Stay said there were no fees we would have to pay, then said they were not responsible for this "incidental." A real shady operation, and even when complaining, a "supervisor" will not give a last name to what sounds like a concocted first name.'
