b'I think my review is based mainly on the fact that I\'m over the age limit to be in here.  We came about a month ago with some friends to go dancing.  We got all decked out, had too many drinks at home and off we went.The place is so crowded you can\'t move on the dance floor at all.  My husband is almost 6\'5" and kept getting ran into by teeny tiny girls who had no regard for their surroundings or people around them.After about an hour of this we headed out to another bar with less people and more room.Bottom line - if you are under 25, or out on the town for a bachelorette party this is the place to be...ride the mechanical bull, dance in uncomfortable confines and shoes....regret it in the morning.  If not, head somewhere else!'
