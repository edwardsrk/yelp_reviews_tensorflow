b"There should be an option for 0 stars. My wife was in a car accident and came in an ambulance so she went in right away but it took over an hour for someone to examine her. 3 days later she was released after just having a seizure 4 hours earlier and passing out when getting up. Further more no prescription for pain medicine or muscle relaxers. They say just follow up with you primary care physician. She didn't make home before I had to take her somewhere else."
