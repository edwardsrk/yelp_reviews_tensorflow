b"I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again."
