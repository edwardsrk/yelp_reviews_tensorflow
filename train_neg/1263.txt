b'I have been to this location several times In the past year since several friends and myself are getting married.Pros: decent selection and okay prices, decent hoursCons: Staff are frustrating to work with, it\'s apparent commissions and the bottom dollar is the first priority.  Appointments are rushed, crowded with lots of people, and they wont document your information so remember what you like if you go back. Customer service is very poor.I had to call three different times to request my dress to be shipped to me, which I told them when I ordered it and they said they put it in my order, since I am now living out of state (I still dont have it a month later after it arrived in the store).  They give the run around to honor bridesmaid discounts.Be specific when you order and before you pay, sales are final which they won\'t always say that it can take 8 or even 12 weeks for some dresses because they are "made-to-order" dresses, dont be pushed to buy 6-9months out, for their sales goals to be reached.  Go there for a decent selection but it is not a good experience for your happy occassion.Be on your toes, ask specific questions, and be aware that they may not have your best interest as a customer in mind as much as they have the profits in mind.'
