b"The Great Greek used to be my favorite place for lunch or pick up. But that changed today, last time I picked up the food was just okay. Salad with mushy tomatoes. So I figured maybe an off day.   Today I ordered the same as always 2 salads with two med rare steak skewers. When I got home with my food once again mushy tomatoes but this time the steak was so well done I could not eat it Two salads both with charred steak skewers.  Not sure what happened in the last couple of months but I I'll not be back."
