b"Average coffee. Decided to try Mayorga at the recommendation of a friend and was disappointed. The espresso lacked any kind of rich or creamy quality and tasted like a latte you would order at McDonalds or Sheets. They have a mixture of Torani and Monin syrups, and it would have been nice to know which flavor was what brand as Monin syrups are much better quality and probably would've helped. However, the staff was friendly. Prices are a bit expensive but hey, it's an airport."
