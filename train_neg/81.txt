b"My friend and I were there this afternoon at 6 PM May 25, 2017 we ordered cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwiches barbecue chips and waterMy sandwich was not fresh the bread was stale it had chopped apples no Pecans. They had no barbecue chips even though they were displaying them they only had one salt and vinegar chips and they had no bottled water of any kind. The beverage cabinet at the front by the register was completely emptyThe only good thing about this meal is I ordered a peanut butter smoothie and that one was fine. My friend ordered the same sandwich that I did instead she was delivered and Apple turkey sandwich that was very dry. No chips we had to go after the chips and they had no water and no napkins with our meal or on the table. The only beverage they were offering was soda, and smoothies. I definitely will never return to this topic and a smoothie's caf\xc3\xa9"
