b'Lately this Jack-In-the Box has just been a disappointment. We typically always check our bags because they seem to always forget something...it was a mistake we didn\'t this time. It took 30mins to get through a drive thru with 3 people in line I had to repeat everything multiple times & before I could even get my order out he would interrupt me just before I was going to say what he asked. There is a somewhat scripted protocol I get it. But allow the person to speak 1st if they don\'t answer what you need then ask...I sat there for 5 mins just to order, I know exactly what I want, let me tell you please...don\'t make me talk to you like a prompted robot, that was a headache. Then we gave them a $20 w/ exact change, they give us $3 in quarters...they didn\'t have anymore $1s my honey paid for it & his biggest pet peeve is "dirty" change...that why we give exact. Now he has $3 he\'s gotta dig out his wallet which I had to hear about, thanks to whoever\'s poor planning...I go to ask for Ketchup & he interrupts to tell me bye & have a good night...do I not get condiments???Come home & figure out apparently you don\'t get the fries with your combos anymore either. We upgrade to a large because all he wanted really was the Jack Fries...then no freakin fries!?!?! When there was 3 people to serve you took 30mins!!! You couldn\'t even give us a complete order!!!! Now I have to blame myself for not checking the bag as we speed out just to get the heck outta there, but no it\'s their fault! My honey is saying he doesn\'t even want to eat out anymore because of all the poor customer service, great now I\'m getting more cooking duties, thanks Jack'
