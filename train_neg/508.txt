b"We came with a graduation party of 23 tonight. The evening manager came out and said that even though there was adequate seating he could not seat us because it would back up the kitchen. He was not very welcoming either. The waitresses seemed confused by his decision as well. We kindly decided to go to McCormick and Schmick's where they happily took our money. It's a shame, I hear this place is really good."
