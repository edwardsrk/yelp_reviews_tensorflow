b"I've tried to shop at Montblanc Toronto several times but the selection is very limited and the sales staff while attentive, not very friendly. Recently I tried to replace a ring I received as a gift and lost.  The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.  Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.  The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 stars to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 stars."
