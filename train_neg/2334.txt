b"*2.5*Since my review from January, I have been going to Iam Yoga on a regular basis. I am sad to report, however, that they have gone downhill by A LOT. The change rooms, which were the highlight of many people's experiences, are now  a nightmare. The showers no longer have the shampoo, conditioner and body wash that they once boasted, and the drain is constantly clogged. The shower heads have been broken on several occasions as well.I have also discovered that the after-work classes (5pm, 6:30pm and 8pm) get extremely packed and smelly. Luckily, I've been able to avoid those. The lobby area, the practice room and the staff have remained alright, but the bathrooms really turn me off from continuing here now."
