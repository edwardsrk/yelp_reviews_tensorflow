b'Lots of promises from salesman, unfortunately none came to fruition.  Our new wi Dow and door project was scheduled to be finished in 3 days.  We have called over 10 times, only to get an answering machine.  They have our 50% down payment, so they seem happy.  I found the numbers of the new owners (Al 480-495-5513 and Dan 707-655-1000).  Called Dan and finally got some action.  (After threats to call in the BBB, Registar of Contractors and the Arizona Attorney General.)They promised to stop by today to measure (per our contract this was to be done 3 weeks ago), we will see what happens.  To be continued......'
