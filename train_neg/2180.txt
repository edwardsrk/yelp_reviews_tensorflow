b'I really wanted to like this place. The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn\'t a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I\'ve been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn\'t have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]Some of the issues I found:1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. 2. Price, it wasn\'t that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.3. Service: I have no complaints. I\'m not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn\'t say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren\'t any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in "brown sauce." The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. How could the food have been better. INAPC [I\'m not a professional chief], but:1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn\'t have some kind of vegetables. 2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you\'re going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. 3. Don\'t reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won\'t make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.'
