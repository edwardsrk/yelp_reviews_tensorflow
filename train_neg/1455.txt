b'(Attended in Santa Barbara CA)  Boooorrrriiing!!  They announced that 2 groups are touring simultaneously,  Clearly, half the talent was missing -- as were half the musical parts in many of the songs. Only 6 "performers"-- who could be replaced by statues. They barely moved for 2 very long hours. No sets, some blinding cheap lights, and just third-rate in every way. The entire group is shoved all the way upstage, clustered there for some strange reason, leaving them far from the audience and half the stage bare. The "orchestra" seemed very possibly to be a local pick-up group who were there to stare at their music stands and collect a paycheck.  What a YAWNer.  Such hokey, poorly-produced videos in this day & age are inexcusable.  Almost $100 per ticket?  Save your money.  I was dying to leave after 10 minutes, but my family wanted to stay to the bitter, boring end.  Listen to the CDs and forget the concert version.  Ugh!!'
