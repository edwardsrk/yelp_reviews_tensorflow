b'What not to do while trying to get into a hip happenin (please note major sarcasm there) Scottsdale club after a few too many drinks and a sassy streak running on full steam by stephy s.Me: "Ohhhh shit, are we goin\' to da cluuuuuhb? Awwwhhh yeeeahhh!!!"(Walks up to door guy who we\'ll call Aggroman to protect identities of big headed ego inflated jackasses)Me: "Hey, I like your emblem!"Aggroman: "What."Me: "Your emblem (reaching out to tap gold emblem on macho man\'s blazer whilst giggling like the smart ass drunk girl I am)"Aggroman: "ID."Me: "Jeez, was just saying I liked your broach, sheeesh."Aggroman: (visibly aggro and motioning me in) "Go."Me: (under my breath, which probably was rather loud) Dang, isn\'t this Scottsdale, what up with the attitude?!!? This ain\'t LA, shiiiiiiit (clearly I think I\'m from the hood now with my gansta speak)Inside da cluuuuub what do we find? Well sadly, not nearly enough scantily clad sluts. I mean, I go to clubs for one reason and one reason only...sluts, hoochies, hood rat hood rat hoochie mamas and this place was strikin out big time. It did, however offer up a fun variety of cougars and possums, though! This gave me some hope as I was also told earlier in the evening that Scottsdale has, per capita, the highest number of Sugar Daddy\'s in the nation, so let\'s face it, I wanted to meet one of those too. Hey, why not, it was Wednesday after all and I was staying at the Valley HO!! :)After striking out in the Sugar Daddy and slut categories, I decided to entertain myself by taking camera phone pictures of random girls dancing, but apparently people are too cool to pose for fun pics like this. My theory is that Girls Gone Wild killed it for everyone! Thanks a lot Joe Francis!! Whatever. I got a shot of a half nekkid girl dancing anyway, so there. Moral of the story. Don\'t take me out to da cluuuuhhhb. The end. :)'
