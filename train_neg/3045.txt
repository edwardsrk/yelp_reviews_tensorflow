b'Been here a few times.  The service gets worse and worse every time we come.  There was no receptionist to take names and there was a line of people waiting to put there names down.  Then once we got sat we waited 10mins for someone to take a drink order.  Then we ordered and waited an insanely long time for our food....even the appetizers too forever!  Too bad because we really like the food.'
