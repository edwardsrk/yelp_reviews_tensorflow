b"This place is located in an odd area as it's on a major road yet the only parking nearby is on residential streets. I have never stopped in this neighborhood as there aren't many commercial spaces nearby. The setup is ok with a good amount of space and decent seating. They offer a few other desserts like macrons and Liege waffles other than their claim to fame. Macrons looked interesting and would be liked by kids for sure. The main attraction has so many flavors to offer that it took a bit of time to decide what to get. I had the bourbon and butterscotch. They do brulee' after the order so that's an attraction I suppose.  After the novelty of fresh brulee' wears off this place offers a mediocre take on this dessert. I think there was too much sugar on top and the base didn't impress much either. Maybe I ought to have tried the classic version first. They do use vanilla beans and from what I could tell decent ingredients. Maybe the recipe was off. At this price point and location not worth the detour"
