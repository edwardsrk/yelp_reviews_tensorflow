b"Food was delicious, but service was terrible. We arrived for Sunday brunch and were told it would be a 35 minute wait for a table, but we could sit at a high top in the bar right away. We were hungry so we took the high top. Our table overlooked two regular tables for 2 in the restaurant that remained empty literally the entire time we were there. We asked if we could move to one of them, but were told no. So, we just watched empty tables for over one hour. Waiters were totally scattered and overwhelmed in the uncrowded restaurant. I had to get up and get menus because we were not given any, and it took a long time to order, get the check, and pay. We were brought wrong items, and had to ask for coffee and water refills every time. Brunch took nearly two hours with the slow service. I've had dinner here before and it's been amazing, but the service has just gone downhill. I will not be returning."
