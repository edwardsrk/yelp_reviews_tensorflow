b"This is an ok gym. I have been going on and off for 4 years. The gym has a lot to offer but I have been getting more and more dissapointed. For one they are not the cleanest. The other thing that really bothers me is they have two out dated stand up tanning beds... One has been broken for MONTHS! That is crazy to me with EOS being a big chain. I went into bed 1 today the only bed that was open and 8 yes 8 bulbs were burned out. I feel like they can afford too and should update their beds... I was also upset with childcare because they promised they would send my daughters vacs record to Aliante when the manager came in at 2. I'm glad I decided to call because they didn't send over her shot record because I didn't sign a release form! They didn't even tell me I needed too. I am honestly thinking about switching gyms."
