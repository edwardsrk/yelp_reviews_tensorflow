b'If i could give this crappy place negative 500 stars I would.   Waitress gets our order wrong.   Asked her about it says we ordered it wrong.    Took her 20 min come back take our order to begin with in a not very busy place to start with.  Daughter who is 6 orders a kid plate of spagetthi.  Gets garlic bread w cayenne pepper on it.   Again tell waitress who doesnt care says her back is hurting and at this point I demand a manager.   Seriously cayenne pepper on kids garlic bread?   What if kids are allergic?   And then attitude from a waitress?    Manager comes happens to be leaving for the evening and we catch her out the door.   She adjusts the bill in full and apologizes for the inappropriate behavior and the badly chosen cayenne bread given for a small child.  As we are getting in our SUV im the lot the waitress is cleaning a table on the patio and she starts harrassing us in the lot.  Saying we have nothing better to do yelling screaming at us.   Trying to start like a fight.   All of this with a 7 and a 6 year old children and a 5 month old baby in tow.   While I see the manager pull away in her sports car.   Never ever will I go here.   Please do yourself and anyone a favor.   There are a million places to eat in Henderson and the Vegas area.   Dont waste your money here.  They dont care about what they serve children.   Or how they treat you.   Unless your dog poop.'
