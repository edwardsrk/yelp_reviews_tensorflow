b"If there was NO STARS, this place would get it. This place is SO SLOW. Been sitting here in the drive thru for 10 min, waiting to give our order. Mind you.... there is no one ahead of us. If there wasn't someone behind us, we would 've reversed. Finally gave our order and approached the window... there was no line, bo one sitting inside. RIDICULOUS!!! How does this place stay open? Time to locate another tropical smoothie."
