b'Extremely mediocre. Disappointing. The setting is a beautiful old farm house. Let\'s start with the positives. The Caeser salad is hands down one of the best in Toronto. Made fresh at your table. It was a classic dressing with the egg white, anchovies, mustard and garlic.  The garlic bread also was delicious and came out fresh, hot  and tasty. I had the rib eye and it arrived at the table warm. It was warm borderline cool. I mean come on guys. Who likes to eat a steak warm?  My guess is that they don\'t heat their plates in an oven like a Morton\'s or Ruth Chris. Also the travel time from the kitchen to table could be lengthy due to the size of the place (duh maybe use something to cover the plates). Also when the plates do reach the area of a table it can sit for a few minutes on a tray waiting for a server. The steak was pretty burnt out the outside and the inside was fine. It\'s a classic case of using to much heat. This IMHO a rookie mistake. I ended up only eating 1/2 because it simply wasn\'t any good. Service was extremely poor. Waiter made several mistakes on the order and had a stuck up attitude. Waiter was not attentive. Near the end of the meal we had to go look for our own milk and brown sugar because our waiter was nowhere to be found. The scary thing was the night we went was quiet. If our service and food was so poor on a slow night, can you even fathom a busy night?The reason I gave my rating two stars is because the steak was piss poor.  Also for a "fine dining" venue the service is a complete fail.'
