b"As a self-declared salad aficionado, I was pretty excited when we decided to go Crisp for lunch.  However the experience and salads were slightly underwhelming.  The menu options were good and the restaurant very clean (which is a plus since they make the salads right on the spot in front of you).  The ingredients looked fresh and the portions huge.  Yet anything else worth mentioning stops there.  I picked the create your own salad, which allows you to pick the norm: green type, protein type, and then a variety of different ingredients and dressing.  The particular guy making mine didn't exactly look thrilled to be there.  While I'm not expecting a song, dance, and 1000 watt smile...pleasantries are always nice in terms of food preparation and service.  I asked for a recommendation on one of the vinaigrettes (they have a ton...which is a plus) and he very apathetically remarked he did not know which one he liked the best because there were like 12.  A huge deal breaker? No. Something a new patron wants to hear from a place specializing in salads? Not really.  They also provided lemonade, unsweetened tea, and sweet tea in self-service containers.  It looked really pretty but tasted pretty generic. We sat outside on the patio because of how nice it was outside and the set-up really is lovely.  Great seating options and good for people watching.  While I would not make a concerted effort to avoid Crisp, there's nothing remarkable that stood out to separate it from some of the other great spots in Charlotte."
