b'It is obvious what this window and blinds department thinks about customers. One employee sitting at the counter said only the gentlemen there does window treatment quotes, so she would help today. Then the male employee said he was going to lunch after he finished with a client and would  it help me either. He proceeded to say that there was another lady who has been waiting three hours and was really upset with him for going to lunch. Apparently the store and employees are not trained well enough, staffed well enough, or caring enough to get more business. It was a waste to drive all the way over to the store and then get turned away. This was after calling earlier when the employee asked me to call back in 10 minutes because they had to walk across the store. Home Depot service has gone down hill over the years.'
