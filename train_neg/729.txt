b'Do not go here! I went here with my sister to look for engagement rings for my now fianc\xc3\xa9. I walked in and was met by 2 older ladies who seemed bothered by my presence to begin with. I was beaming with excitement because I was going to be making a HUGE decision in my life and also throwing down a huge chunk of my hard earned money. The ladies ( both sporting rings on all fingers) asked what I was looking for and showed me some outrageously priced rings. They asked my budget to which I gave them my reply (I worked my ass off for the money I had and I was convinced that it was a very generous amount) ...THEY BOTH LAUGHED...One said " If that\'s the kind of diamond you want you\'ll have to have bring more money than that."I was very embarrassed.  They wanted me to open up a line of credit for the diamond alone. They then realized I wasn\'t buying a $10,000 ring and lost interest in me so I left. Gentlemen, GO TO THE SHANE COMPANY! They asked my budget and made me feel like a king, everybody is so nice. I left there designing a beautiful ring (which I still brag about) and all just under my budget.Don\'t waste your time like I did! Off Scottsdale road and acoma, one mile south of bell road!'
