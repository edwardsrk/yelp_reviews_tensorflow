b'WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!  UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS POST TO POST TO THIS PAGE I HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STAR WHEN IF I HAD THE OPTION TO CHOSE NEGATIVE 5  STARS I WOULD !!!! I called in October to schedule an appointment and was told no opening until Saturday 12/3/2016 which I went ahead and scheduled.  Come Saturday 12/3/2016  I find out that The Studio was NEVER  going to call me to let me know that my "Stylist" oh I\'m sorry student had graduated and I no longer had an appointment.  The REFUSED to accommodate my schedule after I had accommodated theirs to wait for a month and a half for my appointment.  Both Adam (instructor) and Amy (Associate Director) were very sarcastic and condescending and uncaring about my appointment not being able to be held.  They both kept telling me that it\'s a school not a salon but yet The Studio accepts money for salon services.    I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE FOR ANY SERVICES.  THEY ARE HEARTLESS AND UNSYMPATHETIC TO ANYONE\'S NEEDS BUT THEIR OWN!!!!  RUN FROM THIS PLACE AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!!!'
