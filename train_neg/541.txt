b'Red Robin tonight Server: "What temp would you like on your burger"Me: "medium rare"Server: "so a little pink?"Me: "yes"Food delivered...WELL done. Why do you ask if you can\'t deliver?!?  Anywho, I talk to the manager face to face. She says "oh, it\'s on a conveyer belt...we can\'t do pink". To which I say "why would the server offer a choice?" Her response, "if you order the angus burger we can do more pink". Are the servers not trained on what burger I order whether is "regular" or "angus" patties??  Then she continues to say "well if you tell your server, they can do it". Mmmmmmmkay, rewind..."I just told the server I wanted a little pink". The employee next to the manager said "we can\'t because of food borne illnesses". I\'m so confused now.This will be our last attempt at Red Robin.'
