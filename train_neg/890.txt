b'Horrible! Took three hours on my full set - then let me go for free because she knew how horrible it was. Her husband agreed that they were all crooked and tried to fix them. I never complain but what the heck! Be careful they are going off the other people\'s reviews but the good people moved! They have another Yelp account now. Check it out don\'t go here.After she did my nails they were talking about how she doesn\'t usually do full set - just design. Well thanks lady. Can\'t wait for two weeks to go by for these things to peel off. Everyone at work thought they were "press ons." This is the location on Sahara going by the same name as the company that just moved out of there.'
