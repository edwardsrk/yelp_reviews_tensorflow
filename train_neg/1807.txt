b"OK so Metro car wash did do a great job cleaning my car I even tipped $5.00 to the lady that completed the cleaning. unfortunately someone stole the change from my coin slot. I get it they are not responsible for your personal belongings and it is just change. however, stealing is just rude, unprofessional, unnecessary and seriously questions the integrity of your business and employees. I don't need the change but I don't like thieves so I will no longer be getting my car washed hear."
