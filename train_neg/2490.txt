b"Called for reservation with my groupon. Was told to call back lady was not in. But had plenty of rooms. I called back 30 minutes later and they have nothing now. Even spoke to mgr. it wasn't they were sold out. They just minimize how many rooms get groupon. We are locals to Arizona and did not find this service good."
