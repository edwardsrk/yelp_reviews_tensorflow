b"I give this place 2 stars because it was incredibly average. I loved the ambiance, the attentiveness from the staff, the cleanliness. All those things were great. But when it comes down to it, I just want a good wax. The gal who did mine was super friendly, very nice. But again, I just want it done right. She had missed a few hairs, so I had to go home and shave. I also got a brow waxing and the shape is exactly what I came in with. I even advised the front desk when I set the appt, that it was important I have someone who can shape brows. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying it wasn't a great wax. Everything else was awesome."
