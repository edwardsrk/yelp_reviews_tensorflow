b'Food is great thats why I go there . A friend had mentioned to me how at yuphas the owner came up to their table when they were still finishing up and wanted them to leave so the next people could get a seat . Today the same thing happened , I still had the soup and salad I was finishing up , my friends were still eating ,their was food on their plates and the owner comes and says to me looks like you have finished and your check is also here . I did not appreciate this at all .Looks like you cannot enjoy a meal here without being rushed .'
