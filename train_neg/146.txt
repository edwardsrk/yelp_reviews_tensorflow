b"If ZERO stars were possible this gym would be getting that from me. My husband went to this gym today with the 14 pass and at the end of his workout inquired about membership. The lady he spoke to was extremely rude. She told him that he should not have come in without checking with someone first ( mind you that the staff does not show up till 9am and he began his workout at 7am). After scolding him for being at the gym she asked him to leave and said that they were very selective in the people whom the allowed to join their gym. I'm not the type to write reviews but obvious racism is a very good reason for me to break a habit. The lady was very condescending. She is Caucasian and my husband is Latino."
