b"Checking out the Container Park and then decided to have a brunch at this place. First, it was a small restaurant but nice decor and setup. There was no host at all so the waiter said we could sit wherever we want. Okay, got it. Next, he poured us some water and then took the extra napkin and utensils from our table. For the next 10 minutes...tik tok tik tok... no one ever came to our table and asked for our order? I kept looking around and found so many employees on a small establishment but yet no one can ever keep up the guests? I could even serve guest by myself only with that small establishment. Soon, an employee passed by and I grabbed him and told him our order and he said.. Sorry, I am not your waiter but what do you want? Well, nobody paid attention to us??? So if he is not the waiter but can he just HALLER???? to anyone? So he took our order and then tik tok tik tok for another 15 mins. our order still not coming and yet the people right after us got already their order before us?? Umm time to stand up and walked away!!! To the management of The Perch... Please... look around your establishment...It is not hard to keep up with your customer. I can do it with my one eye closed serving guests. Let alone you have at least 6-7 employee that wasn't paying attention. Time To Gather Your People and Re-Trained Them."
