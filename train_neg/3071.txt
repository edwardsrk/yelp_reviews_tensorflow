b"Mr. Cooks has cleaned up the place, made it more customer friendly and appealing. Food is good, the servings are good. The downfall of this restaurant is the lady who is suppose to take your order. She is ALWAYS on the phone and I don't mean for business purposes but to talk to friends. She does not care about the business just who she is talking to. Sadly this will be the cause of this restaurant to close. She could be nice and helpful to customers but feels she is more important than any customer coming into their place. So sad as Mr. Cook has tried to make it a better place."
