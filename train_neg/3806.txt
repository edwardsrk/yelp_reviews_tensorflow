b'The security and ticket lady were Uppity ASSHOLES. All three (three? Is that necessary? It wasnt a fokkin Slayer show goin on in there it was some local bands at a bar in the corner of an unnamed shopping center) were unnecessarily rude. I just moved here and stopped by, seeing there was a line. (I was out for my husbands bday lookin for something to do) Curious, went to check it out.  Oh sweet is there somethin goin on tonight? I asked one of the dudes out front. "Uhhh-yeah" he responded and looked at me like I was an idiot. "A show" and he looked to his coworkers so they could join in the pretentious face-making. Sorry 3ft tall 40-something bald guy. Didnt know how prolific and awesome this bar was in all its majesty. Im new here. I ended up saying fuck it and going home since  i wanted to drink (imagine that, at a bar?) my ID is the wrong shape and apparently theres a new law in az (i just moved here from SD) protecting bouncers who can\'t read dates. Im 23. A vertical state ID will not change that.'
