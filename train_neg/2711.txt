b"This location has been around for a while for good reason, but there's definitely a cycle of employees here that happens regularly. The management has definitely changed since I was last a regular here 2-3 years ago.From a chain store you'll get exactly everything you expect - whether it's buying or trading in. Consoles, games, accessories and what not is all honored. But it never really leaves face value. Trade-ins especially used to be semi-enjoyable despite terrible values, yet this location became a real stickler on policies. I'm all for following the system, but it's offensive to be shown disdain when I trading in a product and asking why it isn't accepted.I guess I'm saying this place feels soulless or hollow. I used to enjoy coming in and just browsing, felt like I was talking with some of the guys. Now coming in is like watching that unnamed show on CBS. Doesn't seem worth it compared to Amazon prime or Best Buy GCU."
