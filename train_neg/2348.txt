b"2 starsThe pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  Who knew what he was saying about us?   He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  REALLY?The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  I'll leave it at that.  So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.If you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.We won't be returning."
