b'We had a menu shoved under our door. So we only thought to look at it. Wished we had looked at Yelp first. 1) ordered the special: 2x 1 topping pizzas. We ordered pepperoni and pepperoni. We received one sausage and one pepperoni. 2) we ordered cheese bread: it was ok. Nothing amazing, a more flat pizza crust than pudgier bread sticks. 3). We ordered fried mushrooms. These were pretty good. We received 11 in the order. 4) we were not eligible for the free soda because we had ordered a special (which sucks. 5) we ordered a 2 L of Diet Coke and a 6 pack. Saying "Diet Coke" each time. I even told the story about how this is a Pepsi town and we needed our Diet Coke. What arrived?  Off brand diet cola. ...We picked this place bc of the Diet Coke written on the menu and the implicit guarantee of the guy taking the order. Side note:  the menu says "under new management". I feel I can say this sucks under new management. Review of the pizza:  it was 2 pizzas for 21$. It tasted like a 10$ pizza. So I\'m ok w it. ...Just to prove I\'m not crazy I\'m going to post a pick of the words Diet Coke...So:  1 star for getting it here in 30 min (guy said 30-45 min, and it was a dinnertime delivery on the Strip) and 1 star bc the food taste met the price.'
