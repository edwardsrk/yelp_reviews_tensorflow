b"My husband went there last night to buy me a birthday cake.  He showed up just before closing time because it was a work day and he was coming home from work.  He told me he wouldn't got back, he felt rushed and treated poorly when he was asking questions about the cake he wanted.  He asked if they had individual candles and was told no, (but they sell individual candles with the cake pops.) Also, the employee wouldn't write happy birthday or anything on the cake because of the scalloped icing.  I called today and spoke with Lisa who identified herself to me as the owner.  I can see why her employee behaves the way they did towards my husband.  Lisa did not identify herself to me when she answered the phone.  I had to ask for her name after she said she was the owner.  I told her that my husband received poor service last night.  Lisa did apologize and tell me that was sorry he felt rushed.  But the rest of the conversation was short and came off as very non caring.  I can't say we'll go back to this shop.  AJ's down the street on Camelback has the same products, accommodates requests like writing on the cakes, (they will pace a ribbon over the cake so a name or saying can be written on it if the cake itself won't allow for that.)  And with much friendlier customer service too."
