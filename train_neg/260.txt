b'Today was my anniversary. I called this morning for a delivery of flowers, explaining that my girlfriend leaves work at 3 and I wanted her to experience the moment at work for a while before she had to leave. The delivery came exactly at 3, despite the fact that they are literally across the street. The cost was just short of $100 and the offered me $10 off for failing to deliver it on time. I will never use their services again, not for these prices.'
