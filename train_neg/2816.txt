b"Peanut Butter Paradise is the bomb, the service really  slow.  I have seen the employees texting on their phones and us the customers have to  waited for them to finish and I mean not just a couple minutes, I mean like ten minutes.....  it's the only one by my home.  Staff need more training on how to have better work ethics........  Good Luck with that one!"
