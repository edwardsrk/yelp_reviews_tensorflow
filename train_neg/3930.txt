b"Note:  Limited Gourmet Food/Housewares section.  No furniture here. TJX (Winners, Marshalls, HomeSense) company has really seemed to have exploded downtown.  In every block, there seemed to be 1 of their stores.  However, I think something is happening where the company is really trying to make distinctions between all their brands.I used to like coming here, but last night, their upstairs Gourmet Food/Housewares section was a complete disappointment.  It looks as though they're trying to shrink those 2 sections and maybe put them more into HomeSense??  As someone with a retail background, this is just my theory.Soo much wasted space upstairs, near the windows.  Not a fan of this change as I think both those sections are good sellers!Honestly didn't check out the clothes or shoes because I don't need anything."
