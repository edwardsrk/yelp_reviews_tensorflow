b'My husband was walking to work one day and spotted this boutique. I had been looking for a good sports bra in addition to some pretty bras because I have had a bit of trouble finding my size. I happened to show up at the store at around 5:40pm and they close at 6pm. Keep in mind, I didn\'t know what time they closed and I didn\'t even know the name of the store because my husband forgot to write it down. I knew where to go because of it\'s location. As soon as I walked in I saw the "what the heck?" face from the sales person, yeah- I\'m calling you a sales person not a bra fitter consultant, because your job is to sell. Anyhow- she was pretty rude off the bat and let me know that they were closing at 6pm and that she would "try" her best in finding me what I needed. She put me in the room, measured me and went to grab 3 bras and none of them fit. As soon at the clock was close to six she was literally trying to get me out of there. She said she couldn\'t find anything my size and that she would call me. I pointed to her a bra color I would also like for her to look into for me and she was very quick to respond that the bra I was looking at was for women that underwent mastectomy\'s. I wasn\'t asking for that bra! I was telling her I wanted that color. Anyway- guess what? It\'s been 2 weeks and I\'m still waiting on that call. It\'s sad for the business owners because they leave their business in the hands of people that don\'t really care about customer service or to actually sell. I\'m never going back there again.'
