b'This a reply to Renee, owner of Studio 480, rebuttal to my negative comment regarding a very bad haircut  that Irene gave me on 11/23.   Please regard my review to get the whole story.Renee states that 3 people worked on my hair after her mother Irene cut it and could not rectifythe chop job.  (I did bring a picture of what I wanted.and Irene said she could do the style.)There was only one hairstylist who came to try and fix the problem.  Casey tried but try as she did she couldn"t fix the damage.Another correction to Renee stating that she called me after she found out I was not happy is not correct.  I CALLED HER and told her how unhappy I was with the cut . I did verbally say how this is not the what I asked for,and showed the picture of cut I wanted several times to Irene.In conclusion.Renee tried to fix the the problem. but  I still walked out upset that I would havelive with this haircut till it would grow out.Marianne'
