b'Stayed at LVH for a convention - it is Okay at best.  Room was clean, TV channel quality was poor and food was good.  Would only recommend if you want to stay close to the convention center.  Staff was friendly, but nothing stands out at this hotel except for the proximity to the convention center.  Must be why it is no longer a Hilton'
