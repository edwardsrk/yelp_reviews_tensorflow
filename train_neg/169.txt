b'Absolutely AWFUL!!! The most incredibly unprofessional establishment I have EVER been to. Not only are their prices stupid expensive but they do a terrible job! I think it is pretty pathetic when i can do my own nails and they look much better than someone who is supposed to be a licensed professional. When I went the other day not only were my nails not straight but the technician (Her name was Lin I believe)  flied the skin off the sides of my fingers and made them BLEED!! When i said "uhm I am bleeding" she wiped the blood off (not gently) and tried to act as if it did not happen. I was still charged full price even after being injured! I walked out literally crying because my fingers were burning in so much pain. Later my fiance and I went back to speak with the manager/owner about the situation and he LAUGHED TO OUR FACE!!! He did not apologize, all he said is that he would fix it, but last time I checked you cannot just magically heal someones cut fingers. When I asked to see the license of the technician he said "I do not have to show you that". I find it highly likely that he refused to show us the license because she probably does not have one. There is so much more I could say about how awful they were but I think people should get the idea. I WOULD NOT EVER SUGGEST ANYONE GO HERE!'
