b"This is a two star experience today.  The hostess to the sever, terrible. THANK YOU KITCHEN STAFF, FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! The server, never told us his name, never replied when asking his name. We waited 30minutes for a patio table while looking at 5available patio tables and an available dining room with multiple tables. We watched our server cater to other guest multiple times before acknowledging us. I would love to tell you his name but hever told us. The receipt says his name is John C but we cannot count on this to be true. He has short dark hair. Anyway,  the buzzers were malfunctioning so we were buzzed without having a table infuriating when me plus ant 10 orher guest are looking at open tables and being told nothings available. I've been here multiple times the food is pretty consistent but the service however is not.  Be prepared to wait and only be acknowledged at their availability."
