b"We were there over the weekend on a Saturday. The DJ was amazing the whole night kept everyone dancing. But the bartender...OMG. Never met such a bad one . We legit stood at the main bar for 30 minutes maybe 40 waiting. Trying to get his attention. He kept interacting with a group assuming his friends/buddies and flirting with a girl. So he finally looked our way and got our order I'm like good finally. 5 minutes later we see him out of the bar serving area taking shots with the group of friends basically partying . I was seriously in shock. My 7 year old can take better directions and focus more. Another bartender finally comes in (looking annoyed since he was picking up the others one slack) and takes our order again and serves us within 3 minutes. Props to him for actually doing his job. Never had such a bad experience. Other than the sucky bartender the vibe and music was a great."
