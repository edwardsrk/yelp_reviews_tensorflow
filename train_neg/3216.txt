b"I made it a point to stop here based on the many glowing reviews. Perhaps my expectations were too high as a result but I found this place utterly uninspired. The various meats were all drowning in chafing dishes and once strained were flavourless and dry. We had the Barbacoa, Pulled Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Tinga and the other chicken, the name of which escapes me now. With the exception of the Chorizo they were all bland. I'm a big fan of these hip reinventions of various cultural foods, but the style here seems to be trumping the substance. Dry meat, bland flavours. Grossly overrated."
