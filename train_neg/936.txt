b"So originally my review was going to have a few more stars but took some away and you can read to see why.So originally was really excited to try this place. Had seen a lot of the pictures of the breakfast food and read some reviews. We were enjoying football Sunday and New Year's Day so we weren't in the mood to cook and thought it would be the perfect time to try this place.Ordered over the phone, got a fit and focused veggie delite omelette with no mushroom. Husband ordered corned beef hash breakfast He went to pick it up, they showed him both things and the girl even read everything back and everything sounded correct, she even mentioned the no mushrooms . Husband saw no mushrooms on the omelette as well. We timed it perfectly so that husband got back right after halftime and when I went to take first bite it was filled with mushroom, tried to take them out but it was just a mess after that. Called them to complain , they were super busy which is understandable . I remember the manager asking if they showed it to us. Like yes but we didn't have a fork to open up the food and check inside . He asked what register it was rung up on and how we paid and said there might be two charges shown due to the fact that he would be doing a charge back or something for the cost of the food without the veggie omelette .  However nothing showed up. We were never comped . And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways. My husband and I shared his and mine was thrown away and we were both left unsatisfied. A manager lying and saying he will pull a receipt and refund you and not doing so, leaves a bad taste , on top of getting a simple order wrong ."
