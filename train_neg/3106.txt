b'Very disappointing at best. A small trip to the market to pick up a few items turned into an hour plus event. The store appears well organized and clean. There is a moderate amount of choices per item. However, the majority of the staff are unfriendly and are not happy with their job. In addition, for the cost of living in this state, these are the highest prices I have experienced. The only other grocery prices this high were in Hawaii. The most expensive place to live in the nation. This is unacceptable under the minimum wage rates or rates below $18.00 an hour.'
