b'I heard great things about this place, so I tried it. I was very disappointed.  The service is great, but the food was terrible.  I ordered eggs Benedict with hash browns. The potatoes were cold. The eggs were over cooked. Almost no runny egg yolk. The sauce was for sure from a can. Over all the eggs Benedict was so salty. I could not eat one whole egg one a muffin. It was served with ham instead of Canadian bacon as the menu list. I must have caught then on a very bad day.'
