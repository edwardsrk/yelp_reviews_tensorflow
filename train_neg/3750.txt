b"Way too bland.  For an airport it might be a good place but if it wasn't for the captive audience this place is pretty weak.  Expensive, probably because of the location but it's just not that good. The regular Chelsea's kitchen is fine but the airport just seems to be phoning it in.  By not being a fast food chain it stands out, but I don't think anyone would come to the airport just to have lunch here."
