b'I\'m puzzled by all the good reviews of this restaurant. Has nobody in Las Vegas ever had well-prepared Korean food? I was appalled by the meal I was served this evening. It was a graceless, ill-seasoned, flavorless mess. It was as if someone had decided to prepare a "Korean meal" at home, threw  "Asian sauces" on a few vegetables, made a salad, put chunks of cheap raw meat on a board, and served it up with a big hopeful smile.  I was able to eat the oysters, and there was some tofu thing that wasn\'t awful, but the rest of it was either offensively nondescript or downright repulsive. Has this place never heard of doenjang?The surprise hard boiled egg hidden in the salad gave me sufficient energy to get back to my hotel. Otherwise, that was a rather expensive non-meal.To be clear: this isn\'t Korean food. This is crudit\xc3\xa9s and cheap raw meat. You could do it at home for $5.'
