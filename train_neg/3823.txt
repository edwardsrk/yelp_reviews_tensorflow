b"I remember when this mall first opened, and there was pretty much nothing inside.I also remember when they were planning to do Splendid China Tower #2, but backed out because nobody comes here.Yesterday was the first time I visited Splendid China Tower in about 5 years. Quite frankly, not a lot has changed. Most of the second floor is still vacant, and the food court has even less choices than when it first opened. However the first floor is now relatively occupied, which is nice to see. There's also a couple of restaurants added, and I have noticed an increase in foot traffic.Aside from events that Chinese radio stations love hosting here due to the abundance of space, there still really isn't anything that attracts me from coming here."
