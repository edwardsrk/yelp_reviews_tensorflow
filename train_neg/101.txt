b"This was the worse experience I have ever had an urgent care facility. The staff was subpar the doctor was rude, inconsiderate, and my discharge papers listed symptoms that were undescribed by me. When I refused to sign the discharge papers I asked to speak with the physician. The doctor begin to explain to me that I gave a vague description so he decided to list just something on my discharge papers and that it didn't matter what it said. I explained to him that I felt uncomfortable signing my papers being that my symptoms though vague  they were given to him and the symptoms listed on the discharge papers had nothing to do with the way I felt and that I am concerned.  The doctor became angry and I rate telling me that I can go and see someone else but good luck with that! I told him that I will be reporting him. .., I am shocked at the type of treatment I have received here . I will be making this less that acceptable treatment I have received at the Urgent Care Extra known by all. The Doctor I saw today was Dr. Timothy Eichenlaub ( bald guy with bad teeth and an adittude to match)."
