b"I went to get a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable. Couldn't find it in the Apple section, waited and waited and waited for the one person working in the Apple section to take a break from trying to sell a woman a laptop so I could ask if they had any cables in stock. Waited for about 20 minutes before giving up and asking another employee for help. He got me what I needed in about 30 seconds. YMMV, but I found that unless you actually approach an employee and ask them for help they are not friendly and not at all willing to help you (unless you're willing to spend $$$ on a new Mac laptop, in that case you get all the time and attention you need...)"
