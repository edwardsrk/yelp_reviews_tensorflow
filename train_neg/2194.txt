b'On the plus side, there are a lot of lights on the Strip!   From a distance, it looks glamorous and fun.Up close, it\'s a different story.Up close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  I know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.Another thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for "dates" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone\'s sister, daughter, mother?Walking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   In the morning, it\'s actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.'
