b'Worst dinning experience we have had for a long time. First, the service is awful. We waited for an hour before the food showed up. However, two tables coming after us got their food almost right away. When we got our food, they were ready to leave. The only thing I can think is they are Americans and we are not. The waitress took order from Chinese customers with a long face but smiled ear to ear at all American customers. Why?! And, food! The food they serve is the same as Asian Express Cafe, almost identical but price is triple. Two people $43. Worst of all, servers kept rubbing their noses with their fingers. We, for sure will never go back. How terrible it is when you are discriminated by your own people! Why don\'t they just put a sign on the door "American Only"!'
