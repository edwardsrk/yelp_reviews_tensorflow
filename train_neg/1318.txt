b'This should be a short review because we did not actually eat here. When we arrived, there were no clean tables to sit at. When we asked the waiter to clean a table, he brushed food debris on to us as he was cleaning it. We overlooked that, and were looking at the menu, when the waiter returned with our water glasses. We quickly noticed that there was not a clean water glass of the five that were brought to us. You could see lip marks on the rim and other food debris stuck to them, that indicated they were not clean. We decided that we were not going to risk our health and left at that point.'
