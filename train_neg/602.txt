b"We had lunch here and ordered the two special rolls and sushi combo. Ehhhhh is what I will say....me and wife both agreed that their rice sucked ass. It was kinda hard and had no flavor (I guess I've always had good sushi rice that I can tell when someone doesn't put any love in the rice).  The nigiri we ordered were small and if this is the portion size....it's a good thing we had lunch only. We will not be returning back here.....oh ya service sucked ass considering there were 2 servers and about 4 tables that were being served"
