b"After visiting the real Richmond Hill Corporate run Nando's, I was surprised at how bad the service is at Markham Road. I have visited  this location a few times and have always left with a bad experience and never went back! The staff never smile or try to engage in conversation with you and in comparison to the real Nando's at Richmond Hill- this seems like a fake version. The chicken is not as flavourful and the portions are very small. Save your experience and try Richmond Hill for a real Nando's  experience!"
