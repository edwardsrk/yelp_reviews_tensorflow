b"Came here for a friend's b day dinner. Currently writing this review as I wait for my server to pick up the payment for my check... it that's any hint as to how bad the service was, considering I have time to write it.  The food was DECENT, at that. The vibe and environment is beautiful. But NOT worth the prices at all. And not to mention, our service was incredibly SLOW, when our server was NOT busy. It's a Tuesday night. We had to ask for things several times before receiving. The whole table was almost finished eating before the birthday guy's food came out because our server never came back to check on us to know it was missing. We were here for TWO hours. 1 person ordered a drink, the rest of us has water, no appetizers or desert and this still took this long. It sucks when you pay a large amount for crappy service and sub par food..... Don't waste your time!"
