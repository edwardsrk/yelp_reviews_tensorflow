b"Do. Not. Live. Here! Trash hole of a complex. Apartments are old. Bed bugs. Old man who lives near the leasing office will accept your packages and keep them in his apartment until you find him and get them. (Violation of privacy and it is a federal offense to take someone else's mail!). Marsha the landlord is rude and not personable. After hours maintenance doesn't exist, and if you lock yourself out or something happens they leave it up to YOU to spend YOUR OWN money to take care of it. All around miserable establishment"
