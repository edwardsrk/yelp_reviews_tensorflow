b'This was used to be my favourite cafe but not anymore..couches and tables are dirty not like before and it makes me feel like Cinderella not princess. Not a bad portion to go near finch station but not best. The other table was so loud/ shouting and screaming for playing board games and servers just let them to do. And food is nothing special. I expected to have better quality tea for the price but ended up having so cheap tea bags. Will not going back unless my friends wants to go'
