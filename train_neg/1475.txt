b"Worst experience of my life staying at a hotel in Vegas. We come out here at least once a year for my son's soccer tournament and this is the 1st time at the flamingo. I checked in and my room wasn't even clean, my bathroom had feces in it (from the person before), the cleaning staff was late everyday to clean our room, the valet was full so we were forced to park on a side street..:: This is the most horribly managed hotel in Las Vegas. Don't stay here!!!"
