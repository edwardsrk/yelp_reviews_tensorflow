b'It was just a "meh" experience. The portion sizes were tiny.  A very small bowl of hummus with about 8 wedges of pita.  The fattoushe salad was sooo small. Side salad portion.  It was just lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, and pita. With dressing piled on top. And the shwarma  was barely filled.  We still dropped $24 for lunch + tip.  Disappointed.'
