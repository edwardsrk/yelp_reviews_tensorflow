b'I stayed here for 2 nights and felt it was not worth the money (over 200 dollars). The breakfast was decent, the room was okay, but like I said, for that kind of money, I expect top notch customer service and unfortunately, that was not the case.The customer service was okay and the guy at the front desk seemed to be in too much of a hurry to answer my questions properly. I felt I was being brushed off. Secondly, the wi-fi had some problems at this hotel. Although it was supposed to be high speed, it was barely that and on top of that, I had trouble connecting each time I tried to connect and it took a few attempts each time to establish and maintain a steady connection.Too pricey for the kind of service they offer!'
