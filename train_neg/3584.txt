b"This is not a bad gym nor is it in a bad area. So props on that... My id we signed up yesterday. We were supposed to have a personal trainer show us what we need cause me and my mom are both larger. And the appointment was at 10. The guy said 10 minutes he is finishing up with someone that .. Its now 12:14pm and he has yet to come back to us to show us what to do. Now he is helping some other woman... So my issue is if you're going to offer a personal trainer. Try to have them actually help us with our problem areas. Rather than just ignoring us all together. Bullshit..."
