b'Monday Memorial Day) we called Oriental Express for take out. I ordered the Moo shu pork. It was very (hot) spicy. I couldn\'t eat it. I also ordered the Wonton soup. My wife ordered the Beef Broccoli and there was hardly any beef in the Beef & Broccoli. She said the egg roll that came with the dinner tasted nasty so she did not eat it. This place serves just plain below average - average Chinese Food. As for quality,  sometimes well, you don\'t get what you pay for. Yet I was torn between giving it "meh" or "A-OK".  That\'s because their wonton soup is excellent.  So I rated the place 2 stars.'
