b"With many eateries to chose from on queen street we decided to give this place a try seeing how there is usually a line up outside....after waiting 20 minutes outside we were seated at an extremely small stool table.. our waitress took our drink order and it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered 3 dishes and an appetizer. An hour later our food still had not come. We flagged our server down and she said it would be 2 more minutes. 10 minutes after that our food arrived all at the same time...including the appetizer and there was barely any room on the table... I was starving by this point and I decided not to make an issue of the extra long wait time and dig right in. Now I never leave any food on my plate...ever! but in this case I could barely get through a few bites of each plate. The hot dishes were lukewarm and tasted like a 12 year old skater boy carelessly threw some canned ingredients together mixed in with cigarette butts. It was quite literally the WORST food I have ever eaten in my life. My husband just ate a few nachos. I mean imagine me, a pregnant, starving  food loving, happy go lucky person who never leaves food on my plate and I just coudnt eat this stuff. I chose hunger over this food...and im PreGnant!When we were done fidling with the food we had to wait another 20 minutes to get someone to flag down our server....finally when she came we had to lie that we are catching a flight just to get the bill at a normal speed. By this point the whole thing was comical....felt like a joint run by teenagers...absolute joke of a place. A lesson well learned...just bc there's a lineup...it doesnt make it good. I actually just got a yelp account to specifically write this review...thats how bad it was. And I eat out several times a week so thats saying something people."
