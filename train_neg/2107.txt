b"More like 2.5 stars. I'm giving two so the owners will have more incentive to make the necessary tweaks.I really wanted to like Strada 241. It's a beautiful space and the service is friendly, but the food was lackluster. We split a salumi plate and each had a pizza (I had the 'nduja). The salumi plate was nice but a little on the small side and lacking in variety, with only three meats. The pizzas looked good but were pretty tasteless - the cheese was bland, the sauce was bland and missing the necessary balance of tanginess and sweetness, and the crust was dried out and lacking flavor (probably a result of the electric oven).I would come back to try the pastas and also to see if the pizza improves. There's no lack of effort here and the food is honest."
