b"I had high hopes for this place but it looks like I expected too much. I went for the teppanyaki dinner menu and it was an okay experience. The chef was entertaining and cooked the food well but service for other food was slow. Slow and wrong.... I also got a seat under the vent which was freezing so I couldn't enjoy the experience at all. I just wanted to eat and leave but there were constantly no servers around. We totally got skipped during the second teppanyaki orders too. Food was nothing special in my opinion. Typical ayce sushi items. Waited 20 mins without food for the cheque and it never came. I had to put on my jacket and go to the front to pay. I will never come back here."
