b"The copy and print center here is just so horrible. They have no care and concern for customer service. This department always handles shipping too. It should be a walk in and walk out kind of thing showing up with prepackaged boxes- wrong! Seriously UPS shouldn't allow them to represent their brand. It makes UPS look bad. And the store manager just doesn't care. Mention it to him and he'll just say their short staffed and not even offer to help."
