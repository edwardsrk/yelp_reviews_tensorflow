b'Terrible customer service!! I called ahead of time to make sure there was a seat available. I walk in there\'s two ppl working. The guy working in the front chair asked "what you want done?". I said a full set. Both workers are still working on someone else. I wait patiently in the chair, minutes go by they\'re done doing nails. I asked "who was going to do mine?." The lady said she was going home. The guy told me he couldn\'t do mine bc he had another customer. So I asked how long, he said he couldn\'t do mine bc they\'re closing after. Mind you it\'s only 5:30pm they close at 7pm. The customer never shows up, so now it\'s 5:55 he says I need to get out bc they\'re closing the store. Worse experienced ever!!!! Never again.'
