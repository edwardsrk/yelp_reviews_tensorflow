b"Every single time I go to the course the staff are extremely rude and condescending. The staff have a snotty air about them and act like this course is cypress point in pebble beach.  By all means it is a nice course but it is not cypress point.  The food at the club house is not very good either.  I just wish my experience was not ruined by the staff's attitude."
