b"I only go here because they bought out Gold's Gym and my membership transferred to EOS. Don't go here between 5PM and 9PM. You will be standing around waiting forever for a machine. They don't keep up with maintenance like Gold's did, I feel like machines are broken more often and the padding is left split/worn longer than before."
