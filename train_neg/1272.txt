b'This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have "the biggest and best sandwiches", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place.'
