b'I\'m not too sure about this place. I might have to go back and try again. But here\'s what I am sure about. Service - very good, the redeemer of this place. Drinks - all of their signature cocktails were just sugar bombs with not of lot of depth. Cheap tasting stuff. Food - I got the coconut fried shrimp as a appetizer, and it was really tasty and well done. I ordered the fruit and chicken Caribbean salad and it was ok. The chicken was of the same quality you get in those giant frozen bags at Sams club, and it was just gross, it really felt like fake chicken, like they boiled it, idk. Don\'t order any of their chicken dishes. The salad was overdressed but was yummy at first. It\'s a very pretty dish. Someone at my table got key lime pie and really like it. The prices here are reasonable, if you don\'t expect above Chili\'s level cuisine. I will go here again and update this review after trying more of their "signature" dishes. 2 stars for now.'
