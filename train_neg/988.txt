b"Pros: -Great food (excellent steak, excellent seafood. The Iceberg Wedge salad has a smoked bacon that is really great. The tuna tar tar is also terrific and beautifully presented. And the Macaroni and Cheese side dish: fantastically flavorful, rich, creamy, delicious pot of cholesterol. Worth it!!) -Good drinks poured generously-Very good service Cons:-absolutely earsplitting music- so LOUD it's impossible to hold a conversation. In an attempt to create a high energy environment, they have eliminated any opportunity for enjoyable conversation, and drive out a lot of sophisticated people. Bad, bad, bad decision!! PLEASE just play some classy jazz at a reasonable volume or anything except that loud rock and roll. Really a detraction from the establishment's fine qualities, and honestly it ruined our meal. If the music doesn't get turned down, we'll never be back."
