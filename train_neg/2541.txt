b'I originally got my pink and white  acrylics there and loved them. I went back to get a fill and my fingers are in pain and look horribly thick. I told the lady ( the fill was done by a  different elder lady from my first initial visit) and now they are uneven thick more in one side than the other and the clear coat has bubbles. They just lost a good tipping customer. Never again!'
