b"This is a whiskey bar in Vegas located in the MGM. We went up to the bar maybe 1am post a concert on a Sunday night and had the hardest time getting the bartenders attention to be able to order a drink. it took probably 10 minutes for me, and then i waited with a friend another 15 minutes for him to be acknowledged. I ordered two buffalo trace old fashions and the bartender reached under the bar and pulled up two glasses that apparently had been prepped with what appeared to be mashed up maraschino cherries and some ice and then he just poured in the bourbon and then charged be $34.00 for two drinks. It was hands down the WORST cocktail I have ever gotten. He completely ruined the bourbon and if I had known that was how he was going to make that cocktail I simply would have ordered the traces on the rocks. You can't mess I was disgusted and felt completely ripped off. I make a lot of old fashions at home and it doens't take a lot of time to make this simple yet classic cocktail. It was like the bartender did not even give a crap about the cocktail. Take some pride in your job if you are going to charge be 17 for a drink  made incorrectly that took you two minutes. We make ours with sugar cube, dash of bitters, muddle with a splash of water, rocks then the bourbon and garnish with a zest of lemon and orange. No cherries and certainly not mashed up cherries. I don't right a lot of reviews but I still find our experience at this place to be disturbing. It is Vegas and its a bar in the MGM and it should be this great place where cocktails are crafted with a passion and that you give a great guest experience. Sorry but after visiting High West Whiskey Distillery in St. Lake City where they take making their cocktails very seriously, including egg whites in a whiskey sour, this place was like a dive bar.  Totally disappointed."
