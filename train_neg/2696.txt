b'I drove to Sears Home Appliance showroom because an advertisement was placed on my front door with appliances up to 50% off. I was not in the market for an appliance, but I might be coaxed into buying sooner with prices like that. So, I decided to go there. The sales guy informed me that the flyer was wrong, and that there was only a 30% discount. When I got home I re-read the ad to see if I missed the posting for the date. Nope! False advertising. Aside from that (which is what is influencing the large majority of this rating), the staff was nice. The products looked to be of quality, and the showroom was clean.'
