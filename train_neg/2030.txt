b"There are better and worse Y's for sure.  This place is nothing compared to Dowd or Davidson, but it does the job.  I would give another star, but I've just been told they are raising the already high price.  Plus, people don't seem to understand the one way signs in the parking lot, or just the parking lot in general.  I've def been honked and yelled at for following the rules.The front desk help are always pleasant, once you get to them.  I normally don't have the best of interactions with other patrons while waiting in line, but that seems to be the idea on this side of town.The locker rooms are decent, nothing special.  Plenty of open lockers most times of the day.  You will rarely find yourself solo in the sauna or steam rooms.I've only swam here once, I need to get on that.  I've never used the basketball courts or anything outside.  I stick to the weight room.  I have never had to wait on a bike or a treadmill.  If I'm looking for a stair climber that can be another story though.  The bikes are no where near as nice as the Dowd.  The only thing I ever have to wait on are the free weights.  There's plenty of weights, but not much room at all to use them.  If you want a lay down bench, you will probably have to wait, especially at peak hours.All in all, it is what it is.  Its close, so this is where I go.  Plus, there is a 24 hour Harris Teeter right there where nobody looks at you funny for being sweaty in gym clothes.  But, If somebody calls me asking if I want to go to a nicer location, I do."
