b"Not disappointed but certainly underwhelmed.  The two women eating gushed about the place as I stool looking at the menu.It was fine.  Nothing special.  Quite bland.  And $10 is expensive for a sandwich at what is not much more than a street stall.  You pay extra for avocado but then the avocado is served as a side dish.Not sold on the product or concept.  Won't bother again."
