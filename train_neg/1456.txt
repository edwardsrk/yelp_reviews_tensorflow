b'This is the worst machine shop to go to. I went there to get my 350 crank polished and balanced, well they polished and balanced it BUT, they did a half a**ed job leaving nicks on main journals and rod journals. And they took a grinder to the crank shaft counter weights and grinded the crap out of them to "balance" it. The owner is cranky and rude and says if his shop breaks it, its not his fault and won\'t take responsibility for any parts that are broken. Anything you say, he says is the wrong way and there is only one way to do things and its his way. Not only do they have crappy customer service, but they do horrible work..... FAIL'
