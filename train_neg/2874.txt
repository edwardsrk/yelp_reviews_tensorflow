b'2.5 stars.I found out about this place after seeing the most amazing pictures of the Blueberry Hill (griddle cakes with blueberry). My friend was making an impromptu visit to the GTA, so I figured it would be a good time to try their brunch. Well, we arrived around 1:45 and we were seated around 2:45, but it was my first meal of the day and I ordered a waffle, so I\'m still calling it brunch.I ordered the brown sugar bacon and banana br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e waffles with a side of sugar cured smoked bacon because... bacon. Also, I was intrigued by that fact that it was also called "butcher\'s crack." It was OK. The waffle was nice and eggy, but nothing special. The bananas were anything but br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9ed... a more accurate description would have been "battered and fried." The bacon had a nice sweet-salty-moky balance, but for whatever reason, I was expecting candied thick cut bacon and what I got was not that. I don\'t know.Service was OK. Our server was pretty blas\xc3\xa9 and not very proactive. Water glasses were left near empty for quite awhile and our empty plates remained on our table until we managed to flag her down for the bill... which was a task in an of itself, as she was nowhere to be found.TL;DR - long wait, average food, sub-par service'
