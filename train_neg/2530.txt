b"When I hear the name Manhattan Deli, visions of real east coast deli come dancing through my head...but alas I was mistaken.The food is not bad, nor can I go out on a limb and say it is good. It is average, and far below most NYC area delis.I have eaten here more then once with the hope, that by some freak of nature the Deli fairy visited and improved the food. One can dream can't one? But, sigh,  unlike my optimistic dreams, I was left with only the dream. The dreams and the memories of real rye bread,  real corned beef and real NYC mustard. I dreamed for the Deli fairy doing its work, but the dream, just like those of my youth, it was just like the Tooth fairy, instead of a real good sandwich all i found was a lousy quarter under my pillow(actually it was dried up corned beef, on the floor under my table).Why I didn't rate the restaurant a little higher, is for as the food is average, the service is usually far below."
