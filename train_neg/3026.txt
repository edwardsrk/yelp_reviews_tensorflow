b'I was recommended to come here for an x-ray due to the x-rays being down at my physician office. I called ahead a week prior and was told that I could just walk-in. I came in at 0945 and was told to sign in and wait. I waited over an hour before I was seen and the only reason it was that long is because I got up and said something. Nobody came over and asked what I was here for. Several people came in after me and were seen. Once I said something the process went fairly quick but the fact is I had to say something and was completely forgotten about.'
