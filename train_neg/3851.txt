b"I've been a weekly regular since they opened years ago and have never had a problem with delivery till tonight. For whatever reason this weekend, their excuse was that they decided to do all you can eat sushi (which is usually just a Sunday through Thursday thing) and they didn't anticipate a crowd?  It's Saturday night!  It's always busy!  So the results were it took over an hour and a half to get our food when it usually takes 20 min and when it finally arrived, they forgot half of the sushi order!  I've been to other excellent sushi places where they will put as many chefs behind the sushi counter as necessary to keep up with demand... But not with katana.  I've had dine in issues before at katana where they are slammed on a Wednesday and only have one guy to do all the sushi.  Now it's affecting the weekend orders as well?  Completely unacceptable for as place open as long as they have and really makes me feel like they are choosing profits over customer satisfaction.  If you are going to offer all you can eat sushi for dine in, open up that pocket book and HIRE some more chefs!"
