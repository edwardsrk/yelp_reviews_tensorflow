b"My fiance ordered from here recently. After waiting almost 2 hours for our pizza to arrive, we called and asked what was going on, they said it would be there soon. Ten to fifteen minutes later it shows up and the driver informed us that they forgot to make the pizza. Any to top it all off we received some cardboard with a thousand dried up pepperoni slices on it. Wouldn't recommend"
