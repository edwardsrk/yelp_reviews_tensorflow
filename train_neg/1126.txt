b"Don't know what happened but customer service is absolutely horrible. Not to mention the fact they charge a ridiculous 18% automatic gratuity for a party of 5 or more. The cashier was very rude and wouldn't even give us credit for our full stamp card, sooooo unfair. I will never step foot in this place again."
