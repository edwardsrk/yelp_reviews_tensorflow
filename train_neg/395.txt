b"First & last time I'll be staying here. Came for an event at the convention center & this was their hotel of choice. Two biggest complaints I had was the heat never worked in my room & I called about it but nobody ever arrived. Second, woke up in at 4a to hear a dripping noise. Water was coming up out of the sink & spilling over onto the bathroom floor & on my stuff I had sitting on the counter. Housekeeping came up but it took them calling their engineers a few time before someone arrived to fix it. Needless to say not a fun experience at all. You can tell this hotel has some age on it & needs to be redone. Other items of note - fridge had smelly food left in it from previous occupant, no free coffee in room, trash by the elevator never emptied & it reeked. I'm sure there's more but my tired brain is done."
