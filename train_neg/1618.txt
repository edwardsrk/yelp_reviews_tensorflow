b'Spent weeks working with Jason O. First I was told he would locate a vehicle for me and getting financing will be no problem. Then I find a vehicle and again they will get the financing and see what kind of payment we can get for your credit no problem. Then I get a phone call saying they want $7000 when I had a trade in. What? My husband and I are both extremely upset and will never do business with these people. This is a perfect example of car salesman that just want to get You in and then run and mess with your credit. Shameful!'
