b"Took my husband last week for his birthday.. First time for him. Unfortunately probably his last. He was nott impressed. The best part of his dinner was the atmosphere. He ordered the special - Scallops.. appeared to be frozen, not fresh and very small. I ordered the Stuffed Artichoke as my entree. The flavor was good, I believe it was cooked in beef broth, however there was enough bread crumbs to coat an entire chicken. all of our food was average to below average. We paid $9 for 4 oz of Pinot Noir,Service was great, too bad we can't say the same for our food."
