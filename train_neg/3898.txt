b"Friday night in Summerlin is often a challenge. There are many choices but it seems that Friday is when the entire population tries to get a table at the same time. I have started to use Open Table for reservations with varying degrees of success. the first time I booked here, I received a phone call shortly afterwards to tell me they could not seat us. This time I tried again, I waited for my phone call to cancel me but it didn't come. Good! Off we go.We arrive on time and are seated immediately. Nice.We order some drinks and some wings for an appetizer. Wings were a little crispy, I am not sure if that was the intent. OK, only OK.Wifee, myself and teenager ordered Burgers. I took the one with lobster, $5 extra for a tiny piece of crustacean and sauce. Hum? Wifee had Turkey and teen built his own. The burgers were good, cooked medium and a good size. But it's $5 extra for fries. Burgers , in my opinion, should be served with fries NOT soggy potato chips. I believe it is complete gouging to charge 50% of the burger price for the fries.Smaller son had kids chicken fingers and fries and it was ok but the portion was small.So 3 burgers, 1 kids meals 2 wine, 2 beer and 2 sodas $100 . Too much, food was ok but I can spend $100 on better.Bye."
