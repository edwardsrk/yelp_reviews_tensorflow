b'Hostess was extremely rude; she just walked off without saying anything after we told her the number in our party. Most people would be like "please follow me."Ordered drinks - pear martini (fairly good) & strawberry limeade (limeade was terrible, had an awful aftertaste & it had an identity crisis, didn\'t know if it was going to be sweet or sour...)Ordered 2 fried rice dishes, which ended up being extremely salty. Would not recommend...Only good thing about the whole experience was that our waiter, Doug was really nice.'
