b'I bought a groupon for laser. And im very disappointed because i didnt see any results. The technician was always very nice and kind, getting a hold of them by phone or anything was annoying. I went to all my sessions, before the last one I was offered to extend it, of course I refused because of the lack of results and I am not saying that I saw an improvement of at least 20%, maybe a 5% at the most. By the last session, the technician, always nice and kind, finished the procedure and disappeared, i went to the front desk and nobody was to be seen, i waited a bit but they seemed to be very entertained talking somewhere else so I just left feeling even more disappointed about their services and  respect for customers. I will never go back there, even if is with a groupon, is a total waste of money and time.'
