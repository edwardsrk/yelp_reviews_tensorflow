b'Very disappointed with my experience here. My fianc\xc3\xa9 called the Casino and were told that our $35.00 parking fee would be waved for eating at the buffet. (We were only visiting for dinner). When we get down to the buffet we had to wait in line for about an hour and there were empty seats everywhere. So I decided to go up to the front to ask about how long it might take and the hostess basically ignored me and turned around and started yelling to her coworkers about how annoyed she was that "people" kept coming up and asking her about the wait. Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our "not so good experience" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait.. That\'s the only reason we parked there when we could have just payed $10 in the next parking garage. So $75 for a not so great dinner. We definitely won\'t be returning any time soon. I\'d say the casino should step up there game in the dining department.'
