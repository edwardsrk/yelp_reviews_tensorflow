b'Was excited to try this place even after reading some of the reviews. The staff was friendly enough but a bit slow to take the order. After careful selection of the limited menu we ordered the southern hospitality, a strawberry cheesecake, poutine, amd two small drinks, $27? Wow. The gnats were complimentary though, yuck. They are everywhere, my ears, my mouth, and our food. I must say that the cheesecake and my waffle were delicious. The chicken in the southern hospitality was good but the flavor of the slaw was not to my liking, thats simply my opinion though. As for the poutine, we trashed them after a few bites. Soggy fries, gelatinous gravy and cold curd. Want some good poutine? May I suggest The Rose and Crown pub. If you\'re looking to try this place I\'d  say to probably stick to the waffles in the breakfast portion of the menu, not that you have much other choices. Really? How is "sorry, but we just recently opened" an excuse for not offering half of your menu?'
