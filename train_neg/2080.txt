b"So I was in the mood for Asian food and after countless research on yelp and Google, this place looked like it would deliver. Boy how wrong I was. The service was terrible. The server tried to get my friend to order two separate entrees when she just wanted a side of rice to go with her general tsos chicken. After we got our meals he disappeared and didn't return until about 15 minutes after we were done eating. My friend ordered the general tso chicken. It was bland and more breading than chicken. I ordered the chicken and mushroom noodles. The hand pulled noodles were slightly undercooked but still really good. The chicken was horrible and didn't even seem as if it was chicken. The texture was more of the organs than the meat. Needless to say it was very questionable. The experience all together was crappy but our server put the cherry on top when he took the bill and never returned with the change. Normally I tip 20% or above but he seemed ok with his 10%. I won't be going back there, I would have been more satisfied with panda express."
