b'Holy Hell I will never go back here again! ok here is how it went we waited for about 15 mins there was a total of 9 people there. it wasn\'t that much going on. well i ordered our food it was good for a price that is not reasonable. I normally go to china town or a real sushi restaurant if I\'m going to eat at one. well the point is i spent about 80.00 and I didn\'t like the service the woman never would come back and to fill our drinks and when she gave us our food it was not complete our order was wrong and we spent more time there than we should have. I didn\'t tip because of her lag time on serving and no apology for her mistakes. we paid our bill and left but get this the woman ran out and said to me did you like your food. i said yes but you made a lot of mistakes and i didn\'t like staying here that long. she said to me " you like food you give me tip" ! I was so confused i told her i don\'t tip bad service i tip good service. she said i work on tips i told her i do too! but you are wrong to chase me out the restaurant and tell me to give you a tip. i will never come here again. i called the owner they didn\'t see a problem with what she did. even knowing what the services was like. so over all this place is slow too slow and shitty employees and owner! i would tell anyone don\'t go here but try at your own risk of being chased down for a tip. JUST GO TO SURU BBQ there open till 2:30am and it\'s all you can eat buffet its better then your near buy sushi wow crap! REMEMBER SURA BBQ KOREAN BBQ AND SUSHI JUST GO! OR kRAZY BUFFET'
