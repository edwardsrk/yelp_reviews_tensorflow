b"I went to this nail place about a year ago, the girl that gave me a pedicure got the calus remover on my legs, they burned so bad for days. I thought I would give it a try again. This was my last try! The lady that did my pedicure did a really shitty job, never talked took her 15 min! I told the manager she apologized. That's it nothing else. The guy did my gel nails they don't look professional I know they won't last! He also didn't understand anything I was telling him!! I won't be going back! $75.00 wasted!!"
