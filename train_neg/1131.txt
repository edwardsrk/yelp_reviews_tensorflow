b'Johnny Vegas Grill has some of the best food that I have found locally since relocating to the Vegas area a little over a year ago. Unfortunately, I will no longer be doing any business with the establishment. Today I placed an order for delivery at which point the representative taking my order advised the food would arrive in around 25 minutes. The food arrived just short of an hour and a half, and to my disappointment, the food was soggy and cold. I have always received great service from Johnny\'s, so I decided to reach out to the General Manager to inquire about a possible refund. After explaining the situation and politely requesting a refund, the General Manager quite unprofessionally told me that an hour and a half wait time isn\'t anything uncommon, and that I was being " ungrateful for how accommodating she is". As I expressed, Johnny Vegas Grill has delicious food.. it is very unfortunate that they have a General Manager representing the business at a lesser quality than the quality of food they provide.'
