b'Thought to try this place out for the first time so got to-go order of goat masala, chicken seekh kabab and garlic naan.hugely disssapointed, they made goat curry and chicken kababs unexpectedly too salty and naan was burnt/over cooked.I immediately called them up to complain and response for salty goat curry was that "We make it in huge quantity", what does that even mean and how is that an excuse or justification for salty food. Such a waste of money, this place is so not upto expectations at all!'
