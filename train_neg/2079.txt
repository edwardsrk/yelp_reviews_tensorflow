b'I wish I could give a better rating. It really isn\'t a bad place. It\'s chill and hipster. But what I had there tasted awful.I ordered iced tea but what they gave me was not lemony nor did it have any citrus flavour typical for iced tea. It wasn\'t even sweetened!! Furthermore the color was blood red! What are they playing at? Sorry, this iced tea detered me from wanting to go back. Maybe the coffee drinks are good, but definitely not this damned "iced tea".'
