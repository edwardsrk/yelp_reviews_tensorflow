b"I'm really sad that I had such a bad experience here. The waitress really lacked quality and was devoid of personality. She had a bad case of RBF. We ordered egg rolls which came out quickly, but were cold. They tasted fine, like freezer or Panda Express quality. The cook forgot to make our fried rice and then made it and it was delivered to our table. I ordered a 3 (on a 5 scale) and it was ridiculously hot. To the point that my mouth was burning and my chest was hurting a bit. I found it to be strange and thought I just got a bad bite, but it was all ridiculously hot and honestly just devoid of all flavor. I was not impressed.I give this place two stars because the fried banana at the other table did look quite good.The other waitress who helped us was very kind at least.I feel like this place is incredibly hit or miss, unfortunately for us, we had a miss."
