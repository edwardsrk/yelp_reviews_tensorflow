b'This is the worst shuttle service you will ever see in your life. The whole experience was a nightmare. We departed the airport and found their booth outside and waited in line only to find out since we had a voucher we did not need a ticket. It did not state anywhere on there about that.Next we went over to stand in line and wait for the shuttle with the other 50 or so people. Shuttle took 15-20 minutes to arrive. It took another 15 minutes to load and depart and then it was another 15 minutes before another one arrived. Luckily I was able to get on that one, but what a fiasco. They have the worst service and are way too slow. They want you to call in advance to arrange your return pick up and they come and get you 2-3 hours before you need to be at the airport. F*** that. These people will never see me or any of my money again. We are taking a cab back to the airport since we are close I think it would have been cheaper just to take a cab in the first place. Never use these people they are horrible and you will regret it. Big mistake I will never make again EVER!!!!!!!!!!'
