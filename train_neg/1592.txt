b"They messed up my drive-thru order AGAIN! 3rd time this month!  How difficult is it to look at the screen and grab the right breakfast sandwich off the warmer?  I ordered and paid for a sausage McMuffin with egg, and not until I get to work do I realize that what's in the bag is a sausage McMuffin - no egg. That's a difference in price of about $2! Really!?! Not the best way to start my day!  I know it's always a struggle to get the drive-thru line moving, but it doesn't mean you sacrifice quality control and efficiency."
