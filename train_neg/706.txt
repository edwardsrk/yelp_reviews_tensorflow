b"Ahhhh the el cortez so much history so old school...what a complete dump. First off you have to walk off of Fremont to get there it was like walking down a hallway in a psych ward replete with urinating hobos,prostitutes having conversations with trees and dogs humping watermelons...I heard they have a 3/2 BJ single deck in here so I went in to check it out....the first thing you notice is that old stale smell..then the clientele which is right out of a homeless shelter field trip. So I walk around the tables to scope them out..not many people playing but a lot of dealers just standing there looking like Oliver waiting for some bread. Eureka I find what I'm looking for. I start to play..initial wager 40 dollars...won some lost some...I guess this is  more then they are accustomed to. Anyways now I'm rolling I'm up about 350 all of a sudden one of the floor supervisors comes over and says after this shuffle we are closing the game....haha hahaha. ..oh really and why is that? The other dealer called in sick..bhahahaha hahahaha how about one of the 10 other dealers picking their asses..they can't jump in? Oh no sir we are sorry..you know we want to keep th game open...i said I don't know anything of the sort..I got up and cashed out...in all the years I have gambled...I have NEVER seen that happen..suffice it to say I will not be returning here...if you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen..."
