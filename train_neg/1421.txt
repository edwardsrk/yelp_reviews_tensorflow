b"This place is the total opposite of urgent care.  I was here for 2 hours before I saw a physician.  1 hour in the waiting room and another in the private room.  The staff are not very friendly and the first thing they do besides collect your health insurance is get your money.  I guess they're afraid you're going to leave halfway through waiting and not pay them.  I would not recommend this place to any suffering soul who needs to see a doctor immediately."
