b'Coffee is amazing as always, but only 1 person was there working at 7:30am on a Sunday morning... my order (5 drinks) took approximately 30 minutes. I just wish that the barista would have let me know rather than take payment and then have me wait while he made them intermixed with taking new orders and making other customer drinks..'
