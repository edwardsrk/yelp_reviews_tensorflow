b"Just ok.  I had the roast beef sandwich which was ok, but a little salty.Also tried the Ahi salad sandwhich which was a grilled butter bomb.  And tasteless.Salad was good.Ribs were OK, nothing special.Koloa Pork was soaked and oozing in BBQ sauce.  What?  That's not Koloa Pork!  Awful.The Tilapia taco whatevers as an appetizer were ok, but needed more zing.  Service was nice enough, but didn't seem like she cared or had any passion.  good beer was enjoyed though!"
