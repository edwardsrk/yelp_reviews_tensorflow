b'I love Indian cuisine and have tried a few in the area but this was my first time here. . I ordered at 745 and was told the wait for my carry out order would be 35 minutes.  When I arrived, I was told I was "early" when in fact It was 5 minutes early.  I then waited an additional 20 minutes.  I ordered the Chicken Makani amd the Palek Paneer.  The chicken was all gristle and had bones and skin and there were literally 5 small pieces of chicken in it which was of very Poor quailty compared to others I\'ve had  The sauce had a good flavor though.  The Palek Paneer lacked flavor and was also lacking Paneer, which for $13.00 should\'ve been more of it!  I will not be going back to Tadka.'
