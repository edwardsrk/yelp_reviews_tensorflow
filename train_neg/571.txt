b'Came here for the "midnight" launch of the PSVR. After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren\'t pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. The previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.Not only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). Not happy.'
