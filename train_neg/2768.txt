b'Waited 3 years to get a Whataburger. I was so excited, but when my order arrived at the table... the fries were undercooked and lukewarm, the hamburger patty was not brown and crisp, but a greyish-brown; the cheese was not melted completely; and the bun was cold-ish. This is not the food I craved for years. Downhill Whataburger. Sad.'
