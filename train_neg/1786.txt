b"I now hate this place if I could give no stars I would! I used to love it here this was my second home but now every salesman is just out for your money they don't care every time I tried to sell something here they'd tried to rip me off till I called them out about it then I was disrespected by the manager. This guitarcenter was never about trying to sell you the most expensive thing it used to be about the music I will never come here again nor will anyone I know!"
