b'Came here bc we wanted to try a New Mexican restaurant and when I discussed it with my boyfriend we figured since the establishment had been open for so many years that they had to be good.  I think they are more based on nostalgia sake then quality of food.  And because there are so many other good quality Mexican restaurants in town we figured they would have to at least stay competitive with the other business.  Walked in and slightly dingy- aged interior- which is fine we knew they had been around forever.... we were seated at a booth which only had 2 place settings not 3 as we had a party of 3.  No one brought us an extra setting.  Service was pretty good, but food quality was sub par especially for the price.  Chips came out cold- salsa was chunky in water and another in a syrup dispenser.  We ordered a combo dinner platter which we were disappointed at the quality of the beef and chicken.  Biggest regret was the fajitas which only were overly oily cooked meat and chicken with onions.  Only 2 thin uncooked slices of peppers on top.  The beef was chewy and unappetizing.  Cooked in way too much lard/oil to try to mask the quality.  I wish I could of had better things to say.  When we got the bill we were shocked- almost $75 for 3 for a subpar meal.  Too expensive for the overall meal and ambiance.'
