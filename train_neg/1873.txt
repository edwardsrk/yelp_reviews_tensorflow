b'I came in here a couple weeks ago to get a couple keys made for my Jeep. I walk up to a man at the self check-out and ask him politely where to get a key made. He doesn\'t bother to look up from his computer and then finally says "Over there" and gives me no direction. I walk over to a desk where a few of employees are sitting. I ask, "Excuse me, is this where I go to have a key made?" "No" I stand there thinking they would redirect me... Nope. So I ask, "Well, where should I go?" A woman points one way and the man points the other. Okay... Finally I found some one to help me. He was nice and helpful. I\'m not sure if it\'s because I\'m a 19 year old girl they didn\'t feel was worth their time or what it was, but I didn\'t realize it was so hard to show someone in the right direction. I won\'t come back here.'
