b"Fries get soggy very fast and is not pleasant to eat after a while. It's not crispy like other fries I've had. Cook was very accommodating. I got the philly steak pouting but with all the extra toppings on the side. Wanted to see if it would be less soggy but that didn't help. Poutines are ok it if I'm going to spend that much on a poutine I'd rather get it at an actual restaurant."
