b'The receptionist at my PCP\'s office recommended Dr. Gimel but I never got to see him. Instead they made an appointment with his PA, David Rueb. My PCP suggested I had an issue with my SI joint.The younger lady with dark hair at the front desk is quite rude. So I was already kinda bummed out. A assistant with arm tattoos called me back and took my vitals. He was really friendly, I wish I could remember his name. Finally David Rueb makes his way into the exam room. He immediately starts in on my x-ray, which BTW you "MUST" have before they\'ll even book you an appointment. He states there\'s nothing wrong with my back. I tell him my symptoms. And he immediately says it\'s sciatica. So first there\'s nothing wrong and now I have sciatica? Okay. I mention how my PCP suggested an MRI to possibly rule out SI joint and he says no. He assures me it\'s sciatica. And prescribed Naproxen and 3 weeks of physical therapy. I again ask if we could just have an MRI done just in case as I\'m in serious pain and I don\'t really have sciatica symptoms. No again, and schedules another visit with him in 30 days. Well, come to find out he misdiagnosed me, just as my PCP suggested. I saw another ortho doctor who w/o  question knew it was my SI joint and not sciatica. If Rueb had only set aside his ego and condescending attitude and ordered additional imaging I could\'ve been on my way to recovery. When I called to cancel my second appointment the rude girl even asked why I was canceling. Don\'t worry about it! I don\'t know how Dr. Gimbal is but I do not recommend David Rueb. What a knucklehead!'
