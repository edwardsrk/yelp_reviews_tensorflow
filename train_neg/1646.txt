b'In my time I\'ve never seen such a unorganized place. Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It\'s sad when a business like this isn\'t taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that\'s just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don\'t respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn\'t help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven\'t they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don\'t get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what\'s going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as "Family Friendly" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths. Filthy Mouths and Filthy Minds shouldn\'t be serving your family food.'
