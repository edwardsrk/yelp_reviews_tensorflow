b"Where do I start?We have been here many many times.We continue to hold out hope for this place because when the stars align you might get a tasty lunch at a very reasonable price. The lunches are 6 to 8 dollars with the usual soup/salad and egg roll with it. Portions are small but adequate.Various sauces do well to hide the taste of these fresh from the freezer offerings. Just 2 miles from Sun Lakes across from the Fry's Market. Come as you are. Teeth are optional."
