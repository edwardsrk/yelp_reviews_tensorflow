b"This was my first Artia's experience.  Very under-welhelming. Being a vegetarian, thisplace was not vegetarian friendly.  The Tomato Vodka penne was like...meh.  It had only a few sprigs of spinach and the tomato sauce was too sweet.  It tasted like it cameout of a jar (it probably did).  It would be helpful to list vegetarian selections on the menu so I wouldn't have to ask the server.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back to Atria's...since there are all the same."
