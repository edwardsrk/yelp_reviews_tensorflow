b'This place gets a 2 stars because while the food is delicious heir service is horrible. Every time I order from here it is always some kind of issue. The first time I tried to order their 4$ ginger salad with extra vegetables she informed it only comes with iceberg lettuce and shaved  carrots.... pause- FOUR DOLLARS? Never mind! I came to dine in today and we order our appetizers- I ordered sushi and Tom Kia soup with modifications to it. and everything came out of the kitchen out of order. My soup came before everyone it was not modified the way I asked for it. And when she sent it back to be corrected the main dishes came out not the appetizer so we said never mind and my soup never came out. I only recommend eating as take out and check your orders to make sure they are correct!'
