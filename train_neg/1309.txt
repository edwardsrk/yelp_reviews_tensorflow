b"Sad how new ownership doesn't value the customers satisfaction. My review went from a 5 star to a 1 star. I would have liked to have given them a no star. Rude and argumentative. The new location is not at all relaxing  and inviting. Feels like your waiting for the dentist. Sad but I guess I will have to find another spa for my massages."
