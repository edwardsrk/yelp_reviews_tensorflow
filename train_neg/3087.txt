b"Ugh. I wish this wasn't the closest McDonalds location to my house, or I'd go elsewhere. I've had a few good customer service experiences, but this place is pretty terrible. My biggest complaint is that they NEVER fill the french fry box! I always have to order a size up, because I know they're going to dupe me.Tip: Make sure your order is correct before you head home!"
