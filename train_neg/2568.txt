b'They don\'t seem to fully have their gas dialed in and I tried 3 different beers and they were near flat. I saw one guy at another table and his beer looked carbonated but his friends was flat and I asked him and he confirmed.  The bartender was nice enough but  told me (in his own words) its because it\'s micro brew and Im used to "Coors Light".  I tend to steer clear of the large and light shitty beers.  This is the 2nd newish bar Ive been to and the beer tap operation hasn\'t been sorted out. So I think its a new bar thing, I\'m sure in a few months they\'ll figure it out.  Please don\'t scapegoat the customer by assuming everyone but you drinks microbrew.  This wasn\'t cask ale they were serving up, this was ales, lagers I tried.atmosphere is nice and staff are friendly.  I don\'t think the guy was trying to insult me but its rude to be like,  our beer isn\'t flat you\'re just used to shitty beer.'
