b"I got a Groupon for 3 laser hair treatments. Casey, who works the front desk and performs the laser hair removal, is really awesome and takes good care of her returning clients. However, I ended up purchasing a total of 9 more treatments in addition to the 3 Groupon treatments (I have completed all 12 sessions) and my hair looks the exact same as it did before I started any treatments. It's no lighter and there isn't less hair. I got treated in several places, including underarms, legs, arms, bikini, and face. All of the hair grew back 100%. Also, a couple of times, the laser burned me so bad that I had burn marks all over my arms, thighs, and bikini. It took several months for the burns to go away. I don't know about the tattoo removal, but I suggest going elsewhere for your hair removal."
