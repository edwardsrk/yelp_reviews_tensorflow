b'This used to be one of our favorite places for Lenten fish fry.  I don\'t know what changed from last year but, tonight we had the greasiest three pieces of breaded cod.  I ate one piece, removed the breading on the second piece and left most of my french fries uneaten because they were soaked with oil from the fish. My wife left two pieces of fish and most of her chips uneaten for the same reason!  To top it all off, there were half a dozen guys playing a "chipping game for beer", who were way too loud, occasionally profane and just plan rude!  I don\'t know if the restaurant is under new management but they had better get their act together.I hope the course hasn\'t undergone any changes like the restaurant atmosphere and food has!'
