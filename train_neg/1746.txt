b'My husband and I went here yesterday for our first and only time. To start, the place reminded me Chipotle or Qdoba, but not. It seemed to have some type of structural problem. In the middle of the dining area there was a section blocked off. I ordered the bean(pinto) and cheese burrito combo(drink &fries) and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito combo. We never got a receipt, that is my #1 pet peeve when it comes to fast food dining. I have been overcharged at many "berto"s style restraunts in the past. They have a skimpy selection of soft drinks and the condiment/ drink area looked kind of sloppy. There were no forks, no black pepper and the knives were all sitting "blade" up, which is kinda gross. Our burritos came in baskets, the amount of french fries was equivelent to what you would get with a child\'s meal @ McD\'s, dissapointing. The tortillas were dry and flaky. My beans were whole, unmashed, and pretty watery, so it was hard to taste the cheese. I was told upon ordering my burrito came with pico and sour cream which was not in my burro when I got it. My husband\'s burrito came with black beans, mushy white rice, pico, sour cream, and of course carne. He said it was flavorless and had to add hot sauce for flavor. We decided then the place sucked and we wouldn\'t return. Then it got worse...We both got sick about 6 hours later. To keep it vague, intense lower GI issues. NOT pleasant.**UPDATE- exactly one day after my review, Nov 23rd, I received this message "Hello, We are so sorry for you terrible experience. It\'s not what we are committed to. Not at all. I realize you didn\'t get a receipt, but if you remember the approximate cost of your meal, we will send you a check to refund your money. Thanks, Vanessa Shaw, the Owner"I sent Vanessa my address that same day and have yet to receive a check from Bueno Burger. AGAIN, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! WHY DID SHE EVEN CONTACT ME IN THE FIRST PLACE?'
