b'Well.  I really wish I had a better review.  We really didnt have a good experience and wont be back.  The service is really, really lacking.  Something is wrong with housekeeping.Our room didnt have a luggage rack (waited 20 minutes to unpack)  Discovered the next morning that I didnt have a hairdryer (waited 30 minutes for them to bring one)  Housekeeping never came when we requested, however they were in our room at 3pm when we came back from shopping.  This hotel, even though its a non gaming, is not without trash.  Dont think you are getting anything extra special.  What you are getting is a hotel that really far away from the strip, very poor service disguised by a good name.  We will not be back,'
