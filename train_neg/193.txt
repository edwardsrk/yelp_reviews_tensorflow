b"I was told when I signed up the gym was supposed to be open in january, never received a call that they had postponed the opening date.I had cancelled my membership with my other gym and now i have been left without a gym for a whole month. I had to call them in order to find out. Haven't even started going to the gym and already dissapointed."
