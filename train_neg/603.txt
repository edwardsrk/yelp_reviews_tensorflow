b'We just sold my dad\'s house, and moved him into an assisted living.  We had a houseful of belongings to sell.  I had contacted Holly at Lenore and Auntie Glads Estate sale.   Holly agreed to do the sale for a 3 day weekend sale.  I had taken a few items from the home, prior to the sale.  She set up a week prior to the sale and decided to do a one day sale, unannounced. We had our back against the wall, cause the house was closing  the following week.  Holly did the sale, which was a total dissapointment.  Selling the items way below the tagged price and leaving 1/3 of the household item behind.  I continued the "Sale" by directional signs on a church Sunday, and raised 50% of her revenue, with all the leftover, pick over stuff.Holly is quite the sales lady, to get you to sign the contract, but has no sense of  business.  I would advise anyone to do a sale by themselves and put an ad on ESTATESALES.Com for $ 89.00, and post numerous pics on that site.  All the money raised was going to charity, but it put a sour taste in our mouth when we had to pay Holly 40% for a pathetic sale.  She also says, she sends emails to her list, which is the ESTATE Sales.com viewership.  Lenore and Auntie Glads is front for a ripoff company!!'
