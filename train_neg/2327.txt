b"Underwhelming at best. Was stoked to try this place out, as it came highly recommended. We showed up early and were seated right away (yay!). Our server was nice and explained the menu and made some recommendations. The cucumber mule, which they have on tap, was entirely too sweet and I ended up trading it in for a glass of prosecco. The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special. I would have tried more things, but was too disappointed to spend any more money for such mediocre small plates. Great concept, lovely space (although there is zero street signage and it's up a flight of stairs), but I was not impressed at all. Will not return."
