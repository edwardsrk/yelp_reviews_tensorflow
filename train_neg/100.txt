b'I would not recommend this place. We went on 7/2/16. First the chips were stale and the salsa had no flavor, watery. My husbands Michelada was not cold, he had to ask for ice. His fish ceviche was boiled instead of cooked in lime and his tostada was warm not cold. He ordered shrimp and octupus cocktail they gave him shrimp and oysters, it also smelled bad. My mexican plate was also not good. The beans had no flavor, the enchilada & chile relleno were not good. I was only able to eat half. My sons fries were over priced.  The floor was dirty, at the entrance, that should of been our first clue. We went because we heard promo on spanish radio. Thought it would be good. This is my first review and for the first time we wished we would have asked for our money back. We are definitely not going back.'
