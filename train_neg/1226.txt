b"My 6 friends and I had reservations yesterday morning when they opened at 11.  We are all older and were sat at the tall table right next to the counter, the chairs were HORRIBLY uncomfortable, made of medal with a really tiny little seat, like for a 5 year old, we all kept sliding off of them because they had such a high gloss on them.  I brought it to several peoples attention and asked to be moved and was told that the other 6+ tables were all reserved, mind you we had reservations too.  The food looked like it would be really good and I guess if it had been hot it would've been but my over easy eggs were hard, the enchiladas underneath were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted.  The icing on the cake was the noise, we had a hard time hearing each other at the long, high table and then they brought in loud, live music, Oh Boy, won't be my next choice of places to go.  The flowers on our table were completely dead in cloudy water, obviously needed to be replaced yesterday.  When the waitress brought our bills, gratuity was already included, she asked me if I needed change on my $20 bill, I was like a yeah I do, I didn't get $7 service here.  Just saying, if I ever went back, it definitely wouldn't be on a Sunday morning and I would refuse to sit at that tall table.  The only good thing I can say about this place is had my eggs been cooked properly, they would've been amazing, I don't know where they get their eggs from but the yoke was amazing, what part of it that was still soft."
