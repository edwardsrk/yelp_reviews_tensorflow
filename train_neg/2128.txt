b"Not sure why all of the 5 Star ratings. Food was just average at best and with price considered it's less then average. Fries were meeh, sandwiches the same and service slow. The only saving grace was the pleasant young man who took the order was both knowledgable and courteous. Too much money and slow delivery, not a good combination.Removed from my bookmarks, won't be going back."
