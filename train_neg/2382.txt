b"I live in the neighbourhood, so I also wanted to like the place.  The first time I dropped in was for a take-away Nespresso/ espresso coffee, which was quite good.  The second time I came by for a take-away salad, which was ok.  To my taste, most of the salads feature poorly combined ingredients, as if disregarding taste, someone randomly selected trendy ingredients like caramelized pecans to throw in with what-have-you.I considered exploring other things on the menu during their half-price evening specials, but discovered that it was only dine-in.  The ambiance doesn't really appeal to me, especially if it gets busy, so I didn't bother.Then, a breakfast special sign appeared in the window:  bottomless coffee, eggs, toast for $5.99.  No bacon or sausage.  Not the best of deals, but still convenient and good.  And mornings were not too crowded, before the high school students descend.  I found the breakfast to be a good start to the day, and the endless coffee was good and strong and dark-roast.  Even the music was ok.  For the price, I was willing to disregard the atmosphere with the big-screen tv and the smell of Pine-Sol permeating the place and interfering with my tastebuds.Regular breakfasts are just ok. I tried an omelette once which was overcooked.  I had the Huevos Rancheros another time and quite enjoyed that.  I don't quite know how it is possible, but much of the food doesn't have flavour.And then, they installed the sliding windows-- which is great-- but they removed the tables at the front windows and replaced them with sofa chairs and wee drink tables: I don't get it.  The breakfast special is gone.  The coffee has now become medium roast acidic diner stuff. The music is now AM radio.  I asked for extra salsa with my meal and was charged for it.I won't be back.  The things that I was enjoying have disappeared, and the sum of what is left is not worth the experience to me.  The place seems uncertain as to what it wants to be and to whom."
