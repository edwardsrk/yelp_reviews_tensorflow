b"This place should be rated less than zero for customer service. We had a horrible experience with the buffet. Couldn't tell you about the food. We got in the line at 9:59 am and were told they were closed when the sign said they served until 10:00 am. That might have been ok if they weren't so rude and when we walked away the cashier actually laughed! OMG! I called to complain to the food service manager. I was told he was in meeting. Not even offered someone else or voice mail. I guess the lack of good customer service starts at the top. Too bad since it's not a bad place otherwise."
