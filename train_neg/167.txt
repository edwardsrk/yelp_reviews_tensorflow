b'Explain to me why I need to pay for parking when they do NOT have enough spots, they do NOT enforce parking, and we had a handicap guest with us and no handicap spots were available because NON HANDICAP vehicles were parked in handicap spots.  Mangement basically laughed in my face and did not seem to care.  So not worth it NOTHING worse then RUDE STAFF!!!!'
