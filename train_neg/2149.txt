b"So disappointing. Just beyond.Not worth the time of a detailed review but here are the highlights...Had a reservation. Host/Manager seated a walk in table at the better of two crappy tables that were open and then tried to seat us. I asked if that was all he had he said yes. I then asked if they had something outside...they did. HmmmmmmAfter about 7 mins manic (and I mean MANIC) waiter comes over to say he'll be right with us.Another 5 minutes later takes our drink order. During which he argues with me on if I want that drink. It's a classic, I order it often...ok I'll wait while you ask the bartender. Ok order drink.35 minutes and 2 small plates later we have drinks.Waiter argues with us on food we order.Food was good, but definitely not worth the hype. Not even close. 2.5 hour dinner. We had 1 cocktail.So so disappointed. Will definitely never go back.And I always give a place a second chance. But I won't give this place another dollar."
