b"First of all don't buy more than one yelp coupon at a time cause you can only use one at a time and they stated that they prefer to give one ticket per table. Now I'm stuck with 2 more coupons that I probably won't use. The salsa was a little hot for me but the chips were fresh and delicious. We got the cheddar quest and it was delicious as well. I was very exited for the creamed corn side dish and it was a little hot for me but was delicious and I ate it even though my nose was running from it. I ordered the quesadilla and it was just basically plain chicken and cheese. Finally something not burning my mouth. My dinner guests had the Barbacoa burrito, which was huge, and the tilapia Cesar salad which looked good. Everyone ate all of their food! The service is where this place goes down hill. Had to wave her down for everything and wasn't overly friendly. If your going for the food it's pretty good just don't go there looking for the best service."
