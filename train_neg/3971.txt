b"When Tzatziki first opened service was amazing and the portions were huge. After a few months, the portion sizes shrunk dramatically and the service declined.I went in for takeout and it wasn't busy in the restaurant. I stood in front of the cash for 10 minutes and I was never greeted by any staff. The older woman that works there looked at me and then ignored me. I stood there for 10 minutes and then waited around another 5 minutes before I gave up and left.The food is average but nothing special. I've seen many people with frustrated faces as I've walked by many times. Expect bad service if you're going to eat here."
