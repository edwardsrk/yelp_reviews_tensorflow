b"The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   Food quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  Overall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food."
