b"My hubby just went to pick up our order of Mu Shu Pork, shrimp toast, pork egg rolls, and pork fried rice.My husband was concerned at the dirty front of house, but we dug in none the less.The shrimp toast was almost black from dirty oil and fell apart.  It really didn't taste good either.  The egg rolls we just so so.  The Mu Shu was ok too ( greasy) but it was supposed to come with 4 wraps and we only got 3 (not great when you were expecting to split it).  The pork fried rice was greasy and the rice was undercooked.  All in all we were disappointed and after reading other reviews I think we will not be back."
