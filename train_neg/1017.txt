b'Originally I had given this HT 5 stars, but after 2 awful incidences they are going down to 1. 1. I (mom) had ordered a cake for my son\'s birthday. My husband had gone to pick up the cake (dad). He had no idea what I ordered but just picked it up for me. When he brought home the cake I had noticed they did not write Happy Birthday with my sons name on it. when I called they immediately started to blame me for not telling the lady what to write, or to write anything at all. I calmly explained that I did, and I distinctly remembered as she asked me how to spell his name. He offered a refund, but I was just irritated that I would be to blame and why didn\'t my husband say something. 2. Today I was standing in line with just a few items. A cashier came up to me and said she could help me on another aisle. I started to walk over when another customer who didn\'t realize I was coming walked ahead of me to have his cart rung up. I thought she would tell this customer that I was actually next since she asked me to come over. But NOPE! She started ringing him up, even looked me in the eye and ignored me. I even said "seriously?", she looked up at me and shrugged her shoulders and continued on with the other customer. Would have been pretty easy to explain to the other customer that I was actually next, especially cause I only had a few items. Guess that will be the last time I shop there!'
