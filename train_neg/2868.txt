b"My son and I love cupcakes and thought we would try this place after shopping. He chose the Grasshopper and I got the Triple Strawberry. We did not enjoy our cupcakes. The icing was tasty, but the cake was bland and extremely crumbly, which made the cupcake too difficult to eat. Must have been an off-day based on other reviews. Also, we went to the bathroom to wash our hands and there were some congratulatory balloons hanging in the hallway. It's great that this business expanded to a second location, but the language on these balloons is just not appropriate for children."
