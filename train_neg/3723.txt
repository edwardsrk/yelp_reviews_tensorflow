b'Server and service were good, but the food sucked bad. Hush puppies were rock hard and dry and tasted a few days old. Ribs seemed like they may have come from a microwavable frozen entree. Pulled pork and mac and cheese were edible, but not good (think cafeteria or cheap buffet quality). No need to ever come here with so many other options available close by.'
