b'My sons and I used to come here all the time. Pretty good selection of games to play. Within the past year or so, there has been a severe lack of game maintenance taking place. Several of the multiplayer games consistently have broken down units. Mario Kart (our favorite) has been broken for almost a year, yet Gameworks has no problem letting people attempt to play the game - One of the steering wheels is almost non-responsive, and it makes the game completely unplayable. The other unit next to it has a seat that is stuck in a forward position. I went to talk to someone about this, and her answer was "it cost money to fix these games". Well, no sh*t. I think we\'re done with Gameworks. Unfortunately, I just purchased a Groupon recently that I haven\'t even used. It will probably go to waste. Dave & Buster\'s is close by, and has Mario Kart. Dave & Buster\'s doesn\'t have a couple of the other games that game works has, but I can\'t remember the last time the other games had both player options working and available at Gameworks anyway.'
