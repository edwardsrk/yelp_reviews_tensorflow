b"If you are sharing a suite where one of your friends must sleep on the pull-out sofabed, you won't be friends for long.  They will only be able to sleep with massive springs jamming into their soft tissue if they are passed out from drink.  Non-smoking room reeked of smoke, with maid service having to come spray twice daily.  Great kitchenette, too bad there isn't a place to buy groceries nearby.  Off the strip, not far, but makes for a creepy walk back in the dark."
