b'Something needs to be done about this location. .. never go here for breakfast!  It\'s so crowed. Drive through and inside. Its so bad that cars on are the main road trying to get into the drive thru.  Its also attached to a gas station so that makes it even more crowed. I asked for my breakfast burrito without cheese.  The cashier said "no prob" turns out, the burritos come frozen and they just heat em up... yuck.THAT Will teach me to not eat fast food.Avoid this location.'
