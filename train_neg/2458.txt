b"This place is just average. Nothing special. The menu is limited to just a few items but there are a lot of drinks on the menu. Food was ok. Burger was decent but small for the price and fish was $22 worth of breading with a tiny hint of halibut. It did come with a lot of coleslaw though which was just average. Drinks are about average price but there are other places in the vicinity that are a few bucks cheaper. Lunch for two with a beer each will run you about $65 so you're better off going someone else if you are hungry."
