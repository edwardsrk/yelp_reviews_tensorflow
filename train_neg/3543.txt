b"This will be a short and bitter review. We arrived at Museum Tavern at 9.30pm on a Thursday night, we were greeted by a nice man who seated us on the patio. We were served by a very nice girl who maybe wasn't trained very well.We ordered the Steak Tartare to share and the wife ordered a Salad and I ordered the prime rib dip. The tartare never got to the table, just the mains were brought, shame I was looking forward to it. Mains were good, the food was really nice. Server didn't check back on us, so I had no beer for my entree.We ordered the shortcake for dessert and it was like a desert DRY. Take it off the menu!!Paid the bill and left Food 7/10Service 4/10Drinks 7/10"
