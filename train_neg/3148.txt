b"Yeah it's a no for me... Was recommended the margarita pizza by the bartender lol.  I 'lol' only because I wonder if he was just 'trying' to sell an item on the menu? Does he not know good food? The tomato sauce base was so bland.  The sauce tasted like a brand I'd buy in the no-name section  of No Frills, if I was desperate and there were no other tomato sauces  left on the planet. I didn't finish the pizza - it was meh.I've had the cheesecake from Scaddabush at the Front street location, and the Mississauga location and it was creamy, however the same cheesecake at the Etobicoke location tasted tougher in texture. For the first time in my life, I can't really put a finger on it, as to why it was off to me. I noticed too it was a little tanned at the top of the cheesecake and I've never seen the cheesecake like that before at the other two locations. For an Italian restaurant, they really need to step up their game. It did not taste like authentic Italian cuisine. At the end of the day, I would have been happier going to Metro to buy the pizza that they make fresh and  fire in the oven. That's sad really... that I would have been more satisfied going to a chain grocery store for pizza.. C'mon , you had one job Scaddabush. Well won't be returning  to the restaurant. I guess  I'll make Joey's my hot spot for my end of the week treat!"
