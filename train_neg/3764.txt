b'I went to Olive Garden for the first time in a long time. I was very disappointed that they didn\'t remind me of the advertised special they have going on - a two for one entree special.  Conveniently they "forget" to mention that when you are preparing to order. Very disingenuous of them. Almost like a bait and switch scam.'
