b'The dream of the 90\'s is alive at Bob Coffee. There\'s "graffiti". Vintage indie rock - think Oasis. Motorcycles. Bukowski. Nirvana vinyl! There\'s industrial metal shelving and spotlights and branding on every damn thing in the whole place. Everything here is for sale.We visited Bob just a day after their grand opening. I waited a long time to order, not because of a long line, just super slow service. I waited even longer for my beverage, and while I waited I watched as the counter person forgot to give customer after customer their baked goods. The London Fog I ordered was very tasty, but I have no idea why it took so long to make. We also had a drip coffee, it was so acidic we only drank a third of the cup before throwing it out. There was a female barista, and a female counter person. As they worked, an unsmiling, unengaged man stood behind them and watched. He made no attempt to speak to any of the customers. I can only assume that he was the owner, supervising - but shouldn\'t the owner, on day two of business, make an effort to smile and say hi?The unsmiling management only heightened the overbearing masculine energy of this place. It\'s all very smug, as if they are planning on franchising into the next Starbucks. I think it\'s supposed to be gritty, but it just seems contrived? Boring. Functionally, those metal shelves are at just the right height to put your kid\'s eye out. Despite this being a family heavy neighborhood (indeed, Bob is right across the street from Action Potential Lab!), there is no change table, not even a hook for your bag or coat in the basement washrooms. The ladies room had no toilet paper at all. Overall, the whole vibe was unfriendly. I like my coffee shops to be warm, cozy, welcoming, and inviting. Bob is not a place that I want to spend time in. Get  your coffee to go here.'
