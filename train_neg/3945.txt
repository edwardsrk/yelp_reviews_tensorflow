b"My husband, mother, two young children, and myself ate here for lunch on Saturday. When we arrived, the restaurant was empty and nobody there to seat us. After waiting awhile I went in the back to see if we had accidentally gone in during a time when the restaurant was closed. The waiter I came across seemed annoyed that we were there, but he did seat us. I ordered the sashimi tuna salad. My mother ordered a Reuben, and my husband ordered the filet with crab. For being the only people in the restaurant it took nearly 30 min to get our food. Mine was inedible. The salad costs 16.95 and had 4 slices of cold seared tuna. The tuna tasted off to me and was slimy. The asparagus and peppers were from a jar. I took a few bites and stopped. Our server was obviously disinterested and instead of asking me how the salad was safe pretended not to notice until I said something to her. My mothers sandwich was mediocre. The bread was charred on the outside and there was only two slices of turkey on it. Her French fries were burned. She immediately asked the server for unburned fries and our server acted like she was unaware of the burned fries until my mother pointed it out. My husbands steak was cooked well and he said the crab on top tasted good. It was the best looking plate of the three. Overall we wouldn't recommend. The price is not worth the quality of food."
