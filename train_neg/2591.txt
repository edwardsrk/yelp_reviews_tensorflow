b'Well... I liked the organisation of the store and the staff are really helpful. BUT what I also noticed was that the games were pretty darn expensive for used games, I guess if you\'re a "video game collector" these prices are ok, but  for someone who just wants a game to play... no I will not pay $30 for a game that during it\'s day was only worth $20... I think that next time I\'ll just hit up the Cash Converters, where I can get a game for any of the old systems for under $15'
