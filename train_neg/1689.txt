b"If I could give zero stars, I would. Disclaimer: This review is wholly based off of service. I placed a to-go order and upon my return home, realized they forgot my cheese crisp. I'd argue that I shouldn't have to check my order if this was even a mediocre establishment considering they read my order back to me when picking up, but fine, I'll take the hit, my fault for not checking. I had my wife call to let them know they forgot our cheese crisp while I drove back. They confirmed that it would be ready when I got there. Upon my return, not only was our cheese crisp not ready, they had the audacity to ask me if I was sure they didn't give it to me. After waiting for them to actually make a cheese crisp, I headed home. When unpacking the remainder of our dinner, nothing was correct in regards to the substitutions we made. I had red sauce instead of the green I specifically ordered. No added shrimp on one of our dishes. No side of sour cream. No guacamole. The entire restaurant lacks any degree of even mediocre service. When you can't even get the most basic of details for an order, it's pure laziness and lack of care for your patrons. DO NOT GO HERE. The lack of service, the mediocre food, and the relatively exorbitant prices are not worth your time or money. This place deserves to fester and die for its serious lack of...well...everything. You'd be better off at Chipotle. At least they get your order right."
