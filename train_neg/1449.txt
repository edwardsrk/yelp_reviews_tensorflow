b"I really like the food here, I guess because I've been waiting for one to open closer to where I live. When it first opened it was different and new. Now I think they just don't care any more. The staff changes, and the ones that remaine have a don't care attitude. The last two times I was there the manager messed up my order twice and made me and others waiting very frustrated. I will never go back, I'm sure they could careless. But I do, because you want nice businesses in your community. I'll go else where."
