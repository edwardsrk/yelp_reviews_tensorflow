b'I know what you\'re thinking. What tourist comes to Sin City and goes to a freaking movie on a Saturday night?! Though in my defense, I\'d been fighting a cold all week, and when I landed into Vegas that Saturday afternoon for a work conference, the last thing I wanted to do is spend time in a noisy casino. So my partner and I decided to hightail it to the nearest theater, where we could digest our ridiculously giant dinners (thanks, Wicked Spoon) in relative quiet. First, this theater is super hard to find. If it weren\'t for the little sign in the alleyway, I never would have noticed it was there. The practically hidden location could partially be to blame for how abandoned-looking this theater is. (Well, that, and that there are a metric bajillion other things more interesting to do within a 1 mile radius). For our 10pm showing of an opening-weekend horror movie (Mama), there were *maybe* 15 people in the theater. Practically empty. Floors were sticky, seats were small, popcorn was stale, and employees were bored-looking and pretty lethargic. This theater is in dire need of an update. If I were a local, I definitely would not come back to this theater. If you\'re not too picky and need a respite from the more "traditional" activities Vegas has to offer, then it\'s definitely fine in a pinch.'
