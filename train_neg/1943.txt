b'Horrible customer service!!!!! Nicole & Marina have no kind of patience. I was very upset the way I was treated, they did not follow up with me after I was constantly sending them emails to confirm the package deal I needed for a bachelorette. In the beginning I was confused and was not sure what to choose from their website and these two girls were no kind of help, they just want to sell anything & make their money without trying to assist you the right way. They have no kind of patience!!!! Go somewhere else or do your research like I did to find better service & better deals!!!  I will never use their services.'
