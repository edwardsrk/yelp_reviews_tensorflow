b"Pros:Good fries. Open 24 hours a day.Cons:Waited 20 minutes though for my to-go fries order. Can't call downstairs to order take out. The servers are NOT helpful. The hostess I don't think completely understood English. Did I mention I waited TWENTY MINUTES for a side order of fries at a DINER!?!?!"
