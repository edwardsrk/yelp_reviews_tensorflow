b'1 - 5 scaleFood: 2Service: 4 Atmosphere: 5Service: 5I really like the decor as well as the staff at La Comida. Everyone was really friendly and the service was excellent, but I wasn\'t impressed with the food at all. I ordered the Red Snapper for $22 and it over cooked on the outside and covered in salt and pepper. One of my friends said it best: "if you think it\'s salty, it must have been really salty". I eventually scraped all the salt and pepper off the fish and managed to choke it down with help from my iced tea. I thought the Cheese Fundido was a bit flavorless so I asked my friends what they thought about the meal before I wrote this review. It sounds like I\'m not the only one in the group that didn\'t think the food was note worthy so I decided to write an honest review. The chips and salsa were "meh" and the Guacamole dip was even more "meh".  I don\'t feel the food is worthy of what they charge so I think you should leave it for the tourist and hit Tacos El Gordo or Don Jaun.'
