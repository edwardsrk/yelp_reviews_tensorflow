b"New ownership has changed the flavor profile of some of the dishes. We have been back three times and we've given up - the food flavors are no longer true to the Thai concepts that were developed and served here. The original owners have left and the so have the original chefs. The Pad Thai that we were last served was not edible - it was red in color (?) and the flavor was definitely off. So, we find the menu is hit-and miss, at best."
