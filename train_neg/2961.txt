b"My mom had a hankering for rolled tacos. Being that we are originally from San Diego, we have high expectations when it comes to authentic Mexican food. This establishment took my mother's order, beef rolled tacos with guacamole, cheese, sour cream and a side of pico de gallo. The cook took 5 pre rolled tacos out of the freezer, literally dipped them in hot oil for about 3 minutes, packed them up and gave them to my mom. She took one bite and was completely unsatisfied! She said she will never go there again! I personally think that her expectations may have been a little high when it came to this place and it's food. Try it for yourself. My husband didn't have a problem with it. He said they weren't the best, but they weren't bad."
