b"Sitting here eating my huge portion of steak nachos.  The nachos chips are crispy pita chips with seasoning.  Actually pretty good.  The nachos come with certain toppings, but they don't tell you what,  and you have to pay $1.00 extra if you want something else added on.  I had to pay for rice, hummus, olives, extra garlic sauce, etc.  I was not expecting this because the place I usually go to in Henderson is same price for a bowl no matter how many ingredients you add.  The place is very small and they don't have a good flow.  It is Chipolte style service but very crammed.  There was a huge line but the workers were trying to fill call in and delivery orders at the same time.I'm only giving 2 stars for the following reasons....paying extra for toppings, serving romaine lettuce during an e-coli outbreak, and the confusing ordering process.  They earned the 2 stars for the fact that there beef and chicken are cooked and served from a spit and the portions are very generous."
