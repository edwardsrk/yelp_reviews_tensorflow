b"My aunt recommended this place to me because she said this was her favorite place to get fries. I guess I should have realized that the fries probably just impressed her more than the actual seafood. I ordered the jumbo fried shrimp plate and got the fries with it. The shrimp was good but not great, the fries were really nothing special. The waitress I had was kind of weird and a bit rude even if she wasn't trying to be. The whole experience was just kind of odd."
