b'RESCIND prior stmnt: From biz standpnt, this is very respectable thing 2 do. Was happy w/my trnr, his enrgy/motivation & even noted in my rvw the facility seemed decent. Sure u picked up on this by my happy-go-lucky, bubbly demeanor. Positive u didnt pick up on this thru our "multiple convos," as we never had any. The depth of our encounters consisted of "Hi how r u?" Disturbed u would post "u gave many unsolicited compliments so shocked 2 read such neg things". When u called Mndy 8/17 @6pm, I had just walked in2 work & told u I would call back in AM. Our convo was less than 3 min, most of which was u explaining how my trnr quit. While I told u I was disappointed 2 hear he left & happy w/ reslts I achieved from him, I had 2 cut the convo short w/u b/c I was @ work. At no time in that 3 min did I give u "many unsolicited compliments." Also, my rvw was not overtly neg, & shift in attitude came from u not doing what u said u were going 2. Sorry 2 hear u parted ways w/ trnr 4 "very serious matters that [u] will not discuss." Being in biz is never an easy endeavor; disagreements ensue, feelings get hurt, & sometimes lawsuits arise. I can assure u that ur doing right by "not discussing" any details of the employer-employee dissolution (or is it employer-indep contrctr?), as that could lead 2 rumors. Sorry 2 hear u say he\'s gone out of way 2 try & "tarnish" ur co "out of retaliation & anger". I choose 2 ignore that comment b/c its hearsay & angry. Think u should take ur own advice & "not discuss" any disgruntles of ur biz relations. At no time did I have a convo w/u re contnuatn of my training w/ T (ur insinuating I currently train w/ him). I find it disturbing that once again ur having "conversations" w/me that never took place. My neg perspctv that I highlighted stemmed from actions of a reimb that never took place. 1. Refund-U did agree 2 void out the contract as evidenced by ur VCE MSG 8/18 @3pm. Full mnth was 600, I trained half (300), minus cx fee (150); there4 should have seen 150 credit. Believe u have me confused w/ another client who left AZP b/c we NEVER "discussed this in detail on the phone," as our cx convo were BOTH over vce msg (my msg 2 u 8/18 in AM when I got off work & ur rspnse 8/18 PM). Based off what u promsd in my vce msg, I rvwd u by stating "From a biz standpoint, this is a respectable thing 2 do". I was refrng 2 u agreeing 2 cx contract & reimb the remainder of Aug. However, this didnt happen & thus led 2 my neg perspctv. 2. Im aware ur website had issues, as that is something I highlighted in my rvw. Not sure how my current trnr (Shaun T) can explain why ur website had issues? Ur correct in ur stmt "our staff may not have been entirely accurate". Since site has been down 4 awhile, cant remember all the peeps who were pictured but not actually there. Believe a few of them might have been Felicia, Erik, Kristen, Michelle & Alicia (Note: May b off w/ names b/c been so long, but I dont recall seeing trnrs). 3. In re 2 my stmt "He helped me achieve my goals w/out drugs/injections". In no way was I insinuating anything AZP does aligns w/ that. I was simply making a stmt (1st Amd Rght) that I did whole diet/exercise w/out HCG or B12 injections! I read up on bikini pro prior 2 contacting u & was upfront w/my trnr that I wanted 2 do this all natural. I never in any way made comment in rvw that AZP employees use/endorse any drugs. In re 2 the trnr telling her client 2 spry Windex on cake so she wouldnt pull it out of the garbage & eat it, this was NOT taken out of context, nor was I misunderstd. I have no hearing prob. And yes ur correct, this is a bold stmt...ON BEHALF OF UR EMPLOYEE! I was disgusted & appalled; shaped my overall perception of facility. My rvw was based on facts, not hearsay, as I actually heard it w/my own ears. Hearsay is when u hear stuff thru 3rd party. Agree in that u should not take comments like this lightly. This 1 time I caught my old dog eating garbage from my neighbors toppled over can & then she got sick, so this is no matter 2 take lightly. (In no way making an accusation or insinuating my dog had eaten cake sprayed w/ Windex). 4. Clean-Glad 2 hear u clean equipment "midday, @ the end of day [&] throughout the day." I must have missed every single 1 of those cleanings in the 10 wks I was there. Now thats an anomaly! 5. Equip-The piece of equipment was out of service 4 the 10 wks I was training. Theres really not much else 2 discuss on this...ur correct in ur confrmtion that it was down 4 several wks. Have 2 say Im SHOCKED @ reading ur response. U completely overlooked pstvs & honed in on negs. 2 boot, u tried 2 twist my negs as "assumptns, insinuatns, or misundrstandngs". If Im disappointed in smthng then I should b able 2 share! Sad 2 hear u think Ive had a "change of heart" from some prior postn I never discussed w/u; unsettled that u "can definitely assume" as 2 why u believe my postn chngd on AZP from a prior postn, since Ive never expressed any postn of AZP w/u'
