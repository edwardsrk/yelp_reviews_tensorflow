b"I'm really not a huge fan of this particular store. I've visited this store three times recently, different times in different days, and I swear to god the same three employees were working. My most recent trip here really disappointed me, to the point that I probably will stick to a department store from here on out. I walked in with only one thing on my mind that I needed and when I found it became frustrated. There was no price tag to tell me how much I was about to pay. Of course there are none of those scanner things to find out either. So the next course of action was to go up front and ask for a price check. When I got up front one of the employees was already at the register ten minutes into what I assume was the world's worst return. As I looked around, employee number two was busy at the copy center. And to too it off, employee number three was standing at the next register ignoring the line forming behind the return.  I waited for another 15 minutes before the return was done and then had another customer in front of me. By that point I was frustrated enough to just buy the item instead of ask for the price. I wouldn't have been so frustrated and angry by the time I had left if it weren't for the lack of attention by the employees. It's really irksome when they act all smug. Relax there buddy, I did my time in retail, but I knew when to get out of retail and I can tell you it wasn't in my thirties."
