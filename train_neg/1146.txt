b'So I\'m providing an update for my poor review on Trump International Hotel. They still suck in my opinion however there is FINALLY closure to all the drama. My boyfriend was sweet enough to find another number to call besides the one the Hotel told us to call and finally got someone else to talk to. We explained to the guy on the phone how we were ignored for TWO MONTHS and not one person has contacted us nor returned our messages and e-mails. He sent us a check for the exact amount of my new flat iron (which I originally had paid way more for the first one). We got it a week later than when he said we would get it. We also contacted the BBB and complained to them about the situation. Apparently the guy who never returned our calls or e-mails before told the BBB that he could never reach us. WHAT A LIE! We never got any missed calls nor responses to the e-mails we sent to him! I\'m sad that they are just as much liars as they are thieves. Incredible. I\'m glad they finally did something and stopped wasting our time. I\'m disappointed that they never tried to go above and beyond expectations to live up to their so called "5 Star Hotel" rating. I would think they would try to make a good reputation for themselves...especially in this economy. Even if they offered us free nights at their hotel, I\'d refuse it in a heartbeat. Thank God it\'s over....I now feel like I can breathe.'
