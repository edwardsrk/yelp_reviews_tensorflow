b"OK maybe I was overly optimistic about the hype of this place, but it wasn't that great.  There was a block long line outside on a Sunday morning to get a table for breakfast.  They were definitely efficient and had great service.  A lot of the breakfast menu items looked like they belonged on a dessert or ice cream parlor menu, rather than a diner. I had huevos rancheros.  The crumbled chorizo was salty enough to choke a horse and there was a lot of it, I wouldn't recommend it.  Another person with us had the breakfast burrito, which he said was overly filled with mismatched odds and ends.  He took the half he couldn't eat there and finished it later.  Our other companion had something else in a burrito and took half of that home also. In my opinion Deluca's needs to focus more on quality and less on quantity.  Maybe the pancakes and waffles are better, but we didn't have them."
