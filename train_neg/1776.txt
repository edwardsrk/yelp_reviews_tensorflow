b'Took and out-of-town friend for dinner @7pm before a night out in Plaza Midwood. We were seated quickly at a patio table. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, and watched others be seated, served beverages, and orders taken. I left our table, found the hostess and asked if we had a server. She responded "He got held up but he\'s coming." We waited, and waited, and waited. The hostess finally came over and took our beverage orders. We waited, and waited, and watched as the other (later seated) tables received their food orders. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Our server finally arrived with our drinks and said "Are you ready?" No apology or acknowledgement of the long wait. My friend asked for fried chicken and was bluntly told "We\'re out of chicken." I stated "Yes, we\'re ready. Ready to eat somewhere else." The server seemed dumbfounded and clueless as to why. We left. Absolutely horrible service this evening.'
