b"Stopped in for breakfast and ordered a waffle with I'm  candied bacon. Yum! My husband ordered a two egg breakfast. The service was awesome, but the food was just okay. I had to return the waffle to be cooked longer, but it had good flavor.  One piece of bacon was rubbery, the second too crisp (microwaved?) and the potatoes were hard and crunchy. Don't know if we will come back, but I'm sure they will improve with time."
