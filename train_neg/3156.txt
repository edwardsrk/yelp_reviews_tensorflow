b'I am SADDENED. I have gone to this Safeway for 14 years, I have witnessed changes, I\'m a "regular".  I\'ve never done ALL of my shopping here, but it\'s my go-to place when I need something fast. But I\'m quite literally here 3 times a week. No MORE.They\'ve changed it. I was worried about the business model with the Albertson\'s/Haggen\'s takeover, how would "our store" be affected. Well....it\'s been affected. LIGHTS LIGHTS, everywhere there\'s lights! My organic section has been mixed in! The shelving is sky high! It\'s HORRIBLE. It\'s like a Wal-mart. I LOATHE Wal-mart. It looks identical to Albertson\'s...I LOATHE Albertson\'s too. I\'ll never go back again. Safeway has officially lost my business to Sprouts, & Fresh & Easy.'
