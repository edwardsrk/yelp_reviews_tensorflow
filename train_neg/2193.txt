b"The positive reviews here clearly came from family or friends that work here. I used a groupon (or something similar) for cut and color and firstly could not find the salon in the unlabeled room in the hallway of rented salon rooms. I had to go door to door asking for them, which was embarrassing enough. Then I was told that color would be extra for my longer hair (which make sense). I ended up declining the hair color part for the added $$ reason, and just asked for the haircut man to make it look nice without cutting too much off. In the end he took about an inch off at the ends, no layering, no cutting to creating a style at all. I literally could have done the same thing in 5 minutes with a pair of kitchen scissors. To be fair I could have been a lot more aggressive to get what I wanted, i.e. exclaiming that I would not pay for extra color as it was not written in the details of the coupon, demanding that the man cut my hair into an actual style, etc, but I should not have to. That's not the kind of person I am, and if this is the kind of place that requires you to do that then I will not be back and would not recommend to anyone."
