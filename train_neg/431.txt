b'It used to be a decent location, not any more. Staff likes to argue a lot with guests, steamroom is constantly broken, sauna is all over the place - hot one day, cold the other. Showerheads are being replaced with the most horrible ones, barely a leak on your head, not even strong enough to remove the soap. Oh, yeah, and they threaten members with "termination" in case if showerheads are removed, which, as you might guess, happens a lot and for a good reason. I guess they think they can win the war against their own customers? I hope they will be able to enjoy the spoils :)'
