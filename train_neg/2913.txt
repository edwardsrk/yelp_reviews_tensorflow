b"Unfortunately, I have to post an updated review for this Fausto's. The original was five stars, but this location has gone downhill the past year or so. The first thing is that they used to have three delicious salsas that I used for every meal. They were great. However, those are no more. Now there are only two salsas that are both pretty bad. Tonight they were so runny I couldn't even get any to stay on my chips. Sad!To make this issue more pressing, the entrees seem to have lost all flavor and I have no delectable salsa to mask that fact. I had enchiladas and a taco and both were incredibly bland. This used to be a place I'd bring friends from out of town to try and now I think I may have just made my last visit. I just hope management reads this and fixes things because I saw other reviewers stating the same thing."
