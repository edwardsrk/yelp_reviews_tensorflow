b"Had a tech come out to check my unit under my home warranty. Looked at unit and said fan was installed wrong. My claim was denied. I tried to talk to tech though my wife And he wouldn't get on the phone. Trying to get unit fixed cause I have a 1 year old in the house. She had to put on speaker phone for him to tell me I needed a whole new unit cause it would be to much to repair. I called and spoke to John who told me that he didn't fully diagnose unit cause warranty denied claim. Also told me it was denied cause my plan came active Sunday and they where called on the Monday after. After talking to warranty company and we both called join with no response I called from home number and answered first time. Seems if it ain't cash customer service sucks. $95 later a new fan unit works fine."
