b"Really really Americanized Chinese food. The portions are really large though, you can definitely share with someone. I was really surprised at the quality and taste for a restaurant at Cesar's. I would think that there are so many Asians at Las Vegas now that they would go for a more authentic taste. The decor is also really trippy and confused me whenever I looked around. It was too detailed to the point of looking really tacky."
