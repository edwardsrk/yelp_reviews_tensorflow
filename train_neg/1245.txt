b"Really disappointed by the service. Called in and said we have 10 people coming in and asked for a reservation. They took our name. We drove from another angry crab to come here to find out that they don't have our name nor do they take reservations over the phone. Why then even ask our name? The hostesses didn't try to help. Not sure how they do business here but this isn't the right way."
