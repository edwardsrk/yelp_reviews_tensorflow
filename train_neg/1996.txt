b"It has been hit or miss with this location but they missed the mark with me for the last time. I purchased a pick a couple of months ago only to have it break. I took it back to exchange it and the lady at the returns desk wouldn't exchange it. I get that they no longer carry the one I had but give me something for an exchange. The sales associate tried really hard to get her to look it up online but she wouldn't budge. I left the pick there (a piece of junk) and went to Lowes. I will no longer spend any money at Home Depot."
