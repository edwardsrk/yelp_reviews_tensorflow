b"Had the escargot and rib eye steak. The escargot was okay, but it didn't seem like too much effort was put into it. The real disappointment was in the steak. It was a bit too overcooked and the outside was really burnt. I don't know about you, but I would rather prefer my steak without a black crust that leaks into every bite and ruins the flavour of the meat. They had a 3 beer selection."
