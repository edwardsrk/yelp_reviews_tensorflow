b'We went there cuz was recommended on one of the food shows.  Aside from alot of food, I was really not impressed.  Was just so much and flavor got all mixed together.  Very good service.  But will also cause a heart attack if go too often.  And we also got a mango drink.  Was in this hug glass.  But too sweet for my taste bud.'
