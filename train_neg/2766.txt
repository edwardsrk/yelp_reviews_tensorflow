b"Just ok. Had the fried shrimp, below average same with French fries. The vegetable mix was decent. My husband had the stuffed pork chop, mashed potatoes and gravy. He gave it all a thumbs up. I took a taste of the potatoes and are not fresh but I'm a fan of the box stuff so I agreed they were good. The service was good but it's doubtful that we'll be back"
