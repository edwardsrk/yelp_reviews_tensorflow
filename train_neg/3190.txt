b"Not impressed.  Waiter kept disappearing, bread was about a week old and eggplant parm was gross.  Manager took it off lithe bill but still we won't be going back.  Manager nice and trying hard but not worth it.  Took 35 minutes to get our check, pay our bill and get the heck  out!   Who has that kind of time?"
