b"I was a fan of this place before they moved but the new location is very tiny and they've done away with a lot of the tasty sugar free treats I used to love. Now there's only a tiny section of pre-made and packaged SF sweets. I went in a couple of days ago and left. Nothing very appealing. A huge bummer!"
