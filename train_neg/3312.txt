b"Horrible, horrible service. And this is with the restaurant half empty. I came for a 7:45pm dinner with a group of about 12. There was another group of the same size seated near us who seemed to receive better service in some areas. We started out ordering drinks and appetizers about 15 minute after being seated. Our drinks weren't delivered for 25 minutes, and the appetizers nearly 10 minutes after that. Beverages really should not take that long! We had requested our server a few times in between this time frame and he didn't appear to take our entree order until 8:45. We were missing one appetizer and had to continually remind him as well. The entrees finally arrived about 35 minutes later, and the missing appetizer after that. Kindly, they at least removed that appetizer from the bill. Receiving the bill was another long wait, but we were able to use the Yelp check-in of 10% off which we had to remind our server of twice. The saving grace was the food. I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken. This was a succulent boneless breast of chicken with a wing attached, served atop wilted spinach and creamy red quinoa. On top of all of this was a marsala mushroom sauce. The dish had a ton of flavor and the creamy red quinoa was really the star for me. The mushrooms and wilted spinach balanced out the creaminess of the other elements. I wanted to like this restaurant because we all enjoyed our food. But I honestly would not come back because we spent over 2 hours here, most of it waiting around."
