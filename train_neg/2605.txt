b"Ok went Saturday at lunch time not to busy . We were seated quickly. That's when it all went wrong. The waitress was to busy talking to get our drink orders we waited about 8 minutes for her to quit talking to another employee to come over. We did get our drinks waited another 10 minutes  for her to come back and get our order. Everyone around us was given bread we had to ask twice before she remembered to bring it. Someone else brought out the food . It was good. But never got a refill or did she check to see of we needed anything else . Then when we she brought the check we ask about dessert she said u want it Togo . We said no then she was like oh ok . Then she dropped food on the floor and just kicked it out of the was hoping someone else would pick it up. Spook with manager on the way out he apologized."
