b"I wish I could pick zero stars.....     So dirty...the bathroom floor had hair, hair, and more hair... I did try wiping some up with a wash cloth, but without a vacuum, mop, and bucket, forget it...there was no helping this place. The bottoms of our feet were filthy just from walking back and forth between the bathroom and the bed.      We folded down the quilt, so it was on the bed, but wouldn't touch us, as it looked dirty. (At least it didn't have yellow pee stains, like the sheets on our friends bed, in a room on the first floor!)     There were 2 bars of soap, no shampoo, no blow dryer. We got 2 towels and 3 wash cloths for a 2 night stay. Our bed was not made, after we were gone all day, and no clean towels for night #2.      The smell was, well I can't even explain it. Maybe something had rotted in there?  That is what it reminded me of.      I don't expect much for $100 a night, but I do expect a clean room.      I went and spoke to management, but was not offered any type of compensation. The new GM offered to get someone to come and clean up, but my husband was already in bed, as he was not feeling well. The girls in the office, Stephanie in particular, were very nice.      We would have left, but couldn't get another room, in the area that we needed to be close to for those particular days."
