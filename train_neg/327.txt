b'The sales team (including the security guard) was not so friendly or helpful. I had to pull my car up to unload my cart (because you can\'t take the cart out of the store) and not one of them helped to watch my cart. A lady who stood by said that she would watch it for me. As soon as I unloaded my bags, the manager and security were quick to take the cart away without a "bye" "merry Christmas", "happy holidays", nothing. This place may have great items but watch out for customer service.....it sucks!'
