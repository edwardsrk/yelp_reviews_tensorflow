b"I'm very disappointed with this restaurant. I called to make a reservation and when we arrived, there was no table available.  We were seated by the bar, and changed to a table after we ordered the drinks.Our waitress messed our orders; she forgot to place half of the order, and she brought an appetizer to our table. The food took a long time to arrive. One of our friends had ordered black bean instead of the beans with pork, and her order did not arrive as she had asked.  The waiter stated that she would bring the black beans, but she never did.  At the end, my friend asked to have the black beans to go. I read all of the review prior to making the reservation, and I had high expectations for this restaurant. The food was very good and the appetizers were a must; however, customer services must be a priority for this restaurant. The waitress seemed to be annoyed with us and barely came to our table."
