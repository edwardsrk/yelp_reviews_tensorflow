b"Visited here on 10-22-16, a busy Saturday night at Westgate.  We were seated almost immediately.  Server was fine.  My disappointment was with the margherita pizza, usually one of our favorites.  I've never had a margherita pizza like this.  Instead of thin, succulent slices of red tomatoes, halves of cherry tomatoes were dropped on the pie!  And not too many of those, either.  Instead of chiffonaded basil, or chopped basil, sprinkled across the pie, one large leaf was placed in the middle of each slice.  I had to tear each leaf into pieces by hand in order to properly distribute them across each piece so I could get that wonderful basil flavor in each bite.  The sauce was bland, more sweet like Oreganos rather than a real Italian taste.  The crust was okay.  Upon a return to Westgate Entertainment Center we'll be looking for another place to spend our food dollars."
