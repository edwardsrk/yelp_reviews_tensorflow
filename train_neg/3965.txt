b"Ridiculously expensive bagels (7$ for a bagel? Come on!), but if you forget about the price and the fact that for that price they are extremely small, these bagels taste good. Let's face it: just across the border, bagels are bigger, tastier and MUCH cheaper, esp. taking into account the current exchange rate.And it's cash only. Very bad."
