b'if i could give them zero stars i absolutely would.   i closed my personal and business accounts after 13 years   Bad service. Understaffed.  Sad to see a formerly good bank in decline.   Stay away from here unless you enjoy long wait times  corporate red tape and frustration.   Last and final visit i wanted to get 1000 cash and there was one clerk. 1 person in line ahead of me and it took 23 minutes.  ridiculous   Bofa. you need help. fast.'
