b"I'm so disappointed with Brake Masters. Makes me think of all the times I trusted them with my car how much stuff I paid for that I didn't really need and may have not even been replaced. I arrived on Wednesday to have my front brakes replaced since my warranty is through their company. The guy comes out with a 450$ list of items, and also told me that I had not had my brakes done in over a year. Which is a lie as I have all my reciepts. He then tells me i need left caliber replaced, rotors replaced, clean and adjust on back, and brake system flush. Red flag if my brakes haven't been changed in a year why would I only need a clean and adjustment on the back? Mmmmhhhhh when i told him to put it back together he offered to take 50$ off. Now it's Friday i took my car to Honda for inspection. An hour later I'm taken inside shop for them to show me concerns with my car...caliber needed to be greased not replaced nothing wrong with rotors shiny and clean as if they had been taken out of box....brakes needed to be replaced..duuhi knew that thats why i took it in to ger warranty honoredas i have been doing for past 3yrs or so. I will never patronize another brake master as long as i live..you have suckered me out of more than enough money.Honda replaced brakes and replaced valve cover all for 175$. Such a weaked world we live in with so many dishonest people.. Shame on you brake masters..."
