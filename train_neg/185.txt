b'I was also scammed in exactly the same way described as Faith!! Unbelievable! I feel like an idiot!  The sales girl pretends she sees the Beverly Hills Dermatologist who developed the product walking by and she asks him to consult. He pulls out all of these little lights and meters and tells you how Susan Sarandon, Mike Tyson And Gov Browns wife are all his customers among hundreds of other stars and reads emails from all his satisfied customers. I googled him when I got home and there is no such person! He says he is Mica. The most elaborate scheme you will ever see. BEWARE!'
