b"I was really excited to try this new place since it's walking distance from home and there isn't a whole lot to choose from in the Tramonto community! I was sooo disappointed especially for the prices! My rice was chewy on the outside and crunchy in the middle. When I called and complained they didn't offer to refund my meal or even give me some sort of freebie or discount! For a new business I found this strange.They seem like the type of place that will close within the 1st year and re-open with a new name."
