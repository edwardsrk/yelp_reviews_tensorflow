b"When done properly the food is not bad but unfortunately,  the pig mac was raw in the middle.  Raw beef okay but raw pork not okay.  The reason for the one star was more to the service of this place.  Our server did not apologies about the raw food and feel annoyed that she has to return back to the kitchen.  Her attitude as the server was just not good. I didn't get a new burger until I requested for the second time."
