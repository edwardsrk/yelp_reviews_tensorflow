b"I'm British so I have been to my fair share of pubs and this is an utter joke! The menu is a relic of 70s greeb fare that would even make a Wetherspoon's look gourmet. The barmaids look utterly silly in their outfits and the d\xc3\xa9cor is absolutely hilarious! Don't fool yourself for a moment if you consider this a cultural experience. It's just another Las Vegas gimmick out for your quid (money)!"
