b'I stopped for dinner with my daughter. When we were seated it was over ten minutes before I had to ask a manager to send a server over. Many of the servers were standing in the kitchen and saw us sit down but no one came over. After our food came out, after a pretty long wait time, the server did not come back to check on us for a while and it took forever to finally get the check and leave. I have been there before and the food is alright but the service killed it for me. I wont be going back there anytime soon.'
