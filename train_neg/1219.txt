b"This the worst flower place that I've ever encountered. The flowers they sent were not at all as pictured. When I called to get a replacement bouquet they were so rude it was astonishing. Got yelled at on the phone for not being happy with the bouquet. Expensive. Rude. Go anywhere but here. They need to be put out of business."
