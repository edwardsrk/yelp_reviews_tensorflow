b"I came here with my friend when we were visiting Pittsburgh. We were lucky enough to come here on the free Sunday they had it open instead on an admission day where you have to apparently pay $20 per person. This would have so not been worth it. I was extremely disappointed after all the talk I heard about it with friends. It was something I found a bit weird. I can appreciate modern art, but I couldn't board this train. If you are into weird art, this is the place to be."
