b"I wish we had read the reviews before coming here. It was the worst breakfast we've ever had in a restaurant (we go out almost every day for breakfast), and 1 star is really more than they deserve. I understand they are in a tourist area, but prices are close to what you'd pay at a fancy downtown hotel: 2 eggs, toast and coffee came to $16.49 per person plus tax and tip. It's hard to screw up a fried egg, but they did. Over easy came out with crunchy brown edges and hard yolks. The bacon was tough, and the coffee, passable at best. Service was pretty much non-existent. Don't waste your time and money here, there are much better alternatives in the area."
