b"They sold us several pair of Lucchese boots at what seemed to be great prices, all the while lying to us and telling us that the prices were going up and they were brand new perfect boots, but they're factory defects!! They totally lied. They don't fit near as nicely as my other boots from Lucchese and they're not backed by the company in the same way as retail boots are. Not cool."
