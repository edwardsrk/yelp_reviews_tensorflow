b"Unbearably slow service. I won't return.  Food was fine, but there's lots of fine food around; waiting 25 minutes to pay your bill, or 15 minutes to get your water refilled is not a model for a successful restaurant. There seemed to be only one waiter in the entire restaurant for lunch. There was another maybe manager, who was more content to sit down with her laptop and walk around than see how the customers were doing."
