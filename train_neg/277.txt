b'Their standard excuse for everything.....we are undergoing renovation.  When it comes to having no working light switch in your room and the over head towel bar falling on your head in the shower that is NO EXCUSE.  These rooms should not even be rented out.   (Especially at $100 and $190 a night) In addition, there was no available hotel parking for hotel guests (not even valet parking) and the bell hop that was supposed to help us with our luggage (before driving the car  to Ballys to park) never showed up.  Try asking to speak to a hotel manager......after 10 minutes they are still on the phone (probably avoiding speaking to angry hotel guests).'
