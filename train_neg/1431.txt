b"I am an American home  shield customer, I requested service for central heating not working,  the issue was my thermostat, the guy replaced it with a cheaper version of  what I had, so I called ahs, to report the issue, the guy came out again,  told me that h re called the company and the secretary stated that I could have the broken thermostat, and he would leave me with no heat if I wasn't happy with the thermostat. He then proceeded to tell me, that he has a family to go to and that he cannot wait for me to call the company,  and I would have to pay him regardless if service.I am really upset that the warranty company would contract a company with such poor work ethic, I am proceedings to call BBB.I would not give this company any stars,"
