b"I don't live in CLE, but went there for an event and while I was there, decided to check out the mall (I had never heard anything about it until today so I had no previous expectations) When i first walked in i was impressed with the look of it. It really looked pretty. Once I started walking around, though, I was disappointed. As far as I noticed, there were only two clothing stores in the entire 3-Floor mall. Rainbow and VS, and rainbow looked dirty and dingy and I didn't even consider buying anything there. The only other decent, chain stores they had was foot locker, champs, and bath and body works/white barn, and journeyz (notice how most of these are shoe stores). There were no other stores that interested me. I didn't buy a single thing. The mall that I'm used to going to (Belden Villiage) while much smaller in size I think, has a much better store selection and coming to Tower City really made me appreciate my mall much more than I did before. I left with a question in mind. How do you have a whole mall and no clothing stores? I feel like that's an important thing."
