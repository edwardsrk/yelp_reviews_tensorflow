b"We waited over an hour for an omelette and bacon.  The cook came out and said she hadn't forgotten our order, but that they were out of eggs.  Not sure why the waitress didn't tell us that so we could have the option of changing our order.  Then, first bite into the omelette had a huge piece of egg shell.  We won't be coming back."
