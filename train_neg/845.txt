b"We went out of our way to stop at the new Sweet Republic this afternoon, super excited to try the ice cream we'd heard so many good things about. We ordered, had our ice cream in our hands, and when the cashier gave us our total ($11) I handed her a $100 bill to pay with. She handed it back to me and told me they did not have any change. I didn't have any other form of payment with me- we literally had to put our ice cream down on the counter and leave it there while the cashier told us that there wan't anything she could do, and if we couldn't pay another way we couldn't buy the ice cream. There aren't any signs posted anywhere that say they don't accept large bills. We made a choice to visit Sweet Republic and we were treated like it was our fault/problem that they didn't have change. Bummer."
