b'To the young lady working last night with no name tag on, speak up, speak clearly, do not walk away from a sick, tired costumer. If you were having a bad night, ok, but your behavior was unacceptable.The first girl was nice, still messed my insurance up, but it was fixed eventually by the girl previously mentioned, (good try at redeeming yourself.)Pharmacist - thanks for pointing out I was right about being allergic to the meds the urgent care prescribed. Good call.'
