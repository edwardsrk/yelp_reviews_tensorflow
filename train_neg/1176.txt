b"Absolutely terrible experience. We had a big group so I understand that large groups are tough for servers to manage but our server served half the table water and disappeared for half an hour. When the server came back she was incredibly arrogant and impatient with taking orders. The bar staff was no better and made us wait for another half hour because they apparently ran out of glasses. Given the fact that the restaurant was barely at half capacity for a Saturday night, I think the overall operations of this restaurant need a huge overhaul. I'm never going back here again and will try to make sure no one else makes the mistake of going here again."
