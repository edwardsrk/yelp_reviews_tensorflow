b'Very average. The people were nice but the food was average, I had the mongolian beef and so did my friend. Broccoli was cooked perfectly, the meat was a little too "pounded out" and fatty and had no real texture. The sauce was missing flavor. I think if they improved the sauce it would have been better, and of course the meat. I may try them one more time but likely will avoid.'
