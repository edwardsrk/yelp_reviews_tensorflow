b'Nothing like the food at Tapas 24 in Barcelona.We were at tapas 24 yesterday for Barcelona chef Carles Abellan.Service: Very poor. No water. The sommelier removed our glass of wine when empty without even offering another glass or bottle...(We had planned for another bottle but when we were able to talk to someone, we were done eating)Seems like the staff was inexperienced.Entire service was rushed as if they wanted us out for a specific time.(2nd service)Food: ok but expensive for what we had. Nothing fabulous. Paella extremely saltyAtmosphere: good! Nice restaurant.'
