b'Like the rest of Vegas..overrated ...the fries were cold...and did not have the taste of duck fat!   The service was rushed...they want to get you out to get the next sucker in your table.   The Mac and cheese was yucky..the Caesar salad was overdressed....and the stake was very salty and near raw!   Skip this place!  Not worth the price!'
