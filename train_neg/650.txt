b"We went here for a bachelorette night and got a private room. I called 5 times asking different questions and then when we got there they didn't follow through with what they told me. For example they said we could do separate checks if we let them know ahead of time and then our waitress said no. I asked about the pole and told them that's what we were excited for when we got there they had remodeled the private rooms and there was no pole (they never told us this) the room was small and stuffy, our karaoke machine didn't work for probably 45 min of our 2 hour stay! Which we were paying $100 an hour for and our waitress was sooo rude the whole time. Never smiled would roll her eyes at us when we asked something!  I will NEVER return to this place."
