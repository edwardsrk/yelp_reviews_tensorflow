b"Like I don't even know where to begin !!!! We have gone here so many time and was satisfied with everything mind you we have a 4 month baby girl. So tonight we where going to go see rough night that funny chick flick and yes I had my baby girl with me and they said I couldn't enter because I had a baby like wtf I'm a MOMMMMMY like you want me to just leave my baby behind UMM NO and my spouse and I where trying to just have a good night out and they fucked it up. Like it's almost a form of discrimination towards couple who have babies but still wanna have a good night out. Just to let y'all know before you decide to go there on a Tuesday date night DAY !!!!!"
