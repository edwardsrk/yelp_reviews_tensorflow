b'Well, we went here once before and I was really impressed.  My husband really likes another fast food Chinese place, but I am not a fan of fast food.  Teriyaki Madness is a blend of "fast" food and good quality food.  I was really impressed with the quality of the food!  We went back tonight for a second visit, and we waited about 25 minutes.  We saw some other people come and go with their orders.  I asked the cashier if they had forgotten our order.  She was very polite and said she was not sure.  After 45 minutes, I finally asked for a refund.  Again, the cashier was very pleasant and apologetic.  My problem is the person from the back who had to ring up our refund was sort of rude.  No apology.  I do not remember what she said, but I believe she was trying to blame the cashier for ringing up something incorrectly.  She seemed inconvenienced that we wanted a refund when in fact she should have apologized.  Not sure if we will go back.  Maybe we will call in our order.  I saw a few people came in and just got their order immediately.  Being new to Teriyaki Madness, we did not realize it was an option.  IF we go back, that will be the way to go!I\'d give one star, but the cashier was super friendly and we had a good experience the first time.'
