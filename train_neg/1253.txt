b"These guy's were at the Chandler Ostrich Festival 2010.My daughter wanted a smoked turkey leg, big belly's bbq were the only vendor that was selling smoked turkey legs. So I decided to go ahead and get one for her. I waited in line, paid for my order ($10 for one leg) and started waiting in another line...Little did I know that these people were accepting money for product that wasn't even cooked yet. 40 minutes later with about 30 people behind me, I finally got the leg. We walked to the stage at this event, took our seats and I noticed that my 11 year old daughter was barely even picking at it. I asked her why she wasn't eating and she gave me a lame excuse...Now my daughter is a healthy eater, but she also doesn't like to complain. (She also realized that we had waited almost an hour for the turkey to finish cooking and didn't want to be a pain)I decided to try some of it.It was moist, but it tasted awful. Sort of like a combination of raw egg and raw poultry. By this time I was pretty pissed, not only had I wasted 10 dollars on sub-standard meat, but also 45 minutes of my time!I really wanted to see the band that was playing since that was the main reason we went. (http://www.wartheband.com/home.html)After they were finished playing I took the leg back and they just blew me off as though I was trying to rip them off.The bottom line is that  these people cannot seem to handle large events or even maintain a consistent product. Keep that in mind the next time you have any remote urge to hire these people. Horrible food, horrible customer service, but they will gladly take your money."
