b"I've been to several spring training stadiums and this is my least favorite. The concourses are small and crowded, making it difficult to walk around. The space between the rows of seats felt smaller than usual. But the worst was the handicap access. The parking attendants could not direct us to handicap parking. The front of the stadium has a ton of stairs and the ramp is off to the side. I will say I thought the food was good and I appreciated several vegetarian options. But my family would not attend a game at this stadium again. There are other stadiums in the area that provide a much better experience."
