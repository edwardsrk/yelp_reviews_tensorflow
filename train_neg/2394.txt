b'Paid $20 each to see Ron Pope last night.  Went early to get some food.  Heard good things about it.   Got table.  No one came to help us so we went to the bar and got our own beers.   Finally waitress came over and we ordered some tacos.   I ordered another beer.  After 20 minutes no beer,,,,so I went to the bar and got another.  After 30 minutes we asked about the food, she said kitchen was busy.  After 40 minutes and seeing 30 people eat that had gotten there after us, we asked her what was up.  She finally went to the kitchen and came back and said oops something happened.   She promised the tacos in 5 minutes.   20 minutes later, a full hour after we ordered the tacos, we split.   Never even saw the concert.   Cool place.   Liked the trivia and vibe but service was Ridic.'
