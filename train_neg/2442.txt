b"This tropical smoothie definitely needs some work. The store is completely deserted, including the employees! I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone came out from the back. The employee that did take my order definitely did not want to be here. Even though the store is completely empty my smoothie also took a while to finally come out, along with 3 hidden employees I might add. What they are working on besides hiding out in the back is beyond me. The smoothie... leaves little to be desired. The smoothie is very watery and doesn't taste fruity at all. Honestly tastes like I'm drinking crushed ice. Please take this opportunity to train your employees or the place might stay this empty indefinitely. 2 stars for having ice cold a/c in this blazing heat."
