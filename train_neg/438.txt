b"There is absolutely no need to visit this place. Dry, from the box-like taco shells housed tasteless meat, uninspired toppings and ended up being probably the worst taco I've had in my life.The nachos were thoroughly bad. Gross cheese, and the chips were round! What self respecting Mexican serves round tortilla chips?The ordering process was painfully inefficient and the staff were not the friendliest.Why this place thought they could compete with all the solid places on Queen St. to get a taco is beyond me. I give them 6 months and they'll be gone."
