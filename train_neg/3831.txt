b"I really enjoy the taste of matcha. I've been here only a few times and I think it's not as great as other people said.The goods: Really nice matcha taste and the interior is very pleasant with a lot of tea/Japanese decor. The staff is very friendly as well ( :The bads: I wish the flavour of matcha was stronger in the Tsujiri latte. It just tasted like plain milk to me. In addition, I think the portions for the soft-serve is very small for the price. They don't fill the insides of the cup/cone (as in they swirl the soft-serve towards the edges so it looks bigger than it is) and the middle was always empty which was disappointing ) : Maybe it was just the times I went but our soft-serves were never as big as the ones from everyone's pictures.Overall, you should try out this place at least once and enjoy the cosy environment."
