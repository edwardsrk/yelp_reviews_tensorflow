b"Every large university area I have been to seems to have a hot dog shop near it. Some are great others are not, but one this is true is that they all offer cheap eats. In this case we have an oddity, a fairly expensive hot dog stand offering poor food.OK I know this place is an iconic Pittsburgh institution but the food is sorely lacking. First of all if you want a dog or two and some fires you have to stand in two different lines, so either you dogs get cold or your fries get gold while you are waiting for the other. LAME.Second complaint the dogs are cooked on a griddle where they sit and sit and sit drying out, my idea of a hot dog is not a semi-blackened piece of jerky meat, it should he juicy and succulent. It's too bad that they ruin their dogs this way, getting past the dried out part the taste of this dog would have been pretty good if prepared correctlyThird complaint the buns - what is with east coast people and their feeble wonder bread buns they serve hot dogs on? You have two main components: The dog and the bun, both of these should be of high quality if you skimp on either one you will have a sub-par hot dog.Fourth complaint - complete and utter disorganization of ordering, waiting and paying for your dog. You would think that some genius would be able to how to figure out and streamline the process to make it more efficient. Also hire some employees with some personality the three that were there seemed to hate their jobs.Fifth complaint - $ 7.75 for two regular dogs (this was a special too) and a drink is ridiculous, throw in fries and I'm over $10 bucks - that's highway robbery for what was served.FOOD 1.5 stars - it's hard to screw up a hot dog but they did itSERVICE 1.5 stars - I think if anybody smiled their face would have fallen off.VALUE 1 star, OK I have to give at least 1 star according to yelp otherwise this would be zero.Total: 1.33 starsFor hot dogs in PA both The Frantuary (2 stars) has won in the toppings contest while Wiener World (3 stars) has the best dogs and buns."
