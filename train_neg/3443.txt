b'Quick review:  Food:  delicious.  Service:  Poor.  SLOW.  Five of us tried Lucille today for lunch.  We were seated quickly and served our drinks relatively quickly.  But, we waited well over an hour and a half for our food.  Lunch should not take nearly two hours.  Patrons will not go here for lunch if they think it will take more than an hour.  Our wait staff seemed inexperienced.  PLEASE train the staff before you open.Our party had both the Detroit panned pizza and the Neapolitan wood-fired pizza, the lunch pizza.  We all enjoyed the salad that comes with the lunch.   Not quite to the standards of Pizza Brutta, but very good.   Pizza and a very good salad for $10 is a great value.  I know the place is new and I will try again.   But, service needs major improvement.  I really want to like this place.'
