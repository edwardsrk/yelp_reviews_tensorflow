b"Beer selection is good. Burger had no flavor. Ordered the peach and prociutto salad. Had 3 small pieces of prociutto and they were the un-edible fatty parts (couldn't chew it). Told the waitress who said the manager told her it was fat (duh!). Service was good.Not worth the $60 bill. Too bad was hoping this place would be good."
