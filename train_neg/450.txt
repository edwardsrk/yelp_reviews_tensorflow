b'Food was nasty, burger was dry and French fry\'s were soggy, that was just some of the food. We were charged twice for our meal. Took the server and manager 3 try\'s to get the bill changed. The manager actually asked me if I wanted to fight all the servers because one of the male servers was staring at me like a watch dog that wanted to fight when I went outside to wait for the manager to figure out her "computer" malfunction. "Just call corporate if you have a problem" is what I was told by the server that was standing with the manager outside as I was finally paying for our lousy overpriced meal. So that is what I will do, and I will be sure to mention that the manager asked, "what are you going to fight all the servers?" Professional management skills shined through as she told that same male who was obviously watching me as if I would bail on a measly $60 check to just go away like she was his mom! Never again!'
