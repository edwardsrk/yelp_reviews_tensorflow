b"I have invested so much time trying to get satisfaction from the Geek Squad that I am exhausted and won't even give all the many reasons why you should NOT USE THEM.  Suffice it to say, they misrepresent their contract (locked in for at least 6 months -- I was never told that), plus the incidental work they did for me was completely messed up and I wished I done it myself.  BAD BUSINESS.  NEVER USE THEM."
