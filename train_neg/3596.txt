b"So everybody is pretty much well aware that this Vons isn't located in the best location. That we can deal with. We can secure our things and make sure that we don't leave our valuables unattended and visible in the car. But there's a point that dissuades you from shopping here when almost every time, someone would approach you either on the way to the store or on the way to ask for some change. I understand that sometimes situations happen and you might need cash for gas but after hearing that same story in the same parking lot over five times, I'm pretty sure it's time for either people to add gas before heading grocery shopping OR it's time for Vons to instill some better security in their parking lot.Service, I mean, eh. They try their best. They accommodate long lines by opening another line when it gets too long. They assist you in finding your items. The typical. Items-wise, they pretty much have the basics of what you need (food, drinks, healthy & beauty, cleaning, and alcohol). However, I would suggest just going to the one on Twain."
