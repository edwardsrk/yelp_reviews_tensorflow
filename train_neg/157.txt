b'Very very unprofessional place. A few weeks back I got my hair cut by Mustafa and It was wonderful as he gave me exactly what I wanted. Came back again yesterday to get a bang trimming and they were clearly NOT busy at all but I heard the receptionist say "give her a few more minutes" and we waited like 20-30 minutes. The hair stylist I had was exceptionally rude for no reason and cut my bangs way shorter than I\'ve asked and even handed me the straightener and told me to straighten it myself if I wanted to so bad. Like ? Are you kidding me? Bang trimming was free but I would\'ve been happy to pay if they were to even remotely try to do a good job. Receptionist was always rude to me no matter what as well. Never EVER coming back to this place. This place is a gamble and really a hit n miss with their service. I used to tell all my friends about this but I\'m telling everyone to NEVER come to this place again.'
