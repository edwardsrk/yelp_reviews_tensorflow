b'Best thing about this place - it was convenient to the shopping I needed to do at the Arboretum!Food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry.  Onion rings were awful - crunchy on the outside but mushy and wet (actually had onion "juice" or water run out after biting in to one) on the inside.Service was ok.  My only complaint is that the server left the check on the table before asking for dessert orders.  If it was a.) busy and b.) we appeared to be a business lunch (not likely - me and the parents) I would understand that move.  But the restaurant wasn\'t busy - worrysome at 12:30 pm on a Friday - and we obviously were not a business group.Thought it was overpriced too - almost $9 for a dry tasteless burger with a side of onion rings and $5 for a chocolate malt?  Would not rate it a great value.Fake 50\'s decor and kitsch - primary reasons for visiting here.  Need more really GOOD casual (not fast food) eateries near the Arboretum.'
