b"Let me start off by saying the food is just okay, however the service leaves little to the imagination. A group of 4 of us were seated 40 minutes after putting our name on the list- and were informed they were full on the inside and no longer seating people there. After ordering and waiting for 45 minutes, we came inside due to impromptu rain which soaked the seats we were sitting on. Miraculously, they were able to find a booth upstairs after one of the people in our party put up a fuss. Unless you're willing to wait an insane amount of time for average tacos, go elsewhere. And my octopus tacos were burnt!"
