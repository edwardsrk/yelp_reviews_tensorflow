b'We went for dinner on a Monday night. We waited over an hour for the sushi. We only received half of our order. Never received our drinks.  When we complained to the manager he said that server would not be there much longer and he would take off the food we never received and a glass of wine.  Terrible service and customer service. Will never go back.'
