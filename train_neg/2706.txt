b'I would describe myself as a very experienced, and frequent Chipotle visitor. My husband and I usually drive to our normal and well known location (Rural and baseline) but when we want to make a quick stop, or are close to our home, we visit the Mcclintock and Elliot store. This store is sad. The people are never upbeat or  friendly. This most recent experience was the worst one yet. We entered the doors, no warming welcome, we approached the glass, no hello, a rude and annoyed "what can I get for you" We often order just rice and fajitas (2 sides) and that is all, occasionally we order chips and salsa. we said we would like chips and salsa and named the salsa\'s, they got them without question. Two bags of chips, salsa and guac and two sides should have been our order, instead they rang us up a veggie bowl, chips and salsa, and chips and guac. As frequent visitors, i knew this was incorrect. So i said, actually this is just two sides, not a veggie bowl. it is only rice and fajitas. The friendly male cashier was very nice and said im sorry and rang it in correctly. However, the female on Salsa looked at me, rolled her eyes and turned around to the female in a collared shirt, brown hair and glasses, and started talking. Assuming it was about what i had said. The manager then looked at me rolled her eyes as well and the continued to talk. Very rude to say the least. I am a customer in your restaurant and to make me feel like i need to leave as soon as possible because i did something that you didnt like is a very uneasy feeling. I usually dont say anything when these situations occur but i spoke to the cashier, telling him that he was the nicest person throughout our whole experience. This location is terrible. The have terrible customer service, everyone seems like they are miserable and that they hate their jobs.'
