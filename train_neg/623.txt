b"Be cautious about what the service advisor recommends. Before doing the work, definitely get a second opinion or you may pay hundreds to thousands of dollars unnecessarily. Here's our story. My wife and son took our Edge in for a routine oil change and next thing I know they are given a recommendation that ranged in the thousands of dollars. The service advisor made it sound like it was urgent and we would be taking a risk if the work was not done. I took my car to a trusted mechanic and he said none of the recommended work needed to be done right away and some not for a long time. After hearing this, I felt like the service person was just trying to make money through scare tactics. I have bought 3 cars from this facility and have done service through them since then but now I will not bring my cars back again and I will not buy another car from them because I don't trust their ethics any longer! I understand the need to let the customers know what could potentially be wrong but they should also be honest and add when they really need to be fixed to give the full picture. The advisors I worked with early on were honest and did not try to up sale me on things that needed to be done through scare tactics but just let me know the facts and when they could be done. Unfortunately they do not work there anymore. I wonder why?"
