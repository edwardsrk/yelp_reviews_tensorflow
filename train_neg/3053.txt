b"This was our 2nd visit to this location, the first after they just opened. We came in around 1:30 on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min. My wife and I decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza, we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good. As we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake, since we weren't sure we wanted to wait that long, we told her to make it a thin crust. She then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust!? So we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish.Over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving. After a couple of bites, we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was! I was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife! Not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it. We ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good. We both did not want any more! When our waitress came back, she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza. We may go back again but never will order that pizza again, yuck!"
