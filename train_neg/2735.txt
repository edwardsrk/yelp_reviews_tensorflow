b"Absolutely appalling customer service. I waited almost a half as hour to exchange a tool and EVERY one they had in stock was also broken. Complete garbage. The staff seems completely uninterested in long wait and lines. I watched other customers stand and wait equally long for tools from the back warehouse. If you go, don't be in a hurry and fully expect to return half of what you buy."
