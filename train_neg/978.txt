b"Very mediocre pizza. If you're stranded in the Brothers parking lot with a broken down car and you're really hungry, you'd be better off walking to the Circle K and getting a snack to tide you over til help arrives. To everyone who gave it lots of stars, you need to get out more and live a little...and eat better pizza."
