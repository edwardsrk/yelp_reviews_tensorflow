b"These people are thieves.  I don't go to the casino expecting to win.  But I asked an attendant to hold my machine while I went to the restroom.  They said they could.  I came back from the restroom to find no attendant and my $200 gone.  They said they'd help, then left me sitting at the machine for 2 hours.  I got the impression they were just waiting me out.  Absolutely awful experience.  I'd recommend taking a road trip before gambling here.  Unethical.  As an update, they left the information for me to contact them.  I did and never received a reply.  They do not care about their customers at all."
