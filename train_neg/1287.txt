b'Horrible hotel, power went out, no running water for hours, a/c didn\'t work well AT ALL, ice machines on top 10 floors(at least) not working, had to goto downstairs bar to get ice. "they don\'t deliver ice". Pool service was great tho. I won\'t stay here ever again and have stayed her a dozen times over the years.'
