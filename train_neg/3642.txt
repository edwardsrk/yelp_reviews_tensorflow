b'Their fees are astronomical.  Insanely high!!!  Even with the Yelp discount they extended I believe it was way too high.The billing department added some ambiguity to the bill by not being on top of it immediately.  Over 1.5 months later I received a call asking if they can charge my credit card for additional services (they feel was left off the first time).   I hate confrontation... I disagree with them completely... I agreed they could charge my card.  DISCUSS PRICING in detail before services...I give them two stars for their prompt service...  They arrived on time...They completed the job. I will NEVER use them again...'
