b'Poor service, waitress was snippy and rude. I have been in this restaurant numerous times with friends and family. Twice with people having a birthday. I brought my sister there because it was her birthday and from previous experience, I knew she would get a pancake treat if she wished. When I asked the waitress about this she said "well no one has ever asked me that before and no we don\'t do that."She then stated she went back and asked two managers and they "all" said no. If the policy changed then fine, the problem was the woman\'s rude demeanor. We said ok and continued with our breakfast. I was sad for my sister and was very displeased with the way the situation was handled. Food is ok. I can get "ok" food with amazing service at ANY breakfast spot in this city and will do so from now on. I brought a lot of business in this restaurant and will not do so any longer. Disappointed.'
