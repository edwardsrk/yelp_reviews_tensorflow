b'This place could be great, maybe even a top 10 "must stop for kids" in a what to do while in Old Town, or even Phoenix/Scottsdale . However, they have a way to go before they even make the top 50 list. There is a really bad smell as soon as you walk inside the door. The restrooms and general areas are not clean.  The food is average at best. I had the chili with cheese and onion. They gave me a "slice" of cheddar, it was strange, and the chili was 90%beans, no flavor. It\'s such a shame. The decor, if clean would be on spot. The theme is so cute, down to the menu. They need to shut down for a weekend, hire a professional chef to revamp the menu and clean the place from top to bottom.  So close, but yet so far!!!!!'
