b'Extremely bad service:WARNING!!! Do NOT eat here!Even though the service and food here were both below average, the worst has nothing to do with their bad food/service, but business ethics (the thing that keeps businesses from cheating their customers).This restaurant, my dear reader, has violated the key principle of doing business - they are cheaters:They put a couple of sales promotions on yelp to lure you in and spend money, but when it is time to pay, the servers stare at the yelp page i hold in my hand and have the guts to say: "sorry, we can not honor that..."Naturally, I asked: "why not? You put it on your yelp page, so i think you should honor it."This is the restaurant\'s response: "sorry, but we haven\'t done that for a while now.""Not for anybody?""Yeah...not for anybody."Well, that was the end of it.End of conversation.End of trust.Do you want to help stop this cheating restaurant\'s dirty practices?If yes, then please find your food elsewhere, in a better place, with way better ethics.Thank you.'
