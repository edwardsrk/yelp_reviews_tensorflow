b'Zombie Brunch: False Advertising We went with our kid and nieces expecting a Zombie Brunch, but the only Zombie-like thing was a couple of servers behind the bar wearing make up. There was no special decoration and no special items on the menu.  I checked on an old post about the Zombie Brunch from 2012, when there was a special menu and it certainly look more fun http://www.thedrake.ca/blog/2012/10/zombie-brunch-drake/  We live uptown and the only reason we went to The Drake was to have a Halloween experience we DID NOT have. We could have gone to any other restaurant since there was nothing special about this.'
