b'There is no way this place deserve a high raiting on yelpThis is the most unprofessional and disorganized range I ever been to. I gave it a chance as it was close my home but I really regret I didWe arrived and immediately put our names on a list, upon asking how long will it be, the lady behind the counter replied, 20 to 30 minutes. That\'s ok I\'ll wait a bit and see what happensI go and observe the range, only 7 spots, seems small but I\'ll deal with it. I see three lanes open up, range officer says over the radio, three lanes are open. 15 minutes go by, still no one in the lanes. The place is packed at this point.Other customers are getting irritated. I go back and ask how much longer, she tells me 25 minutes. Another customer starts yelling "there are three open lanes back there, what\'s the hold up" she replies that she didn\'t know, after I observed four radio transmissions stating three lanes are available and one range personnel coming to the counter to say three lanes are open.At this point, I had enough, got up and left and proceeded to range 702, where I started shooting within 5 minutes of arrival. Do yourself a favor, skip this place, unprofessional and a waste of time with a horrible set up'
