b"Terrible service. Mediocre food. We literally spent 2.5 hours here just trying to have lunch. It became a case of weighing how much time we had already invested vs. 'should we just get up and leave.' We should have left. By the time we were done, most of the nearby shops had closed. I don't know what took so long, as the sandwiches were on par with something a 5-year-old could have slapped together -- white bread, mayo, luncheon meat, iceberg lettuce. Our waitress  failed to bring salad dressing after two requests, so I went up front to get it myself. A bus girl said she would bring it. When she failed to, I went up front yet again and this time waited for her to bring it out of the kitchen. This experience has taught me to always check the yelp review first, not an hour into a bewilderingly bad experience."
