b'Due to the unprofessionalism of Alex at the Gilbert location, I\'ve decided to cancel my membership. My family member and I were served with cancellation papers on the floor in front of other patrons which was humiliating and unprofessional. I was told that I could not have my family member train me which we complied. We took turns on the machines and even did our bicep curls side by side. Into our next circuit a PT walked up and handled us papers and said "your membership has been cancelled at this club". How embarrassing! We tried to explain that we followed their rules, but Alex insisted that he and his trainers saw otherwise. How dishonest! We were told that we couldn\'t come back to his gym, and that our accounts were flagged. When I inquired whether my daughters membership would be impacted Alex said no. My husband and some friends encouraged me to cancel our family\'s account only to find out that Alex had cancelled my account and my daughter\'s. How Rude! She had nothing to do with this situation. I\'m only giving this review 2 stars because the Mgr at the Val Vista location was very understanding and sympathetic about the situation. I explained that I understand the policy, but as a paying customer I deserve respect.'
