b"Went there for 20 bags of mulch to neaten up the landscaping the day before Mother's Day.  Being right before Mother's Day, it was rather busy.  On the way into the store I see an employee and ask where do I go to buy mulch (thinking perhaps they have a cash register outside - they have at times in the past).  He says inside, and then pick it up outside.  So I pay inside and the cash register person flags a guy down and asks him to help me load mulch.  I go outside with my son and tell my son to wait by the guys at the mulch so I can bring the car over.  I drive over, we load up, and go.  All good.  Except, my 14 year old son tells me on the drive home that the guys at the mulch didn't know he was with me while I was driving over.  They were laughing and joking that I was too stupid to know how to buy mulch, dropping the F word about customers in general, etc.   So ok, maybe customers are stupid, but they also never checked my receipt, so perhaps this stupid customer made off with a bunch of free mulch?  That would be stupid too, huh?"
