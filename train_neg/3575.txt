b"I'd give this place 4 stars for food, but the service is just that bad. The owners grand- daughter is a grumpy b***h on the best days. The owners friend (french woman) is friendly but usually behind the grill. The owner herself is sweet as can be.The food is very good for the price. Be prepared to more or less have your food thrown on the table (once she knocked the creamer bowl off the table). For a local greasy spoon, it lacks the family-feel of a local cafe. Sad, because it's so damn convenient. Sad, because it could be so much better with just a smile.They don't take credit cards, so beware. There isn't an ATM anywhere close, either.While you're there, visit SandyAleksander across the street. You'll realise the difference between sh** and sweet customer service."
