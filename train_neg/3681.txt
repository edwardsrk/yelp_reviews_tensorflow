b'The name was changed from York to Cho but layout is pretty much the same. Overall I thought York was better with respect to the sushi (more fish & better selection), buffet was OK but I liked the York version better, used to love that u could get some interesting ice cream flavors out of the buckets and now they have middle school cups. Service has always been good and price has remained reasonable. I will probably NOT go back.'
