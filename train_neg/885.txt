b"Do Not Eat Here!! It smells like rotten eggs as you walk up and inside. They are not very friendly and do not cater to food allergies. The bathrooms are extremely dirty as well. They don't really understand English either. I ordered a quesadilla and my cheese wasn't even melted. Wow! Not a happy customer and they didn't even care!! Stay away from here everyone!"
