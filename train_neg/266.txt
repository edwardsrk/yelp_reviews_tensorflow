b"I do not know much about their services. Strange, I know, but let me explain.I made an appointment on a Monday for this location (which is a good 30 minutes away) for the following Friday. Even though I was not sure it was going to be open (Friday was the day before a holiday), they told me they were and confirmed my appointment. That Friday I drove to the location and waited for the doors to unlock so I could take care of my bothersome cavity. I waited. And waited. And waited. Yes, you get the point.Big surprise, they weren't open. Nobody had given me the courtesy to call, apologize for the scheduling mistake and reschedule. So instead of booking another dentist to take care of my increasingly painful cavity, I had to wait almost another week to get into a stellar dentist who confirms their appointments ahead of time and are very friendly.P.S. 4 days after the missed/accidental appointment I received a call/voicemail stating that they got my message and if I was interested in still obtaining their service I could call X phone #. No apology. I didn't expect champagne, catered breakfast and a red carpet as I walked into the office, but a simple apology for THEIR mistake would have saved my business and resulted in more referrals. Sorry Absolute Dental. Fail."
