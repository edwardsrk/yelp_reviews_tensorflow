b'This place could be good, but needs work. I ordered 1 roll, spicy salmon roll. Was made traditional but had just the salmon in the middle with sricha dabbed on outside, for a very American style sushi place this feels to me lazily made. (Salmon tasted fine)  their happy hour was $$. 2 rolls for $9.95. Ug where are the basic $3.50 California or spicy tuna.  I also ordered 1 salmon tuna nigiri, was ok not good quality. And I ordered tankostu ramen. The ramen and veggies were tasty and meat but the broth was boring. It had no flavor.  This place could be good. I hope in the future.'
