b"Plenty of chain restaurants and bars to keep people entertained for pre- or post- fun when going to the Jobing.com Arena or UoP Stadium. There is a spot on the west side of the City Center where all the scalpers hang out, off the sidewalk by the parking lot. We've gotten some good tickets pretty cheap from them.I like hanging out at one of the restaurants or bars after a game and wait out the traffic. The nearby Yardhouse is my personal fav for the selection of beers, don't expect any place in that area to have cheap drinks on a game day. I'm not sure about other days though."
