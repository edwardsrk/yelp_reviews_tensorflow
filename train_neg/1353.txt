b"I've never had a problem with any Yogurtini ever until today. I had to wait to pay for my Yogurtini for 5 minutes, received an apology and still had to pay full price for my half melted Yogurtini. Then as we're sitting there eating at the table the girl who was in the back for over 5 minutes was eating food in front of us with her fingers and then touching the spoons to put them away and then wiped her nose with her hand and continued to just work at the front with all the food."
