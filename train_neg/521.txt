b"Just visited this location and noticed they have a C in their health department audit. I personally can't eat at places like this. I've been working in the food Industry for 22 years and to receive a C score in a restaurant is because something is wrong besides the fact of dirtiness. Didn't eat and asked for my money back. A place like this doesn't deserve no star (s) but in order to post this comment I was forced to rated it with at least one star."
