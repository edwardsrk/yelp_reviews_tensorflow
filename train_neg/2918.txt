b'Mixed feelings about this place. Scheduling - I think it\'s wrong of a family practice to not have some same-day appointments. My husband and son were in a car accident and needed to follow up with their primary after being treated at UMC.  When I called for an appointment just in that same week, I was told the first available was in 3 weeks.  What????  After me hemming and hawwing, miraculously an appointment appears with Dr. Gardner for that coming Thursday.  A family practice needs to be responsive to the fact that most families can\'t predict their illnesses two weeks out.  Wait Times - the other reviews are correct.  You will wait, and wait, and wait.  I\'ve accepted this.  I think they overbook and it backfires.Dr. Forte - I only saw her once and she was actually very insightful with some issues my son was having.  I appreciated her candidness.Dr. Gardner - The first 5 minutes he was in the room, I thought he was just plain weird.  He didn\'t even introduce himself.  After awhile he grew on me a bit, but still not the greatest bedside manners.PA Joe - I think he\'s a jerk.  My husband sees him for regular check-up and thyroid meds,  I guess if you\'re an "easy" case he\'s okay.  After the car accident, his bedside manner was awful.  I had more questions and he just disappeared into another room - didn\'t even say goodbye or ask if we had any questions.Referrals - We have Teachers Health Trust and they\'ve actually been surprisingly quick with getting our referrals set up.Overall, I\'m not very impressed.  I think we\'ll shop new primary doctors in the near future.'
