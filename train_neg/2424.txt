b'Hate to say that I was not really impressed.  On the outside of the restaurant is a big sign that says "FUSION FOOD".  The place was also described as a typical Japanese cafe.  Have been to Japan three times and there is nothing that indicates a typical cafe except for a tiny place in Osaka that had curry and 5 other things on the menu.  I would recommend removing that banner.  The food is not fusion and it detracts from what you are really trying to do.  The service here is decent, but I\'m still struggling with the typical cafe thing.  The menu is a mix of some Izakaya style dishes...Japanese curry and the Japanese version of Hanbaga, with a Korean pork and kim chee highlighted by some desserts that you might see in a cafe/coffee shop.  I still have had much better parfaits and desserts.  Heard the chef/owner is from Sushi Roku and I wish him the best.  Focus on the food and forget the fusion.  The Japanese Hamburger and the Curry is a great start for the concept.  The creative desserts can be another aspect, but go the extra mile and do something more.  I get the impression of settling on a little of this and that.I would probably go back once or twice a year unless the food improves.  Get rid of the metal chopsticks as well.  Wooden is preferable in a Japanese establishment.  Consider share plates or chopstick holders as well so your customers have a place to put them rather than directly on the table.'
