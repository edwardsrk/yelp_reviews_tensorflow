b"Customer service is deplorable, the employees are not responsive to the disabled person's needs, they don't pay attention to detail so many times have ordered the wrong eqipment.They don't return phone calls, and it can take 6-12 weeks for medical equipment that is needed today! We've waited that long for a battery, or a wheel, so that my husband, a quadriplegic is bedbound until it comes, leading to risks of skin breakdown, urinary tract infections, pneumona, blot clots. My husband is now in bed for 12 days because we can't get an extendable leg rest for his wheelchair. After 1 wk, they sent out a generic one. The customer service has a record of my husband's wheelchair and can easily see that the generic one won't work on his chair. When we finally got ahold of them, they say it will be 1-2 wks and there is no way to expedite this. Then, when is comes it could be another week before it's delivered. We have been stuck with these guys for 2 yrs, as it's the only provider our insurance will work with and every single thing we're ordered has taken 6-12 wks and then longer to have it delivered and/or installed. The last thing we needed was a new seat and back and ended up installing it ourselves after waiting 3 mos for it."
