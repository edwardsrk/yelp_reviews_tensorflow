b'Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper\'s Tale.You might say, "I\'ve never heard of Rock Bottom, there\'s no way that they are a chain restaurant." Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you\'ll end up on the rock bottom.After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn\'t right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.'
