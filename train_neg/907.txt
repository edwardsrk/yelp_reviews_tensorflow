b"Customer service here was horrible. You would think you'd help the customers that are in line to give you money before stocking the shelves. Nothing was priced. I asked for a pin the tail of the donkey game for kids and they couldn't fine it and then the employee just walked away. The girl that filled my balloons was so rude. She didn't even tie them right and made it seem like I'm inconvenienceing her by purchasing balloons at a party store. Bad vibe at this place. Stay away."
