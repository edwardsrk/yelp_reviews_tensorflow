b'Food was ok, not the best just ok. Service could have been better, we ordered a large pizza, 20 wings and garlic knots... They brought out everything and forgot the wings! And never even told us anything about how long it would be, we finished the pizza and Knots before the wings even came! We where told that they forgot to put them in! BS! And the manager never even came over to apologize.... Horrible customer service!'
