b"I've been coming here since it opened and it has really gone downhill in the past few months. It seems they have new management that scrimps on everything. My husband and I ordered online to-go and when we went to pick it up, fries weren't ready. Further, when we pointed out that the veggie frites were half of what a typical order is, they said that was their normal. Also, when we came home and checked out a burger, the requested extra spinach was not on the burger (also, what little spinach present was wilted when it used to be fresh) and the cucumbers were so thin as to be translucent. The burgers were also very salty. Before this new management took over,  orders were ready for pick-up, toppings on burgers were actually present as requested, and sides were full-sized. This was the second time we encountered this situation at this location and it's very disappointing. For the money and the hassle, I suggest going to In-N-Out a few blocks away."
