b'DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Not only was the food cold, and poorly put together, there was a bug that came out of the ice machine. I went up to the manager, and all he did was replace the drinks. He is allowing customers to still use the ice machine. I would give zero stars if I could. Eat at your own risk!!!'
