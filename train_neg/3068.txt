b"Well well well.....we've been wanting to try this place for a while. We had a night open and decided to try it out. Came in about 7 and the place was empty. Hmmm? Seated next to the bar and I noticed a sign for $3.99 craft beer special. Asked the server and she wasn't sure. She had to check and it turned out it was a bottle of Fat Tire. Not too bad of a price I guess.When I ordered brisket, appropriate for a BBQ joint, they were out of it! Very inappropriate for a BBQ joint. I decided to go with baby back ribs instead. They came back and said they had enough brisket for a side with my ribs... For $3 more! Couldn't I just have that for free since I originally wanted it?We ordered a kids meal for our son. Mac and cheese with broccoli. The portion was tiny for $6.Ribs came and they were not very extravagant at all. For a place that prides itself on BBQ, this was way below par. I'd expect this presentation from an Applebee's or chilis, but not this place.They were still flavorful, but the fries were probably the highlight. Coleslaw had a weird  taste.I'd be ok not coming here again."
