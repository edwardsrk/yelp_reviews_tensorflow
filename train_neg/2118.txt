b'If you\'re able to get fiber internet, it\'s worth it. Fast and had minimal downtime in the 2 years I\'ve had it. I work full time from home and I only had a handful of issues over 2 years.So why the 2 stars?If you have to deal with customer service or god forbid the billing department, prepare to spend most of your day if not a couple of days on hold and repeating the same issue over and over again until you finally reach one intelligent person that helps you. Their downfall is their customer service. It\'s probably the worst I\'ve dealt with and I\'ve dealt with Cox and Comcast. The bonus to having fiber internet is that you get L2 local phone support. As a software engineer I understand networking and computers, their L2 fiber support is great because they are knowledgeable people, not some tech moron reading a script. Also, never settle for their advertised prices. Don\'t get a contract either. I was paying $80/mo for the fiber internet only and not on a contract. tl;drFast and stable fiber internet if you can deal with complete incompetence when you need "customer service"'
