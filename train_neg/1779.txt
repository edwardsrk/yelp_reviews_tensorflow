b"So i went to this taco spot today,i usually go to tacos El Tizon on Eastern and Trop and i love their food,i went over to Roberto's today because i was going to walk to Target afterward.I walked in and got no greeting or hello from the person at the counter she acted like she couldn't understand me,i was tempted to order in Spanish to see if she would make more of an effort but decided against it,maybe as another reviewer suggested living in Los Angeles for years means i am used to a higher standard of Mexican food but i doubt it...........I ordered 7 taco's,three for me in the store and 4 for the hubby for later,when i order taco's at a Mexican place i expect soft corn tortilla with fresh Carne Asada,what i got was deep fried shredded beef tacos with lettuce and cheese......i mean i have literly ordered better taco's at Taco Bell.I immediately went to complain to the girl she said that is how they serve them,they have no soft tacos and that i never asked her anything.I spent $15 on these taco's which i think is alot and i was denied a refund so i left with 6 Taco's i will not eat and  was completely irritated.I think this place is a joke,the picture of their Taco's on the menu board is no reflection of how they serve their food,the meat tasted off and the taco was dripping in grease totally disgusting.I go to Taco's El Tizon and i can get one taco with beans for $1.25 and it comes with a whole choice of salsa sides and pickled veggie's the staff are wonderful and the meat is cooked fresh,the Taco's i bought at Roberto's were $2.09 per taco and i wouldn't be surprised if they came from a box in the freezer.I will never go back and would never recommend the place to anyone........very disappointing"
