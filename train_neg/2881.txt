b"The food was really good! We ate mainly appetizers. The slopes were hard and the meat was cold. The flautas were very good as everything else such as the guacamole and ceviche. The service was TERRIBLE... it took the server 45 min to tell my father that they didn't have the bottle of wine he wanted wasn't available... it took them 45 minutes to bring out some food. And another 20 min to charge the bill..The waitress honestly had a terrible attitude whenever we asked where our drinks or food were.. the food overall 5 out of 10.. the service 3 out of 10"
