b'Not sure how i feel about this place as today was our first appointment for OT and Speech eval tomorrow is his PT eval.  First thing the building looks like a house im giving it a chance bc they do have horses. Walking into the front entrance the waiting room is small, the bath room Is A Porta-potty which is DISGUSTING. I asked how the state can allow this to be considered a handi accessible bathroom my son is in a wheel chair but he is content. We had to physically lift my son to urinate which resulted in urin on the floor, along with all the Other Urin on the floor, apparently the bathroom is hooked up to a septic tank and would not accommodate the amount of ppl who would be using it, the pool pump was broke. And the water was Green. I have waited a year for pt so im gritting my teeth and pushing through, the Speech eval was working with a mask bc she had an upper respiratory illness and despite me telling my children are low immune she found away to get back into the room.  Ill update further as this review develops.'
