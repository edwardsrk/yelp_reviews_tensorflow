b'Super nice inside good music mix of hip-hop and house dj was putting it down ! The downside is the staff ! Security is rude as hell racist if you ask me ! They said no tennis shoes ..... I\'m wearing a $200 pair of Jordan\'s these aren\'t some beat down raggedy kicks so I went to my MERCEDES ( yeah I\'m not broke but they treat you like that unless they know you or you buy bottle service haha ) and changed shoes but when I got inside I seen white guys wearing tennis shoes so I\'m thinking really it\'s like that ????? But I\'m not gonna let that ruin my night so we drank and danced it was cool plus they have a super huge nice patio with chairs heat lamps and hookah ! The waitresses were hot and the bartenders but the drinks were weak as hell and overpriced but that\'s Vegas unless you know where to go for locals. The female bartender sucked just because you\'re hot doesn\'t mean you should be a bartender !!!!!  I knew I was in for it when I asked her to put my ciroc in a bucket glass and she said " what\'s a bucket glass ? " I was like OMG you\'re a bartender and you don\'t know what a bucket glass is ..... really ????? So then I kept going back to the guy bartender who actually poured a decent drink and knew what a bucket glass is so he got my business and tips ! Make it sweet and short good time with friends but pricey drinks, rude security and dumb bartender but the guy bartender made up for it so maybe I\'ll go back but definitely not one of my top five ! It\'s to bad that the staff can ruin such a nice place with a great set up ! Oh btw do not run an open tab  with the waitresses !!!!! They ran my boys tab up over $400 and when we look at the receipt they had stuff on there that we never ordered obviously tryna increase sales and get a bigger tip !!!!! We were not happy to say the least but yes they\'ll take advantage of you thinking you\'re drunk and won\'t look over your tab !!!!!'
