b'Ch\xc3\xa9 was good, i ordered #1 . Girl was not very helpful, she just greeted us but did not say anything else .( we were the only customers ) Did not asked us if we need help or know the concept??It was my 1. time there so had no clue what i get.Anyway my dring was good, not sweet at all (which i like and ordered) I wish I would ordered it with coconut milk would tasted better I think.Mister did not liked it at all. He ordeeed #4?I think the ladies there should be a lil bit more helpful or at least ask if they can help to choose the Perfect drink as there are so many options to choose from.'
