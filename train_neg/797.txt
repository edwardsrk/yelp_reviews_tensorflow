b"I normally do not give restaurant 1 Star, and I'm doing so not because they are horrid. Their food is actually decent, but, for now, I HAVE to give them 1-Star for serving raw Shrimp Dumplings. That's just unacceptable after we waited over 15 minutes for it.Hopefully, I'll have no choice but to upgrade the rating next time I visit."
