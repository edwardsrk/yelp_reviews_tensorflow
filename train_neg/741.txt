b'It should be noted that this is now called Black Sheep Bar and Grill. As soon as we sat down and got a curt reply when asking about the beer menu (that was posted on the wall on the other side of the restaurant) we knew this was going to be an interesting experience. We placed our order, including appetizers. After our order was taken that was the last time we saw a waitress or anyone checked on us for 40 minutes. We did not see her again until she noticed us being increasingly annoyed with the neglect we were receiving. Empty drinks, no appetizers, forgotten customers. Once she came back we mentioned the appetizer that we have yet to receive and she did apologize that the wings were taking so long. Our fries came out cold and with all the cheese solidified. It was 50 minutes before we received our food. Still with no drink refills. The wings were hot and the sauces were delicious. The sweet and spicy BBQ was excellent. The service was slow and terrible. I would recommended getting take out and avoid spending anytime in there unless you got all night.'
