b"Great location for locals and if you choose to just have a drink and watch a game -it's perfect!  Great TV's and atmosphere for sporting events.  For anything else, dining for instance, it stinks.  The food quality is bad and the servers are hit and miss.  I'm not sure what the goal of having the female servers dressed so provocatively is, as this is a family place.  The girls all seem more concerned with their appearance than being attentive to their tables.  Maybe if I were a dude, it would be different.  Alas I'm not and unfortunately for them, I'm the one who gets to choose where we dine more often than not and I always vote to go elsewhere or stay home.   I hope they improve, I'd like to be able to give them another try.  Get a better chef and dress your servers in appropriate uniforms.  I'm all for fun and sexy, just not tacky.  Sorry."
