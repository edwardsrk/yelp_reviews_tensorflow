b"I'd love to support a local business but wow, what a mess here! Don't expect quality, tasty food, or for your order to be right. Don't expect it to be fast, and definitely expect to be charged extra per entree for your carry-out order. Portion sizes are pathetic. We will avoid cuco's waunakee location. Don't recommend at all."
