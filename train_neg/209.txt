b"Awful Awful Awful!!! I made an appointment to get my hair colored and the front desk women recommended a specific stylist based on what I wanted. I arrived with a photo of the type of color I wanted. Also described.... Darker color at roots, golden color towards bottom no stripes. What I received 2 hours later was ashy dull highlights all over the top of my head, the bottoms of my hair looked so broken and dead, when looking at back of head there were 2 dark stripes down length of my hair that went from top of head to bottom which is very long to my mid back. I was embarrassed and just wanted to leave salon ASAP. The following day I found a new salon to fix my hair. They described my hair as looking like cousin it. Every stylist in the salon was astonished as to what was done to my hair. They actually stayed open late and arrived to their Christmas party late in order to fix the mess made of my hair.  The stylist took photos of before and after photos of my hair to send back to etch to ask for refund. I did this the following week as I had a lot going on with Christmas and family in town. I spoke with Emma the salon manager at etch... She informed me that they stand by their work and since she didn't see my hair in person, and since I waited a week they would not be refunding my money. I will never ever go to this salon. I strongly suggest that you don't try this salon not only do to the poor work performed but also do to the incredibly poor customer service.  I spent $200 to ruin my hair at etch...and another $200 to get it color corrected at snap dragon salon.  Thank goodness for snap dragon!! They saved me!!"
