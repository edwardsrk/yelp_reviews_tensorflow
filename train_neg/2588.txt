b"I went in with a 7 day free trial pass that they completely ignored and they convinced me into signing up for a month to month membership with a three day cancellation window and the added bonus of waiving the (utterly ridiculous) $75 enrollment fee. That really should've been my first clue.After two visits over the course of two days where I found out the pool was less than spectacular and a number of their cardio machines need maintenance, I decided I was fed up and took advantage of the cancellation window and thought that would be the end of it. Of course, it wasn't and I got a lovely surprise this morning when I discovered that, despite cancelling within three days, they still withdrew the $30. Classy.The one bright side of this entire mess is that I'm supposed to be refunded my $30 in 7-10 days, so here's to hoping that will actually happen."
