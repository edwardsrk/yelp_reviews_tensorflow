b"They will never, ever get your order right, and will argue with you about it and make you show receipts to prove you didnt get what you ordered. However, it is the best fast food that you can pick up early in the morning, so you just have to decide if its worth the trouble. PS: If you want a hamburger, get the natural one-- the patties on the other burgers are absolutely disgusting, but the natural burger is actually pretty good. Good luck!!Update: went back again today, the employee taking my order was irritated at how many times i asked her to repeat my order back to me, yet it STILL came out wrong. There is just something wrong with the way they do things. It's slow and always incorrect.Update 2: after a month or two of not going at all, because the food was starting to make my family sick, we gave it another shot (don't ask me why, lol) and the orders were all wrong, as always, and it made us all sick again. This restaurant should be avoided at all costs."
