b'After hearing so many people in the area raving about Folco\'s I finally decided to try it out. And we were looking for a reception spot for a Baptism - which we let them know when we walked in.  I was disappointed about the food. The veal parmigiana was sub-par. Too much sauce, very dry meat which was overcooked. My husband tried a pasta dish which was "ok" we were told pasta was made fresh in house. The drenching of sauce on the pasta killed any taste I was hoping to get out of it. The caesar salad was good & so was the bruschetta. Their tomato sauce - homemade I was told - tastes like something out of a jar. I was hugely disappointed and felt their food tasted no different than the Italian restaurant across the street. I was hoping to go back & try out their pizzas, but there is a much better Italian restaurant in the Garden Basket Plaza that makes everything from scratch and I have been a regular of theirs since they opened.'
