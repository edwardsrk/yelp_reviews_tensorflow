b"My experience wasn't that pleasant.  First time in there so had a wait of about 10-15 minutes.  No problem since I didn't have an appointment.  The girl that did my pedi never even said her name and didn't talk.  Same goes for the gentleman that did my fill.  The thing that was the worst was the zombie type movie playing right in front of me while the music still blasted.  Don't think I will go back."
