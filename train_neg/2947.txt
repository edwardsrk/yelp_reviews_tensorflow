b'I was really excited to try this place, but it\'s just more of the same. It\'s more of an upscale version of El Pollo Loco meets Chipotle . I loathe the fast food Mexican, and this place doesn\'t offer anything extra except a bar, beer and Sangria. They\'re as expensive as the actual dine-in Mexican spots. They have a "salsa" bar (nothing exciting), but, it\'s basically just like all the other "fresh Mexican" chains around. We\'ve got at least 6 within a 1 mile radius of Boca Park: Cafe Rio, Baja Fresh, Chipotle, El Pollo Loco, Hussong\'s, and Viva Mercadito. This place won\'t make it, unfortunately. Their prices are too high, food is just mediocre, and Summerlin has too many other great spots to dine at.'
