b"I was really looking forward to bringing the family here today because kids eat free on Sundays.. But was kind of disappointed. We had two Aj burgers (one with jalapenos & bacon and the other with just bacon) a order of cheese curds, fried onion strings a beer and a soda.. Our total came to $30. Good thing the 3 kids meals were free or it would have easily topped $50 bucks. The burger was good but kind of small. The cheese curds were good but the portion size was ridiculous. For $4+ we should of got more then 7 cheese curds, Honestly, and $5 for a blue moon is crazy expensive. The chipolte ranch was the bomb tho, super spicey and good. I probably wouldn't go back unless it was some type of special occasion."
