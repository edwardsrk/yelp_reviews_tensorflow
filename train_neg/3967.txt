b'Mediocre.We came here to see Darrell (who was the manager at the King West location...has since moved to the York Street location) he always makes the dining experience exceptional. Sadly he was not in... maybe he would have saved the evening!On to dinner: The server was relatively quick on the drink orders. And because we were regulars we know our orders relatively quickly. No real connection was made...but Melanie did her job well enough off the hop. I did have to ask another server to send her our way. And the couple next to us who arrived prior to us received their mains as we left. I over heard them say "well I guess we have nothing else to do tonight" My food: quite lacking! Sadly. I only ordered the tuna tartar (my usual). The fried wontons were cold and stale. I told our server who said a manager would bring out the replacement...I\'d imagine to do a table touch...this didn\'t happen. One of the line cooks did. Fine. There was a visible difference in appearance between the two. Obviously the first set were older/possibly refrigerated. I was satisfied with the replacement wontons. THEN I BIT INTO THE HARD BIT OF THE END OF AN AVOCADO! like the stem circle bit. I didn\'t even complain about it. I just quit eating. My husband said the filet mignon was good. Standard keg.'
