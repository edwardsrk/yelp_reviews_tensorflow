b'I went their last night for dinner after reading the review here on Yelp.  They mailed a "buy on; get one free" coupon to my house which how I learned about them.  I was really looking forward to it because there aren\'t any Gyro places in my area.  My friend is from Turkey and loves Gyro.  They offered us a free Falafel tasting while we were standing in line to order.  I\'d read an unfavorable rating about their Falafel so was looking forward to trying it for myself.  We both agreed it was dry, overcooked and tasteless; actually terrible.  With that we decided we\'d both order a standard Gyro sandwich.  It was the worst Gyro either of us ever had.  They have a nice concept of healthy ingredients but unfortunately they don\'t have their recipe right.  It was tasteless and for us worse, a bad taste.  We frequent Mediterranean, Middle East and Israeli restaurants frequently and have both traveled the world extensively.  We understand they make their own pita, it was OK but not pita as we know it.  We didn\'t like the sauce.  Their gyro at least wasn\'t the standard prepackage frozen gyro we\'ve received at many places here in the valley.  It was our last time their.  With this introduction, we wouldn\'t even risk a second visit.BTW, there staff and service were wonderful.  However when my friend began asking question it was obvious they didn\'t have any knowledge about "true" Mediterranean food.This is more of a fast food American version of a tasteless "American" version.  I was disappointed because it\'s conveniently located near my house.  We came home and made Turkish coffee just to get the bad taste out of our mouths.'
