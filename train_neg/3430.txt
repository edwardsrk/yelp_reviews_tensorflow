b"If there is a way I could give them NEGATIVE stars I would! This was my first time there and it was one of my most awful experiences at a restaurant and I probably would of received better service at McDonalds. There was about 6 customers at 7PM on a Monday night, only taking up 3 stables and a seat at the bar, with two waitresses attending to the people at the tables. So they had no excuses for having such slow service! I ordered the Chicken Provolone Philly and it was as bland as card board. If you want good food with good service, don't go to DB's. Plus the babes aren't even good looking... They were probably from their 30's-50's."
