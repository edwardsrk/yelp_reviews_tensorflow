b"I called in for delivery and waited an hour for them to deliver my pizza which yes they might have been busy I understand but when they drop it off I didn't take a look at the pizza because I was working and put it in the back in the break room as soon as I went to go get a slice the entire pizza was burned and it looked old. I waited an hour at least you guys should have made sure my pizza was not burn and at least somewhat fresh. It's so mess up. They wouldn't even give my money back."
