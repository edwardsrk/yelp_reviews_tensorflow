b"I've had better. I come from the Bay Area where Asian buffets come a dime a dozen. My BF raved about this place and being a sushi lover, I of course had to try it!We went for lunch after doing some shopping and we were seated very quickly. Selection wasn't as good as I had hoped for and they didn't have signs listing what kind of sushi you were eating so you were in the dark. The beef terriyaki was good and I ended up eating mostly that.So why the 2 stars? Why not 3? Because my stomach was not happy - AT ALL - an hour after we left."
