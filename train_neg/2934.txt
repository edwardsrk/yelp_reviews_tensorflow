b"$10 for a single mushroom/Swiss wasn't good value in my opinion.  Bun was unremarkable and beef was a bit too blackened for my liking.  One of these days a burger joint will open that puts fresh saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms and real Swiss on a high quality bun.  That would be worth $10.  As it stands, I can get a higher quality burger for the same price from national burger chain.  Lower this price point, and improve on quality & this place will do much more business."
