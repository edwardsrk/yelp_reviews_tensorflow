b'Amazing. Apparently there\'s zero communication between employees at Fitness One because after somewhat successfully cancelling my membership on Tuesday night I got a phone call tonight from "Jennifer" inviting me to come to a free fitness assessment because I was a "preferred member".So either I was wrong to think that my account was actually closed or Jennifer doesn\'t know how to read a client file?'
