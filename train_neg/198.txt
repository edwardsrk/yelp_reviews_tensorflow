b"I'm very upset with how this whole clinic works all of them, you call one number for all locations so your never able to get through with the medical assistant at the location you visit. They take forever to give you a call back and the customer service Representatives are mostly nice but when you haven't gotten any calls back after being told to keep your phone by you someone will call you in a few mins and its been four hours!!! Its very disappointing. And they all give you the same run around and at this point your a bit annoyed they have sarcastic attitudes. I've been waiting since 9:30 am and its now 2:00 for a call back for a simple precipitation and nobody can give me a answer. After my first trimester I am leaving this place. The first nurse I saw was nice but not a people person which made my first visit uncomfortable. I suggested things to her to make my blood work done, she should have just brought it up. Anyways I hope to have good things to say but at this moment I don't and am very displeased with the service everyone's experience is different this was mine."
