b'We\'ll start with no smoking, no gambling, and no restaurants in this hotel.Do you still want to proceed?VALET was full. Another large bummer!  This means you have to go park on the 3rd floor of the Miracle Mile shops then drag your luggage almost clear across the mall and through the hotel to get to your dang room. NO BUENO.Let\'s go to the "no restaurants" part.  You are in Vegas, might I remind you, you are going to want to eat at some point, maybe?  They have room service till 10 pm at night, but if you want something to eat, you better put your walking shoes on b/c you have to go into the Miracle Mile Shops.  They do; however, have a small kitchen in each room with a fridge and a microwave so that\'s helpful.  Ice machine only on 2 floors--5th floor and the 50th so I heard, real pain in the arse to go get ice. Like I didn\'t go get ice b/c it was such a pain. NO BUENOThey also make you swipe your card every time before you even get close to the elevator bank, that\'s annoying. NO BUENOSeating downstairs is limited when you are waiting for your party to arrive at a meeting point in the lobby so you can go out together. My friend was sitting on the small table that looked like a stool and was rudely told not to sit on the furniture by one of the security guards like she was some kind of heathen... NO BUENOnot my favorite--go w/ the trump or the hotel'
