b'really spacious room cheaper price bc it is off the strip. but really disappointed at its cleanliness. found used shower cap in a cabin and dirty stain on the bed sheet. black stain on the side of the door. made me wonder did they really clean the room or not.  the decoration seem modern and nice but when i paid a closer look at the pillow, they seem really old and never get replaced. dont think i would come back again..'
