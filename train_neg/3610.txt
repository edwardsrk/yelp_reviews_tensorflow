b"Social media hyped this place up too much, because District One was a total let down. We tried the oxtail pho and the oxtail fried rice, and we were very underwhelmed by both. $16 for a bowl of pho? I don't care if it contains unicorn meat; at that price, I could get TWO bowls of pho from a traditional Vietnamese place that tastes infinitely better. The oxtail fried rice (also $16) was too greasy and contained shreds of meat so small, I wouldn't be able to tell it was oxtail unless you told me.Sadly, they were out of coconut shells for their coconut ice cream that day, which was odd considering we were there on a Monday afternoon. Disappointed by the food and general lack of empathy from the staff, we decided to save our money and get dessert elsewhere.Did we arrive on an off day? Who knows, but I don't see myself coming back to find out anytime soon."
