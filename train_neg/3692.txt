b"Mediocre at best. Previous reviewers must have been confused that they were somewhere good.  Hong Kong noodle soup with duck was a decently cooked portion of duck with a brick of egg noodles. The noodles were so over cooked or reheated that they wouldn't come apart and gave up after of few minutes of fighting them.Fried rice was decent, egg flower soup was decent but I think most people prefer it a bit thicker and not watery.   Sweet and sour pork was good but the dinner combo only has five pieces.  Chicken chow me in was alright, just wish they didn't use so much MSG you can taste it more than the protein in the dish.Might go back if I was stranded in the hood with no where else to go during a civil uprising."
