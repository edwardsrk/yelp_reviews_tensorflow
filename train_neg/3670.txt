b'I hauled @$$ after a long day at work to get here before closing, and maybe it was because I came so late in the day, but the selection was limited. The already limited selection was further limited for me, because almost every item had some sort of edible glitter! Am I the only one who is reminded of metal shavings when there is shiny stuff on my food? Perhaps. In any case, I got a slice of cake that was described to me as a cake version of a "cannoli," and a macaron. The cake itself was nice and moist, but all together, it was overly sweet - too much frosting, not enough cake.  Also, the slab of sugar (frosting) separated from the layer of cake when I was "knifing" it with the side of my fork for a bite, which kind of turned me off - that typically happens when the cake is dry, and has been left out for a while, which it didn\'t seem to be.I didn\'t finish the slice, and didn\'t bother trying the macaron at that point - I think my roommate may have helped himself to it. The person behind the counter said A Bakeshop is known more for its cookies, so maybe I just didn\'t have the right expectations going in as I was jonesing for a decadent, cakey treat. However, I likely will not be back, especially because getting in and out of that center can be very stressful. Not only are spots limited because of TexAZ patrons, it\'s almost impossible to exit west on Bethany home on the  south side, or make a left going southbound on 16th street during rush hour.'
