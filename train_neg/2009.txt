b'There are good things, and bad things about this tiny airport. The bad things are, no food, no bar, just vending machines a couch and a big screen TV. The good thing is that this airport is so small, only American Eagle flies here, that when you show up for your flight, you can sit on the couch or an easy chair and watch TV while you wait for the security guys to show up. Then everyone on your flight (~32 people) go through security and get on the plane.'
