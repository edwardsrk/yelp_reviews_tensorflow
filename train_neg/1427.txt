b"Such a shame! I have ordered food here a few times and it's been fine.  Nothing great but okay and near my home.  Tonight...I'm making myself eat some of it just so I'm not hungry.  Totally disgusting. sampler platter,  fries cold and mushy, came  with no sauce, chicken wings cold and mushy.  Chicken fingers - one not cooked all the wayand the rest mush. The soup was beef vegetable.  Something from out of a can.   Sub sandwich - vinegar completely soaked through bread and mushy.  I almost cannot believe that they serve food like this.   I would attribute a lot of this to the fact that I ordered it at 6:35 and it arrived at my house at 7:45.  The way it tastes - it sat for at least 45 minutes getting cold and mushy.   I will never order from this restaurant again and I suggest that you don't either.  With this economy, one would think that places that want to stay in business would go the extra distance to make sure their food is better.   By the way, sandwich, soup, 5 chicken strips and sampler appetizer $$43 with the $5 tip that I wish I hadn't had given now.  I feel completely ripped off and still hungry....  If you aren't good at the other things on the menu, why are you serving them and delivering them???"
