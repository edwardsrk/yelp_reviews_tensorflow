b'Had a horrible experience at this establishment.  All of orders were incorrect and it took us along time for our orders to be taken. The waiter was not very suggestive. The best part of our visit was the hostess. She was very attentive and took of us when we needed something. I only suggest this place if you wanna sit at the bar for a drink and food.'
