b"In the past six months I have seen a steady downfall in the preparation of the dishes and service at Mimi's. ( Stephanie St. location). I ordered the salmon dinner and it was dried out. There were few vegetables on the plate. There was a small amount of spinach and four, yes,  four small roasted potatoes. Another time, I ordered the egg breakfast. The bacon was stringy and in parts inedible. Recently, I again ordered the breakfast (2 scrambled eggs, bacon,roasted potatoes, English muffin and coffee) The restaurant was not crowded yet the wait was a long one. When the food finally arrived, the eggs were lukewarm, the bacon was stringy , again!, and the potatoes were, well, one was completely frozen, and the others were cold! The server neglected to ask me if everything was ok until she arrived to hand us our bill.I told her about the potatoes and she willingly gave me a small fruit cup in its place. Oh good, their fruit cup is usually good. The fruit in the past at Mimi's was clean, firm and tasty. Again, disappointment. The grapes were mushy, and the cantaloupe was not sweet. The pineapple was also tasteless.  Big changes at this Mimi's and not for the better."
