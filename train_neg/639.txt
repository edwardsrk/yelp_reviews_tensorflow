b'This is a new location from the same owners of the Luna Rossa at Lake Las Vegas.  I have never been to the original location but had a TERRIBLE experience today at the Downtown/Fremont Street location. I went with two other people and we ordered the meatball sandwich, filet mignon sandwich and lasagna.  Lasagna and meatball sandwich were both cold and flavorless.  Am assuming that this was previously frozen and microwaved before it was served to us.  Also, the water glasses and silverware were very dirty. We were very shocked when we received our bill... All items that were ordered were supposed to be part of the lunch menu and were supposed to include drinks.  We were charged $3.75 each for our sodas and by that point we all just wanted out of the restaurant. It was really expensive for a previously frozen, microwaved lunch.  The only good part was the Krispy Kreme donuts that we stopped for on our way back to work.'
