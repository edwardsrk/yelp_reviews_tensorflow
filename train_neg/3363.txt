b'My friends and I (6-10 people) have been coming here every Sunday for over three years.   We really enjoy sitting out back after a workout and catching up with each other.  Today they very rudely told us they would no longer serve us on the back patio and we would have to wait for our food to be prepared and then take it back ourselves.   The lack of hospitality really ruined the morning.   I guess next week we will give First Watch a try.  It seems the young ladies were far more interested in playing on their phones than serving us.'
