b"I brought my kids to Vegas to experience the lights and glitter and during that time, take them to see some shows that wouldn't break my budget.  So, I purchased the tickets from Groupon and thought my kids would enjoy a magic show.  It was my daughter's 9th birthday and she was really excited to see a magician.  I have to agree that this was not the greatest show and quite disappointed on paying $100 for a family of 4.  You can see certain tricks being done, and personally, my husband, older daughter and myself were just bored.  I gave it 2 stars because my youngest enjoyed it a bit. It wasn't a mind blowing experience for her but rather, eh, it was ok.  The room was extremely small and the way the chairs were positioned were not the greatest.  If you're not sitting in the front center or even on the front row of the site aisle (where GA admission would sit), it's not a great view.Overall, I would suggest a different show or save your money."
