b'This "was* my go to steak house place in Vegas. I come very often. This is my anniversary weekend and this place just ruined it. I asked for a certain bottle of wine per arrival....and once arriving I was told it wasn\'t available anymore. They has a different bottle as an alternate. Fine. Once getting the bill I notice it\'s a good $25 more than the bottle that I usually order. I ask then about it and (what i assume is the manager) comes over.  He asks me if I was made aware of this by our server. I inform him I don\'t even know how are server was because we\'ve have at least 4 people serve us. Which is not the norm when we have our usual server serve us. He informs us that hes going to ask the server if she informed us. If she did we would be charged accordingly..if not he would fix it. He finally came back and told us that she had informed us in which we said we would that\'s impossible. End of story they weren\'t going to discount us a dollar and we\'re paying whatever they say because they said so. I haven\'t even mentioned that not once did we get our wine refilled.....and we had to wait 1 hour to get our order fulfilled. Worst experience ever. Especially for a anniversary. I never not come here on my visits but this could be the last time I ever come here. I will reach out to the higher above. This was just unacceptable for a $200 meal for 2 people'
