b"Do not stay here under any circumstances. The hotel specifies that you should call ahead if you're going to be arriving after hours. I called the front desk early in the afternoon and got confirmation that we could arrive 15 minutes after their closing time. The woman that I spoke to was sweet and assured us that it'd be ok. I then called around 11pm to confirm that our plans were still good, and was told by the male manager that not only did they have no record of my call, but that under no circumstances would they wait 15 minutes after closing for us to get there. This is after we've paid them. So I asked for a refund, and they said they wouldn't refund me because there wasn't 24 hours notice!!! Meanwhile, the hotel manager was being flippant and accused me of lying that I'd called in the first place. He claimed that they had no female receptions on their staff!!! When expedia called to get a refund, a female manager answered the phone and said that they had no male managers on their staff!!! Unbelievable! I fully intend to pursue legal action against this hotel if this matter is not resolved soon."
