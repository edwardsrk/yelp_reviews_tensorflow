b'Good sushi but the "all you can eat" option has draconian rules. If there\'s a single piece left on your plate it costs a dollar extra(1 for maki, 2 for sushi). They\'ll actually watch over you like a hawk to see you eat it. Their menu is confusing to where it can cost you far too much for what you get if you\'re not careful.'
