b"I typically don't write reviews but I went out to El Hefe May 25th for my birthday, I reserved a table with 2 bottles two weeks prior along with my friends. We got there around 11pm and spent almost $1,000.00 only to be asked to come down from our table around 12:30am because it had been resold after we finished our bottles. Long story short, do not buy bottle service from this place. Specially from Xavier who's the one that resold our table."
