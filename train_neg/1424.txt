b"Maybe it was just a bad night that I went. My friends and I went to this hot pot place last week to 1) warm ourselves up, 2) cheapest one in the area. It seemed like an optimal place with bubble tea and billards downstairs. When we entered, there was only 2 tables occupied. We went at approximately 8pm so we thought maybe we missed the dinner rush (I don't think that ever happened). We stood around for 5 minutes since no one was there...then a girl came out and escorted us to our table. The service overall wasn't good at all. When we were paying, I think the girl made a mistake so she kept on swearing to herself and didn't give a crap about us paying. Food wise, it was alright. Not the best I've had (given it was only for $18), it was decent. I wouldn't necessarily come back to this place again given the shitty service."
