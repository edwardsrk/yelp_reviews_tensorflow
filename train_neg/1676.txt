b'Just had a terrible experience at this location!! Took over 30" to get food. They had mixed order up and gave it to someone else. I finally had to ask for where my food was and then it still took time to o get. Then, while I was eating it, a find a food wrapper mixed in with my food that I didn\'t realize what it was until after I put it in my mouth and started to chew it!! I SO disgusted. I have had it with crapppy service and food prep. They gave me my money back but that doesn\'t cut. I patronize this particular restaurant chain quite a bit and no longer will be coming back. I plan to call the health board and file a compliant.'
