b"At first sight this is a great dealership. However, after you have discussed a plan to buy a new car and you think all is going to be great... it's not. I decided to not buy that day. Give myself a few days to think. When I called to schedule an appointment to buy the car they told me they did the math wrong. They can't give me the car for the price discussed. Needless to say I didn't buy the car and they could care less that they lost a customer. It was a very disappointing experience."
