b"Torture.  Walked right in @ 10 pm on Saturday night, it was busy but no wait.  I imagine it can get very busy (good for them, not so good if you dislike lines/waiting).I'd suggest get the $7 nacho sampler; that only took about 10 minutes, the 16 spice chicken (name?) took over 45 minutes...  One item??!! (and yes it was very good but small portion)  Brutal, it's so loud inside, just an exercise in patience that we weren't looking for.  Staff was friendly, I would never return, nor recommend it to anyone.  TOO DARK.  TOO LOUD. WAY, WAY TOO SLOW."
