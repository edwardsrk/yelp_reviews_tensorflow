b"My favorite Mexican sushi spot (mocorito) was closed so I figured this would be just as good. All Mexican sushi is the same right? Wrong. Although this sushi appeared identical to my favorite spot, it was completely lacking flavor. For that reason alone, I don't think I will return. It was really that flavorless and a waste of $30. No issues with customer service the food just sucked."
