b"Salad sensations is a place some people from the office like coming here because it's fresh and healthy. I've eaten here a bunch of times and honestly I'm not a fan of the place. I'm all for healthy food however I find their sandwiches uninspiring and bland. Sure they have lots of options but I don't really find them very flavorful.  Maybe because they are too damm healthy they don't taste as good to me. The last time I was here I ended up using copious amounts of sriracha just to give some more flavour. The last time I was here I had their le frais sandwich. I've also had their l'hyperactive soup. Again it was okay but I find the flavour lacking zest. Maybe because we use lots of bold seasoning in our household. When friends from the office mention to come here I cringe like taking a bite into a sour lemon. You may enjoy this place but I concur it's bland rabbit food for me!"
