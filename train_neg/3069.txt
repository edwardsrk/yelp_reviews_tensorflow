b"I don't have any other cupcake place to compare this too, and except for my own humble creations which come from a box. 4 stars it is for now.  The boyfriend and happened to be in the area and they happened to be open.  We were there around 2 so pickins' were slim.  Still, we found 4 flavors to try, Mint Chip, Classic Vanilla, Half-baked and a Mango.  The people there were nice and I took a card as they do bridal and I have a friend who may need them for a shower or two.The cakes were moist, and well done.  For me, the frosting was just sweet enough without making your teeth want to run from your mouth, and the frosting was a good ratio.  The Mint chip is a buy again, the Half baked was good, and the vanilla was decent.  (I would prefer more of a pronounced vanilla flavor).  The mango will not appeal to everyone.  If you don't like mango or coconut, this is not for you.  If you do, like I do, you will really enjoy this cake.Will I go again?  Yes.  I want more of a cross sample to make a really good review.  Will I go at 10 am?  Yes.  (See above) I live close enough for me to do so.  All in all, not a bad little local shop.Update: April 17, 2014. I have reduced my review from 4 to 2 stars as a second visit has rendered me unimpressed.  I also have had more cupcakes from cupcakeries to compare these to and I will stick to baking my own. I KNOW I can do better."
