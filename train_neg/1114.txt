b'This was an absolutely terrible experience for a meal. Let\'s start...the place was sweltering hot inside the restaurant. I ordered a Caesar Salad w extra salad dressing. Had to ask 3 times. My friend ordered a salad but the server missed the dressing. My other friend ordered a sandwich & the fries were "forgotten"?! The steak was undercooked for another meal! For my meal I had wilted fries & they were out of a key part of the meal of waffle & chicken!! They featured a meal & were missing a key part?!?! The place was old & broken down as well. There are tons of restaurants in the area...do yourself a favour...eat somewhere else!'
