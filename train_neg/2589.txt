b"Was excited to have a dim sum place in Madison. We ordered a bunch of different dishes. 7 total which is a bit too much for two people but we're able to take them home. We were disappointed in the Xiao Long Buns (Baos). There was no juice in them. Typically, you eat these with a spoon. You place one on a spoon and nibble some of the top off. Then you proceed to slurp out the super yummy juice. Anyways, these are more like steamed dumplings though the meat was very mushy and wouldn't hold its shape. It seemed like they used a lot of fillers, possibly flour, that made the meat act this way. I would recommend the pot stickers instead though there were a LOT of chives. The deep-fried dough sticks was the best dish we had. It's best to eat these hot. Although they do mention *picture for reference only, please prevail in kind* on the menu, it was disappointing to get no veggies in the vegetable crepe. There are absolutely no greens on the dim sum menu. Instead it was filled with different types of fungi. It would have been nice to have some real veggies in it. On to the sweets - the deep-fried sesame balls are good. The outer shell was a bit harder and crunchier than I have had before, but overall they were tasty. The puffy egg custard tarts are good though the shell is a bit in the buttery side. The flavor is good though. The service was good and attentive. They speak both English and Mandarin. I didn't hear any other dialects when I was there. If you have never been to a dim sum place, they will walk you through it. Basically, just mark down how many of the dishes you want. You can always request more later. Each dish will come one at a time so expect a wait in between dishes. For those who have had good dim sum, you may be disappointed. Things are on the greasy and salty side, as others have mentioned."
