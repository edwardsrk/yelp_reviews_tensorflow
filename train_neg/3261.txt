b'This Vons is a stark contrast to the windmill location I used to shop at. It seems to be severely understaffed. The shelf layout is fairly incomprehensible. Many products are near the end of their shelf life, and the feminine hygiene aisle has a gate on it for some reason. The store is open 24 hrs and they have only the manager at the cash register to serve a very long line from 10 pm to midnight. The grocery bagger/ cart wrangler does triple duty, having to unlock and carry liquor to the register. I have to say James the manager and his compadre were troopers, they were very nice, funny, and worked well under pressure. The lady working the slot machines was not awesome and just pointed at the register and said "ih!" when I asked who could unlock the booze. I think I will take James\'s advice to NOT come in between the hours of 10-12... I probably will not come back at all. I\'d guess that, unfortunately, most of the issues here are probably due to a crappy regular clientele. Oh well, I now have what I came for- my very own bottle of locally crafted vodka for zombie brain Jell-O shots, and a box of crackers.'
