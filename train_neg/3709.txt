b'Food was good and the hibachi guy was awesome! However, we had a 7pm reservation and we didn\'t leave until after 10pm. We also got seated in the basement and it was super hot down there. The service was slow and it\'s hard to wait until 8:30 to get food. They kept saying "the hibachi chefs will be down shortly because it\'s really busy upstairs". When we asked for our checks, he came really quick than disappeared. Our friend had to go upstairs to take our checks up to the front desk to get them taken care of. Once our friend had given the hostess our checks, her response was "oh your waiter is busy". What?! I don\'t think I\'ll be returning here. The service wasn\'t what I expected for an establishment in the location it is in & for the prices I paid. Feel free to come eat here if you want to spend 3-4 hours of your life waiting on dinner.'
