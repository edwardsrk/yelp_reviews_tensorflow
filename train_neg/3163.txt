b'I do not usually give two star reviews, but Kinka Izakaya North York earned it. I waited 30 minutes to order. Then had to wait another 40+ minutes for the food to come. The prices are quite high for the quality and the amount of food you get. The waiters are too focused on screaming when people walk in that they completely ignore you when you try to grab their attention for napkins or extra utensils.Also, WHY SO LOUD? I understand that it is all about "the energy" and making the dining experience "fun" and "different", but oh my goodness, I could not even hear my friend who was sitting right in front of me! We stopped trying to converse with each other after a while. There was no point in screaming at each other over the noise when we can go somewhere else and talk. I feel bad for the waiters working there. How do you not get a headache after being there for over an hour? We got out of there as soon as we could. Will not be back.The two stars I am giving is for their washrooms. I have to admit, they were pretty amazing, and very clean.'
