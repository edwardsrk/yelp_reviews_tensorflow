b"food arrived cold. was either cooked too early or reheated. Service has a lot to improve. Ladies: if you decide to wear heels when going to this place, I suggest you DON'T. Steel floor between the entrance to the second door in both the restaurant and the marche has small undetectable, movable holes and unless you've been to the place before your heel will most likely get stuck in it. My $1200 Louboutin did. Both feet. Such a deadly trap. One should always do some research before trying new restaurant nowadays. If the restaurant is often busy, no need to participate in the Mtl A Table."
