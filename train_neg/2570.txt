b'Generic menu (salads, burgers, and steak). Highly over priced steak for the quality of the cut and meal. The foods ok here. The restaurants at a nice spot with a great view of the lake. Make sure you walk all the way to side of the restaurant and sit by the bay window.Looks like there was only one server for the whole restaurant during lunch. Props to the lady giving us good service.'
