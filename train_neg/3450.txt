b'We were in the mood for steak so we decided to have some there! The food tastes amazing, however the service was awful. We found a hair in our food and although the manager stop to apologized they never offered replace the meal, he offered some free drinks that we never got and the waitress was MIA...never went back to refilled our drinks and ask if we needed anything else!'
