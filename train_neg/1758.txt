b"Has to be the WORST fish and chips I have ever eaten.Was in town with some friends and we thought we would try it. CRAP! Can't say anything good about the place. How people love it or how it has stayed in business for so long is beyond me. Frozen right out of the box. Fish is horrible. Shrimp is barely palatable.I'm done, don't want to waste any more time on this place!!!"
