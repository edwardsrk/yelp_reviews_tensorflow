b'Not impressed with Enterprise or their taxes and surcharges! Nor with the fact that while a child was talking in my one ear, the customer service agent took that weakness and upsold me to a small SUV. LOTS more money, but NO more space. When I had a chance to breathe, I was angry.  In addition, you have to pay a $75 fee to return your Enterprise rental back to anywhere else BUT the airport. DISLIKE!'
