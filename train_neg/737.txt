b'I would never go back to this restaurant. when its about brar one thinks of good food, good ambience, and variety. i have been to all three brar restaurants in the gta. this one in mississauga is way below average. the food was average, very little variety, pathetic lay out, disgusting ambience, and poor poor service. i will never go back to this brar location again. the best brar restaurant is  the one in brampton..'
