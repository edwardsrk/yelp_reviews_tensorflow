b'RACIST ! I called this location and kindly asked " hi are you hiring any new nail techs?" She said "are you vietnamese?" I said "no" and she said "ohh then no" so in order for me to get the job i have to be vietnamese? Discrimination in the work place terrible thing, i cant believe this even happened'
