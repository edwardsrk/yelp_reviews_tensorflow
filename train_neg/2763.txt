b".... Not good ....They're saying my review is too short so I'll expound. We got the cocktail of the day. Pear vodka with prosecco. 3/10The margarita pizza was a sloppy mess as you could see from the picture. It felt like they rain it through the dishwasher before the brought it out to us. Gnocchi was average, pretty bland."
