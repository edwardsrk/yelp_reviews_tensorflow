b"My experience here was ok. I am new to town and wanted to get my nails done on a holiday, fortunately they were open. However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency."
