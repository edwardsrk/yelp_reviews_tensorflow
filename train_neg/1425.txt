b'I should of known better to cut my losses when the first thing we heard from the House of Egg Roll staff was "we\'re out of egg rolls".  The service was terrible and when my food finally arrived, the waitress set it down on the other end of the table.  I realize there may be some cultural differences and language barriers but the staff at this place is inattentive and rude.  The food was bland and cold.  In the middle of the lunch rush, a huge delivery of the food came right through the front door.  Why the owners of this place would let his happen during their lunch rush is baffling.  They staff was overwhelmed and inexperienced.  Don\'t worry about them not charging for something!  I\'m surprised they didn\'t bill me for my ice water!'
