b"I was in there with my son the other night.  I ordered him a chicken teriyaki bowl. The chicken was burnt and dry, when I brought it back to the counter, the guy looked at it and threw it in the garbage right in front of me with an attitude the whole time. He said he would make me a kid bowl. I said no that's not what I paid for. He then proceeded to tell me that half the chicken was gone, which was untrue. I then said are we really arguing about this. I then demanded my money back and left. I will never be back in this establishment again. My husband and my family are regulars at this location. Ever since new management  has taken over there service standard have gone down. They are very unwelcoming. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for 20 years, and would never dream of treating a guest that way, let alone arguing with one and tell them they were wrong."
