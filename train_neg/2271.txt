b"It wasn't a good dining experience.  Food was cold, they didn't check on us, then when I sent the food back both servers scolded me for not dealing with it quicker. Sadly both servers (trainer and trainee) didn't check back with us for over 20 minutes (side work).  They fixed it, after both schooling me, then got us out of there as quickly as possible.  I wanted dessert, wasn't offered. Check came.  Poor showing.  I'll skip this place next time I want Mexican."
