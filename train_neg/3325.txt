b'My husband and I were staying at a hotel near this restaurant while traveling through town. After reading reviews online, we decided to give this place a try for dinner.Now, I know that every restaurant and every cook has an off day and I\'m sure that this was what happened here.We started off with the Cafe fries (fries, cheese, and bacon) and it was pretty good. Fries were crispy and the homemade ranch was definitely good. Unfortunately, one of the appetizer plates came to our table with old food crusted on it. I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. It was just awful. The potatoes had the strangest consistency and had an unidentifiable and unpleasant taste. I asked my husband to try it and he agreed. The chicken fried steak in itself was fair and the mac and cheese was greasy. The cornbread was a bit tough. My husband ordered the three cheese baked ziti with meat sauce. As my husband put, "it\'s not good". I gave it a try and agreed with him. It seemed almost watered down. Our waitress was a doll and was super sweet. She was very helpful and friendly.If we are passing through town again, we won\'t be back.'
