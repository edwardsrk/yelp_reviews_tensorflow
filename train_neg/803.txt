b"Okay so I gave this place another try...not happy!  The food wasn't great enough that I was willing to ignore the horrible service.  Nice clean environment...staff was friendly.  Decided to try the Southwestern Shrimp Wrap (wanted to be daring and bold so I didn't change the order-even ate avocado lol)  not very good.  The shrimp had a weird taste to it and I couldn't even force myself to eat it.  The smell was kind of turning me off.  I looked at the nice selection of desserts and noticed that they had Tiramisu (oooh tiramisu), it was okay.  Washed it down with a Vanilla Milkshake...it was good, not too extra extra sweet, lol I can actually taste milk (lol I hope that made sense).  So I thought the items I ordered was meh...but I will try their breakfast menu soon."
