b"One of my favorites has now gone by the gutter.  Lack of attention to detail regarding reservation and celebrating a special occasion, lame excuse for credit system not handling chase visas and overall an unappetizing experience.   As a frequent customer to Mastro's I'm annoyed by the way management is handling us as consumers due to a fraud alert on our credit card.  Very impersonal, humiliating and overall disgusting.  We did enjoy the meal but don't feel I'll ever return to any Mastro's in the near or far future.  They even told us after trying to pay that chase visas have been an issue.  AFTER eating that is....BTW the credit was fine and all resolved but treated as lepers as we leave.  HORRIBLE"
