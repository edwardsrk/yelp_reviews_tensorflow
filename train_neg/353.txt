b'WORST Panda Express I have ever been to. I wanted teriyaki chicken but the chicken they had did not look edible at all. It was a pale brown so I asked if I could get fresh chicken. The girl said it was fine that it would take about 7-10 minutes. I waited 20 minutes for my food my mother was done with her food by the time I got my teriyaki chicken. And while I was waiting they ran basically out of everything that the line was out the door from just waiting for food to be ready.  And to top it off they were giving people who ordered after me teriyaki chicken before me! Do not recommended to come during busy hours!'
