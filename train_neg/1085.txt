b'This medical group is a mess! Telephone system is horrible to reach actual human. Frequently get stuck in phone tree, voice mailboxes full or calls not returned. You can complain to supervisor or receptionist but no one cares about fixing your problem short of offering an "I\'m sorry "Go somewhere else - avoid this group and both Thunderbird locations!'
