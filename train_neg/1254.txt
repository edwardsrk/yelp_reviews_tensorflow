b'We ordered 3 drinks. One large caramel macchiato, one small chestnut praline latte with no whipped cream, and one medium hot green tea with 2 ice cubes. We received a medium caramel macchiato, a medium gingerbread latte with whipped cream and a large matcha iced latte. When I asked to change the gingerbread latte for a chestnut praline, I specified no whipped cream in both English or French in case of a language barrier. Nope. Still got whipped cream on my medium latte.'
