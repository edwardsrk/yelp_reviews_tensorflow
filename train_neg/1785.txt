b"Dash pass Check in ahead of time not working.  Had to wait 30 minutes in info line to get number in the system and was quoted a 2 hour wait time.  Left and came back at 2 hours and still waited another hour.  I can't believe dmvs are still this bad.  Almost 4 hours of a day wasted on something that took the barely pleasant dmv employee about 10 minutes to process.  The DMV needs to get it together and figure out a way to be efficient and stop wasting people's time."
