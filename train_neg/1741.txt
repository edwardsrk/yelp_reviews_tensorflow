b'went two nights ago. Upcharge for Martini was $2.00 for Smirnoff bringing it to $8.00. Salmon was the salty side of the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea. Worst we have ever had despite the manager saying it was the best. Green chile was good but again salty. My wift threw up upon getting home. Will not return. The $15.00 coupon was not worth it.'
