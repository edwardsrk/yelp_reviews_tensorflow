b"I was at Momma's Organic Market which is a farmers' market in Peoria and Mollies Tamales was there. I bought 2 different kinds of tamales to have for dinner. The older man bagged them up and I paid and when I got home I was shocked at how small they were, what a disappointment. Next, after I steamed them, I noticed how hard the masa was when I cut into one with a fork. The masa was dry and had no flavor. It was truly tasteless masa. But here's what was disturbing more than anything else. The pork and beef weren't shredded as one would expect. It was mushy and greasy. There was a strange film left in my mouth after I took a bite. The filling was kind of like a tub of processed pulled pork or beef that you'd get in the freezer section at Walmart. It was also pretty tasteless. How on earth are they getting away with charging $30 for a dozen small, tasteless tamales? Thankfully, I only bought 3 pork and 3 beef. All in all, I was not happy with paying $15 for 6 small tamales that had no flavor and mushy filling."
