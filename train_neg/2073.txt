b"i've had better. it is really nothing special, but you could not tell that from how crowded the place got after i sat down in my booth. the burgers were on the thin side, but the fries were really good. i ended up eating all of my fries and my friend's when he wasn't looking. i ordered a milkshake, but it really was not a milkshake at all. it was a soft serve ice cream with hershey syrup frozen drink disguised as a milkshake. how can you do that and call it a milkshake, i will never fully understand?so either i was really hungry after spending the day at hoover dam or it was actually a decent meal. i think i was just hungry. the jury is still out on that one."
