b'So..... - they sold me a car with a bad clutch - the car only had 40k miles - took it back a couple weeks later when I started noticing it, I noticed it the first day I had it, but was like "maybe it just delays a little, it has such low miles" - nope - bad clutch - service told me it was going to be $160 to look at it - I talked to the salesman and finance - they blew me off like nothing - So I drove it as long as I could with a screwed up clutch - the clutch was $1200+ to fix at the dealer - I got it done at a local shop for just over $1000... #1 I and nobody I know will every buy a car from them again - #2 that is what I get for buying a foreign piece of crap - I will only buy American or Toyota (they are mostly made in the U.S. anyways) - Oh and free car washes?? - yeah if you have an hour or so to wait'
