b"Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street."
