b"Very disappointing. On the plus side, greeting and service was very friendly. Decor was cool. We visited on 9/19/12 around 11:30 am. The food was a huge disappointment. Two eggs, chicken sausage, potatoes and biscuit $7.99. Chicken sausage was hard, dry, and maybe made the day before?. Terrible!  The potatoes also could not have beent fresh, reheated, and tasteless. I'm not sure what the moon dust was they advertised, as they were plain. The signature biscuit was large and hard, cold and dusted with sugar. Poor value and bad food, not a good mix, sorry but I'm being honest.p.s. I originally wrote this after our visit on 9/19/12, but not sure why it was sitting waiting to post. So here it is, hopefully, gotten better."
