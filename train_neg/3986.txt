b"Be careful if you have food allergies. My food allergies were clearly stated to the staff, and they still served me a salad containing my allergens. The manager was nice and offered to refund me, but it doesn't fix the fact that I now am having an allergic reaction because of their lack of care. I'll never be back, and I hope others with food allergies never have to deal with this."
