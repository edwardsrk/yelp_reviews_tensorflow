b"When to this place to get a yearly eye exam for contact lenses.My first impressions were not very good. I had to wait to check in while the receptionist at the counter had a private conversation with another employee. Then after I checked in she let me stand in the lobby for 5 min with no seating. After I joked that they need some seating, the receptionist casualty said the waiting are was in an adjacent room as if I was supposed to know. How long was she going to let me pace? Why didn't she tell me where the waiting room was after I checked in? Not rude just unhelpful.The Dr was very knowledgeable, except he dilated my eyes when I specifically told his tech I didn't want it, and even signed something saying i didn't want it. The Dr. shrugged it off and said the tech didn't put it in the chart. That might be true, but the doctor never said what he was putting in my eyes or what he was doing either which i didn't appreciate.My real problem with this place is when how they make you buy contacts. Instead of the standard procedure where they go over you insurance and place your order after your exam, I was told to go home and use their website to order. The website doesn't answer your questions about billing and insurance issues and can be confusing if you are not used to ordering your own contacts. I tried to calling the office 3 separate times one day to ask questions about their website no one answered the phone. I ended up having to go back to the store to get my questions asked. They were helpful on that second visit, and I eventually placed my order. But seriously what kind of office sends you home to order your own contacts and doesn't answer the phone? Not good.Their ordering system is not customer friendly and the staff I met initially was not overly professional, friendly, or helpful. I've had way better experiences at big chain eye exam stores. I will not go back to this place."
