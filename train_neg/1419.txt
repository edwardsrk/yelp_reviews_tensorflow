b'HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Finding a nice restaurant in downtown Cleveland is difficult, but after seeing GHT boast vegetarian and vegan options, I was excited to try it out.  i will first start by saying that this place is NOT vegetarian friendly.  While they have had two main courses that  I could order, I chose the Winter Braised Vegetable Potee. It came  with 2 cubes of tofu, 2 cubes of polenta, and 6 cubes of vegetable and was grossly under seasoned.  It came in a plain broth that was not meant to be consumed and just made everything soggy. I could have prepared something at home that would have tasted 100% better and would have cost 10% as much.Futhermore, I was completely disgusted by those around me ordering entire pigs heads.  One came at a table next to me and I completely lost my appetite- which may have been ok because the dish I ordered would not have filled me up.  I cannot say one good thing about this place and I wish I could warn everybody to never go there.'
