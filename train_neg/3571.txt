b'I guess if you are truly desperate than this will serve a purpose. Just don\'t keep your expectations high.We had guests in town and they were gambling it up in the D and didn\'t want to leave. We just wanted to sneak away and slam dunk something quick so we weren\'t hungry. So, in that sense, it served its purpose.We got the 5.99 "special" of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza was obviously microwaved and very much like "Michaelina" type "pizza" you would buy in a grocery store. I mean..I held it down, but it was nothing special. The drink was pretty pitiful too...probably around the 12- 16 oz variety.Plus, how can you serve food and NOT have a public restroom? Isn\'t that a violation of some sort??? Seriously?If you insist on eating here, just know what you\'re getting into...2 stars.'
