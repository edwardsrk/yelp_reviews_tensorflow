b"I won't rehash the ins and outs of the menu, as many other reviewers have done this admirably.  We went for a late lunch (2pm) and the place was nearly empty, i.e. no wait.  Service was good but in all honesty, she didn't have much to do.  I ordered a custom burger, pink center on a brioche with lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo and ketchup.  It was above average but overcooked and not anything special.  The accompanying chips were also overcooked and not particularly tasty.  I really wanted to love the place, but for my money, I'll walk up the street to Murray Ave Grill for an exceptionally juicy, tasty burger that is actually cooked to order."
