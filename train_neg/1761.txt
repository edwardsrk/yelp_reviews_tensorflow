b'The hostess here was such a nasty, rude and untrained mess that I\'ll never know if the food is as good as it smelled. The words "I\'m sorry" and "Let me see what I can do" were never uttered. She acted as if the entire dining experience was really a way for her to get attention. The music was too loud, there was a very tight parking lot and there\'s just no reason to put up with this kind of nonsense with all the offerings in Phoenix for lunch.'
