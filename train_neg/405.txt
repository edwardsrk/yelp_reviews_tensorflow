b"I would give Neat Freakz zero stars because they are completely unprofessional! I made an appointment, confirmed over the phone and was sent a confirmation email the day prior to my appointment. At the very time they were suppose to show up, I got an email saying they canceled my appointment, stating I was out of their service area (not true according to their website). Now they won't even return my calls. Do not use Neat Freakz ever!!!"
