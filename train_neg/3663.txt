b"We have seen Dr. DeLucca since 2013 and he is absolutely wonderful. However, we will be switching pediatricians because the office staff is impossible to work with. Very rude each time we come, and there is typically some issue with records that she blames on me. Last time I somehow didn't have insurance anymore and they said I couldn't see the doctor until I paid 65$ up front. I asked if she had called my insurance, she said yes and they had said I am not covered. I called my insurance right there and within a minute of being on the phone was able to verify my insurance. Today I went for my daughter's well visit and the same girl said I didn't have an appointment. She said my appointment was last Thursday, which is possible but unlikely that I would schedule an appointment during a day that I work. Regardless of the error, she didn't not offer to work me in, and didn't try to reschedule the appointment. She said you don't have an appointment and that was it. I am very sad to have to see a new pediatrician but I can't handle the stress from the office staff any longer."
