b'My experience with Maggiano\'s was terrible. Our first impression was of the host, a young man with a very snooty, rude attitude. We were there on a Monday night and asked for a table on the patio. His response was "the server already has 7 tables out there and I\'m not giving her another". We had Crystal as our server. She was less than pleasant, not smiling or friendly at all throughout the entire meal. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. It was terrible. The eggplant was a mushy mess and the pasta was very underdone.  My honey had the spaghetti with meatballs which neither of us cared for. My daughter had the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Hers was the best  meal of the three. We will not return to Maggiano\'s and would not recommend this restaurant to others.'
