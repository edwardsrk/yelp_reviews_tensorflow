b"This storage facility is nice and seems secure. However, I wouldn't come here solely because I was told a price, I took a day off of work to come down and set it up, and when I arrived I was told a price about $50 more. When I asked about it their customer service was apathetic and didn't care to help. Hidden fees are a sure way to lose customers."
