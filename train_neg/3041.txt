b"I'll start by saying that the staff was great...everyone was very friendly and helpful; my low rating has nothing to do with them! The facility though...that's another story. I've been there a couple of times, and both times it smelled vaguely of sewage. The women's bathroom was also super gross and none of the toilets worked. Literally none of them. To top it off, there was a giant cockroach on the floor in the bathroom on one of my visits.Overall, this place felt dirty. I went back a second time because I thought maybe the first time was a fluke, but my second visit was over a month later and it was just as disgusting. Not going again."
