b'It\'s not that it was bad, just that it was basic "Americanized" Chinese food.  We were there for lunch and specifically went because it appeared to locally get good reviews on Yelp.  Ambiance is dreary and bland.  Service was relatively quick.  Staff seemed friendly enough.  Menu was basic and did not have uniquely authentic Chinese dishes.  Comparable to a Panda Express in our opinion.  Maybe there is just not a market for Chinese food here in Pittsburgh. Again, it was not that it was bad, but not sure we will go back.'
