b'My co-worker and I have seen construction going on in Noodle & Co\'s tidy corner of market square and were anxious to try it out.I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet "chili" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, "Asian", "Mediterranean", and "American" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle\'s success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.All that said, the prices are probably fair, especially affordable if you go sans meat/tofu although I would really appreciate an extra veggie option.'
