b"I absolutely love Gabe's. However this location is not so great. They recently had their Grand opening at their new location....I being a loyal Gabe's customer attended. I was treated so poorly. Prestine was our sales associate at the checkout. He responded rudely to our request, kept us waiting while he assisted other employees without even acknowledging we were still in front of him. We had to get a greeter to ask him why he stopped checking us out mid checkout. The dressing room attendant we're rude. I find it sad that it's such a nice store and a great location; yet a rude and cold staff. Very disappointing"
