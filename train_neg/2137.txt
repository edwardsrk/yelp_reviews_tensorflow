b"Had such high expectations from all the recommendations I got to try this place. I must say that I didn't see what the hype was all about after my visit. We ordered the traditional breakfast and build your own omelet. For starters, the toast was burnt and the eggs weren't cook as ordered. The hash browns, eggs, and omelet needed some serious seasoning. I ordered bacon and ham in my omelet, but if they were there they were masters of disguise. The person that brought our food was helpful, but nothing to rave about. She got us non-burnt toast, scrambled eggs, and jelly. Nevertheless, we won't be returning anytime soon. For the price paid I expected more, could've got better tasting food somewhere else."
