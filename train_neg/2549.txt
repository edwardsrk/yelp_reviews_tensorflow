b"It's great gelato... but WAY over priced. I think I paid $6 for a single scoop of gelato. The most I've ever had to pay. I have to admit that it was really good though. Cocolini is located in the Venetian... appropriate I think. I guess they can really jack up the price cause it's vegas and people will pretty much pay no matter how expensive things are."
