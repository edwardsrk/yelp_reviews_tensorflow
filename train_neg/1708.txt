b"If I could give this place negative stars I would. The radiologist cancelled the appointment for a study where the referring doctor ordered an exam that was not going to yield a higher amount for them. For example: ordering a diagnostic mammogram is an upcharge than a screening mammogram for radiology departments. It's the same exam but for diagnostic the radiologist shows his presence for a brief moment and the screening is more cost effective exam with the same outcome where a doctor reads is. Another exam: CT chest for lung nodules -- the radiologist at PMI will only perform the test with Contrast. A person is subjected to more radiation and same exam yielding the same results in without contrast was ordered. Dr Eisenberg cancelled the procedure and was sent away.HORRIBLE!!!!"
