b"When you go to tell the manager on duty that your storage got broken into and he can't even make eye contact with you not to mention he didn't even know I was talking a picture of him... I think someone is guilty of breaking into my unit and stealing my stuff  Don't store your PERSONAL items here, the employees here are crooks and there are NO good cameras to watch your unit. Surprised this place is not closed down by the BBB."
