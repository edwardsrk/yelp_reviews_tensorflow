b'We\'ve been to this restaurant many times over the years and have always enjoyed the food. However, since changing their name to "Tandoori House," they have reduced the size of their lunch buffet significantly, and food is not replenished once emptied. Very slim pickings really, and no mango ice cream! They\'ve also done away with the warm gold, red, green interior. Instead they have painted the walls a prison color beige and replaced the dark carpet with standard issue beige tile. Did I go to the prison cafeteria or an Indian restaurant? The staff was very nice, but they did not offer any kind of drink other than water. Sadly, the underwhelming food and stark, ugly decor equate to a deal breaker. There are many other Indian restaurants around Madison that bring their A game in all categories.  All those wonderful pictures you see of the buffet tables and the warm colors on the wall are long gone from here.'
