b'Went to Embury back in June and was severely let down.  I sincerely appreciate the owners/managers creating this place. This is exactly what Pittsburgh needs, world-class cocktails made by people who are passionate about it. The fact is probably the majority of bars around here still feature egregious, free-pouring, 1980\'s-style junk (think cloying sweet-and-sour mix with an unmeasured slosh of bottom-shelf "bourbon" for a whiskey sour). So I\'m thrilled that Embury exists and obviously has the talent and vision to produce great stuff. Unfortunately on our visit the service was simply appalling.  I definitely don\'t mind waiting for a drink, good drinks take time and that\'s no problem.  Where I have a problem is when one of the bartenders is flirting out in the hallway with a girl, and the other is nowhere to be seen.  Now, as much as "self-service cocktail lounge" appeals to me for many reasons, I don\'t think that\'s what they were going for. A final nitpick: I actually thought the atmosphere had a lot going for it but please get rid of the corporate office-style glass door.  I don\'t think 1920\'s speakeasies featured fully transparent doors to let the US Marshals take a free peek inside at the prohibition-be-damned party.'
