b'The restaurant looks nice. The service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious. However, the price of a disc of Seafood Noodle ( just regular seafood, not even lobster and enough for 1 person) is $34.99. The same disc in Los Angeles is typically around $12-$15. Their jacked up prices have left a bad taste for us. If you have a deep wallet, it is a good place to go.'
