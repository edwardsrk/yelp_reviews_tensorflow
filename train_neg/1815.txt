b"Only got one star because I cannot give Zilch!   Stay Away! The staff make it a dump!Manger and staff could not have been nastier!I had booked a mini Jacuzzi Suite as my husband's valentines gift. We had concert tickets for that night. Thursday I phoned to confirm, no prob, they even sent an email to confirm. Arrived at 6:00 on Sat and they told me that my suite was not available, and they had DOWNGRADED us to a regular room. I explained that we were local, for a reg room we could stay at home! This was a special occasion! The clerk would not bend so I asked to speak to the manager. She told me that my booking only entitled me to a room not any specific room!!! They could upgrade me for $100 to a full suite. I was over a barrel ( thuis was a gift and I was mortified to be arguing over the price) so I had to pay., almost $300!!! I paid more for a suite at the CRUMMY Eastside Cannery than I would have paid for for a 5 star on the strip!Incidentally the casino stinks like an old ashtray. Even with reservations we waited 45 minutes for a table in the Staekhouse."
