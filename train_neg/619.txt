b'This is the worst hotel I\'ve ever been in!! I reserved a non smoking room, checked in at 9 pm and was told there was only smoking rooms left. They brought some air purifier BS and said "that should help"! I am allergic to cigarette smoke, yet I am forced to sleep in a room type I didn\'t pay for!!! And dont even get me started on booking through Expedia!! Never again! If I owned this place I would be embarrassed! Not to mention the night security guy who was in the process of running off the homeless people (???).  Gross, dirty, smelly, and disgusting!!!  Negative 5 stars!!!!'
