b"A few months ago, I was very excited to try this place and I was disappointed. As far as decor, it is a cool and modern place. However the service is not great at all and the food is okay.I went on a Friday night and it was empty in there except for a few people around the bar area. My boyfriend and I were seated at a huge table even though it was the two of us. Then our server only visited our table a total of 2 times (once to get our drink order and once to bring the check). We had random workers stop by to ask how things were and to bring out our food. They weren't very organized and every interaction was kind of awkward.Although the service was not great, I believe that it could be fixed if the staff would have interacted with each other a little more and had a game plan for the few customers in the restaurant. They just seemed so unsure of themselves and we could pick up on it. Despite everything though, the chicken quesadillas were good."
