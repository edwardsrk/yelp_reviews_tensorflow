b'Went through the drive thru and practically had our food thrown at us as the drive thru lady was in such a hurry to rush is off. In fact she was in such a hurry she forgot to give us our drinks, and when she realized we were still sitting there she opened the window and said "what do you need?"  Horrible customer service.'
