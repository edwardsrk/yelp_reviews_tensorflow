b"Worst place ever! Warning ! Do not buy here! Bought a sofa here because my wife wanted to shop and support  small business,  3 months later springs started to pop out and poke. My wife called and Jacky made her cry she was very rude so I called, she was very nice to me. Told me to send pictures thru email so I did months passed and finally she asked me to call the insurance wich I did and they only cover fabric when we bought the sofa she said it would cover any problems with the sofa..lieafter that they didn't return my emails finally they asked me to come in and bring the pillows and that tgey would exchange them, the problem was that iyt wasn't the pillows  but the couch.. again they didn't answer my emails when finally I found jacky and she said they had sent me an email and that they would help me..she passed the phone over to her boss and he said he wasn't going to help me I bought a cheap couch and basically to deal with it $600 for a small couch, well that should teach usNever again."
