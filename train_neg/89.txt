b"I wish I could leave no stars. I waited in the drive through for 15 minutes even though there's a 60 second guarantee sign outside. Got no apology. Said to the girl 4 times what I wanted and assumed she got it right...which I should know better than to do. Got home and all of my stuff was wrong. I drove all the way back & got no apology and was told to wait in the drive through line again. Which took another 15 minutes. Never coming back. I'd rather drive to Henderson to get good service.It isn't my fault that you have a mediocre job and hate your life."
