b"Probably the worst service we've ever experienced. We were a party of 4 (myself, my wife, our 3 year-old and 6 month old). We ordered water and they only brought 2 of the three we asked for (nothing resembling a kid's cup) we eventually got another water when we ordered our food but it set the tone for the rest of the evening. Food arrived relatively quickly and was average sushi, nothing remarkable. We ordered udon with chicken and the waitress though the best place to put it was directly in front of our 6 month-old. Before we could even react he grabbed the plate the bowl was on and pulled it, causing extremely hot udon to splash out onto his hand. Just about every other customer saw or heard what happened and audibly reacted, some even asked what they could do, not one single employee even bothered to see if there was anything they could do. As parents we understand and accept it is ultimately our responsibility to keep our kids from harm but who in their right mind would put steaming hot soup in front of a 6 month old...?Our last roll was brought out about 5 minutes later and that was the last time we saw our waitress until we stopped her and asked for a container for the remaining udon. That was also the only time our water was refilled, after our food was gone and we were waiting for them to bring our bill. When we arrived it was not very busy, by the time we received our food the dinning area had filled up  but there was never more than 1 group waiting to be seated. Had they been swamped with customers I would better understand the lack of service but there was no obvious explanation. Needless to say we won't be returning; average food at best and even if the food had been exceptional the quality of service would keep us away."
