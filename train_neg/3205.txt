b"We went on Father's Day so the place was really busy but that does not justify the mediocre service and do not order strawberry waffles unless your like strawberry glaze from a can because that is what it is! Ugh! Also be careful with the build your own omelette as it was over $18!!  Granted we ordered egg whites and about 5 other items but geez, shouldn't the initial price include some items other than just the eggs?? We asked for a side of salsa and they server told us they have two types. We decided to try both. We got the bill and we were billed $0.75 for each!!  Our bad as we need to read the menu better as we were nickel and dime to death!! Thanks Brittany."
