b"I came to McDonalds to try the Grand Big Mac.Frankly, it tastes like a bigger Big Mac. Sadly, it carried on with the burgers that tasted microwaved from a precooked batch. The fries were fresh and very good. Also, they make you order from a new Kiosk. I didn't care for that and needed help twice. They need to keep a worker ready to help those of us who appreciate old fashioned counter service. It just hurts to think I could go to Shake Shack for a couple bucks more and have an awesome experience.You and I both know McDonalds. Nothing new to report."
