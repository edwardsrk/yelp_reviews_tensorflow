b'After paying 250 something for 3 nights! This hotel charged me 300 for "1" night!!! Once we checked into the hotel they gave us a "non-smoking" room. Which turns out to be a smoking room that smelled awful got my entire family sick! Then our neighbor decided to throw a party in their hotel room!!! We complained they gave us a new room. This new room had a non-smoking sign on the room smelled clean when we entered my husband went and sat on the bed and the bed caved in! Let me tell you my husband is 160! NOT a heavy dude! After receiving RUDE service by hotel front desk!! They did not want to refund our money even though we did not stay the night they STOLE 300$ for a piece of shit room we didn\'t even sleep in!! ARIEL the "manager" is rude and unprofessional threw a bitch fit about giving me back my money for the night I was not going to be staying!! Don\'t waste your time with the hotel they will not accommodate you!!! Waste of money!! Beware!!! They will steal your money over charge you and give you CRAP!! they don\'t give a shit!'
