b"So was driving to this place to check out new menu since they said in the phone they changed there menu and website was not working. Keep in mind i ALWAYS get delivery so i had no idea where this place was.  I called them cuz i was having trouble locating them. After being passed to 3 different people because they did not understand me the last one finally told me the address, which I already knew, without allowing me to speak. He then after giving me the address, proceeded to tell me he could not understand me and did not have time for me. He then told me have a good day and hung up the phone. I guess it didn't have time for my money either, which by looking at other Reviews would have been a waste."
