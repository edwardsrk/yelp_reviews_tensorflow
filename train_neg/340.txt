b'So here\'s how my visit goes--literally like 4 mins. I need new shades and I have a AAA-membership--win win. Just need to pick them out and go, Ray Ban, ALWAYS Ray Ban. I do NOT need a prescription, just the glasses. Husband stays in car because I am gonna be that quick. Walk in, male associate is on work phone, I walk strait to the women\'s sun glasses. Try on a pair. Try on another pair. Older female associate walks in from her smoke break--literally smoking outside the glass as I try on the first pair--and says, "Have you been helped, we are closing in 15 mins..." and continues to walk to the other side of the store. My husband walks in at the same time and asks, "Did you find any?  Have you been helped?"  And my response is "NO!"  I understand that you are going to close in 15 mins. And that you have lives to live. However, I am a customer, in the establishment that pays you to sell their product. And today, you did a VERY BAD job. We walked out.  The female associate went and straitened the one glasses that I didn\'t face--and then spoke disgruntling to the other associate. Wow!!  I know it\'s only one sale for a large corporation, and my meager $200 doesn\'t matter. But today was BAD!!  3.25.184:40 pm7700 W. ArrowheadGlendale, Az'
