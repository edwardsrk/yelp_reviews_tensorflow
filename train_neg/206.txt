b'Sadly disappointed on my last visit. We sat at  rooftop bar & service was terrible except for one waitress. Wish I had gotten her name because she knew exactly how to take care of her customers!  First, took forever for the waitress to even take our orders. Then, when the food came over (after we asked for it because it took too long) waitress was in a hurry to put down our plates that she spilled all the drinks!  Water & other drinks soaked our clothes, phone, and purse. The waitress ran off quickly to get towels & came to clean up table. Never once asked us or gave us towels to dry...other customers had to until we asked her. Mind you no apology for the spill. The manager even came over to clean up with no apology but rather cracked jokes!  Moved to a new table & she quickly drops off more drinks (on the house) & almost spilled them all on us. Thankfully the new waitress took care of us.  I mentioned our meal should be on the house, when  manager comes over to say they can do the drinks only. After all, it was only water!!  The nerve!! We had to tell him it was drinks other than water. Poor customer service from manager and waitress.  Had to ask to comp dessert. Not recommending to anyone!'
