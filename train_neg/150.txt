b"Wow, sooo disappointed! Our first time here and the brunette waitress at the bar had no personality and was very unfriendly, obviously hasn't smiled in a very long time. Pretty sure it's the same one in the other reviews. We waited 45 minutes before anyone came back to see if we needed anything. Would of been great to have a couple more drinks and another appetizer but apparently we had our invisible attire on. We like to find places for work events etc...but will never come back again. Too bad, the atmosphere was great but the service is terrible and so is the bartenders attitude. Tried to contact the manager Sandra, had to leave a voicemail."
