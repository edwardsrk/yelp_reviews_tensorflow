b'Paid $8 for a veggie sandwich which I thought was a bit much.  It was not fresh tasting and all my toppings were falling off.  My husband got a grilled chicken sandwich and they put so much mayo and the grilled chicken looked like it was microwaved over all was not very good. Friendly employees though.'
