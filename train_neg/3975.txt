b"Shot the M4 here, my first full-auto. They explained everything thoroughly; the store and range area were clean and well maintained. My complaint is that the firearm kept jamming, so I wasn't able to dish out as many rounds at once as I wanted to. I followed all of the instructions, and yet the M4 still jammed four times in one magazine; the range instructor could not determine the problem, but whenever it jammed he just cleared it and handed it back to me. I came here to shoot full-auto, and I could have done semi-auto in Canada, where I'm from. As a result, this was a waste of my money. They should have compensated me, or at least given me a different firearm after it jammed the first or second time."
