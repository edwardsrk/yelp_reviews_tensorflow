b"Close to home so we wanted to give it a try. Ordered a couple rolls (no avocado), tamago and a beef bento box. They made the rolls with avocado so they had to remake it. I felt bad but I asked them for no avocado when I ordered because I'm allergic. Also, the spicy tuna roll was not spicy but lukewarm. Dined at the bar and one of the chefs were right in front of us the whole time...he wasn't even the one that took our order or made the sushi. It was really awkward because only 4 of 8 bar seats were taken with guests and he was just standing there watching us eat. Ah, so weird. There must be something else you could be doing...The bento came out and the beef was good. They forgot to bring out the rice and when they did it was a little on the dry side. The waiters reached across and in between the two of us throughout the meal. Just may be inexperience. There wasn't any consistency in service either. Check took forever to get. There were a total of 6 guests in the whole restaurant. Overall, the service was interesting. I'm no food expert but the food is okay and I left feeling uncomfortable and awkward. Oh, it's probably from the chef watching us eat the whole time."
