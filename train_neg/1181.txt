b'PLEASE READ! IF YOU HAVE A SERVICE ANIMAL THEY WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO STAY HERE! They refused us with an emotion support animal. She is a small sweet chihuahua and they claimed she would ruin the room. According to Jason the front desk manager you must be able to prove what the dog does for you. For so many people that depend on their service animal for so many physical and emotional things, this could be incredibly embarrassing to be asked to demonstrate what their animal does for them. DO NOT book your next stay at South Point.'
