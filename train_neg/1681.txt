b'I was ordering a few donuts , and made a  Uhmmmmm sound while making a decision on my next Donut and I hear one of 3 girls behind the counter imitate my Uhmmmmm sound and were giggling and chatting even as I was paying. I will never go back to Bosa Donuts. They need to have there employees respect customers , not make fun of them in an other language.I was very insulted being a citizen of this country , why do I have to go out of my way to figure out their culture etc. They should be speaking in ENGLISH , not Thai or what language it was , it is very RUDE.'
