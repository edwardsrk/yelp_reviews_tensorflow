b'Reserved a room for our daughters volleyball tournament.  3 weeks before tournament she was injured so we could not attend.  When we tried to cancel we were informed that because we (unknowingly) reserved under the "advanced purchase" section that we could not be refunded!  BULL!!  We have been traveling with clubs over the past 5 years and sometimes things like injuries with the girls happens and families have to cancel.  Every other hotel we have heard of let the families get a full refund.  Sometimes with a little persuasion, but still they were refunded.  Hyatt House refused and would not even offer a partial refund.  BAD customer service.  They have the authority to refund customers if needed.  Will never recommend this hotel to ALL of the clubs we know of that travel to Phoenix for the yearly Volleyball festival.  They don\'t even deserve 1 star.'
