b'I once got busy in this burger king bathroom. Not all the humpty dance has it hyped up to be. I have been hittin up BKs across this great country of ours for decades.  So I was quite disapointed with this joint when I had to spend most of my time in the restrrom.  Maybe it was something I ate before my double whopper, but I doubt it. :('
