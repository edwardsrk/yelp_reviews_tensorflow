b'I made a reservation days in advance for NYE, when we got there we were seated at the back of the restaurant.Our first server who was a tall brunette, she was awesome. Then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. "Is that a allergy or just some preference?" excuse the hell out of me? I worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. You should simply agree and smile. She then gave my boyfriend the same attitude....Our food came, it was pretty good. I was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said "Here is a steak knife" and proceeded to storm off. We watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years. I just really didn\'t appreciate how we were treated. Probably wont be returning for another meal there which is a shame.'
