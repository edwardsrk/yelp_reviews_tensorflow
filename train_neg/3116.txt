b'We went for the first time and were very disappointed. The food was very average and somewhat over priced. Salads are extra on a $16 entreeAnd the least expense salad is $6. The waiter we had was poorly trained.We were offered "happy hour" pricing on drinks and were charged full price when we received the bill !   Had we known we would have ordered what WAS on happy hour. Again poor training on the waiter he made no adjustments to the bill. The is somewhat new but I would recommend training to the wait staff and some price adjustments.'
