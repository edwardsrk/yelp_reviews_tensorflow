b"Very bad experience from check-in.We were in rush for cirque show. First they block parking from the Main Street, going all the way around took 15 minutes. Then self-parking is another long story. Then check-in machine says our room is not ready at 8.30pm!!! Kinda walk around and wait email. We were in rush. I went to concierge, fortunately she was still working, so she helped. But what if we'd come 15 minutes later? Then we'll be without the room at 9pm!!! And couldn't change and go for the show.Room itself is a disappointment. No fridge!!! No coffee machine! Not even saying microwave. Not all the light works.Attention: they charge to use WiFi! In 2018.Pool:we came to the pool with 60y.o. mom. They asked our IDs. My mom didn't have any with her.There are no signs anywhere that seniors need to bring ID to get into the pool. Stupid! Not welcoming.Very very very bad experience. I should have read yelp reviews before booking, not only booking.com"
