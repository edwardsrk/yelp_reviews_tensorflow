b'new italian restaurant. they make their own sauce and pasta "everyday" according to the waitress who served us. food was okay. garlic bread sold as "charity bread" was very tasty....apparently net proceeds are donated to some charity. because it is new....staff are inexperienced. they brought out a water bottle which they couldn\'t open...served us a pizza called "americano" instead of coffee americano (not sure why they thought we\'d order 4 main dish for 3 people)...and when the coffee came, they forgot about cream which we had to ask for...by the time we got the cream...coffee was cold. still charged us full price, whopping 4 bucks for a very small amount of coffee...4oz maybe less. we were entertained for a while by the mishaps, but found the overall experience underwhelming. decent ambiance, louder music than I\'d like, service can be significantly improved.'
