b"Absolutely avoid this place it's a last resort for me and even then I regret it. Undercooked pizza sparse toppings and the rudest employee ever. They need to just shut this place down I've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. When you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! I hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot."
