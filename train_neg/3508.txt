b"We came here after discovering Pho Kim Long had a 1.5 hr wait. We really didn't care where we ate, as long as we got some pho before heading home back to LA. This restaurant is really the epitome of: sit, order, eat, pay, leave. I had to hold my menu up and repeatedly ask for service before someone came to take our order. And even then they were in some sort of rush that they got two of our orders wrong. After that I didn't even bother to ask for anything else. The bill is paid at the front 'cause apparently nobody there got time to help you out. The food is your typical pho place food. Nothing spectacular and nothing horrible either."
