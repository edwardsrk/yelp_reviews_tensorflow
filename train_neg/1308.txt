b"Dot dot dot has gone from decent to worse. I've been here several times and each one has been progressively worse. I recently showed up with a group of 5 and was told that I could use the NoWait App to register my party to enter later after eating at Sir Edmund Halley's. The app did not let you register 5 people for the wait list and we instead registered for 4. When we showed up, we were told we were in the wrong for showing up with one more person and were forced to go back on the wait list which was another 40 minutes (there was no line outside and people were pouring out of the bar). You guys need to do some work with your seating methods. How does one person cause you to have to wait another 40 minutes to be seated? I would like to understand before I come back. I will also be urging others to avoid until this is figured out."
