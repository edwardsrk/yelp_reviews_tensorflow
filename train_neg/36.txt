b'DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE!!!!! I wish I would have looked on here first as now I can to attest to the fact that this company is a total scam!!!  Their website looks so professional and said family business so I figured they would do a good job!!!  I was just charged $760 to rekey 6 locks!!!!!!  Total scam!!!  I am sick at my stomach as I had my elderly parents there to meet them and they totally got taken advantage of!!!!  At my own house in Colorado I had 12 locks rekeyed by a different company and paid $240!!!'
