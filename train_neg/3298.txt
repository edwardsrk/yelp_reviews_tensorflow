b'I don\'t  want this review to discourage you from going; I want it to make you aware they may have significant kitchen issues when it comes to the cooked food.  I really like the feel of the place; have eaten there twice.  Highly recommend sitting at the bar and eating the sushi/seafood.  Here\'s where the problem came from:  after Sushi (which was fabulous), we decided to try main courses.  We ordered a prime new york strip (they were out of prime filets) with the crab & asparagus topping (approx. $55 - not cheap, but worth it if the kitchen knows how to make it), along with the fried oysters as recommended by the bartender.  Sounds like a truly decadent meal, right?  WRONG!!!!!!  The Medium-Rare Steak, not only came out fully cooked, but even worse, came out as what I call "baked steak" - slowly cooked.  I couldn\'t believe it.  So, if you want a prime steak, personally, I would go to a restaurant that is good at making them, such as Flemings or Mortons or Maestros.  If you still decide to go here & want to have steak, be warned.  Also, they forgot to deliver our fried oysters and when I asked how much longer for the oysters, they suddenly appeared, completely cold.  So, we had a very very disappointing meal.  However, I would still definitely go back to sit at the bar and have sushi.'
