b"Nothing like ordering Postmates from The Vig and opening your steak salad only to immediately see a piece of plastic sitting on top of it. Wow. It even has some dried black gooo in the middle, like they clipped the top of a chocolate dispenser and the ring landed in my salad. Well, I figured I'd separate that garbage out of my food and eat, I'm hungry. First bite I put in my mouth is an ice cold (if not thawing) piece of squash. If I wanted something plastic and frozen I would have went to McDonalds or something!. Won't be ordering The Vig again... thanks for the $24 edamame!"
