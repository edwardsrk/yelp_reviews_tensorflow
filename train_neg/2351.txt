b"Had dinner with my gf couple nights ago. The place itself looks very nice and elegant. However my gf's steak came out medium well when asked for a medium rare/rare. We were one of two couples eating at the time In the entire restaurant, I don't see how the steak could come out over. I had the rabbit pasta dish. Although good, it was not good enough for the price and quantity given.  I asked the waiter about the size of the dish because I was very hungry. He definitely exaggerated the size by at least double. I was given an appetizer amount of food that I finished in less than 10 bites. Once our bill came I noticed we were also charged for a glass of wine that we did not order. We had no wine at all that night.I would give them some time to get settled before going back for a second time."
