b'I don\'t understand how a hotel with such a name can be so bad??.. So many people talk about The W like Drake for an example "I\'m at the W but I can\'t meet you in the lobby" but this W isn\'t the same like the rest. The others are bigger and the rooms here just feel cheap. You\'re paying this high price for a room that\'s not even the size of a regular bedroom at home. They have LG TV\'s from like 2007. In this Scottsdale area you shouldn\'t have anything so cheap especially if your rooms are so expensive for no reason. They give a speaker that connects to IPhone 4\'s... Like? What? I stayed here randomly and didn\'t have a tooth brush guess what? They didn\'t have one either? With this W being in Old Town places with bars and clubs you\'d expect them to have these things because a lot people get a room randomly and don\'t drive home so you should have these things for them. Also there are no balconies just a window that opens again doesn\'t make any sense. For the price I would say no. If you compared to a motel 6 I would say the motel 6 has probably all the same things this place has. Save your money and find a different hotel. The only reason this place gets two stars was the staff members downstairs called me boss at 5am when I was coming in drunk.'
