b'Went there to get my nose pierced last month and the piercer did not sterilize the stud. I watched him bend the stud with a plier and his bare hands and did not sterile after. After the piercing he recommended 3 items in which I bought all 3. 2 of the items were pointless (wasting money) and the other one was a sea salt spray in which did not do the job it should have done. I was left a month later with a huge bump. Hypertrophic scarring (which is normal) but mine got so big and nothing would make it go away. I was so desperate I went back into the shop and asked what to do. The piercer called it a "keloid" in which was totally incorrect. A keloid and hypertrophic scarring is completely different. Then he told me to continue to put tea tree oil on it. After 2 weeks of doing that I was so fed up. I decided to go to a RELIABLE piercer in north Olmsted in which he was great. He said my piercing was not pierced at the right angle and that I won\'t be able to wear a hoop and if I did it will stick out. The piercer at all tattoos pierced it straight where as your suppose to pierce it at an angle. He changed my stud to a higher quality stud (which I wasn\'t offered at all tattoo). I am SO disappointed with my piercing and will most certainly not return. I would not suggest going there to get your nose pierced. Unless you want a dreaded experience.'
