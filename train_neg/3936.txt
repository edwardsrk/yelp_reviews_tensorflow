b"Food is great. Service is the opposite. We went with no reservations. The hostess was rude and dismissive when we told her this. Let us know we can go to the bar which is fine, but a kinder attitude would have been appreciated. One of our meals never came and the forgot a drink too. No apologies and nothing done to correct it. If the food wasn't so good this review would have 0 stars. Shame too because the restaurant has a great atmosphere overall."
