b"I've been very pleased with my experience at this store. I haven't had a bad sharpening here, and the goalie guru (Kevin?*) has been fantastic. I went in once to try on leg pads, and even though I told him that I absolutely wasn't going to be buying anything that day, he spent a good 30 minutes with me. Other employees have also been very helpful with one exception.The exception: on two separate occasions the same employee has given me inaccurate information. Both times I was looking at some dirt cheap entry level catching gloves. Both times this guy has come up and told me that it's an incredible deal on top of the line gear. Now if you know anything about goalie gear, you know that there's a HUGE difference between a $150 entry level glove on a clearance rack and a $450 top of the line glove. I don't know if he was intentionally BSing or just clueless. I'd be really angry if I bought a piece of crap thinking it was a steal because a salesman lied or made things up.(*Edit: His name is Justin, and he's incredibly helpful! Sorry, Justin.)______________________________________________________________________________Edit: I'm knocking off two stars. I had two experiences at this store in the last few months that I was living in Madison that really soured me on the place. 1) I had them install a new pair of cowlings on my skates and they did a lousy job. There were two issues: 1) One of the cowlings was clearly pinched too tight. When I pointed this out, they referred to the fact that it was under warranty instead of trying to make it right. 2) A rivet in the other skate wasn't installed correctly. It sticks up a good quarter of an inch. This was a really, really obvious problem, and I'm deeply annoyed that they didn't get it right.2) I purchased a very pricy pair of knee guards. One of them burst a seam just a few months after I bought it, but fortunately it was under warranty from the company. I brought this to their attention and waited for a replacement. And waited. And waited. Months went by and nothing was happening. The manager assured me that they would get me a replacement as soon as possible. I assumed that the manufacturer was completely out of stock and that they were making their best efforts to secure the replacement. They weren't. I ended up moving to Pennsylvania and going into another Hockey Giant where I saw those exact same knee guards on display. Ultimately, the Madison store was able to transfer my credit, so I finally got the replacements that I'd waited so long for. It really pissed me off, though, that these knee guards existed in their system and that they didn't figure out a way to get me some in a timely manner."
