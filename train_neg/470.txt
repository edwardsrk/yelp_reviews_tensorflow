b'SCAM....SCAM...ALERT... I took my van in on 2 March 16 and I had 29,700 miles.  My battery was dying so I made an appointment at 5 to have it checked out.  After a little over an hour Keith called me and stated that, yes my battery failed and that it was replaced under warranty.  I am like cool but then he showed me the multi point inspection sheet that my front brakes were at 3 and 2 mm and my rear brakes were at 7mm.  He said it would cost 329.00 to replace the front brakes but I had my kids so I told him I couldn\'t at that time but will comeback in a few days.  So I left and went home and told the wife the outcome.  She then stated " weren\'t the brakes at 8 or 7 the last time it was there?  I was like yea your right, so I went and took out the invoice and looked on the inspection sheet and yes it stated my front brakes were at 7mm(Green) and rear at 5mm(Yellow).  That was on 18 Jan 16 and my mileage was at 28,500. So within a month and half, 1,200 miles later my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and rear brakes went from 5mm back to 7mm.  WOW...I bought this van in Las Vegas in May of 2014.  We moved in June of 2015 to Pennsylvania and drove the van.  So from May 2014 to Jan 2016 and 5 to 28,500 miles my front brakes went from 10mm to 7mm and rear brakes went from 10mm to 5mm which sounds about right.  So doing the math, that\'s the front brakes losing 3mm and rear brakes losing 5mm.  Now from 18 Jan 16 to 2 Mar 16 and 28,500 to 29,700 miles my front brakes went from 7mm to 2mm and my rear brakes went from 5mm to 7mm, so again doing the math my front brakes lost 5mm and rear brakes gained 2mm.  So just under 2 years I lost 3mm, then under 1.5 months I lost 5mm...I don\'t think so.  They obviously tried to scam me into getting front brakes when I don\'t really need them and I would have got them if it wasn\'t for my kids being with me at the time.  Either the techs don\'t know what they are doing or this is a scam...I bet on that it is a scam...stay away from them....'
