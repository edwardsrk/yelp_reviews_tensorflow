b'I haven\'t had the best experience here. The receptionist isn\'t the nicest. I got a new family doctor here but she never seems to remember me, and always asks the same questions, then looks through her notes and says "oh right, I already asked you that." She suggested that I do an ultrasound, then forgot that she suggested that, so I brought it up and she actually asked, "why did I suggest that again?" ummm...you\'re the doctor??  I remember at the end of one of appointments, after completing a test, she said: "you should do this every year. you can even come back here if you want." ...isn\'t she supposed to my GP? They also don\'t schedule appointments on the same day, even if a time slot is available... which is weird?'
