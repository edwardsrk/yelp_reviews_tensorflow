b'Just be aware that this management company will charge you extra on your move out bill. I used to love this place.... It was quiet, nice staff, and the apartment had a great view. I lived there for three years and recently moved out. I got a move out bill from them where they charged me for an extra day after I already moved out and returned the key...  They also charged me extra for a carpet cleaning and special treatment. When I called to ask about the two charges I was told the carpet company determined that the carpet needed it due to some light test and that in order for the 30 days to be filled I needed to be charged an extra day however my 30 days was already fulfilled because I gave them the notice on the first and that month has 30 days in it....'
