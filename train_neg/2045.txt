b'Quite a disappointment really.  Over priced non-specialty grocery store that only has you coming back simply because nothing else is close by.  Limited produce selection due to space, nothing is fresh, huge sweets section, not sure why. They do have prepared meals hot and ready to go but they are served in hot plastic and the plastic is placed on a heated table to keep the food warm and toxic, hot food and plastic is pure poison,  by now you know how I feel about plastic and hot food. Plastic is the root of all evil when it comes to healthy eating. Speaking of healthy, they have a Good-life located just above with a lot a traffic as a result, you would think Longos would make some effort to provide some healthy alternatives at this location. Get rid of the Starbucks or white sugar counter and put in a juice bar and replace the white sugar section with some products conducive  to the gym and healthy eating.'
