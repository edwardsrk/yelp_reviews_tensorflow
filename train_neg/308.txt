b'I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted "Speak"... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry "what the hell are you talking about?" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.Why would I ever set foot in a business who can\'t even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.'
