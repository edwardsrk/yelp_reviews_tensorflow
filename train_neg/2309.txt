b"I live in the area, so I was excited when this place opened up last year.  Since then I've been here twice.  Once I ordered a burger with duck fat fries,  and once I had a the rabbit burger.  I had high hopes for the burger with duck fat fries.. but they were just okay. I didn't care so much for the rabbit burger, but I don't hold that against wild burger I was just trying something new. Both times I felt a little gouged on the price. On their website they have the details of their daily deals, most centering on having a pint with dinner. But i find it irritating that there are no prices for their regular menu.Give it a try if you want to try eating an exotic animal in burger form. I won't be coming back."
