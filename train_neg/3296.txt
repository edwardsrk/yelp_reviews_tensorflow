b"We booked a mini-suite from the picture shown on the Internet. The room on the Internet was very nice but when we checked in our room was the old section of the hotel. The room was dark and dingy with spots on the carpet and shower tub with a curtain. When I told the woman at the desk that the room was not what we booked, she immediately got an attitude; but we did get the room shown on the Internet at no additional cost. However the is what is called bait and switch. They also have hidden daily fees called resort fees to the tune of $32 per day. All and all this place is not worth the price and we'll never stay there again."
