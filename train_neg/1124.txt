b"I had the worst experience here. I was at self checkout and realized a lipstick I wanted didn't have a bar code. The rude older Mexican lady working took it from me instead of having a runner get a new one. (That's what they do in the south.) Anyways she started off rude and told me to hurry up because she had other customers. I told her that I had just got there to go tell everyone else at self checkout to be faster. She was so rude the security guy came and asked me if she was harrassing me.  I have not been back there. People like that shouldn't get away with that shit. I spoke with a manager but doubt anything was done."
