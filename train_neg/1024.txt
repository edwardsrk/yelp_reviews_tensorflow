b"If you love your self and the person(s) you are with, I urge you not to take them here. My friends and I have made a few mistakes in our lives and this is certainly one of them. We ate there Wednesday night (it's now Friday as I am writing this) and some of the people in our party still had stomach aches until this morning. The food looked good, but it wasn't. EVERYTHING had a sweet taste to it and nothing was a few degrees above room temp, so there's no telling how long it had been there. The sushi selection looked rough, but I noticed a few brave souls trying it out. Hopefully, they didn't get sick like all of us did. Service was ok, nothing really stood out. I don't think any of us will be returning."
