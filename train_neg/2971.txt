b'Let me start by saying, I have not truly had a UTL experience yet; however, my mother and her friends went to the UTL and I requested that she bring back a dessert for me.  She called me and read all of the delicious sounding desserts, I selected the Lemon Bundt Cake for her to bring back.  When the dessert was presented to my mother and her friends, they thought the cake looked very familiar to a "Sam\'s Club" cake or "Costco".  They asked if the desserts were homemade, particularly the Lemon Bundt Cake, the server stated that the cake is "outsourced".  When I opened the take home box with the Lemon Bundt Cake, I looked at my mother and said to her, "This looks like a Costco\'s or Sam\'s Club cake."  My mother kind of chuckled and said "that is exactly what we thought."  I asked how much I owed her and she said it cost $5.95 but don\'t worry about it.   I am extremely disappointed and slightly disgusted that the UTL charges $6 for a slice of Sam\'s Club or Costco\'s cake.  My expectation exceeded the UTL\'s potential to produce a high quality dessert.On a better note, I will say that my mother had a pleasant dining experience, sans the dessert, and I am not opposed to personally visiting the UTL; I just will not order dessert.'
