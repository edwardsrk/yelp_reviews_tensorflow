b"An alright place to get your nails done.Just alright. At first glance everything seemed pretty standard for a low end nail place. The lady who did my nails seemed like she was taking measures to do a really good job. But after I noticed leftover nail polish from the color I had before all over my hands and the polish she used all over my cuticles. The place itself is really dirty. There were nail clippings all over my station and the whole just seemed kinda of yellow tinged and unsanitary you know? English also kinda minimal. I give it two stars instead of one Cus the lady was lukewarmly friendly, although kept trying to up sell me to shellacIn short go here if theres nowhere else open. $7 polish change $15 manicure $26 pedi. Meh there's better"
