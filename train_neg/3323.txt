b'Stayed at the Flamingo Hotel over the Memorial Day weekend, Sunday and Monday was okay.  6:30 am of Tuesday we were awaken by sound of jackhammers!!! There is a construction site next to the hotel. And the best part is at 9:00 am, no water!!! There was a water issue in most of the towers at the hotel and they are looking at it getting fixed in 3 hours. The front desk advised us to take a shower at the fitness center but there they run out of hot water. Continued on with our check out at 11 am. We will never stay at the Flamingo Hotel ever again.'
