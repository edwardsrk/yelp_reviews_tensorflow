b'Service is so slowNot the first time here neitherThey priorities the pickup ordersThey clean n busy doing other things instead of helping the line movesA back wall can wait to be wiped if the line is to the door and people r so frustrated because your too slow!Seriously!!!!As soon as she stopped n came to help the line was moving.Made me late to everything, I would avoid this particular location :/Nothing wrong besides super slow'
