b'Went to this location. Signed up the day before. My name was not on their "check-in" list, but I had my email confirmation. I have donated to United Blood for many years. I was excited about donating because after traveling overseas, I was not allowed to do so for a year. Today was my on year anniversary, meaning that I could finally donate blood. I monitored that date for a year, looking forward to the next time I could donate. So, I get there, my name i snot on the list and they say they cannot take me in because I am not on the list! So, all my preparation: eating well, being conscious about not doing certain things, spending time on the prep questions, waking up early, driving all the way to the donor center; nothing mattered. She didn\'t even seem honestly apologetic. She (Della) just said "sorry", without truly caring. She even offered e a voucher for a burger. Ha! I was there ready to give whatever blood kind they needed the most. All the beds where empty! All of them! I sure hope this doesn\'t happen at other United Blood donation centers. What a shame that would be. United Blood, specifically this center, need to remember how much effort their donors put into each donation and they need to focus, get their act together, and remember what their purpose and commitment is. For me, I am very disappointing. I will continue to help, but seeing this; it will not be with them. Tip for donors: call before you start your drive to the center (even better, before you start your prep questions).'
