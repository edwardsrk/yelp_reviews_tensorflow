b'First time in Cleveland. After we got seated and ordered, we realized this is the Radisson Hotels restaurant. I ordered the burger medium/well. I believe it was a frozen burger which came on a wanna be pretzel like bun. I would rate my meal a 1 star. My son got the herb roasted chicken which he really enjoyed. Definately overpriced.'
