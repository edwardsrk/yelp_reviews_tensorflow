b"So my wife and I wanted some sweets.  We came here they asked if we wanted to dine in. I informed the lady we would only be getting dessert. The lady sat us and walked away.  People payed and left. Came and sat down and got drinks had the menu  explained to them. After ten plus minutes  of being ignored we decided  to leave. On the way out asked to speak with the manager.  He was the manager for the night.  Explained  what had happened  and he didn't care. He did say if I wanted to stay but I showed him they already sat my table.  I am a visitor. A tourist. I do not expect  extra treatment. Just service. I asked for a corporate  number  he refused to give it.  I am here for 3 more days and was very excited  about the menu  it looks fabulous. But if they don't want to serve you because  you will not be a regular that's a shame.  Could have said sit here I will make it right.Or let's get you a better seat over here and we will make the dessert  right now.  I would have even taken here is a sugar cube but instead it was oh well post or call what ever bye."
