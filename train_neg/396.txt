b'My experience here was horrific. The service here is terrible. My green curry was so salty, that I had to ask for them to fix it. When they brought it back out, it was still salty. I asked again, this time I asked if I could exchange it for red curry. The waiter said,"No, I can fix it again." The third time they brought it out; they just added coconut milk and it wasn\'t even spicy anymore. I will never come here again.'
