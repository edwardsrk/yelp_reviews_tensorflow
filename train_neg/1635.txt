b"The art of bartending and serving food is not that complicated. Be attentive, constantly observe your customers to see if they need booze or more food and smile from ear to ear. They have failed to to all! tips should not be expected, but rather earned. This all points to poor management. I didn't like the service but food was good. cheers"
