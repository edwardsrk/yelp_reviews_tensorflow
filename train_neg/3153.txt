b'Patria as a restaurant is average.  Two reasons: First it is not Spain and some times the food can be good... sometimes.  The chef is not Spanish.  I believe she was trained in Spanish Cuisine, but there are some important details on her training that are missing.The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL, really beautiful, the bar, the decor in general... The food is ok, I recommend the paellas, and from the tapas the croquetas.  For dessert the churros are excellent...People go to Patria because of the ambiance, people go to drink.   After 10 pm is vibrant, a happy atmosphere full of of young and attractive people that go more for a a drink and experience than for the food.The service gets 1.5 stars... It needs to improve A LOT, from the hostess to the servers, and the person that helps with the wine needs to be more communicative. Management is average like everything else.'
