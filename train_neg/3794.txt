b'Very unimpressed. The eel and tuna were very fishy tasting. They even forgot the sauce for one of the rolls. The hot mess roll was meh. Not worth the price and the quality is sub par. Fake crab on a $21 roll. Really?  Shishito peppers were delicious. Skip this place. There are far better places to eat at Mandalay Bay and far better sushi in Vegas.'
