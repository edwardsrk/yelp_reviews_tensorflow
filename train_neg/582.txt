b"We returned from a day out sight seeing and I decided to look for some inexpensive ($$ or $$$) french food.  I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice. As others have stated, there is only one entree.  Your only choice is whether  you want soup or not and we ordered it.  We also ordered some house wine and were served bread and butter with it.  The bread was good and so was the wine - what I'd expect for the price. The carrot soup was ok.  It was a bit bland but not bad;  That was the highlight of the meal!  The 'salad' was iceberg lettuce, walnuts (right out of the bag) and a bland vinaigrette dressing that was very acidic.  They could have at least toasted the walnuts if not glaze them and it wouldn't take much effort to improve the looks and flavor of the salad by adding a bit of arugula or other mix.  The main course, was of coarse, the steak and fries.  The steak was very low grade, tough and not a lot of flavor.  The sauce helped a bit.  The fries were fine for what they were.The price is $26.95 per plate which is way too much for the quality of the food served.Service was ok, not bad but nothing special either.When we go out to eat, the biggest factor about whether we like it or not is the food.  The food here is way below average and the price is way too much for what it is."
