b'Horrible. Where do I start? I dutifully let the hostess know when I made my reservation that I would be needing the vegan menu. When I came and she was whisking me to my table, she pointed at a tray of desserts and said "You don\'t want to know about the desserts, do you?" Um, I guess not. It was several minutes before someone cane to take my drink order. Apparently, my waiter Roger was busy so this fella was going to fill in for a sec. Ok. I ordered the Dandelion cocktail and some water. After about 20 minutes, same fella came back and said "Roger is really backed up so I\'ll take your order." Mkay. I ordered the Buffalo cauliflower as an appetizer and the "red curry braised tempeh" for my entree. The cauliflower was really good. Then I sat there for an interminablr amount of time with an empty water glass, a crappy cocktail, and no breadsticks and watched a guy spend 30 minutes setting a table for 6 like he was Mr Carson and the Queen was coming to dinner. Did I mention the tables around me had bread? Then some guy with a ridiculous cart of copper cups asked me if I wanted a Moscow mule. No, but I\'d like some water. At somepoint in this mess, my tempeh arrived and it was horrible.  When the person I assume was roger dropped the dessert menu on my table, I was Visibly ticked off. A manager of some kind came around to make nice since I was fuming. His excuse was that Mr Wynn was going to coming in for dinner. He comped my tempeh and I stormed out 37 dollars poorer. I hope for their sake Mr Wynn did not show up to that poor excuse for a restaurant.'
