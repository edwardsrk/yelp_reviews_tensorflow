b"I am really disappointed in the Friday night seafood buffet.  It used to be one of my favorite places to go because they used to have oysters on the half shell.  I always thought it was expensive but the oysters made it worth while.  The food choices have really gone downhill but the cost is still high and not worth what you get.  I was there on February 5th and only had a couple of items that fit on a small saucer.  I am not a picky eater and couldn't find anything that appealed to me.  I was going to ask for my money back, I'm really sorry that I didn't. Where did the oysters go???????/"
