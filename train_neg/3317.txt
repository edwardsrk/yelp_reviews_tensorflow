b'Check your bill!  SO and I had a dim sum lunch together.  Food was ok, but the selection was challenging.  They were pushing the fried foods and noodles.  We were looking for more steamed dim sum items.We noticed several tables around us that had more items show up on their bill than they thought they ordered.  Keep an eye on our check-off list.  The servers attempt to keep it facing away from you.  Make sure the count lines up with your expectations as you go.  We did not have that problem.  We got to the checkout and the lady actually placed a different amount on the credit card machine that our bill added up to.  It seemed like this was not an accident - when we noticed, she ignored our complaints.  CHECK THE BILL - NOT TRUSTWORTHY.'
