b'Snooty staff. Was deeply offended by the horrible service we received. Hostess was arrogant and made statements like, "we are usually a reservations only restaurant, you are lucky we can for you in at all."Not sure how she even had a job with an attitude like that. When I asked to speak to a manager she said no-one was available. Then some guy came up and claimed to be the manager\'s without even taking the time to respond to my complaints of bad service all he had to say was that a table was available. He was not truthful, however. No table  was available.We left before we were seated. Won\'t be back. There\'s a better greek restaurant down the road with significantly better service.'
