b"I had stayed at this place during Memorial Day weekend. When I reached at hotel there was no self parking available so have to do valet parking. Hotel room was very substandard wasn't clean, wash basin were getting clogged. Furthermore while driving back to home I found many stuffs like drug bottle (Medical Canabbis), cigratte making papers etc. I was shocked and annoyed to find these articles from my car. I complained about it to Hotel Valet manager but he said none of his employees can do it and ask me to send evidence so that he can investigate on it. Till now I haven't heard back from him."
