b'I have been to a lot of events in many cities across the United States and this venue is one of the poorer facilities I have been too, almost exclusively because of experience.The entry into the venue left hundreds waiting out in the cold until after the show started due to excessive security scanning, an understaffed crew and slow ticket processing. Once inside the poor stair lighting and aisle marking made it very difficult to find our seats. We missed 50% of the show we came to see despite arriving 30 minutes prior to show time. Will not go back here for anything.'
