b"Went with a party of 8 on a Friday night.  Two wanted bone in rib eye and we told at 8 pm they were out.  Huh?  It's a steak house.  Manager less than sympathetic.  Also one NY strip came out well done instead of medium.  Very slow delivery of entrees as well.  A very expensive and poor experience."
