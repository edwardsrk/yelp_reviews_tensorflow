b"My sister and I decided to try a new salon. I am very familiar with gel manicures and how long it takes to get them off. The longest it has taken for a different facility to get the gel off was approximately 10 minutes and they at least checked up on me every 2 or 3 minutes to make sure I was doing okay. Not here. The lady that did mine, soaked my fingers in acetone, wrapped them in tin foil, and then directed me to sit at a different table  while she took another walk-in and started a manicure.  A different woman (that was doing my sisters nails at the time,)Tiffany, was really sweet and checked up on me about 20 minutes later to remove the tin foil. I sat there for 30 more minutes after while more clients came in and other techs quickly rushed them to a table or pedicure chair.  After a total of 50 minutes, my sister was finished with manicure and I was acknowledged. By that point I was so livid that I didn't stay for the manicure. If you like being ignored this is the place to go."
