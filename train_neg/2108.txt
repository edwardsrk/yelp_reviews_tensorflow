b"Well, I'm not quite sure how they were lucky enough to get a 4 out of 5 on Yelp. My trip there last night was less then stellar. We were out for my sisters birthday (a table of 12 of us all drinking). The place was dead inside . By 10pm they closed the kitchen. By 11pm they did last call, yes last call at 11pm on a Saturday . Yes there drinks are nice but who does an 11pm last call on a Saturday night ?!"
