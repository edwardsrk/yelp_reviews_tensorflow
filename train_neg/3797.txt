b"While looking for a new barber in my neighborhood (usually I drive to Scottsdale and it's worth it but ran out of time today) and I stumbled into this place. I meant to go the place near it, but thought since I was here I'd stay. Talk about slow service. Got in a little before six, and didn't leave until 8pm... My haircut was very generic and wasn't what I asked for. Not bad, but  not good. Won't be going back there again, but not too upset or anything because it'll grow back. Seemed kinda amateur skill in the shop compared to places like the Local Barber on 7th and far from par when comparing to the Dapper Devil in Scottsdale"
