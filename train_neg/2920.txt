b'I\'ve been here numerous times sat at the bar and had a few appetizers, love the bartender she has always been great.. I totally wish today I would have sat at the bar just like every other time, needless to say I was terribly disappointed with the service, food and overall experience, not only did I have to wait for a waiter once he finally came to "help" he was rushed and short got us some waters and came back to take our order, after taking our order we waited at least 15 minutes before we saw him again at which point we asked him to bring us a couple drinks, once he brought our drinks my fianc\xc3\xa9 realized his beer was not the one he had ordered, he then waited for this waiter Richard H. To come back so he could address the issue, once we were able to see him we noticed he was busy with another table so my fianc\xc3\xa9 went to the bar and asked the bartender to change his beer for the one he had originally ordered, we waited about 20 additional minutes and our food finally arrived it was cold and stiff I tried to mention it but Richard kept running up and down our area he finally asked me if I wanted some A1 sauce, at this point I was halfway into my steak I was so hungry and didn\'t wanna go through the hassle of having to wait an additional 20+ minutes for my food..... He finally brought our bill after asking if we wanted some desert... We put our debit card on the card holder and he took it but when he brought the bill back for it to be signed our card had gone missing... To be later found in his apron!!! I was very disappointed angry and irritated all I wanted to do is leave.. Needless to say I will not be coming back here and will not recommend this location to anyone else!!'
