b"Sigh. What a bland place. On all counts.Perhaps dim sum just doesn't do it for me, but I'm pretty sure that my issue with the food was that, although it was objectively okay, it had an objectively low flavour content.Almost worst for me was the dim sum service; the service was as convenient as a buffet and just as charming. Again, perhaps this is how it should be, but the servers didn't even pretend to care what we might find interesting. They were not in the least bit interested in making suggestions. Whatever. They didn't care. I don't care.The space is huge though. I bet they can fit a million people here. So there's that I guess.Oh, and the tea was excellent (even if tied to the teapot with a plastic tie). Yes, the tea. If I visit Silver Dragon again, I'll take the yum cha, hold the food."
