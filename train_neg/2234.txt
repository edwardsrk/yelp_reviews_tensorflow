b"This place was my 'go to' restaurant for two decades, but since the new owners took over I've stayed away. The menu prices have soared and you have to pay extra for every little thing 'a la carte' now. The salads/soups are not included with dinners while quantity and pricing has gone to the dogs. Why must all good thing come to an end?"
