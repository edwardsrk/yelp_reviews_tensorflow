b"Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again."
