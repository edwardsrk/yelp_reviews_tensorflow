b"I've been here a couple times and am less than impressed.  The service is ok, my coffee cup was never empty but the menu is limited in my opinion.  I eventually settled on the mushroom and brie eggs benedict and although my eggs were supposed to come out medium, they were under.  The benny itself was edible but I wouldn't order it again, the potatoes that accompanied it were decent but again, not awesome.  I don't know what but it's lacking something."
