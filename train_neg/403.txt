b'The worst hotel experience that I have ever had!! I had reserved a room here for a weekend during spring training with my boyfriend and friend. When we first arrived we just dropped off our bags and left, not really looking around at the features the room had to offer. Later that night we came back to call it a night when my boyfriend called me from the bathroom to come see what he found. He had smashed a bedbug that was pretty big which was far from comforting. After this experience we looked on the floors and bed and saw at least 4 bugs running across the room and sheets. If that wasn\'t exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom. Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts. They offered to move us to a different room but at that point we wanted nothing to do with the room.  The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name. If you\'ve ever seen the movie " The Birds", it can compare to the experience that my friends and I shared at this Motel 6.'
