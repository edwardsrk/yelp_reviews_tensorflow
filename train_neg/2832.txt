b'I choosed to go to flor de sal to celebrate one of my team that so deserved a great meal. Based on the reviews that I read, including the reviews I religiously read in toronto life (which have not disappointed in the last year) I was expecting a lot from this restaurant and got disappointed. It was regular food at best, the flavors were not unique and the presentation of the food (except for a vegetarian meal specially ordered) was ok at best. The food arrived cold and the polenta served as an accompaniment to the branzino was caked to the cool plate. The service was nice enough, but flor de sal failed to deliver on the eating experience I was expecting.'
