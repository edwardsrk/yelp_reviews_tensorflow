b"First thing I noticed was there was no attempt at creating a comfortable environment. Food was good. High quality and fresh. BUT chips and salsa were $3.50 and when we asked for another round of salsa they charged us 2 bucks but didn't mention it. We found out when we got the bill. To finish it off, they don't take American express.They don't understand how to make customers comfortable. So I strongly urge all potential patrons find another place to grab a taco."
