b'Stay Far Away From This Place!!!!I have visited a couple of Urgent Cares in the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, but this was by far my worst experience.  I arrived and was seen rather quickly.  I was in a lot of pain, but thought that I was off to a wonderful start.  This all changed once the door opened.  The technician who took my vitals was very cold and aloof.  By the time that the nurse practitioner Pamela Pritchett arrived my blood pressure was through the roof, which it NEVER is.  Mrs. Pritchett walked into my room in a huff.  She slapped her computer on the table and rarely made eye contact with me.  She was very belittling and condescending.  Both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience.  I will never return, and cannot recommend this facility to anyone.  There are several other offices in the area that can least provide a shred of human decency and compassion!!!'
