b"Dante's hell had nine layers, max & erma's only had two because no-one was risking dessert. There are bad experiences and then there are how can so many things not be right simultaneously.  This is the later.   We taxed the staff with a party of four, complicated by two people arriving later.   The first party ordered an appetizer and this would be high point of the dinner experience.   First problem was the coffee refill that never came. It was requested with the good order of the second half of party.   Or about ten minutes later.   The first two meals were a chicken salad and a black bean burger, they came cold.   The salad was skimpy on dressing and chicken. The black bean burger was not good and worse was the cheap tasting guacamole add the only flavor.   Second problem was two orders of soup taking 20 minutes, but when you order French onion soup, it takes time to Brown the cheese.   Oh wait the cheese wasn't even melted but floating on a slice of bread.   The chicken tortilla soup was awesome (something had to be right).  That French onion soup was a $2 up charge because it only comes in a bowl, not a cup! Here's the surprise the food arrives right after the soup,right after.   So the food is getting cold before you can get to it.   Third problem the Cajun shrimp & pasta should have more than six shrimp for $13.99 and the cream sauce would be nice to have enough to cover the pasta!  The other meal here was Laredo steak and was nothing either good or bad about it.   Well maybe the string beans should be bigger than a piece of twine.   A hour of meal bliss and a talk with manager led to a free meal. But att last the draft beer was good. There are much better places near here like Perkins, arby's, speedway gas station, ....."
