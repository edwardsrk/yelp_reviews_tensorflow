b'My family and I have been here a handful of times, and everytime the food is so good, except today. The country potatoes were way to salty, everyone in my party who got them said the same thing.. we told the waitress, who then asked us to scrape a little on a plate so she could taste them,(like we were lying about how salty they were).. I got turkey sausage  and it was cold. My son got scrambled eggs and they were really runny.. The food is honestly better when the place is packed.  The 2 waitresses that work there, Lynn and the blonde haired lady are the most rudest people I have dealt with, unless you are one of their regulars, don\'t expect a "Hi, welcome to biscuits"..  They rush you, they roll their eyes if you ask to many questions, more so the blonde haired lady.. The friendliest one is the bus boy. He is always so nice!  We definitely will not be going back for a long time, if ever...'
