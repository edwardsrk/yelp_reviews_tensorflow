b"Unprofessional! Why,the photographer had to ask someone else how to pose us. Two adults and 2 children. How could that be hard. He couldn't get the lighting right either. When we finish I couldn't even look at the results until the next day. Why, because the person was to busy visiting with a friend. Looked at the reviews thought this place would know what there doing with 5 stars. Never ever again!"
