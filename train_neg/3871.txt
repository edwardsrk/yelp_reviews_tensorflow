b'Food 1/5 stars. Service was good so they earned another.. the best thing on the table was the coconut juice. BBH (bun bo hue) lacked some major lemongrass action. Their banh canh cha ca was unexpectedly spicy from the cha ca. Broth was so basic with their not soft enough banh canh. Banh Beo needed more meat than just a tiny bit of shrimp. Not to mention the ga roti, chicken was not flavored enough. The safest thing to order was bun thit nuong here.'
