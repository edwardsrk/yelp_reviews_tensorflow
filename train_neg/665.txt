b"A bit pricey. My early experiences at tanning salons were places that included cold washcloths, decent products to use to freshen up after (wipes, spray deodorant, lotion, hairspray), and also had things like small water bottles or juice, candy, hair ties...**** they made their 'improvements' and the place still sucks. Service has gotten worse and so impersonal. The value of services and amenities is not worth the $$$."
