b'This review is based, solely, on my experience ordering a gift certificate online.Ordered a gift certificate online. Thinking: "Yes, this will be an awesome gift for my sister\'s birthday!". I chose, and paid extra, to have them ship the certificate to my home. A week and a half passes, no sign of the gift certificate. I call, and it never shipped it was "missed". This was on a Friday and the gal said she would ship it out that day. I live an hour away. It\'s now Wednesday the following week, I call again and they want me to wait a few more days because they say it was shipped on that prior Friday.  Now you and I both know that if you mail something an hour away, it takes a day (at most two) to arrive. It\'s now Thursday, and it came in the mail; the postmark was on Tuesday. I\'ll more than likely have to call again to see if they actually mailed another GC or to use this one. What a disaster and complete waste of time.'
