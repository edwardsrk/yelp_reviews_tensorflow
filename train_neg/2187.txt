b"It was ok. I mean, it wasn't Bazic or anything. lol (I'm such a Bazic Elitest).Soju was cheap, which is always good. But, I wonder how much soju was, actually, in there because my friends and I bought must've been 7 bottles of soju in an hour half span and I was still standing.3 bottles at Bazic get me blurry.Soju was presented in a Patron bottle which was a nice/cool touch; BUT, the bottle was soooooo sticky. Obviously because it spilled out when being poured in.Whatevs. Meet me at Bazic up the road."
