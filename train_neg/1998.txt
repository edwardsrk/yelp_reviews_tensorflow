b"The girl working the front desk was super rude and unhelpful. Had to ask her several questions to even understand the process. Finally got in room and it was not cleaned. Bed was messed up and tv wouldn't work. Never even got an apology when we asked for a new room. Will never stay at this hotel again or any microtel."
