b"I waited 2 hours for my meal to be delivered to be said by someone who didn't gave a fuck about the situation that my meal is never gonna be delivered! WTF? Fortunately I called because I had waited forever for my food!...and sorry guys but we're in Montr\xc3\xa9al here so you should have bilingual employees. Even if I'm French-Canadian I wrote this review in English! Nobody's speak my mother tongue there."
