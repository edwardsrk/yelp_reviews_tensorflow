b"Fix your store, it is so poorly run that I cannot even go there. There are never pizzas ready, they don't answer the phone to make orders, the employees are rude and condescending and the customers are trash!Our neighborhood is not this gross but if I was from outside the area, I would think it's the slums. Totally unacceptable, get this store fixed immediately. No excuses.It also has a foul odor to it...the pizza is worth 5 or 6 bucks...nothing special just fix your stupid store and standards"
