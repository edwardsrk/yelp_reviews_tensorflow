b'BEWARE!! Do not go here. They have absolutely no customer service. I showed up 1 min late for a class. Besides not letting me in the charged me a late arrival fee. They then told me to callback at noon to get into a later class. After calling for over an hour I kept getting a voicemail. I left 2 voicemails and an rvw of my experience. I get a call back from a woman who would not give me her name and after calling me dumb and cursing at me she hung up. I called back the same woman said they don\'t want to talk to me and stop calling. A paying customer!! The owner then sends me a long email saying I need to pay the late arrival fee. No apology or anything for the complete trash of customer service they offer. I called groupon to get a refund and explain the situation and the groupon rep was completely surprised at couldn\'t believe it. She issued me a refund with no problem. Stay away from this business. I searched reviews after this experience and they all say the same thing. They wanted my credit card info to "keep on file" for a groupon purchase.'
