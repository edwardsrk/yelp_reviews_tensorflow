b"Scheduled an appointment for a couples massage for my sister's birthday about a month in advance. We needed a Saturday appointment since I was visiting from out of town, and Donna asked for a $30 deposit, which isn't unheard of for spas. I received an emailed receipt for my deposit and confirmation call the evening before our appointment. The morning of our appointment I was contacted by Donna through text that her daughter had gone into labor and she would have to reschedule. Since I was visiting, we were not able to reschedule and we had to cancel. I asked if the deposit could be returned to my card, and Donna stated that her card processing system was down but she could send a money order.  This was 3 weeks ago, and I have yet to receive the money and have been unable to get in touch with her. Definitely do NOT recommend Donna!"
