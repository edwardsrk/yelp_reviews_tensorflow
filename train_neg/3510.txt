b"Once upon a time, before i started yelping, I loved hanabi because you get your bang for your buck and I thought It was amazing ..that was before I knew better.Coming back to reminisce my high school memories, I was utterly disappointed. Yelp had turned my taste palate into a diva ! Once seated and ordered, we were brought a dozen of starters like soup, salad, congee (random, I know!), fried salmon, tofu and edamame beans. Once my food came I understood why they gave away so much free apps.On the menu, Order J looked like it had everything I craved: assorted sushi, sashimi, tempura , and maki rolls..... But what came on my plate was 8 pieces of pre frozen salmon, 4 pieces of California roll, and a hand roll. My friend ordered something completely different and he got the exact same stuff. Nothing on my plate even remotely looked like the food I thought I ordered. The tempura was definitely the worse I've ever had. There was zero panko batter. Just a small piece of fried shrimp.You'd spend 12$ here ... Why not spend the extra 5$ to get yourself some quality sushi ?I'd give one star... But because it is so damn cheap, I guess that's one thing you have to sacrifice : quality."
