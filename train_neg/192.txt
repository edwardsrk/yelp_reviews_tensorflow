b'Total ripoff.  The supervisor was sent out because the first guy they sent (twice) couldn\'t clear the clog.  He poured some chemicals down the drain then gave us a lame story that my pipes were old and we would need to tear into the walls and floor to replace the lines. My husband went to Home Depot and bought a $14 snake and after about 15min had the clog cleared. They still charged us $135 and when i called them to tell them we cleared it ourselves, they just said "that\'s great". Really???  Buyer beware!'
