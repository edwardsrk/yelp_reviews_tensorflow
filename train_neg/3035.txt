b"I am a frequent customer of Tropic Jewel. They have a nice selection of beads and materials to make your own jewelry as well as pre-made jewelry. I dabble in both options, but I am in no way a connoisseur of making jewelry. Because of this, I ask a lot of questions and need help picking things out. That is where my issue is: the customer service sucks. The women don't seem to want to help me and their answers to my questions feel almost patronizing, as if I should know the answer. Or, perhaps they do not have an answer for my jewelry-related question, but they do not seem to have any remorse for this.Tropic Jewel is incredibly close to my apartment and they have not lost my business because the prices are low, it is convenient, and I like to support local stores. But, I hope that they will take this into consideration because I know I am not the only customer that has experienced their less than friendly customer service."
