b"I went in for a baliage and did not like the results because it looked like nothing had been done to my hair. So I had them re do it, but it ended up even worse. It looked like they just straight up bleached my hair, no blending or depth, started way too low, looked like one solid color instead of highlights, and I lost 3 inches because of the damage they caused! I had to go to another salon and pay $185 to fix what they did. You can really tell the difference between the photo in my other review and this one how a correct baliage is supposed to look. Also, they don't even style your hair at all after they color it unless you pay extra. Worst experience I've ever had at any hair salon. I wish I could get my money and my hair length back!"
