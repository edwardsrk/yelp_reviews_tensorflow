b"not that impressed. I really wanted pancakes from ihop but my boyfriend's mom wanted to come here, so had no say. They had 3 pancake selections to choose from - I ordered the lemon poppy seed and wasn't too impressed and the pancake texture was kinda cardboardy. I also wanted a side of hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns are actually potatoes, so that was another disappointment. I also ordered lemondae which tasted pretty weird and watered down. Only food I find impressive here is their bran muffin - it is very tasty with butter. The restaurant itself is nice and clean and nice service, but I am definitely not a fan of their food."
