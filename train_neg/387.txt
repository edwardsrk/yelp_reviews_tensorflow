b"I'm posting this review while sitting in the waiting room to see Dr. Waltman.  This is a review of just the front office staff.  I was asked to come to my 10:15 appointment 30 minutes early to fill out the necessary me patient forms.  I arrived 55 minutes early.  Provided my ID and insurance card then day to complete my ppwk.  After I finished I went to turn it in.   The girl in the front glanced at it and told me(rather rudely) I had to fill out the insurance portion.  I said to her that I thought that was why they took a copy of my card.  She gave me a funny look and said you have to fill it out.  I took the forms back and walking away I muttered.... that's a pain in the ass.  After completing them I handed them back to her and she said they'd call me.  About 10 min later I was called by a different lady to pay my Co pay.  As I was talking to the new lady the ride one interrupted our conversation by saying that I'm not allowed to swear in here, that kind of language isn't permitted.  Lol I'm sure I looked at her crazy because honestly I had forgotten that I even said anything since it wasn't directed at her.  I asked what I said and she said you called me a pain in the ass.  I told her I want talking to her and that comment was more to myself.  She replied with you're not allowed to talk like that.  At this point I'm getting irritated because I honestly wasn't talking to her and I had explained that,  so I told her... generally speaking if I were going to ball someone a pain in the ass I would look them in the face and straight up tell them that they are a f#%#ing pain in the ass.  Then I sat down.  Needless to say, this was not the best 1st impression they could've made on me."
