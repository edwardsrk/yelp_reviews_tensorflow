b"1st Visit: Took order home - Donuts stale2nd Visit: Entered store with intention to make sure donuts were fresh, but no counter person in sight; rather friendly, loud conversation from back of store - Waited for a bit and then left. Kidding around in the back apparently more important than selling product.3rd Visit: Counter person busy with coffee machine, didn't acknowledge customer. Continued with a more important activity going from one side of store to the other complaining that the steamer didn't work. Another case of ignore the customer.Summary: 3rd visit was last visit; doubtful that I'll bother with Dunkin' again."
