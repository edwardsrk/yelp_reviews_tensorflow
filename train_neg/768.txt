b"Go to another Louboutin store. The sales lady here is very judgemental and I honestly never received such horrible service. I'm used to sales reps from CL to be super helpful, courteous and patient. I mean I'm about to spend a couple thousand dollars. I know I walked in with a jersey and some jeans, but never judge a book by its cover. Wish I got her name that way I can put it here, but she isn't worth my time. I went to Crystals to buy me shoes. Go there! The sales ladies are much much nicer!!"
