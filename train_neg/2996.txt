b"This place is in the strip and basically overrated and expensive for what it is! I paid $47 for 4 little tacos, a steak bowl plus $3 for additional pastor meat (which I had to remind them to add once I saw my bowl with no additional meat yet they were quick to charge the additional $3) and a Mexican coke! On top of that I asked them if I can get a small amount of chips to dip in the salsas and they said no I'd have to pay for them!? REALLY! Next time I'd just stick to tacos el gordo at the end of the strip Just suck it up and go up to the room hungry!"
