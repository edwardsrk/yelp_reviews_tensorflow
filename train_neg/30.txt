b"Seriously, where are the vegetarian options? All the dishes (even the salads) have either meat, fish, poultry or eggs in them. I have heard that this place is good from my friends but I can't join them since there is nothing for vegetarian or vegan people to eat here. Vegetarianism is becoming more popular everyday and restaurants like this one have to learn to adapt and cater the needs and wants of people becoming vegetarians or vegans. Sadly, this is one of many restaurants who fail to understand this change. There are very few places where vegetarian or vegan people can have a proper meal. I'll come here only when there is a proper vegetarian/vegan menu in place."
