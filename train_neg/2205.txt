b"Jun's Special - all of the meat was really tasty as well as the sides but I personally don't think it is worth the $14-$15Bibimbap  - ordered the bibimbap without the hot plate, not sure what the difference is but it was $2 more. As for the dish itself, there was no flavor and it just felt greasy. With Bibimbap being a main dish, I expect it to be good, or at least have some flavor. Personally I like the vegetables pickled and they weren't, the plus is that the veggies were fresh. All in all, the meat was good but not as tasty as a wholeI think the total came to around $25 which isn't bad. This satisfied my KBBQ craving but definitely not worth it IMO. Don't see myself going here again"
