b"First night here and so far I have been unimpressed with absolutely everything. We tried to upgrade our room a week ago by phone, and was told that we could not upgrade our room until we got here. When we arrived we were told that we could not upgrade our room. Nothing else was available. Not a great first impression.Our room has a great view but it also has mascara and blue eyeshadow all over the bathroom floor. Obviously the floor was NOT CLEANED.The cocktail waitresses in the casino were rude and so was the woman who gave us our Togo food at Johnny Rockets. We have three nights left and I think at this point with the lack of service, hospitality and dirty hotel I'd rather stay my next 3 nights in a cardboard box under an overpass. I DO NOT recommend this place."
