b"I don't know why I bother. After a log day at the park and really no urge to cook I figured why not and have some fast food. Being vegetarian really the only place to go is Burger King. When ordering my childrens meals I specifically asked for no pickles and no mustard and not to any surprise when we got home of course there was pickles and mustard. For my vegetarian sandwich I asked for mayo (which they charged me .75 for) and yup that wasn't on there either. The person taking our order must have been doing something else brig the fact that I had to repeat myself 6 times and then drive thru girl well let's just say her attitude wasn't any better. No smile, no hello, and no here's your food. Needles to say I've been staying away from fast food for a reason and Burger King you pretty much proved my point."
