b'I was looking for a really good wings spot so I came here. Wedges were soft and tasted good however could not really eat them cause it was over seasoned and heavy in salt. Wings were ok not good for it to have "Wings" in the name of the establishment, but to each its own. sauce ok. Atmosphere was welcoming server was great. The attraction for this place is good to get a drink with friends if in the area or if you want to try a different random sauces with names like "Voodoo" then you will like. Glass wear wasn\'t very cleanEntrance not easily accessible due to construction.'
