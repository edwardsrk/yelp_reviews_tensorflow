b"I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try. Variety was lacking and the old fashioned donut I tried tasted like it was left out overnight. Not fresh whatsoever. Two star experience for sure !"
