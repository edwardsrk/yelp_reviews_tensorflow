b'Before writing this review I went to the front desk and tried to explain my dissapointment and was completly brushed off. The night we checked in the room rate given over the phone through reservations was higher than what I was quoted - the front desk would not accept it ($9 difference) the Expedia rate (more than a 50% difference) and still the gentleman would not match or discount the room rate even after seeing what I had pulled up. When I checked out I was not asked how my stay was so I vocalized my disappointment with the lack of service I received the night before and all I got was "oh ok I will let him know" I was shocked! No discount no apology Nada! I then requested the managers name and contact info and she replied "that\'s me" as she wrote her name and email on a card. Locals, find another hotel that value you as a customer - this by far was the worst experience ever at any hotel in Vegas that I\'ve ever come across. Shame on you South Point for not appreciating business from the locals!'
