b"Extremely disappointed. Ambience and service were fine. Ordered hot green tea. It came in a cute kettle but the tea didn't taste good. Opened up the kettle and pulled out the tea bag - it was Bigelow green tea, one of the cheapest tea available at a grocery store. No Japanese restaurant should serve Bigelow green tea! Makes one wonder if their fish is also of lowest quality. Did not order any fish and walked out."
