b'This place is horrible. I was towed from a U of I parking garage, which is fine. I get the fact that I wasn\'t parked in the right spot, but there is absolutely NO information on anywhere in the garage that tells you where your car would be when towed. I don\'t go to U of I so I had no clue and there is very limited information on the university website telling you where your car is taken. I finally figured out where I was supposed to go this morning after an entire weekend of being stranded in this place with no car. I arrived at the towing place fairly distraught and the man working there was the most unpleasant person I\'ve ever encountered. This man gets his kicks from a predatory and mutually extortive/beneficial relationship with the city of Sham-paign by commissioning tow trucks to drive around and impound cars while giving inadequate information on how to get your car back. The other kicker is the fact that the offices for both U of I parking and Tatman\'s are not open over the weekend so I had to wait until the entire weekend to be over to find out where my car was and even if I had figured it out earlier, I would have had to pay an extra fee to pick up my car "after hours". Once I had gotten there, the aforementioned man working at the desk quite literally berated me in the office for trying to figure out how to pay my tickets online to get my car released. I was clearly upset at my situation and this man snapped at me and upbraided me for being stressed out with what was going on. On top of all that, the amount I had to pay total for both the ticket and the towing fee was $400 dollars which is way more than it honestly should be. Horrible place, horrible service.'
