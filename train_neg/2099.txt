b'Went there last Friday before going to see a movie at the Queensway cineplex, the food there is good. I ordered the small chicken burrito and it was more than I can eat. Thought the food was good, the service was, lacking, to say the least. The staff there were doing everything but providing good service. I was the only person there and it still took 15 mins to make my order. I didn\'t even mind the long wait time, but the unfriendliness from staff there was awkward and not welcoming at any means. Though like the food, I WON"T be returning due to poor service. I will however, try a different location in the future.'
