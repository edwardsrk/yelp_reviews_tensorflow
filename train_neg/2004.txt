b'I love bookstores, and I love to spend some time browsing and flipping through the books and having a generally pleasant time. I would have enjoyed it more, though, if this store were organized better. It was nothing but an exercise in frustration going through the fiction section. I am not sure if it was a matter of the store being in transition, or what was going on, but the "General Non Fiction" shelves included a number of books that should have been filed in the fantasy or science fiction shelves, which were incredibly tiny as it was. It make finding anything incredibly difficult, as it was hard to tell if they just didn\'t carry a particular author, or if it was mistakenly shelved elsewhere.Service was perfectly polite, the Starbucks inside is pretty comfortable and a good place to relax. However, if a bookstore wants to compete with Amazon, they really need to have their stuff together and not annoy the customer.'
