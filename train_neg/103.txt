b"We went to tour the Stetson earlier today. When we arrived we were told to wait 20-25 minutes for a tour because the ONE person working was assisting someone else. Luckily after waiting a few minutes, the assistant manager showed up to help us. We took a tour and the community seemed nice enough. However, the assistant manager who was helping us was completely incompetent. She did not know pricing or what was available for our time frame. She also took us to see an apartment and then we found it was occupied so we couldn't even see it. It looks terrible for the company that she was so incompetent and unaware of the community. At the end of the tour, she told us that she didn't have anything available at the end of July when we wanted to move in. We told her we would be in touch, and got up to leave. She proceeded to do a hard sales pitch (probably because her boss was around the corner), and tried to get us not to leave. We left with a bitter taste in our mouths. We looked on their site later that evening and found that there were several apartments becoming available in mid to late July. Guess we will take our business to one of the plenty other luxury apartments in old town."
