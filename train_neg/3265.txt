b'I feel bad leaving a "meh, I\'ve experienced better" review for Muramoto. But, I have definitely experienced better.  *At* Muramoto!  (Both locations.)  Posting this review in the hopes it helps them up their game a little.We stopped by for lunch around 11:45 on a Sunday and it was nowhere near as busy as I usually see it.  Were seated right away (also unusual -- I\'ve usually experienced at least a few minutes\' wait).  I thought, "This is great!  We\'ll be in and out and on our way in plenty of time to catch a movie!"  Maybe I jinxed us.We got waters and menus right away, but that was where the good service ended.  A server never appeared.  We didn\'t actually notice for quite awhile because we were having a fun time talking amongst ourselves, but one of us looked at our watch and realized we\'d been there 25 minutes with no service after the waters we grew a little concerned.  Just as we were starting to realize we\'d been there such a long time, we overheard the table to one side of us was complaining that they hadn\'t been served what they ordered.  The table on the other side was having a conversation about how long it\'d been since they\'d last seen their server...Given that we had other plans for the day, we made a collective decision to just get up and leave!  Which I have never, ever done before.  I was pretty disappointed because I love their food.  But given it wasn\'t clear if/when we\'d receive any (or, based on the neighboring table\'s experience, that we\'d actually get what we\'d ordered?) we gave up on lunch there and just went and got sandwiches.  Meh indeed!'
