b"the service here was terrible and they didnt prepare my salad like i asked. my friends and i waited thirty minutes to get our order taken and it was an all around sub par experience. the food and atmosphere were good, but the service wasn't good at all. the woman who sat us down forgot about us and i honestly wouldnt go here again"
