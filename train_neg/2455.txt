b'Update (that was fast) Spoke to the manager. He was very nice and apologetic and took care of biz as best he could. Hopefully, this doesn\'t happen again. I\'ll delete the below once the fod redeems itself I had to find my Yelp PW to make this review. I ordered nachos & requested CHIPS ON SIDE due to time and soggy factors. Picked up, no chips on side. Ok, I\'m starving but Idw to be totally disappointed so I go back in, the bartender rudely asked if I "actually asked for chips on the side." Duh, check YOUR system. She passes it off to a server & doesn\'t talk to me again until 10 min later when my new order comes out. Her attitude was trash & Idk if they took it personal that MY food was wrong or what, but they put EVERYTHING in separate containers and left out my beans-the reason I wanted nachos itfp! Seriously?! It\'s not the 1st time and it sucks that Idw go back because 1900 used to be my spot! But seriously, SIX separate cups!? Y\'all were being smart @$$#$ because nobody said separate everything and I was overly polite to them as if I\'D messed up my own order or smtg.Do better.'
