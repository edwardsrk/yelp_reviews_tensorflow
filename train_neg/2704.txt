b'Wow.. the prices for food and beer are pretty outrageous. Even the ballpark has better prices. My only positive is that I really enjoy the lawn area (with the exception of the huge columns that block your view). What really bothers me about this place is the sound. They really need to crank the sound up here. You can barely hear the music. Also add some screens so we can see the stage from the back. Other than that, I only see a show here when I get a cheap ticket off groupon.'
