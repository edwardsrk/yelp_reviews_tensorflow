b'Food was terrible. Restaurant seemed to be big for happy hour as that area was packed. The dinning area we were in was old and dumpy looking. Food was ready within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted like it was reheated. Will not eat here again. Sad we wasted a night out here and money. Was not worth it. Worse than ramen noodles.'
