b"If I could give them a 0, I would! WORST customer service!! I bought a truck and traded two cars in for it. More than 3 weeks later, My husband and I are being harassed by Kelly in financing to bring the car back as the deal won't work out as one car that we traded in is past due. They knew from the beginning that we did not make a payment on the car and they said it would be fine, deal would still work. MORE THAN 3 WEEKS LATER!!  BOTH cars we traded in are now past due, registration and tags need to be updated since we returned those also. Worst experience of my life. DO NOT GO TO PEORIA FORD. They will only screw you."
