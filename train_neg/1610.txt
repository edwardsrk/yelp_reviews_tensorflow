b"The front desk staff are nasty, rude people! They don't want to help, they make you feel like you are an inconvenience!!!! As if we enjoyed going in! It's obvious that if people go in there is because, they are in need of medical help! Otherwise we, wouldn't go in! I will not be going back there, nor would I send people there anymore!!! This place either needs to close or the front desk staff need to change!!!! It's ridiculous, to be under stress because of injury or illness and to have these people make you feel worse!!"
