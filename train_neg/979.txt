b'I\'ll start by saying that my boyfriend and I have been to many PT\'s in the city and they have all been pretty awesome. We were enjoying this location until we were slapped with a bill without even asking for it and the bartender saying "here\'s what you guys owe, just so you know." We were no where close to finished and came here to enjoy an evening together to get some snacks and to play some Keno. We collectively put about $500+ through the machines and we were charged for mostly all of our drinks.We\'re not ones to ask for free items ever as we are both in the service industry and understand they have to make money as well (in which we always make sure to take care of our bartenders very well because we go off the original amount of the bill) but as a local you know it\'s typically customary for drinks to be comped, especially when playing the machines. (Which we played for roughly 5-6 hours for the entire duration of the time we were here.)He left and incredibly bad taste in our mouth after this action of his and we found this to be INCREDIBLY rude. After years of loyalty to the company, many long nights, many football games and thousands of dollars played through the machines we\'re just disappointed. I hope that things will be improved in the future. Sadly, we probably will not be visiting this location again.'
