b"Took my family to this museum.  It cost $55 for 3 of us.  There were only 4 or 5 art installations.  One of the exhibits is only accessible via the elevator so you can't use the stairs.  The spaces are small so it gets crowed very quickly.  We toured the museum in less than an hour, about 15 minutes of which time was spent waiting for the elevator. The museum is located in a residential neighborhood with few restaurants so your only food options are the cafeteria or driving somewhere else.A complete rip-off.  Go to the Warhol museum instead."
