b"$10 to see Ferraris!But they're all automatics. And almost all 458s. There was 1 each of the FF and California, and 2 F430s, one of which was relegated to photo duty (poor thing). Don't worry, there are a ton of Maserati Ghiblis strewn about to catch your attention for about 0.5 seconds each.Here's a list of what you may come to see, but they don't have:Enzo599F12612575456F50F40etc. (everything built before 2009)Terribly disappointing. I was here years ago and saw an FXX in the flesh.  They do have some interesting non-Ferraris (Z8, split window Vette, Penske's Indy 500 winner), but that's not what you're here for. Next time, I'll ask if they have anything remotely interesting before paying."
