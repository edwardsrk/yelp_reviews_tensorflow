b"I was really excited to eat at this place because it looked so nice from the outside and the yelp reviews were all great. I was incredibly disappointed in their sushi because even though the fish was real..not imitation..it tasted very old. I'm from the pacific northwest and we have amazing seafood...so I should have known desert seafood wouldn't have been very good."
