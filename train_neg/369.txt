b'I was a former subscriber for 2 decades.  Cancelled paper with invoice and two subsequent  phone calls to "Customer DIs-service".  Declined multiple offers to renew at low rate. Yesterday, I  received a "Past Due" Notice backdated 10 days for issues delivered after cancellation, the reason for my calls.  Customer rep claimed that they sent prior invoices (never received) for these issues.  Today, I paid bogus invoice just to get rid of them.  This paper has steadily deteriorated both in quality and quantity of content over past 10 years.  The customer service agents are often rude and incompetent.  Now the paper has taken a hard line approach to collect dubious debts. Fortunately, customers have much better choices for news and events, so AVOID THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC.'
