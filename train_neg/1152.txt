b'Pookie was our server, she was awesome, full of personality and bubbly, offering miso soup on the house which was amazing. I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, spicy yellowtail handroll, and a spicy tuna roll, all of which are my go-to items at a sushi restaurant. Not only did the food not taste that fresh, three hours later I am now vomiting clear liquid nonstop after all the rolls have came up. Food poisoning is no laughing matter, I will never go here again.'
