b'I wish I knew what everybody likes about this place.  Second time was as bad as the first time.  But it will likely be my last time.  The food is mediocre and the service is way below par.  I waited a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to tell me she would be right back to take my order.  5 minutes later she came by.  Coffee cup was filthy.  The overall experience was just lousy.'
