b"We went on a Sunday evening & the staff was quick to help but the place was sadly dead. The overhaul was pretty extensive but the place was still recognizable from the previous Minder Binders which was really nice for the nostalgia. The food menu didn't look great & I mistakenly ordered a foo foo chick drink which I rarely do (a pina colada) that was so, so lacking on the frozen end it was border line warm from over blending. Also it was Tempe priced in a shallow margarita glass. Hook me up with a hurricane glass full of frozen goodness & that's a Pina Colada. What I got was just sad. Hubs got a beer which was cold & what he ordered. Next time I will do the same. At the old Minder Binders I would have only dreamed of getting a beer. I should have stuck to that thought process  but with the fancy bathrooms & extensive overhaul I thought hey let's be fancy. Gotta try again for nostalgia's sake & order a burger & beer like the good ol' days & see how it goes. But right now I'm afraid to say it's like putting lipstick on a pig. :("
