b"As with some of the other reviews I've read we've had a TERRIBLE time with customer service and how our account has been handled by Sparkletts since they took over O Premium Water.  They said they would honor our contract with O Premium which was an unlimited amount of water monthly for the amount we were paying O Premium (we use the water for cooking, ourselves and our five pets and also wanted extra bottles that we could use for an emergency situation).As time went on they began taking back water bottles and not replacing them.  I called them and was told they did not do unlimited water and I spent an hour on the phone with them and finally settled for 16 bottles of water a month for a similar cost.  Again after a while went by they began taking bottles and not replacing all the ones left out.  When I called them this time I was told the account manager had changed our water amount based on our usage.  I again reminded them that we were also using the water for water storage purposes (and by the way they did not reduce our monthly bill).  We went back and forth and finally I was told the account manager would call me back.  This never happened and I have been working on an alternate solution since.Funny thing although they didn't honor the orginal O Premium agreement nor their verbal contract with me they wanted to take back the water cooler (which is about 10 years old and was paid in full 5 years ago) and to charge me the $52 cancellation fee that O Premium had in their contract.  Apparently the contract only protects them and not the consumer.  I'm really glad we can be done with this company the customer service has been abhorrent.  Honestly I don't even want to give them ONE STAR."
