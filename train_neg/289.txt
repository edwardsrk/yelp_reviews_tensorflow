b"The people here are extremely rude. No one will even bother to hold the door when you're right behind them. I tried multiple times to book classes online and couldn't get anything to work. The staff doesn't seem to know much about anything either. Took me 3 tries to cancel my membership, which I rarely ever used.There was one really nice girl from North Carolina who worked here though, she really tried to help, but that's about."
