b"So so place to go. I'm new to Huntersville and I picked a placed that was open and had good reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, it was a complete disappointment. I was in and out with a classic shellac mani and pedi within an hour, which always takes at least 1.5 hours anywhere else. The attention to detail is less than par. The colors you are allowed to choose from don't match the bottles they bring you. The customer service and personalities are dull. For the price, I won't be back... NOT WORTH IT!"
