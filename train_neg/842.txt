b'Terrible....don\'t use these guys. We needed a cab to and from our hotel for New Year\'s 2012 and decided to pre order it the night before and even pre-paid with tip online both ways. We also called to confirm the order and they said all was good. NYE comes and so does our pick up time and they never show. We wait 15 minute past pick up before we call and when we did they said oh he is on his way....after being late 45 minutes they finally show. Then the driver was mad I pre-paid because apparently they get stiffed on the tip by the company but he drops us off where we need to be.On the pick up we called 45 minutes before and the guy shows up when he said. When he arrives I told him I pre paid so he isn\'t caught off guard and he said "I don\'t take pre pays" and drives off before we can get in!!!I called and they said they\'d refund the money 3 times but never did so I filed a dispute with paypal (thats who the pre-pay is through) and it took 60 days to get my money back because they ignored it and paypal ruled in my favor because they never responded to it. They never even bothered to to respond to my BBB complaint.They have another bad review here for a reason.....DO NOT USE THEM!!! You may end up regretting it.'
