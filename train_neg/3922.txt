b"We used to enjoy coming here for weekend brunch. The latest visits we didn't have pleasant experiences for two reasons: 1)  Food was taking a REALLY long time to arrive. 2) This place does not have AC (which is fine as it's an old diner) but they should have extra fans running. It was so unbearably hot in there, I could not enjoy my meal. Food took 20+min to arrive. I was too nauseous from the heat to eat then. Don't think I will be returning"
