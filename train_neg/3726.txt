b'Been coming here since they opened , over the last year or so this place has slowly declined in cleanliness,customer service, and overall movie experience . The prices are super high for what you get which unless you ask for light ice is a cup full of ice with a shot of your favorite soft drink.  These people really need to step up to the plate and work on customer service skills, and instead of texting while working clean the place !!!'
