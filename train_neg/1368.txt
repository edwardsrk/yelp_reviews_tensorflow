b'We waited 40 minutes after ordering to get our food. When it finally came it was cold. My husbands steak was medium well and he ordered medium rare. My cheeseburger had no flavor and had clearly been sitting for some time. Our original waitress left and a new waitress came to the table to check on us. We complained about the food and she sent the manager over. My husband showed him how well done his steak was and told him that our food was cold. He took the cost of the steak off the bill. This will be our last meal here. Very poor customer service.'
