b"Just left had such a horrible experience here, as im trying on some pants i needed for work my son is playing with a soccer ball outside of the fitting room halls, the security a younger guy comes with such a horrible and rude attitude and says you better take that ball away before i take it from him, like wtf how the hell you talk to someones kid in that voice, and with. that attuide, we were gonna purchase those pants and that soccer ball, so whats the problem that my kid wants to play with it while im trying some pants, ok well stay with your ball and pants, i dont see why a security would think its ok to talk to kids like that, theres ways of saying stuff but not the way he did! such a horrible person. So lucky I couldn't punch his face!"
