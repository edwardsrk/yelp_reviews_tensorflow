b"Stopped in while walking though the Junction recently, but I can't say that I was impressed. I had a cappuccino and a scone, and can only say they were okay. Unfortunately, okay is not good enough for the cost of $7. There were quite a few people there, both inside and on the patio where I sat, so others must like it. But then I'm not really a fancy coffee person, regular coffee with a donut is more my style."
