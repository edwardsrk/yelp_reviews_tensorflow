b'Worst service i have ever recieved in my life. Myself and a friend came in after work to relax and get our nails done. The person who did hers didnt understand almomd shaped, messed up on her nails and then blamed her... really? Friend ended up telling her to take em off and walked out. I wanted simple tips with black, tell my why my tips are dark blue and not black. The tips are uneven. Never again will i come here'
