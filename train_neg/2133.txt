b"I am not sure what all of the hype is about. Based on Man vs. Food recommendation we had the Torta Del Ray sandwich and it was VERY disappointing.  The meat was dry, sausage was not browned and it was totally tasteless. I think the cook neglected to season the meats. My buddy ended up dumping salsa on his sandwich and I put hot sauce- anything to get flavor. Don't waste your time on this one. MAJOR disappointment.On a positive note, the service was excellent."
