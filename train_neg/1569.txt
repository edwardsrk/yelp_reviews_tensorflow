b'Rude Pharmacy Tech and the Pharmacist refused to fill my prescription because this was not my "usual" CVS. Tech was snotty about the fact I was there and their inventory was low. Despite having my medication in stock, they refused to fill it, saying that they would need to order it. I\'m not kidding. They had it in stock and REFUSED to fill from stock.But because someone else who may, or may not, regularly filled their Rx there and might show up in the next few days, they wouldn\'t fill it. Another CVS is "expecting me" they said. Not caring that I was filling because I just got the script on my way out of town and didn\'t have time to drive 30 minutes back, wait, then leave town. Most unhelpful staff ever encountered. Zero customer focus.'
