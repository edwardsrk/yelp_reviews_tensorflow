b"I would highly suggest looking elsewhere for transportation. The fares are nice but that's about it. The workers are highly incompetent when it comes to basically everything. Rudeness seems to be top priority for these people. I was grabbed by a worker and physically moved by them because I didn't know where the line began for the shuttle; I have never had an incident like this one with a company before. I've been waiting for a shuttle for twenty plus minutes now giving me time to write this review and watch the workers to continue to perform poorly therefore irritating more customers. BIG THUMBS DOWN!"
