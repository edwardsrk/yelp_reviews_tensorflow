b'Our service experience was as bad as I have ever received.  They are over booked and only completed one of three items that needed done.  The service tech was more excited about telling how superior they were to our previous provider, Gaudin.  He is delusional.  When I received my car back it was dirty and had a bad smell that lasted two days.  We had to go on a road trip, so we just endured it.  We will travel to Phoenix or LA for future service.'
