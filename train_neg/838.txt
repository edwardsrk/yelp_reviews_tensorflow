b'I have stayed in this hotel when I come to Vegas for the last several years. I will never stay here again. I will spend my thousands of dollars else where from now on and make sure it\'s not one of the connected "chains".  Upon my check in the women Ebony was beyond RUDE! I bought two hotel rooms, one was for my mother and father that I was trying to pay an all expense paid vacation for them. Even though both rooms were placed on my card for payment she wanted me to check into my room and then stand back in line behind 30 other people to check into my dads room. Why would I need to stand back in line to check into my other room? Also she ran a payment and asked for no signature but insisted that I had to call my dad back to sign for his room, she said "I did you a favor not asking you for a signature" so then why didn\'t she continue to do the favor on the second room? After her bad behavior and rudeness the hotel offered me a $40 credit per room which I never used because I had planned my dinners for my family else where. I called in the morning for a late check out which they said was fine, 20 minutes after I called I had a cleaning lady walk into my room and 10 minutes after that I got a phone call asking me why I wasn\'t out.  So much for a late check out. I don\'t know if management has changed or what has gone on with this hotel but I would never in my life recommend staying here. there are hotels right next door with the same pricing, please spend your money there and you\'ll have a much much better stay stay.I also Asked for a pet stay room when you look under the rug there are dog pee stains everywhere. They hold deposits and make you pay double for these rooms to cover the damages that dogs do to the room. Apparently peeing all over rugs isnt damage to the room so you have to live and stay around other dogs pee. My bad for bringing a potty trained animal and expecting the same.'
