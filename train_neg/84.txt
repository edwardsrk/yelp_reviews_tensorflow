b'I\'ll give this place one star for the music, I would never eat or drink here again, ever. We went in for the 2 for 1 margaritas, which ended up being $11.00 each, even with the 2-fer!! Yeah, the server said they were regularly 22 bucks each. They came in small plastic cups for a nice touch, they weren\'t bad but the food was horrible. We ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  I went the safe route and got the street style tacos and I\'ll tell you any Taco Truck in California is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, I ate half of one and gave the rest all back. Ew. Actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn\'t eat Mexican food for a while, that\'s how bad it was. Oh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when I went up for the "Mas Tequila" shot at the bar. Seriously..'
