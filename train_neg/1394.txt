b"Absolute nightmare and completely unreliable!So I called Daniel and told him about the job description with photos and all the details at about 10am.  He told me it would be no problem and he would be there at 1:30 PM. When 1:30 came around he then told me that he's going to be late by about an hour. I said no problem! He didn't call after an hour and I had to text him asking where he was at?  He then says I'm sorry I won't be there until about 3:30, I said OK, then he doesn't show up so I called again and he said he could come at 4:30 finally at 4:45 he calls and says he probably can't make it but he would have someone one else will call me. After giving the job description for the second time with photos, the woman on the phone tells me her price is $500 and didn't even look at the my condo, which was about a 3 to 4 hour job. I know because I have vacation rentals and many other properties in Vegas, so I'm not a newbie.  I explained to her I owned dozens of properties since I started in 2010 and know for a fact this pricing was unreasonable! I provided photos and details of work and again specified it was a 3 to 4 hour job and they never set a foot into the condo to give an accurate estimate!  To top it off she was extremely rude and proceeded to degrade me, About how I know nothing about my business. I find it shocking that someone could give me a verbal quote without having step foot on the property and be as rude and degrading as she was! I was so upset I simply just hung up on her! Think twice on finding a handyman here!"
