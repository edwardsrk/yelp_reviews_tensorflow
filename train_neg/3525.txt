b"Strawberry Mojito: If they hadn't packed a half of a pint glass with crushed ice (instead of the cubed ice they put into their glasses of soda or water) it might've been fine. It watered the whole thing down. My opening cocktail was a minty lime water.Appetizer of West Indies beef patty was delicious. You could probably buy them in bulk at Costco. The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)Chicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.Our server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.It's a chain restaurant, meaning not truly ethnic. Can someone recommend a sweet hole-in-the-wall?"
