b"I would definitely not return to this restaurant.  We ate here for a work day lunch recently and regretted our choice.  I had the hibachi shrimp, and my husband had the hibachi chicken.  Neither of us liked our food.  The hibachi flavor just wasn't good.  Additionally, all of our food smelled and tasted like it had been cooked on a grill with oil that was old.  Like if you were to stir fry some food and then stir fry again in the same oil another 50 times.  It simply did not taste good or fresh at all.  With regard to the shrimp sauce, it tasted fine.  However, it was room temperature, leading me to believe it had been sitting out for some time.  If it had been either hot or cold I would have felt better about it!And another note on temperature:  the day of our visit was an unusually warm December day, and the temperature in the restaurant was so hot and muggy that we were totally sweaty by the time we left.....not a good way to return to the office for the afternoon.  Yes, it was an unusually warm day.  But it did not appear that the restaurant had turned any air on at all.  We arrived early - around 11:45, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food.  By 12:15, however, the line snaked through the entire restaurant, and we saw several patrons who had been waiting at least 15 minutes for their food.  Given the long line, it makes me wonder if most people like their food more than I do.  I'm more inclined to think it's simply because there are many businesses in that area contributing to the lunch crowds, and not enough restaurants......every restaurant in the area seems to be packed at lunch hour.Wish I could give a better review, but it just wasn't good."
