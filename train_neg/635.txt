b'This was one of the worst services we have ever experienced in Vegas. The waitress did not even get our names for the waitlist and even thiugh we could see 4 tables free we were definitely NOT welcomed. For a small restaurant in an area filled with veterans, you would have expected more. Super disappointed!'
