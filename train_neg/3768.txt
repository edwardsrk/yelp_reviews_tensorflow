b"Using a Groupon as an excuse to cheat on my go-to spa, I thought it would be a opportunity to try a new spa out since it is so close to my home.The spa was clean, the services were mediocre, they spend most of your time there trying to sell you products, but it is the staff's attitude really put me off. The receptionist was rude and condescending when I called to confirm the time for my appointment, which quickly gave me a bad impression.Moreover, when I decided to pay with cash as I was leaving, he told me he had no change, slapped the inadequate change on the counter and turned away, assuming that the rest could be treated as tip and that the conversation/transaction was over. I thought coupons were a marketing tool a business would use to attract new customers, and grow your clientele, but if you are going to treat your customers badly just because they are using a coupon, they will not return, and tell all their friends never to go there."
