b"Stayed here for work reasons and that would be the only reason to choose this place. Like a previous review, I experienced the shower/tub that feels like you might fall down into the room below. I also got the experience of drunk idiots and their drama in the hallway at 12:30am. Some sketchy folks wandering around this place.The staff seems to do their jobs, but don't expect them to go the extra mile for you.The location is convenient for places in Henderson, but this is not located in the best area of Henderson. Lock your vehicle and keep an eye on your belongings."
