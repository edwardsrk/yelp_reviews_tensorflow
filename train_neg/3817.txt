b"First, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. Then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) Our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. We waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. Our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. Overall not a good experience. Go to a different grimaldi's"
