b'This place is crammed with people, and really really bad drivers as well. I just witnessed a hit and run in the parking lot this past Saturday afternoon and that woman just dashed away so quickly. After seeing that, I am very afraid of parking there anymore.And if you are the owner of that poor Odyssey, you might be able to get some info from the surveillance cameras around the Wal-Mart, Best-buy or Petsmart area.'
