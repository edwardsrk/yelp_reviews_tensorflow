b"Second visit to The Keg Steakhouse Yonge/Eglinton after being unimpressed last time. This time - it's just slightly better. At least the steak was cooked right.I can't pin it as to why but even a good juicy piece such as the New York cut could turn out dry and somewhat bland while served lukewarm. The cook was about right which is medium rare with some redness inside. Still though - again, ingredient / seasoning of the steak was just off the mark. Definitely couldn't justify the price.On the upside - the place has great ambiance (perfect for event, etc) and service is also terrific. Unfortunately the food did not deliver."
