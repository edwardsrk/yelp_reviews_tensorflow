b"The only reason I gave this place more than one star is because of their mozzarella. Everything else including their service sucks. Food is tasteless and it's not even close to italian food. Food was 45 minutes late and the appetizers came with our main dish. The server did not even fill our glasses with water and avoided eye contact the whole time. My dad even had to go to the bar to ask for water. They keep their kitchen open because they don't know they need chefs and servers to keep the place running. Go to Reds instead!"
