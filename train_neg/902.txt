b"Never again.  Not only will I not set foot back in Bricco, but I'll never stay at the Doubletree because of the rude manager at Bricco.  I tried to complain to the desk at the hotel and was told that the individual that had spoke to us the way he did was the Manager so not to put in a complaint until the next morning.  We were locked on the Patio and knocked to be let back in...no one came...shook the door and the Manager came and opened the door.  I assumed he was letting us back in.  Instead he told us the door was locked (as he's standing in it) and that me and my fiancee can jump the fence to get back in....Seriously?!  He then shut the door and walked back in.  Yes, we're still standing on the patio locked out.  This was at about 11:30.  I jumped the fence, went the entire way around the building, back into Bricco and to the door that he just shut to let her in.  Very rude and cost them my repeat business.  This man does not need to be in a business that deals with the public...get him in an office behind a wall where he doesn't have to be bothered by paying customers."
