b"Being the only place that serves Thai in the area I was hoping I had found a nearby place for my Thai fix. Well this place won't be it for me. I went with several friends and we all got something different to share. To the food. The Panang Curry was watered down and lacked flavor, it was a shadow of the true Panang Curry I've had everywhere else. Next the Pad See Oew... Or what they called Pad See Oew. The noddles were floating in liquid. The noodles were rubberish and it was all very bland. The Pad Thai... Hard to mess this one up right...wrong. First it came out looking neon orange which is no big deal as long as it taste good which it didn't. We got it at spice level 7/10 which I do everywhere. The heat level was good but it wasn't heat with flavor but just all over your mouth heat with the bland noodles. On to the fourth bad dish, the Lo Mein noodles. The noodles tasted stale and lacked any flavor what so ever. The one good item we ordered was the garlic chicken. Nothing special about it but it was good."
