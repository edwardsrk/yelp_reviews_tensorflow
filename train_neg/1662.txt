b"My girlfriend just got an oil change done here, she asked that they check the car over because we are going out of town. It is roughly a 100 miles later, 12:21pm, and we stopped for gas. The transmission fluid(measured hot and with the engine running) is not even showing on the dip stick, the belt cracked pretty bad, all the fluids are low there isn't a drop of washer fluid and who knows what else they didn't bother to check."
