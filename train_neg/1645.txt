b"I am disappointed in their cancellation policy. We had two memberships, one for our teenage son and one for my husband with both having the ability to bring a guest. We were told we can cancel at any time for any reason. Since my son was using a different gym, we no longer needed his membership so I called to cancel and was told to call a different company to cancel. I called them and they told me I had to send an email confirming my cancellation. I was told I had to give a 30 day notice so I was charged another $24.95 for the month. Then the next month another $24.95 was charged. I call up the location they said they can't help but to call the other company again. I call that company and they say they can't help either. Then I'm calling the gym to talk to the manager who says she will try to get it refunded, it's been months and no refund. Then I send an email 2 months ago to put my husbands acct on hold while he's recovering from surgery and restricted from lifting weights. We are charged a $5.95 fee for the acct to be put on hold. I send an email the other day and say, just cancel the acct, I'm giving a 30 day notice, keep the $24.95 that you owe us and use it as the last payment for the 30 day notice and today we are charged $64.95. I send another email and no response. I'm not a fan of this location because it smells and is always crowded. I like the one on Sahara better. I never would have canceled my husbands membership but did because of the lack of correspondence. I'm contacting my bank to get involved with the shady charges. Avoid this company or be prepared to pay even after you cancel. Highly dissatisfied and disappointed!I emailed and received no response!"
