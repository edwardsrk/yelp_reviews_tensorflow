b"We were planning on going to Southside Pittsburgh today, so being the good organizer that I am, I  decided to research restaurants in the area.  I pinpointed a few great places to eat through Yelp.  Then my wife  decided to ask a merchant in the area good places to eat nearby.  That's when  everything went awry.Marios is a mediocre bar at best.  It is not very appealing as bars go.  It looks like it has been around forever and has never been updated.  They had good prices on beer, and meal prices were good.  The food was good but certainly not great.  Our waitress was pleasant and probably saved me from going over the edge.Although it was the the worse place I have eaten, I won't be returning...even if my wife insists."
