b'The work I received was really good. But have a breathing problem and am not to breath the fumes In the salon. I was also recovering from a broken leg and hip when in the salon. I asked the manager for a mask. Oh brother, you would have thought that I had asked for a million dollars. The rude response was unbelievable. I would have paid the 25 cents or so that it costs the shop for the mask. So I used my walker and returned to the car to get a used mask. Had my daughter not had her request to have a pedicure there for her Birthday, I would have left. I spent well over $100 and will never return.'
