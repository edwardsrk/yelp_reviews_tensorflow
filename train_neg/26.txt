b"$28 for a 15 minutes pedicure with used tools? I would never come back. The place seems new and having 50% back so my friend asked me to join her for a pedicure day treat. As soon as my friend and I got colors and sat down, there were three other customers came. There are not too many technicians working at this salon so they started rushing through my pedicure to get to the next customer. I did not say anything because my friend was beside me so I don't want to make her feel bad . The technician finished my pedicure in 15 minutes. After that, she got her small basket and ran to the next customer using the same tools that she used on me. The tools did not get washed. I was thinking the tools she used on me was already used on someone else. I hope I won's have any infections. I would never come here or let my friend come here again !!!"
