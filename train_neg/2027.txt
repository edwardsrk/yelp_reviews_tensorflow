b"Honestly I expected a lot more from this restaurant due to rave reviews of the others in the area. I ordered a burrito with steak and the quinoa brown rice. It was obvious the steak wasn't super fresh; it was kind of cold. The burrito, although super large, didn't have too much flavor and the quinoa brown rice was pretty unappetizing. The dining area was pretty dirty too, tables had food all over them and hadn't been cleaned for a while. I would  give this another try and order something different but until then the 2 stars stands."
