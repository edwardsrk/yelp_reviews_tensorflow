b"I've done business here before with no issues, but I recently had to replace a phone and I also bought a tempered glass screen protector for my new Galaxy S8. Service was good, phone is great, but the screen protector was $50 and fell off after a week. I did some research after the fact and discovered that this screen protector was grossly over priced at the Sprint store, $35 - $40 over priced! I took it back for a refund and they would ONLY give me an exchange. There are better screen protectors available and I'm not going to put this one on my phone. Don't buy any accessories from this place without doing some research first, they will rip you off..."
