b"I don't even see how this McDonald's has an average of 2 stars!? I But it doesn't matter what time of day you go you WILL receive the WRONG order even after you specify to the worker. The managers are a joke as well, you try to speak to them to get what you originally ordered and they tell you that your basically wrong & ordered what they give you. I always regret going to this McDonalds but it's literally a minute away from home or less & I know I shouldn't be complaining this bad about a fast food place and simply because it's McDonalds but it's not often that I go and yet they still manage to mess up every order that I have asked for. Heck if I was to ask for a water they'd probably give me Sprite."
