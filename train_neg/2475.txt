b"We went to Tryst on a Sunday during lunch for a family member's bday. The menu seemed promising. I decided on the seared ahi tuna salad for myself and spring rolls to share. I didn't think to ask if anything I ordered was going to be hot. I assumed the spring rolls would be hot because I've never experienced raw spring rolls before and any time I've ever ordered a salad with some fish in it- the fish has always come out hot. This was not the case. Which is not a big deal but cold seared ahi tuna is not good. The seared part of the title is misleading. When something has the word seared, I expect it to be HOT... but that's just me. The spring rolls were tasty -I just did not expect them to be cold/raw. Nothing to write home about but it wasn't terrible. And my fianc\xc3\xa9 found a hair in his salad and I lost my appetite."
