b'Wow this place is TERRIBLE!!!! started with a margarita that tasted worse then pine sol(cleaning supplies). the food all looked exactly the same. weird because i believe it was all frozen and just heated up. we had a party of 5 and we all felt sick shortly after beginning to eat it. if you like salt you will enjoy this food. another reason that we all belive that they just heay up frozen food. if i could give this place 0 out of 5 i wood. DONT GO!!!!'
