b'This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had. the customer service at this location is horrible. i have a contractor account and came to purchase some 4X6X12 treated posts. When we arrived in the lumber section a guy came and asked us what we were looking for, I told him and he opened the gate. With four employees standing around doing nothing, we found what we needed. When we realized how big these were we tried to ask for some help. Every one disappeared. After standing in the contractor line up for 20 minutes to get assistance we decided to try some where else. We went to Timber Town and we were in and out within 15 minutes.'
