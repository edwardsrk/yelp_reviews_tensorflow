b"I went up too my storage unit at the Uhaul facility on 1/9/16 and when I opened my unit door I noticed that there was boxes pushed too the side ... I noticed that three pieces of furniture was gone out of my unit and I notified the manager of that facility about the missing items... And the manager told me I had too file a claim with the Uhaul company ... I couldn't believe that the manager wouldn't look into it making me feel suspicious... I will never use their facility ever again can't trust their company....I called and they have never returned my calls"
