b"Was told this place was the best Italian in Henderson by mt step-daughter so though the wife and I would try it out last Friday night.Overall impression was it's a cozy little place with great decor, decent appetizers (we had the sampler with calamari, cheese sticks and fried ravioli), and it was pretty good.I ordered the Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and the wife ordered the Chicken Parm.Thumbs up on the Chicken ParmThumbs down on the Alfredo.... Fettuccini noodles were cooked probably 2-3 minutes under cooked so they were very, very chewy. I had to put quite a bit of tooth to them to get them chewed up. I probably only 3 bites and left the rest.As the waiter came by at the end of the meal to collect our plates and ask if we needed 2 boxes to take the rest home, I said I didn't need one due to the undercooked noodles. The server/hostess was apologetic but neglected to even offer us a refund or take any price off the final bill.Don't think we'll be back to this place, even though it's close to home.2 of 5 Stars rewarded."
