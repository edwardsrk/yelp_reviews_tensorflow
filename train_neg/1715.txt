b"I called this location on Friday September 8th at about 8:30pm to see if they have the pumpkin spice glazed doughnut so as I began to ask the person who answered the phone they hang up on me so I thought maybe she couldn't hear me and hung up, so I called back 4 times after that and no answer, very unprofessional!"
