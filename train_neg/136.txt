b"Boo!  I was excited to use my groupon for this nearby salon in upscale Dana Park, unfortunately I was quite disappointed.  My first visit I waited on my hairdresser well past my appointment time and was disgusted that the previous client's hair was still on the floor around my chair as well as on the chair.  Then I was covered with a dirty apron, also covered in hair.  I decided to give them a second chance and again was disappointed.  I struggled making an appointment and when the receptionist finally offered an available appointment I was told that they could not take any groupons for that day.  I did finally get an appointment and when I showed up, I was told my appointment was for days later!  Then the hairdresser said I couldn't be accommodated because she had paperwork to do.!?  Too much drama, hassle, and lack of professionalism."
