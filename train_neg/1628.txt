b'Just stopped there for a breakfast taco. As my order was taken just a few feet away two guys were standing on the food service counter using power screwdrivers above. This is not good to have people walking and working on the food counter. Plus some plaster and debris was falling. All while the clerk is serving customers.   I wonder what goes on in the back ?  Probably would not go back.'
