b"Horrible horrible horrible.  Didnt have our car, talked me into a $50 upgrade which I agreed to, then advised me the upgraded car wasnt available. So now I've been waiting for over an hour for the Advantage people to get another car ready.  The line is 15 customers long with only two nitwits working.  Never again with these clowns."
