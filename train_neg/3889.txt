b'Great Location, Great Neighbors. Close to the strip but not ghetto, you get what you pay for here.  Unless I leave Vegas or Buy a House here I will not be moving out!Only Issue Is having guests over can be a hassle, getting in the gate can be long but, it does make the place safe.We rent from a Tenant and we are lucky to have a very helpful and attentive one at that.  I have heard of many bad stories tho.24hr Pool, BBQ, GYM, Hot Tub just Feet from my Place, and I can see the Cosmo and Palazzo from my couch as well as the Hot Tub.'
