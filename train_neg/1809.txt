b'Shocked. After years of being faithful customers, we received inedible food and a too bad/so sad.Sesame Chicken looked hushpuppies. No sauce. Mongolian Beef was bad. Could not eat it.I called the restaurant to find out what was going on, we have been going there for 20 yrs. I was told and I quote "I\'ve sold twenty dinners, and you the only complaint". Really?No where near their normal quality. I have had better tv dinners. Refused to allow me to speak to manager.They have to have new owner or chef. Never been treated with such disrespect!'
