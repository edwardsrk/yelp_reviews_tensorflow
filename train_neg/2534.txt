b"Wow I'm sure this place is MUUUUUUCH better, but I went here after we spent the day over at the Chambly beer fest, we just wanted to have a beer and a bite to eat after drinking beer all day long : )Food:To make a long story short, the nachos which were pretty $$$ was nothing more than multi coloured nacho chips with cold toppings that came out of a jar.  The beer on tap was not even cold.   I realize the pub was probably involved with the beer fest that was going on, but Wow... I was not impressed.I'm sure this was a fluke and would be willing to try them again, but first impressions don't leave expectations particularly high."
