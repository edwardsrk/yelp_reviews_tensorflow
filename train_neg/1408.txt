b"I came here to get a pedicure. Worst experience ever. My pedicure was rushed. The utensils used to do my pedicure were not clean. If I could get first class service then maybe I would leave a tip but I can't get first class service here. Over charged for a terrible pedicure $25 not worth it. Save your money and go elsewhere!"
