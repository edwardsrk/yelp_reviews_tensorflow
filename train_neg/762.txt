b"Terrible service here!!!  Had a coupon for st Pattys day and the employees treated me like they'd rather I not be there.  My bagel was handed to me by one of the food prep workers and he had a very upset expression.  Very unpleasant.  I know he is capable of smiling since he was laughing and joking with the other employees. Bagels are good there are other einstens with better service.  Also ordered a coffee but the employee didn't help me with making a choice just expected me to figure out the menu on the board but it is large and requires you to walk around to see them.  Smear cream cheese choices is on a table flag which is hard to notice.  Very difficult to make a choice here unless you already know what you want.  Don't go to this location in particular!!!"
