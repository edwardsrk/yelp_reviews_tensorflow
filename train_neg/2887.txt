b"I found the place overrated, the food underwhelming and overpriced, and the portions small. In fact, the scallops that we were most excited to try seem to have gone from 3 for $17 down to 2 for $17. They were tasty but hardly worth it. The steak was thin and fine. No complaints or real praise. The pickerel was sort of nice but bland and unmemorable. Desserts looked good but they didn't have the Maple Cheesecake that is on their online menu, so we skipped it."
