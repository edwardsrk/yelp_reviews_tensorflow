b'This has to be the worst show I have ever seen. It has no business being on stage at all but if they do have a venue then it should be an afternoon show billed for children. The children in the audience were the only ones gullible enough to fall for this crap. From start to finish every trick was flawed. It was almost a "behind the curtain" show because you could see how every trick was done. The "grand illusions" were they same tricks you\'ve seen a million times but this time they are so much worse. We should have walked out but it I wanted to stay to give them a fair review. This is only a go if you bring your elementary school age children. This is like the entertainment they used to bring into my school as a kid on assembly days.'
