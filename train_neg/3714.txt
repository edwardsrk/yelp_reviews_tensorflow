b'I had some business dowtown (not court or jail) so I thought I would give this a try.  Stopped by at about 12:30 and the parking lot was full.  This place is a in a tiny little run down building.  I loved the sign on the door that said "to open push hard."  We are not in summerlin anymore...So after pushing hard on the door to get in - the place was packed!  One table left, now I can see why the guy that pulled in behind us practically ran us over to get in here first!  He wanted to get a table!It is a tiny square dining room, with maybe 30 people in  it.  There is no atmosphere here - and with out the advice from Yelpers I would probably not stop in.  Sometimes I can\'t tell if the restaurant is a quaint mom and pop joint with some charm or if the owners are too cheap to update the place???The food was about average.  Shredded beef enchilada and a chili rellano.  The only thing that stood out was the sauce - everything else was ok.A friend had a beef burrito with green chili as a combo.  The burrito was sorta small with a dash of green chili sauce.  Disappointing for a $13 lunch special.I saw a taco on the plate of another customer and it was a store bought taco bell like taco shell.  Not impressed.Overall - food was okay.  The service was okay.  The place is a dump.2 lunch specials for $28.50...hmmmm.  I would rather eat at Roberto\'s and spend less money.'
