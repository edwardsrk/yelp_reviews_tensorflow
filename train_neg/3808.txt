b'The service is nice and the outdoor seating is comfortable with overhead heating during the winter. (The outdoor seating is much better than the indoor seating.) They have a kid\'s menu that comes with temporary tattoos.The food is bland and underwhelming.  I\'ve been invited to family dinner here several times. I don\'t know what the point is of paying $20-$30 for premium fish/seafood that just comes out tasting like "eh." The food is really underwhelming.This restaurant is ideal if you plan on inviting guests who are greatly impressed by the sight of an expensive and varied seafood menu but don\'t necessarily care about the taste of the food they\'re eating. Because while the food is totally edible/passable, it\'s just not particularly delicious or even memorable. At all.The only thing I would consider recommending is the oysters.'
