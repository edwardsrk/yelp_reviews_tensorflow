b"Ok so now this has happened about 5 or 6 times in past month. The staff working in the evenings/nights are very rude and untrained. Ordered an iced caramel latte tonight and they messed that up. Absolutely no caramel????? Its 3 ingredients and not complicated. Went back in to have it fixed and the so called elderly lady that is being paid to manage this establishment was utterly rude and disrespectful and refused to fix my drink. I get this coffee at least 5 to 5 times a week. And for this to continue happening is a shame. As well as it has happened to several of my staff members who I got hooked on your coffee. Not Starbucks and not Dutch bros. Our hard earned money is paying for a product your establishment offers and when a mistake was make failure to solve the issue shouldn't be the customers problem. Time to solve this issue"
