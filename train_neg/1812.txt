b"I was in a hurry to my appointment yesterday and was hungry since I hadn't had breakfast or lunch. I saw this Panda Express close by my appointment facility and thought this sounds good. I ordered to go so I could make it to my appointment on time. I took a few bites of my Kung pao chicken and found a short thick curly hair which made me spew. I am so disgusted that I will NEVER eat at another Panda Express. I called and spoke to a Wilson he said to bring my receipt in and I could have something else REALLY!! I don't want something else I want my money back because I surely didn't pay for some either arm hair, armpit hair or pubic hair in my food!!!! Forever grossed out!!!!!"
