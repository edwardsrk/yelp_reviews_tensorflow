b"So I understand this was one of the first hotels in Vegas. But our 5 day trip was awful. The first night we arrived we went up to our room it was the evening so my boyfriend and I got in bed and notice a big old spot in the middle of the sheets and realized it BLOOD! Are you kidding me! It also seem liked they tried to hide it too because it was in between two different blankets. I didn't get mad I just kindly asked for a new blanket which I got but they left the nasty blanket in our room. On top of that The transformer exploded and didn't have air or tv for 3hrs. lastly never use VALET!!! I even saw warning videos too I should have listened but they brought out our car with a dead battery!!!! Didn't even care just said we will jump you and you can be on your way. Note we live about 5 1/2hrs away.. not worth the price"
