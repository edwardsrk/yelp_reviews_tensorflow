b'Bartender was ill-informed. A friend asked about a hoppy IPA. He had little knowledge because he didn\'t like IPAS. Failed to even identify the only double IPA on tap. Personal preference is not bartending. He was playing games on his phone instead of taking care of our checks. Not friendly or even conversational. No"How are you" or "welcome." The bar was empty - may my friends and I feel good. I walked into the women\'s restroom- and was greeted by a MAN and two women who were "talking." They should have been thrown out. I shouldn\'t have to ask a man to leave to I may use the women\'s restroom. On a plus, he did card us and he did wipe down bottles and the bar. But!! Left the bucket sanitizer under the taps where it easily could have been mixed into my beer.'
