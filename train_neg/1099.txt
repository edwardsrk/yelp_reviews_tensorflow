b"DO NOT BRING YOUR PET HERE! MY father brought our dog here after searching the Internet for symptoms we came to the conclusion he was having heart failure. After telling the vet what we think is wrong the vet at this clinic (sounding extremely unexperienced) took a needle to Buddy to see if there was blood in his abdomin he came back and told my father that we would have to put Buddy down. He then said he made a mistake and might have hit his spleen with the needle. He took x rays/ultra sound stating he doesnt know how to use the machine and told my father Buddy isn't showing anything wrong with his heart and he just needs rest. We paid the incompetent man 500$ and today Buddy passed away."
