b'So I decided I will try then once again, and they prove again why I should continue to refuse going there.  I checked in and was told to pick out my gel color, then Casey told me it would be 10-15 minutes, which I was ok with.  About 10 min later another girl walked up and told me to pick out my color, which I had already done, then she walked me back to an empty station next to Cindy, who was doing another girls gel manicure.  I was given no other instruction but to sit.  As I sat there and watched Cindy do this girls nails, I noticed she started trying to hurry, which led me to believe that she was trying to hurry so she could do mine next.  Which to me is not ok, first don\'t sit me down at an empty station to wait and make the tech feel rushed and also make the customer feel uncomfortable that I\'m just sitting their .  After another 10-15 minutes and knowing how long gel takes, I got up and said "I\'ll just come back tomorrow" which just to be clear, I will not be returning tomorrow, or any day after that.'
