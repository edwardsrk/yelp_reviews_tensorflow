b"The food just didn't have any flavor.  And now my stomach hurts.  The guy that took my order was lovely, the delivery guy (possibly same guy) was very sweet.  It's just that the food has no flavor.  Also the apps were burned.  I mean I'm definitely not hungry now, but I could have accomplished that for less than $45 (three people ordering entrees and two starters).  I won't be ordering from there again.  I heard good things about this place, but I'm just becoming more convinced good Chinese food in Phoenix (or Arizona) doesn't exist."
