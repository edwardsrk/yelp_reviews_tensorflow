b"I sought out the new b-dubs in downtown Kent. Having never been to the new location I was impressed with the building and T.V set up and everything else. Very impressive however it ended there our waitress on a dead afternoon came by 4 times and really didn't talk the even ask us how the food was she would just grab our drinks with no heads up and bring them back. Really frustrating service. Very disappointed because with only 3 other tables being served on the floor by other ppl idk what in the hell could keep you from providing some decent service"
