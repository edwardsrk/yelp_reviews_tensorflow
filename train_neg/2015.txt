b'I was so excited to try this place after many people recommend this place. When we arrived we had to wait in the entrance for couple minutes.  Than we were placed at a table and the server came 5 good minutes later.  When he arrived we ordered drink and food.  We had time to visit all the shop and after wait at the table. The food arrived  and all our meats were dry and hard. The tabooli tasted like the presley was old... we all left more than the half of our plates and very disappointed..'
