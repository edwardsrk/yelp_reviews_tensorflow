b'Went here for lunch with my boyfriend today. The green beans, crab puffs and chow mien were good. But we had two serious issues while we were there. The first being when we asked for a straw and the waitress brought out two loose straws, not in paper protection, that she was holding in her bare hands (no offense, but I don\'t know where those hands have been!) and second when my boyfriend had to go ask for out check as it was time to leave me no one had come by to even ask how we were doing and the (bad enough right) and the lady standing behind the counter directly in front of the kitchen, was plucking her eyebrows. Which she immediately stopped doing when my boyfriend said "I hate to interrupt you but can we get our check please?" YUCK!!! I feel sick just talking about it. We will never go back here again.'
