b'We ordered from this location last night for the first time in about 8 years. We got take out because we were busy and we wanted to take out some place close. We usually go to Little Joe\'s Pizza as it is our favorite, but it would have been an additional 20 minutes and everyone was hungry now. On the phone, we ordered the family special. One large pepperoni and a large pineapple pizza with a side of cheesy bread sticks and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi. One we got home we discovered that their large size pizza was about 14". Little Joe\'s pizzas large pizza is 16-18 inches so you can see our disappointment in the size of Pizza Huts pizza. The bread sticks were good. I liked their marinara dipping sauce. I didn\'t mind eating the pineapple pizza even though it seemed greasy and the crust was light and fluffy. The pepperoni tasted horrible which turned my husband off to ever ordering here again in any situation. I\'m only giving it 2 stars due to the taste of the pepperoni pizza and the small size. For the same amount of money at Little Joe\'s Pizza I could have fed 2 more people so I don\'t feel I got the best bang for my buck.'
