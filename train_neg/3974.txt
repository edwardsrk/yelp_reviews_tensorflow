b'everyone is blinded by the tofu, for a place that is considered "the best chinese food place is uiuc area" I wondered: "would it be possible to have crummy dishes?" When I went my first (and only) time to this place. I ordered meatless udon pan-fried noodles w/mushrooms and Satay tofu. When I ordered I assumed "what could go wrong?", everyone has had good things to say about this shack; so anything/everything should be good.. Well, let me tell you...I was Wrong!The pan fried noodles were at most sauteed, but definitely not pan fried; for they were slimy and were practically tasteless (besides the stinky mushrooms that shaped the horrid taste-- and to think i thought i loved mushrooms) The satay tofu was bland and mainly tasted like an orifice or a dirty mouth (it had such a weird/nasty taste to it). The only way I could barely eat half of what I ordered was by drowning it in Eel Sauce I had in my refrigerator.Maybe this is my fault from ordering from the translated menu? Maybe it\'s my fault for being an American? All i know is that, if that is what authentic chinese food tastes like thheeen...WT eff??? THEN I will gladly stick with the American aspect of chinese food, because I totally wasted $20 (on a bulk load of crap)...It was really bad, possibly some of the worst food I ever had in my life (and it\'s not like I ordered pig tongue! I ordered totally basic items!). All i know is that it\'s pretty sad when the only good thing i had in my order was the steamed white rice.After this experience I  really hope I just managed to order the two crappiest dishes from this place; if not, that was a sad excuse for food and I was a sure sucker for paying $20 for it.'
