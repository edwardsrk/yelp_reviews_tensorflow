b"We decided on short notice to try the new Ditka's. We went with friends on a Saturday shortly after it opened. It was disappointing. The building was updated from the Atria's that was there before, but only superficially. It was still the high ceiling, open room, not the dark wood, intimate setting you expect and pay for at an upscale steak place. The food was okay, but not consistent with the high prices. We had crab cake appetizers and seafood pasta as entres. We ordered a 'shareable' spicy hash browns side which was decent but far too small to be shareable.There was no bread offered or served. The server was never around, hurried, ran by throwing our drinks when passing by; overall pretty rough around the edges. The wine list was very limited and poorly designed. The only thing consistent with an upscale steak house was the prices. Some of the problems are fixable, some not. Too bad - we could use a good steak house out here."
