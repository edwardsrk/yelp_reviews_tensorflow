b'Reserved a car 4 months ago yet waited in line for 45 minutes because there was only 1 agent although there were 5 rental counters. Finally, 2 other agents came out including supervisor who stated he was " helping outside".Reservations are supposed to enable supervisors to schedule staff to prevent this type of poor service!'
