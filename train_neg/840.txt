b"Possible the worst food I every took a bite of, yes a bite because that was all I could taste. I regrettable had the meatball sandwich which wasn't a sandwich, it was a calzone. I call to tell them the sandwich was wrong, but that's how they make it. Got other items wrong on order also. Wouldn't feed that garbage to my dog."
