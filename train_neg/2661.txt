b"It was really hard to find, and the whole experience was underwhelming. The service was strange and borderline bad - the server sat us at a table where the lights were not working even though there were open tables that were properly lit, the server took my drink order and then forgot to take my friend's, and the server didn't ask how any of the food was during the entire meal. Speaking of the food, it was boring and just totally bland. The meat was overcooked, everything was under seasoned, and more of less every dish had an uninspired mushy quality. I would have given this place one star, but the wine selection was good and the interior was really lovely. Overall though - avoid."
