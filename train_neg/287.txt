b"The food looked good from where I was standing... but unfortunately, I was unable to actually taste it.  I walked in there with my friends last night expecting to get a decent burger.  When we waked in, we stood at the front of the restaurant for over 15 minutes waiting to be seated.  It seemed as though workers were walking by us trying not to make eye contact so they wouldn't have to take the time to seat us. Needless to say, we walked in unnoticed and walked out unnoticed."
