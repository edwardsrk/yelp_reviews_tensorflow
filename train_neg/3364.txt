b"Normally, a car was has got to really stand out to get a review at all. Well, Superstar Car Wash stood out in a negative way for me. I took my brand new truck into their car wash, and it was damaged in the car wash. Fortunately, it was just the antenna. So, it's not the end of the world. But, it was a $60 antenna to replace. They do warn that some antennas may become damaged. But, BEFORE I took my truck into the car wash, I took the time to walk over and talk to their employees and I specifically asked them if my type of antenna could get damaged. They assured me it would be safe, at which time I entered the car wash. The car wash mangled it. After it was damaged, the responsible employee confessed it was his fault to the manager. So, I contacted the corporate office and I had a written acknowledgement from the manager that it was their fault. But, after I attempted to contact their corporate office, they just ignored me, and wouldn't return my attempts to contact them. So, this negative review is based on the company's attempts to pretend that the problem didn't exist after they were directly responsible for causing damage to my truck."
