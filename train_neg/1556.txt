b"This is the battle of the misinformed.  This store is in need of new management, that can hire people that know customer service.  I was directed to this Target, by another Target location(so I was a fan of Target for many years). I was told they had a Fitbit Surge on hold for me. They supposedly had 3 of them.   Another associate at another location called while I stood right beside her.  First I don't see an associate in electronics.  When I ring the bell, a kid tells me he will be with me in a few minutes.  He could have called someone else like the Target on Green Valley Parkway did.  Instead, I waited for him, only to find they were out of stock.  I was told to go to Guest Services.  They had a Fitbit for Brock, none for me.  The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.  I won't beg any store to take my money.  I love shopping local, but in cases like this, I MUST shop with Amazon.com. I did just that, and saved money.  Target's slogan is expect more, pay less.  Yeah, right. Thank God for Amazon. I won't have to waste my gas or time shopping at Target ever again."
