b'So extremely disappointed.  I had been to the Hash House at the M back when it was still open there and the dinner was pretty good, especially the biscuit.  Fast-forward to this morning when a friend and I had breakfast at the HH on Stephanie to understand my disappointment.A place called Hash House should have actual hash, should it not?  When I ordered the corned beef "hash" today it showed up in what looks like a large cast-iron skillet, but it appeared to be just for show, because nothing in there was cooked in that skillet.  My corned beef "hash" was just a bunch of pulled corned beef with melted swiss on top, then just thrown on top of some breakfast potatoes.  The corned beef was decent, but what part of "hash" does the Hash House not understand?  On top of the disappointing breakfast my stomach was upset most of today, and that is not a common occurrence.  I hate to blame HH, but I\'m pretty sure HH was the reason for today\'s discomfort.My friend got the biscuits and gravy and was extremely disappointed as well.  Although he said the sausage gravy was good, he also said the biscuits were like rock-hard paperweights.  For the prices we paid it should have been an above-average breakfast.  Unfortunately, it was one of the most disappointing breakfasts we could remember.  The only reason I\'m giving them two stars instead of one is due to the service.  The place was quiet, very clean, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  She was the only positive part of our breakfast.'
