b'After parking in the garage across from the Dodge Theater I followed the "Restaurant/Bar Open" sign to Crazy Jim\'s.  The "bar" part is a joke - it\'s a tiny counter right where you walk in the door, with about 4 stools.  The restaurant has no atmosphere and the food was just so-so.  There\'s quite a variety of offerings on the menu, including salads, pita wraps, subs, pizza, and entrees.  However, you will quickly notice that many of the items are exactly the same with one variation, i.e. two subs with chicken and onions but one has cheese and the other has jalapenos.  I asked if I could get the vegetable "sub" as a "pita sub" and was told that that just wouldn\'t work.  So I settled on one of the chicken pitas.   The pita itself was just fine, nothing special.  I expected more of a wrap but it was served open-face and couldn\'t be held together so I had to use a knife and fork.  The accompanying fries were disappointing - golden brown on the outside but hard/under-fried inside.  Bottom line: Crazy Jim\'s is lucky it pretty much has the monopoly of pre-concert eating/drinking within walking distance of the Dodge Theater.'
