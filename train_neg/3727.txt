b'Ok, honestly, I really wanted to like this place. The location was promising as most of the best Mexican food is found in hole in the wall strip malls. The ambiance inside was promising, with string lights hung from the ceiling and authentic tables and chairs. As soon as we walked in, what seemed to be one of the two owners mentioned in previous reviews sat us at a booth amidst large crowds of other patrons. Then we wait... and wait... and wait. It literally took us flagging down our hostess to get drinks, chips, and salsa. We received our drinks and two salsas, a red and a verde. Ten minutes later, we ordered. Two of us got a wet burrito. One with beef and another with chorizo, served with rice and beans. One got the carnitas. Cue the 45 minute wait for our food (the party of 15 behind us didn\'t help, I\'m understanding). So we get our plates and the "wet burrito" is sitting in a grease flavored red liquid... don\'t recommend. Carnita pork slab was DRY. The rice was hardly authentic, I\'m talking like plain Jane rice. So much for my hopes and dreams of delicious Mexican food'
