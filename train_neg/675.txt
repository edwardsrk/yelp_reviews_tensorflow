b"I'm being generous to give this place 1 star. The service was ok. We went in with greater expectations only to be disappointed. We stopped in for cocktails and appetizers and were shocked to find that the specialty cocktails are served in plastic cups-a Margarita in a cup? ( Really?! I thought this was a restaurant, but a pool party!) We ordered Drunken Shrimp and Guacamole and chips. The shrimp looked like something you use as bait for bigger shrimp; it wasn't peeled and was overloaded with heat, not spice or flavor. The Guacamole tasted prepackaged or something from Costco. The venue was typical-TV's playing 80's Rock videos were okay, but not of high quality. If you are looking for a better rock-and-roll venue, go to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino."
