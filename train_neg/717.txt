b'Heard this was a good place for after ball game, or anytime for that matter.  prior to going to Cactus League game checked their website. They advertise daily happy hour  with $4 Margaritas + $3 well drinks, among other offers. My Margarita was $7 & well was $6. When I questioned this was told that during March no happy hour due to ball games as people still come in & that their website means nothing.Great location, poor help, poor service & FALSE advertising. Wont go back!'
