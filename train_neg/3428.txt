b"Prepare to be dissapointed! Ooh Vegas, you gotta stay away from this one, if you want to wait for your food, wait for your drinks, and keep waiting for service this is the place to be! One star for service, 2nd star earned because there's fun stuff to do after you're done waiting, lol. The place wasn't even as crowded as you would expect, I think because the word is out on the place already, and i got there at 8:50pm to eat, way past the dinner rush and the popular 6-7:30 dinner rush. One and a half hour meal and drinks could have been finished in about half that time, just spent too much time waiting. Me and Gary Z preordered our next drink because the first drink took half an hour to get the first one, lol. At least 35 min to even take our order for food. It's a 2.5 star establishment for a reason people! Don't get your hopes up just because they reopened."
