b'Definitely do not recommended. Bought a Groupon and figured I would try it out with a friend. Our gel manicures and pedicures took around 2.5 hours which I was fine with since it was a school and it seemed like they were just really taking their time to do a good job. However, a couple of my gel nails ended up like wrinkly looking, but whatever, it wasn\'t super easy to notice. Then my friend tells me the next day that she went in the pool and all of her gel nails fell off. So I tried calling the place 3 times, left 2 messages and waited to see if I would get a call back. Nothing for over a week. So I tried calling again and still couldn\'t get a hold of anyone. FINALLY talked to someone almost a month later and all they said was "it\'s a school so that\'s the risk you take" and that it was so far out from the date now that they can\'t do anything -even though I called the Tuesday after the appointment (since they aren\'t open Sunday or Monday) but got nothing back. I looked into their policies more on the website and even if my friend had gone back the next day, they apparently would have charged her another $5-$10 for "supply" charges to redo her nails. I will definitely NOT be going back. It\'s not worth $20 + tip to have gel nails for a day'
