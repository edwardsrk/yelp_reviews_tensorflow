b"Very disappointing. All I asked was for my new growth to be crocheted it into my lock, instead he started a million baby dreads of new growth. Didn't take anything I said I wanted done into consideration. I mentioned before starting I've never used interlocking. I have been told my whole life it's not how you loc MY kind of hair. He told me he could do multicultural hair. Long story short very disappointing,  I spent $280 for literally nothing everything that he crocheted or interlocked slipped out the next day and now I have to spend another $300 to go back and crochet my roots where he interlocked because there's a hole in my dread. On top of everything hair aside the first subject he brings up as religion which is a big no-no. I said let's agree to disagree I don't to talk about religion I'm not gonna tell you you're wrong and I got a Bible thrown in my lap.  Very unprofessional if you do hair than you need to do hair and you need to take the customers opinion and their needs in the consideration."
