b"The food is delicious here but be prepared for extreme crowds not being able to get through to place a to go order and a snotty bartender. We do take out to avoid the crowds but have had multiple issues with the phone sending us to voicemail making it so doordash or grubhub could not even get through to do a to go order. Then there was the time I put in a to go order to pick up myself and one of the bartenders informed me that if its been over an hour, they throw out your food and then have to remake it when you get there because the cold stuff sat out too long. Don't they have refridgerators that keep that cold stuff until its time for pick up. BTW they quoted me it would be ready in 15-20 min and I got there right at the 50 min mark for pick up, not over an hour."
