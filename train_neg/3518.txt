b'The $10 (and above) burger is commonplace in brew pubs and concept restaurants these days.That doesn\'t mean the burger should be 10 bucks or eaters should put up with \'em. HopDaddy is the latest, clearest example.We went on a Wednesday night, right before the rush of diners. I ordered the prime time, the missus the s\'hroom burger. I was told the PT is served medium rare and was asked if I\'m OK with it. Great. What came out was a soggy, well-done burger -- did they keep the patty in a steamer, like some fast-food joint? -- that was flavorless.The missus\' burger was better but also overcooked.The bun is just not right -- it\'s way too soft and weak -- for a burger.The fries and beers are the best thing about our visit, although you have to wonder about $5 for a side of fries and $6 for draft beer served in a margarita glass (well short of a pint).Lastly, and it\'s not a small point, the concept of HopDaddy seems like an afterthought. It\'s poorly thought out and executed: you ordered on your own, then once seated, get "full wait service"? The wait staff provides no insight or service, save asking whether we needed anything else with our naked fries (yes, ketchup is upon request and served in small paper thimbles, just like McDonald\'s) and bringing the check.One might drop in for a brew if shopping in the area. Else there are many more options for a better burger experience.'
