b"Today i saw lax food safety standards at Chippys and alerted the chef to the issue and was shocked at their flippant reaction.A cook in the restaurant handles raw fish and frozen fish with bare hands and then handles cooked food at the same time, not even pretending to wipe the hands or kitchen surface (and cross contaminates the whole kitchen). He then cooks the rest of the food, and serves it. The finished food, chips, etc are placed on the same counter as raw fish preparation. There is not an actual food service area separated from prep. There is a pool of fish juice. The chef was in the rear of the open kitchen filleting fish (during a busy service) so I stepped over to talk without having all of the customers hear the issue. I asked the chef telling him I've experience as a chef/food handler and am concerned, wanting to speak away from customers and told him the issue. He responded that since he is a George Brown teacher he knows the code and I don't. He questions if I really have experience as a chef, He says that the food was being prepped on one side of the counter and serve on another. I pointed out that fish juices were literally spread all over this small counter and that the other cook wasn't using gloves and that bacteria migrates.I asked for my money back and said I didn't want to argue with him if he completely did not care about proper food handling but he just kept arguing at me angrily. My girlfriend came over and stopped things from going further. The chefs tone was very confrontational and rude.I alerted dine safe about Chippys."
