b"If I could give less than one star, that would have been my choice.  I rent a home and Per my lease agreement it is MY responsibility to pay their Pool Service company.  Within the last year they changed to PoolServ.  I have had  major issues with new techs every week, never checking PH balances, cleaning the filter, and not showing up at all 2 weeks in the past 2 months. I have had 4 different techs in the past 4 weeks.   I have emailed and called them and they never respond back nor even acknowledged my concerns or requests.  I cannot change companies but I'm required to still pay for lousy or no service.  Attached are a couple pictures of my pool recently due to one tech just didn't put any chlorine in it at all according to the tech who came the following week to attempt to clean it up.  Please think twice before working with these people.  No one wants to work with a business that doesn't return phone calls or emails."
