b"The last time I was at hot rocks, I had the most interesting and delicious pizza experience.  If i had written a review that time i would have given it 5 out of 5.  Oddly, I hadn't been back in quite a while until just recently.   This time I ordered the Macedonian  pasta with a starter green salad.  The salad was unique... but not good at all. It was waaayyy  overdressed. It tasted like every ingredient had been pickled  and then doused in lemon juice. I couldn't handle more than a couple mouthfuls before I gave up. The pasta... looked good.... sounded good.. but again was overdressed. There was so much dried basil in the sauce.. and instead of a light pesto.. The dish was swimming in oil. I'm not kidding. It was more like oil soup with penne noodles.  I'm was supremely disappointed.  But I will say the service was excellent. The server did come by and asked how everything was but I didn't have the courage to send my food back... Not saying this place doesn't know how to do pizza... and maybe I came on a bad night..  but I would be wary of ordering the pasta and salad."
