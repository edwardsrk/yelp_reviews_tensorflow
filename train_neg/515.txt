b'Ugg the service and food was just awful.Last time i ate here it was good,but last night was ridiculous.The server was rude and apathetic.She moved at the pace of a turtle,never smiled or showed any interest in how our food tasted.She let us sit with empty drinks for 10 minutes. i have never seen such a poorly run restaraunt in all my life.IT was not busy,and food took forever,along with everything else.When my chicken finally arrived,it was stringy and undercooked.I dont know how they managed to not cook my chicken properly,since i waited a half an hour for it.when we left the clueless manager was sitting on her butt at the bar,smiling and waving goodbye,like she thought everything was a o.k.I will never eat here again.the only good thing was the bread, which they are very stingy with the portion size.'
