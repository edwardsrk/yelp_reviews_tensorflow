b"This place is quite comical.  There were late picking me up.  The car smelled like smoke.  I asked for another car that had a USB port (I need to listen to a lecture) and the other car had a huge dent in the front and didn't have a USB port.  So then I kept smelly smoking car. I'm just not happy with this place"
