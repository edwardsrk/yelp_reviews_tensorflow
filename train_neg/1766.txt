b"Isn't this fantastic that we can voice our real opinions so just maybe this restaurant chain will wake up? Literally hospital cafeteria level quality! Hadn't eaten at a Red Lobster in years. The salad was iceberg lol..shrimp??? Tiny greasy crumb coated cheap junk! My husband's soup was so watered down with zero flavor or any clams to be found, he took it back. I understand this is a chain but come on! Better shrimp at Rubio's tacos!!"
