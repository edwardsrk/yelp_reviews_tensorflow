b"The owner of this store is very unprofessional. I got referred to this store by a co-worker and said that he would hook me up with everything. So, I made an appointment on Friday for a Saturday 9am appointment. I ride 20 miles to see him and he tells me he doesn't have a mechanic and that there's nothing he can do. He asked me to wait around and see if his mechanic decides to show up. 10 mins later he tells me that his mechanic showed up but it's gonna be a few mins. I ask him how much all of this would cost me and he gave me a total. To which I asked him if he would hook me up like he promised me over the phone. He blew is top and totally disrespected me in front of another customer in the store. I told him that his attitude to someone that came referred to his store was extremely horrible and he should be grateful that he gets referrals and his excuse was that he was having a bad day. Really????? Since when does a customer becomes a victim of a store's owner's bad day???? I don't care what anyone says, but this owner needs to learn the basics of having a business and that is customer service and keeping his promise."
