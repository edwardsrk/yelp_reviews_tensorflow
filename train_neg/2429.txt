b'I tried this place for the last time. Ive been here several times and everytime its never the same price and the people dont know the price they always have to call someone (the owner i assume) and clarify what price was agreed upon. When the guy asked do u want oil and hot stone he never said it would be $10 extra. Umm for you to rub a hot stone and oil on my back for an extra 3 1/2 minutes , im good thanks SKIP. Such a rip off. Dont go just because its convenient.'
