b"I wanted to like this place.  It's really close to where I live and I love Mediterranean food.  I held off on doing a review until I had tried it out multiple times.  However, after trying many items on their menu, Parsley just doesn't deliver. The ingredients don't seem fresh, the food is bland, and the overall quality is mediocre at best and sub-par at worst.  For example, every time I had their baklava it was stale.  The employees are nice and attentive.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large, but it was definitely a case of quantity over quality.  Maybe my standards for Mediterranean food are too high, but I don't think I'll be going back."
