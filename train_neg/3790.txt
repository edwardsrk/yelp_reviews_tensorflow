b"Bleh.Maybe their pizza slices + pop deals are decent value, but my standard medium regular pizza (plus pineapple - yum!) was only a teeny tiny marginally fractionally  bit nicer than the same order at the neighbouring Pizza Pizza, but three dollars more expensive.I'm also pretty sure one of the staff members who dealt with me was high. Judge me all you like, but I'll head back to Pizza Pizza next time."
