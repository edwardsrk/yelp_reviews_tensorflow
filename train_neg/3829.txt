b'I\'m probably not a fast food kinda person - still I was excited about US Fries.  I love fries! Security question "what is your favorite food" my answer is always french fries.  I suppose I should have asked if the french fries were hand cut fresh on site before going.  Still I\'m thinking if your name is US FRIES you should be the master of all things fries. I suspect the fries are made from frozen product bought in bulk. Fresh or frozen the fries are almost tasteless. I went with a friend from Canada who is always asking for brown gravy, she misses the poutine of her youth. I couldn\'t wait to take her to US Fries. She was over the moon with her meal. This is the first time I\'ve witnessed her eating all of her food.  She really liked it. She also likes Denny\'s, Golden Corral Buffet and processed cheese food. She loves meat and more meat. I\'m a vegetarian who has hosted french fry bars, fresh hand cut potatoes fried to a gold brown with soft creamy centers, so yummy! (Points of reference to gauge how your palate might relate.)Bottom line would I go back? Maybe to accompany a friend, otherwise no way.'
