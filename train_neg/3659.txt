b'I really wanted to like this salon. When I moved here I was trying all the area nail salons to find the best fit. The pedicure chairs seemed to be a little bit older and not well cared for. Many women were offered beverages, but I think they forgot my friend and I so we had to ask. The positive - we were able to walk in on a Sunday and get appointments immediately. The salon folks were very nice, but my nails chipped quickly.'
