b'This would have been a 5 star review but since there was a fraudulent charge on my credit card this place receives a 1 star rating.  The $27 fraudulent tip added to my bill by the bartender is not only unacceptable but illegal.  If you decide to visit bring cash and save the headache of calling your bank to reverse the charge.  I have since emailed the GM to advise him of what is occurring in his establishment.'
