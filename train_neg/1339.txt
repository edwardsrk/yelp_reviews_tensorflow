b'Horrible store! Horrible customer service! Was planning to open 2 new lines through Sprint with my husband but after being in this joke of a store we decided not to. We were helped by a woman who clearly didn\'t know what was going on in her own store. She tried to show us the new iPhone 6 but didn\'t even know it wasn\'t on display anymore. All she cared about was making her sale. We were going to preorder 2 iPhones and she said she just had to see our credit. My husband SPECIFICALLY asked her if it would be a hard credit pull or a soft. And she said don\'t worry it\'s soft. Come to find out this morning it was a hard credit pull. Besides that she had no other information or answers for our questions. It was all "I\'m not sure." "I\'ll have to check."  Do you know your job or not?! Don\'t go here. You can find better help at another store with more educated employees.'
