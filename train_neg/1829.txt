b"Ordered the pizza on my phone. It said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. Went to pick it up. Worker looked up the order on the computer and said it wasn't ready yet. Didn't get the pizza until more than 40 minutes after we ordered it! Brought it home (5 minute drive) and guess what - the pizza isn't even hot anymore!!! I'm guessing the pizza was made on time but the order wasn't updated in the system? I don't know. But either way - waiting 40 minutes for a cold pizza is totally unacceptable. I've been to other locations and this has never been a problem."
