b"I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO APPALLED BY THE MEDICAL CARE RECEIVED! Or should I say lack there of! Appointments?! Clearly mean nothing, after waiting 3 hours before being seen! Then to have Dr. Royal-Pain-In-The-Ass only look for 2 minutes and proceed to rush me out. Not to mention the MOST INCOMPETENT, ABSOLUTE RUDEST UNPROFESSIONAL FRONT DESK STAFF I have EVER met!!. I'm sure I would've been better off using webMD or Google to diagnose myself! Unbelievably awful!! Just an over all Atrocious experience!! RUN!! DONT WASTE YOUR DAY in this fast food, sorry excuse for a medical office!!"
