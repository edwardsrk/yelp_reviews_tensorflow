b"I have visited thus salon at least a half a dozen times and have never left with a smile when I have gotten my nails done. I even asked for different technicians each time. The salon looks beautiful and elegant unfortunately the expertise is lacking! I just wanted a gel color change and the technician didn't realize I had fake nails, she thought they were real. In my opinion that speaks volumes to the level of knowledge present. Also, on that same visit I paid $30 for a french tip and an uneven blue line. This was the icing on the cake for me and I will never return. Oh and don't bother making an appointment, you will still wait for at least 30 minutes until they take you.Go anywhere else, but here!"
