b"I finally decided to stop coming here after several years because I've grown increasingly dissatisfied. I suppose I stuck around so long out of convenience.To start, I'll never understand why it always takes 3.5 hours to groom my 18-pound dog. And last time, he came home in an itching frenzy. He finally stopped after a whole month. The vet told us that something irritated his skin, but we don't know what...could've been the shampoo or maybe a powder of some sort? In addition to that, inconsistency seems to be an issue. It would be nice if the staff would take note of what their clients ask for, so that they can ensure the grooming will be the same each time. Also noticed some blood on my pup's nails a few times... they clearly cut too close to the blood supply. When I calmly brought it up, the person totally downplayed it and didn't apologize. Listen, it happens. It's not easy cutting a dog's nails, but for the love of God, a simple apology goes a long way."
