b"This place has some rude and racist employees here! I kept saying nooo it's not jst that person but this has been my third visit and I will never ever return! After the old lady rang me up today I had an e gift card I wanted to use since I had 40.66 left on and she's like we dnt even take those ok tell me how was I able to use it last week and now this time was an issue?! So since I wasn't able to use it, I told her to cancel my to go orders and she yells out to her boss who was jst next to her Oh void THIS since she can't afford to pay for it! I didn't say I can't afford to pay it I wasn't going to waste my money since I had the gift card with a balance on it! Then manager says u need to print it out next time what's the difference of me bringing in a copy of the e-gift card when u could easily scan the barcode?! Ridiculous!"
