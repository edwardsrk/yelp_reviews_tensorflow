b'Well Fridays,  I think we are going to go our separate ways.   Your food was good,  the service used to be good and the beer was cold,  however,  the last 3 visits to different locations have proven that it\'s not just a location issue it\'s a company wide issue.  We had horrible service today for a lunch and the fries were nasty.  It took the server over 10 minutes to even take a drink order.  I was seated without a kids menu and when I did get one,  no crayons.  That\'s not a deal breaker as I carry them with me.   Our food took an ok amount of time and was super hot.   We had the rib special and chicken fingers as well as kids mac n chs.  The fries that both my husband and I had were horrible.   Cold and mushy.  The manager was so busy running food we couldn\'t flag him down.   Our server never truly stopped at the table she only paused long enough for us to say any thing as she kept try to serve the other table more then us that was right behind us.  I honestly felt like the "red-headed step-child" and was a huge bother to her.  Even trying to pay she never truly stopped at the table just tried to grab and run off until my husband said there was a striped reward written on there    She tried to say she didn\'t need anything but the phone  number, but my husband was trying to tell her there was a reward to redeem number written too.  I don\'t think they were under staffed as I saw many employees running around.  It seems as if a company wide training needs to happen since this seemed to be the same situation at all 3 locations.'
