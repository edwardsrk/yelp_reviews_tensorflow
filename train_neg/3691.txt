b"Not takeout friendly unless you enjoy cutting your own noodles.  Beef broth for pho was pretty good, but the ramen is totally worth skipping.  The wangs were totally underwhelming - save yourself some money and toss some wings in oil at home, then dump on some sweet and sour once crispy.  Garlic rice had no garlic.  Can't recommend."
