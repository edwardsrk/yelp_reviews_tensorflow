b"I always saw pics from this place and it looked good so thought I would try it out tonight..unfortunately it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. The service was slow!!!!!! We got seated quickly because there were a lot of open tables. However it took them awhile to ask for our orders. Even when they took our orders, they forgot some of the items. We decided to do all you can eat and started off with bulgogi, short ribs, and beef brisket..they just brought out the bulgogi and forgot the rest. When we asked for the rest, the waitress said 'okay' and made it seem like we didn't order it from the beginning. We also asked for drinks but even after 15min, they didn't bring anything (not even water). The quality of the food wasn't all that great either. Didn't leave a good impression that I want to go back again.. Only good thing is parking! Since it's in a shopping complex there's tons of parking."
