b"This review is based solely on the food. Service was 5 stars, but we probably got such great service because we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. I ordered the special Cuban Torta, meat was a bit on the skimpy side and flavor was very lacking. No salt or pepper on tables so we had to ask for it. Portion to price ratio is way off, ordered rice with my Torta and after 3-4 spoon fulls rice was done. To sum up this place I'd say it's best for drinks and appetizers."
