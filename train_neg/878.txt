b"One of the worst HOB I have been to.  My wife and I went here on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. Decent looking place. My waitress was nice, but she reminded me of the gal that was on Seinfeld, a low talker.  I could barely hear anything she was saying.  I hoped I didn't misunderstand anything she said and ended up with a meal I didn't order.I ordered a shrimp po' boy.  The shrimp was just okay, no spiceyness to it, but the bread it travelled in was bad.  It literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up. For the price, not even remotely worth it.My wife ordered a salad.  It was lettuce with a small chunk of blue cheese on the top and dressing on the side.  For nine bucks. And though this is no fault of HOB, my wife didn't like the lettuce offered and she asked for another kind.  They did not offer anything else.Very disappointing meal.  Lots of waitresses and waiters standing around.  It seems like this place is going on it's rock and roll reputation. We will not be back, at least not this location."
