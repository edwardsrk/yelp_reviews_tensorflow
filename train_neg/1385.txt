b"When this salon opened, they were great.  Over the past few years, ownership/management changes have really led to a decline.  The pedicures I have had there haven't been very good for a while.  I recently found an older gift certificate I had, so I took it in and the lady (who had not one other customer, by the way, laughed when I asked if I could still use it.  She said that they expire a year after the purchase date (which is not noted anywhere on the gift certificate.) Any business should always keep a consistent accounting policy.  Gift certificates outstanding should be noted in the event of a sale and still honored if not disclosed with an expiration as this one was not.  I was there to have several services and they lost an additional $60 above the pedicure value of the gift certificate that they should have honored.  I went down the road to my preferred salon."
