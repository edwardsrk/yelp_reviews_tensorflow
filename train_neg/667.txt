b'Let me start by saying this place is a complete joke, whether it starts with the "luxury living" while housing section 8 guest or just having rude employees. The fake wood floors is a nice touch if you are looking for cheap. One Of the things I love the most is the 37 kids from section 8 screaming their heads off. Everything is old and cheap, one of the employees explained to us that the place was old and that\'s why it is the way it is... Oh okay I didn\'t know that was an excuse for having not so hot water, dips in the floors, blinds made of tissue paper, AC\'s that could barely cool a smart car, water that smells like sulfur, and phone jacks that have been painted over... Like really? Did you have sloth from the goonies build these? Honestly I get creeped out at night to take the trash out... You feel like you are going to get jumped by a velociraptor or just plain see someone going number 2 in the grass? I also love the vomit in the rocks from old town guest, that\'s a nice touch.'
