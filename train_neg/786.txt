b'The food was actually great, but one star for the horrendous service. I can\'t speak for all of the servers, but don\'t come here if you\'re looking for a good dining experience. Our service was awful.  My boyfriend and I ordered the sirloin with the soup, salad, and dessert ($32 combo). The server never introduced herself, never tried to have a conversation with us, never explained anything on the menu nor the concept, nor once tried to treat us like we were anything other than just another check.When we ordered, we made one single substitution to the combo: we swapped out the profiteroles for creme caramel (a $0.50 difference). That fifty cent substitution came back as a fifteen dollar increase on our bill. The waitress then decided that was the appropriate time to explain they have a no substitution policy, so she "had to" ring up each item in the combo individually. Midway through the conversation with my boyfriend, she tossed the receipt at him, walked 10 feet away, and turned her back to us until we paid. Unbelievable. Once we paid the ridiculously inflated bill and tipped, she proceeded to start an unsolicited argument with us about how the charges were justified.Anyway, they have one single item on the menu: the steak. It\'s excellent.'
