b"We stopped in for late night tacos tonight at 12:05. Sat at the outside counter for fifteen minutes without being acknowledged. There were plenty of people in the kitchen putting tops on containers and such. Specifically, there was a chef in a blue and gray shirt that looked at us three times while working an arms length away and didn't acknowledge us once. Finally, we went inside to ask for service and was told late night service wouldn't start for another 30 minutes. I expect more from a Richard D restaurant. Very disappointing. I hope others don't have the same experience."
