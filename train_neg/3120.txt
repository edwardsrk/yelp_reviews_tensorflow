b"You'd think that the menu items here would be vegetarian, looking at the restaurant name. Think again. *dramatic intro*Came here to celebrate being veg-curious with some cool folks. I'd been to the Mekong Plaza across the street and tried UnPhogettable, which offers delicious pho. I was craving something hot to soothe my throat and pho sounded perfect. I'd read in reviews that this place has two menus: an American and a Vietnamese. Wanting to order something authentic, I chose from the latter and got a pho combo with beef and chicken. Since I thought the whole menu was vegetarian, I was excited to see this option with soy meat. I also ordered cream cheese wontons as an appetizer.Our food came in waves in the order that we ordered. My wontons were pretty good and I liked the sweet and sour sauce. The pho bowl arrived and it looked surprisingly and suspiciously like it had real beef. Then when I noticed the bone marrow/gelatin, I knew something was wrong. Thankfully, Norm saved the day by tracking down our server and asking about it and somehow he gave me the real deal. It took 15 min or so for my vegetarian pho to come out and I didn't eat much of it. It was lacking flavor, even with the addition of Sriracha.This is why I have trust issues. Apparently, the restaurant has two sides and one serves meat. Reading the name and the menu, I didn't realize this and only found out after my snafu. I can look past things like the ambiance if the food is good, but this wasn't the case. The placemats reminded me of the 90s and there was a dead fly on the table. Like I said, I normally don't care about the aesthetics but figured it belonged in this review. I won't be back, and there are other places nearby that I'll probably try."
