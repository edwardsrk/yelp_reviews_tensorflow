b'Nothing special here. Some lights, a DJ, a small dance area, mediocre drinks, decently priced for a place in the Mandalay Bay, and lots of sitting room.  Convenient for those staying at the Mandalay Bay or The Hotel and not too crowded (no cover, open seats available) but almost too loud for talking with friends.'
