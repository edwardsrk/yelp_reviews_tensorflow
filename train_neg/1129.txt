b'Good food at Mesa but bad experience, totally unexpected from a restaurant owned by one of my favorite tv chefs - Bobby Flay. When our food arrived, the plate had a big hair on it, I immediately brought it to the attention of the server and the manager who got my food to the table, they took it back and immediately got one back, just by removing the hair, when I asked them why did they get the same plate, they lied and said they made a different one, it was impossible, first of all I had to wait for a good 20 mins before they got my entree out so there was no way they would do another one in seconds, secondly I was sitting very close to the kitchen and saw it with my own eyes that it was the same plate. I decided not to contradict as I had my 3 yr old around, we barely ate, paid the check and walked out, they did not compensate the dish, neither did they apologize. So not done....not going back.'
