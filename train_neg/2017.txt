b"Last night we had a take out of Butter Chicken. I ordered it as medium spice. The butter chicken sauce tasted like sweet tomato sauce. It reminded me of panera bread tomato soup. It was that sweet. Tamarind used to have good delicious food. I don't mind paying more for delicious food but their quality has gone down. It's more expensive than other local establishment and food quality has degraded as well."
