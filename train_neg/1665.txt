b"I went here before the chili peppers concert. We got there around 4:00pm before it was packed. The food was horrible and nothing like the Buford's in Moon. I ordered the chicken fingers and my friend ordered a burger. The food came out within minutes of ordering. It was so fast that we initially told the server it was the wrong table because we had just ordered. The fries on both dishes were hot but the chicken and burger were barely warm. My chicken looked like it sat under a heat lamp for a couple days. Neither of us could stomach the food enough to finish the entire dish. The only good thing about the visit was that the server made sure we had drinks. If it wasn't for the server, I would be asking Yelp to allow negative stars."
