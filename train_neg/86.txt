b"I wasn't aware that it's a state law in PA for phlebotomists to only be allowed to try taking blood three times at one time. Whoever the woman was that I was assigned to could not find a vein to get blood. This was important for medical reasons to get done and she was very unprofessional and rude. I recently moved to PA from Ohio, so I didn't know a phlebotomist here can only try three times. I kindly said to her 'can I ask why you can only try three times?' And she gave me a nasty uncaring look and replied quickly 'because I'm not a doctor'. After I left, all I could think was no shit you aren't a doctor, it's not a doctor's job to take blood, it's your job( a phlebotomists' job). I thought it was very unprofessional. I've never dealt with someone in the medical field that didn't truely care or have passion for helping me, especially if I ask a question. I don't remember her name, and if I did I wouldn't put her name out there. I just wish people would stop and remember the reason why they chose that field. Yes, money is great for most of the opportunities, but you really have to care and want to make a difference in order to be successful in the medical field. Even if someone asks a stupid common sense question, just remember there is a reason they are choosing you to ask. If someone asks me anything, I feel honored because they care about my opinion and what it is I have to say. Just saying, sorry for rambling!"
