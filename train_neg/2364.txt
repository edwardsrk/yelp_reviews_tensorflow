b"The car was fine. The service was fine. My complaint is I got a confirmation email telling me the car was waiting for me.  So, naturally, I assumed that meant I could go out to the garage and they'd have the car ready to go... (I'm Platinum w them btw.)  I got out to the garage and was informed I had to drag my stuff back into the terminal and wait through a line 10 people deep.  Ugh!  My suggestion Enterprise (as if they're really listening to this feedback) is to change the email reminder to explicitly tell people they have to stop at the counter first."
