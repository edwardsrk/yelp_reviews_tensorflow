b"No matter where I am in the valley, when I'm craving donuts this is where I go because the donuts here is the best. Apple Fritters, crisp outside, soft gooey inside, donut holes that are completely covered in glaze, and their burritos are pretty delicious.*update* Today 09/02/18 I experienced the worst service ever. Male working at 530PM when I arrived, worst attitude, refused to listen to what my party and I said, placed donuts into box that we DID NOT ORDER and looked at us like NEXT? No matter the fact that I told him we dont want THOSE, he stood there and asked AND? If it were legal, I would have jumped the counter to beat his stupid ass. Told him to shove his donuts up his ass and his response HAVE A GOOD DAY."
