b"The food sucked. We left extremely unsatisfied, especially considering that we were super hungry coming in (it wouldn't have taken much to please us). Paid $55 for a meal we didn't finish. Did I mention I was super starving?Ordered the garlicky butter bake because my boyfriend loves garlic. Turned out to be a disaster. The dish came out much smaller than expected (unlike the picture shown).  The lobster wasn't cleaned, had no flavor, and the meat was way too soft and fell apart. The one small cluster of snow crab legs we got was missing a leg. The corn was bland. The mussels weren't good, either. The garlic flavor leaned towards bitterness... The garlic bread was okay though. Also got the skillet paella. It mostly tasted like tomatoes, even with the seafood in it. The worst part was broken pieces of mussel shells were scattered throughout. Unappealing and unappetizing. Like the garlicky butter bake, the best part of the dish was the two pieces of garlic bread (which wasn't even that great).We were actually here sometime last year and the food wasn't so bad then. I don't know if they changed chefs or what, but it's safe to say that we definitely won't be returning here anytime soon. I'm only giving two stars because service was pretty decent -even though they didn't ask us how our food was. I guess they already knew the answer."
