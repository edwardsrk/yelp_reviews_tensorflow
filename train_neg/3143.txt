b"I really wasn't too impressed. I walked around the entire store trying to find help and I couldn't. I mean talk about ghost town. I finally found someone who was helping someone else & I hate to interrupt when that happens but I didn't have a choice.After some of help, I found what I was looking for. The variety of choices here does not compare to other craft stores that I can go to. I wouldn't waste my time coming back."
