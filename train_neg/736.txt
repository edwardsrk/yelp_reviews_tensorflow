b"Stayed here on 12/29/2015. First off, the parking situation was really bad. We had to park in the far end parking lot which is about a 1/4 mile from the hotel lobby. Second, they put us in the wrong room, so we complained and they reluctantly switched us to a non-smoking room. They acted like they were doing us a favor for the switch. Third, we were woken up twice in the morning, once at 8:00AM and again at 10:50AM by guests who were incorrectly  booked in our room!! Fourth, upon leaving the elevators were not working - we had to haul our luggage down 22 flights of stairs to finally exit onto the 1st floor roof only to be greeted by an unfriendly security guard that told us we needed to have more patience with the elevators. After dealing with the rude employee we preceded  to exit the first floor roof down a flight of stairs. Keep in mind, we had no idea where we were going - us and other guest thought we'd end up stuck on the roof. Wow, this was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. We complained to management, and in return they graciously paid our resort fee of $30.00 LOL."
