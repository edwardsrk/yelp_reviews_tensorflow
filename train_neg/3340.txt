b"I love that they have a drive through that serves real food. Who doesn't want a salad or soup without having to leave their car?I've been here once. I had a Coke Zero, which was truly terrible. Their mix is way off. This cost them half a star.I also had the Al Mondo salad. It was very good. Fresh ingredients with well trimmed chicken. No flabby bits. No weird seasoning blend (like Panera uses on their chicken).  I didn't want the sweet dressing, so I got ranch dressing instead. The salad came with bread and I chose country French. This is basically sourdough sandwich bread. Boo. They also didn't give me any butter. The bread was nothing to get excited about, which is too bad at a place called Kneaders. The service at the drive through was great, which I appreciate.Edited - I noticed that their ranch dressing is not that great and I got a couple of bites of flabby chicken. Their bacon has an artificial, chemical smoke flavor but it is otherwise good. I think it's really more deserving of a 2.5 star rating, not 2'"
