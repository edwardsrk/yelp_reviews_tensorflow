Never communicate about how my case was going and when I called to ask for information their staff was very unprofessional and rude. Remember calling Mr. Corral and leaving messages to hear about my case but he never answered or got back to me. The day when I have my second accident called him and as soon as I mentioned that I have another accident he pick up the phone but thanks God I have already founded another lawyer and told him that I was only calling to advice that have another accident because stayed at the paper work that I received on first meeting with him. Haven't finalized my case still because they holding my daughter's check and still don't know when I going to get it it's over 2 months since my case settled..."
