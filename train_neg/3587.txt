b"I really wanted to like Booyah, especially because it's like David fighting Dutch Dreams (Goliath) in the ice cream war just a couple doors down.Perhaps I just had my bar set high with my TO favourites like Red Bench, Bakerbots, Moo Milk Bar and Bang Bang... But Booyah really failed to deliver any wow factor in its ice cream sandwiches. I ordered a half sandwich of milk and white chocolate chip cookie and Moose Tracks ice cream.  The cookies were thin and flat, with average flavour and the ice creams are not made on premise but rather are sourced from Kawartha Dairies. Ice cream sandwiches are 4.65 for a half (one cookie, two scoops) and 7.10 for a full (two cookies, four scoops), the value for which I expected better. The interiors however are very clean and modern, and the service was friendly. There are two benches outside its door (similar to Bakerbots) for seating.For a shop that's super specialized, Booyah under-delivered. It's good for when the Dutch Dreams line is impossibly long and you have an ice cream craving that won't go away, but otherwise I would patiently wait a few doors down."
