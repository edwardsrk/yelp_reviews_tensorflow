b"I stopped in because Harumi Sushi no longer serves dinner options, only sushi. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by a nice woman. After glancing over the menu, I chose the lasagna, which comes with sourdough bread. I wasn't in a dine-in mood so I took the order togo. The restaurant was clean and I only waited about ten minutes to receive the meal. However, the clean environment and short wait time cannot make up for the bad taste of the food. The lasagna was horrible!! It taste extremely bad and I don't know if it is just me or not but when did lasagna start being made with carrots? Moral of the story is, I will not be returning again!"
