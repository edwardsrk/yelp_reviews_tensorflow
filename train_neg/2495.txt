b'$240.00 New Patient FEE$122.00 "Surgery"$65.00 Binocular microscopy-------------------------------------$427.00 TOTALThis is what my bill looked like after going in to have some earwax removed.  EARWAX!  If you want to be rushed through your visit and then overcharged, this is the place for you.  Had they mentioned there would be a $240.00 new patient fee, I would have turned on my heel and walked out of there.  When I called and asked for the undisclosed fee to be reduced or removed, they refused.  Not sure how they get away with this.'
