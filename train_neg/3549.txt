b"Perhaps the breakfast is why people have given this place such high reviews, but today we showed up at 11:30 and we were told breakfast stops at 11. Which is fine, since this is a diner and should have some good burgers and sandwiches, but we were wrong. I had the Scotty, which was okay but way too much sauce that made the bread mushy, my son's hot dog buns were semi cold, the same for my daughters cheeseburger. The fries though plentiful weren't anything to write home about...Yelp yes, but not home. :)Food took quite a while to come out, server was friendly and seemed to know many people that were in the cramped areas. I had to move to another table because the person behind me wouldn't be able to get out unless my son and I got up during our meals and let them out. I go out of my way to eat and mom and pop places, but this time we were all let down."
