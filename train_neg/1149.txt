b'Started our Sonic experience this evening at 7:30pm, attempted to order a heath concrete mixer, was told they were out of heath. Ordered two mixers and a small vanilla ice cream. We waited, waited and waited until 25 minutes later my husband went to ask about our order and was told they are short staffed. They handed him our ice cream and he asked for spoons...THEY WERE OUT OF SPOONS! My husband expressed, "you have to be flippin\' kidding me, half of what you do has a spoon in it!"  Seriously, Mr. Sonic himself would of been disappointed with lack of menu items, the WAIT and NO SPOONS. It\'s simple really, put someone in charge, wait should never be more than 5 minutes, check your inventory and make sure you have SPOONS :)'
