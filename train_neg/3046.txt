b"Iv been coming to this location for 7yrs. Iv always asked to vacuum out my own car since the guys are in such a hurry they tend to miss shit. Today I was told I can't vacuum my own car. Why not? The excuse was is against insurance policy. That's a bunch of bull... iv always done it. Then was told its because the owners were here so which is it? After coming on to yelp to see the low reviews of other ppl. Think it's time to find another car wash place."
