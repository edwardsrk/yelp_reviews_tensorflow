b"What an odd No Frills.  As a No Frills goes, stock wise it's actually superior to most -- lots of things here you wouldn't normally find at a discount grocer.  Prices are good, nice variety... but:1)  shopping carts are dingy, old, and broken down.2)  shopping carts (again) are located either in the below ground parking lot, or in the NASTY corral outside that has on occasion smelled of urine, vomit, and dead animal.3)  terrible layout... where the hell is everything?  is there any rhyme or reason to how things are stocked?4)  questionable staff -- I actually witnessed a staff member stocking halal meat next to and on top of bulk packaged pork... a manager was there, told him he couldn't do that, and they subsequently got into a heated argument (complete with 'F' shots)All that aside, I can't ignore the variety available here... so every few weeks I'll come back, pick up a few things, and be done with it.For a better No Frills experience, try the one at Brockton village at Dundas W & Lansdowne.  Cleaner, fresher, superior layout."
