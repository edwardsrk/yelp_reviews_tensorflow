b"Wouldn't go back do to a lack of service and blandness of food. Teenage waiter lacked hustle and basic costumer service skills. Didn't even offer or bring any bread or parmesano for the meals. Thankfully I wasn't paying the bill because he wouldn't have gotten a cent for his lazy, unorganized, and unapologetic performance. Not one person in our four person party was wowed by their meal. We asked for a manager at one point and he /she never showed. At $18 a meal and so many good reviews I expected much more."
