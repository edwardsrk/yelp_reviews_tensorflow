b"I will not be going back to this place. I got a complete car wash service done from here--the actual service was average/okay. I later noticed that the back seat car mat was missing and called them back to complain. I was told that someone would be contacting me back but nobody did. So about a week later I called them again and was promised that someone would be calling me back within a day or so. Again no phone call. I've since stopped calling  but have vowed to never use this location again. I completely understand that someone might have forgotten to put back the mat in the car--mistakes happen. However it's not acceptable to never respond to an inquiry after 2 calls."
