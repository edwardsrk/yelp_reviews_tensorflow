b"I hadn't been to Roberto's in a while, but I was in the mood for Mexican food and since I had my dog with me, I needed to find one with a drive-through. This Roberto's has a drive-through (yay!), but the food was just as lame as I remembered it :(I brought my meal home to eat. Good thing, because it would have been an unholy mess trying to eat my order in the car! I got a beef taco and a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. I appreciate the freshly made taco shell, but the meat was really tough. (I must say I am not a fan of shredded beef tacos, so maybe if I would have gotten ground beef, it would have been better. But I didn't see that as an option on the menu...) The quesadilla was HUGE--maybe that's how they justify the $7 (with guac) price tag. But the chicken was bland; the peppers were undercooked; and the whole thing was really greasy. I only ate half, and I didn't even give the rest of it to my dog, because I was afraid it might make him sick.I did notice some out-of-state license plates in the parking lot while I was waiting in the drive-through, so maybe they get a lot of tourist traffic. And I do know several locals who swear by Roberto's. I guess it's just not the right Mexican food for me."
