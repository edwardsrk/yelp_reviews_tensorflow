b'This review is not limited to this particular Albertsons, but for many, including the one near Bermuda & Maryland, as well as the sister company Von\'s at Anthem Drive in Henderson. Shoppers BEWARE. When I presented my "just for you"  discount for certain items, the cash register price is higher than the stated "just for you" price.  This was not a singular experience. Without exaggeration, this occurred in more than 50% of times when I shopped there (at least 10 times in the past 2 months). I have no intention to destroy their reputation, but simply want to warn shoppers. In fact, I have switched to Smith for this reason.'
