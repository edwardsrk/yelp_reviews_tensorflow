b'I had an ok experience, it was during lunch on the weekend... not a lot of people inside and they had the games on but the TVs were blasting loud... couldnt enjoy conversation. I ordered the french dip, it was very greasy... the au ju appeared to be some form of a gravy. The tots were good.. nice and crunchy and not too salty. Its a ride from my house and not a place I would go out of the way to go to again.'
