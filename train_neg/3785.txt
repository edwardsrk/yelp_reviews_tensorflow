b"I used to love their food. Until one time I got a bee in my salad. Granted, I understand that fresh produce has the potential to be exposed to such things, but when I called and talked to the manager- she could have cared less. She said she could have them remake my salad - which would be nice if I had dined in or lived close. I live 20 mins away and myself and 2 other people couldn't stomach to try to eat our takeout meals. So $35+ meal down the drain. And no compensation. We refuse to go back."
