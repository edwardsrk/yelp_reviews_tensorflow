b'This place is disgusting!  I walked in shortly after it opened to get a drink.  No customers there.  The floors, tables and counters are all dirty ( yet no one there).  So obviously it hasn\'t been cleaned from day before.  No one greeted me.  Waited 5 min.  Still no one.  Went to restroom, and it was beyond gross!!   Stalls all dirty, one even when blood on floor under toilet.  Went back out without using restroom.  I finally had to call out for someone. A young girl came up.  Got me the drink.  I asked to speak to manager, and Indian guy I believe.  I could here her ask to come out from behind wall. He obviously said no cause she came out and said, "can you come back later, he\'s on computer right now. ".  Don\'t go here!  Can\'t believe it passes health inspections.'
