b"Garbage car wash. The owner always seems to be in a bad mood and doesn't make the customer's feel wanted there. I've been here 3-4 times and I always thought maybe they'll change. I guess not. What made me write this review was that the last time I was there, they did a horrible job. The car was still dirty and they didn't even dry the car 100%. I drove literally 10 miles away and I had a ton of water marks near the spoiler, side mirrors and trunk area. They're cheap for a reason. Save yourself a headache and treat your car to a real car wash else where."
