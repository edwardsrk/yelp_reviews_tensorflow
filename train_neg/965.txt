b'Rude US Airways Gate Agent in a Friendly CityI fly nearly every week. Maybe I\'m getting to be a jaded frequent flyer.  Today was one of those days that I really wanted to pitch a fit. I am booked for a flight that is scheduled to leave at 7:05. I had a shot to leave Pittsburgh airport on the 5:15 flight to Charlotte that departed from Gate B34.When I arrived, they were boarding. I approached the first gate agent and asked if I could get on the flight. She looked at me and rather shortly said "Are you Platinum or Gold?" I said "No, I\'m Silver". That was it. No more words beyond that were said. I was not happy. So, I waited a bit and asked the second agent, who said, "I believe the first gate agent already answered your question". Wow.Every time I can choose to fly Southwest instead of US Airways, you can better believe I will.On the other hand, I love Pittsburgh. With 2 exceptions, home to some of the friendliest people in the country.'
