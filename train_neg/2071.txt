b'Horrible customer service. I have gotten food from here a few times expecting to have a better experience from the last, but I was wrong to hope for that. I once called and they answered "Hold on" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered "Hold on" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says "Well what do you want to know specials on?" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We\'ve ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use "fresh ingredients" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service. If you want WAYYYY better NY pizza go to rockos pizza. Way better prices, extremely friendly service, way better EVERYTHING.'
