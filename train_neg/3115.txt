b"One of the worst meals we've had in Vegas. My  wife's Tuna was cold in the middle and after sending it back it came back tasting fishy. My ribeye with Bearnaise sauce was nothing special. The best dish anyone had was truffle fries.The desert menu was pedestrian at best. In no way did the meal live up to Thomas Kellers reputation."
