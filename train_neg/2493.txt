b"Why fly Economy, when you can get that same food at Ikea? This is my first experience eating at Ikea Food Court. Ikea has been open for over a month now & the lines at The Food Court are still massive. The portion sizes are perfect for small people or people dieting.... but at least they are reasonably priced. I had the Swedish Meatball plate & the hot Salmon plate, they were out of mashed potatoes for the Meatball plate so I substituted French Fries. First, the good: the French Fries were perfect- well cooked, hot & not skinny, also my customer interaction with everyone at Ikea, has been great- very friendly, super informative. Now for the bad: EVERYTHING else was over-cooked. These were well thought out plates, that should have been great..... just not well planned for a busy Cafeteria venue. They need to cook in smaller batches, watch sitting times in their storage ovens & taste & throw out old, over-cooked items &/or under-cook their food from the start, knowing that they will continue to cook in their storage ovens. One last thing, their 75 cent coffee, is the 2nd worst coffee that I have drank in Vegas...... but it was free with my Ikea Family Card.This was my first dining experience at Ikea & even though it wasn't great, I plan on eating there every time, that I shop at Ikea, until I have tried their whole menu. I like to try different cuisines....... & Meatballs with Lingonberry Jam, is very different for me. I hope with reviews like mine or maybe more experience cooking with their equipment, that Ikea will put out better hot food, in the future. I will let you know. I have high hopes, because everything else at Ikea is just so very clever."
