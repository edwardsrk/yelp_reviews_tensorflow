b"Disappointed with this Chipotle location. The employees are very skimpy with portions. If I'm going to pay you for a bowl, you should give me enough to fill the bowl! I understand that the employees are probably concerned about running out of food. This falls now on the cooks and management. Make more food to serve your paying customers and keep portion size consistent. If I wanted a kids meal I would have ordered one. Another thing, I got a bowl recently and it had hard pieces of idk what in it!!  Not cool or ok!!!!"
