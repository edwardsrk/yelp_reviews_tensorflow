b'I live in the neighborhood next door, so I unfortunetly frequent this place. I can vouch that about 98% of the time they WILL get your order wrong. I don\'t know how they do it. Maybe they have some kind of contest on who can get the most (or least?) amount of people to return their order. Just today, I order 2 coffees and 4 wraps (2 with chicken and 2 with ham) from the drive thru. They hand me my drinks and ask me to park and wait for my food. The guy assures me it will only be two minutes. I wait about 6 minutes. For wraps. When the guy comes out, he hands me my bag, gives a quick "Have a nice day" and walks off. I\'m barely opening my bag of food before he\'s gone. Guess what they get wrong? The ham! They left out the ham that they charged me for. It\'s on the receipt but it\'s not in my wrap. I just said forget it. They clearly don\'t care about their customers enough. I won\'t be going back. There\'s a Dunkin near my job that is always efficient. I\'ll just go there.'
