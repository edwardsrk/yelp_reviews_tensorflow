b"Thank you Eric M. for a response. However, based upon previous reviews citing the same issues of unrepaired broken equipment, the general state of the gym's cleanliness and  - one I didn't add - the fact that weights are thrown around the floor or not unracked - and the ongoing lack of attention to these matters over the months, I'm not really sure why responding to you one-on-one will help. The gym either fixes its issues, or it does not. If the proposed 24-Hour Fitness at Blue Diamond / Buffalo / Durango ever materializes, EoS will lose a lot of clients. Not a shill for 24-Hour, but from my experience, they have people who go around the gym hourly and clean up, etc. I have not found their equipment in constant of disrepair. I don't think the issue is the staff at this location, per se. The problem is having thousands of active members, but not paying for the appropriate levels of staff to maintain the quality of the experience, and equipment. It also didn't help that the contractor that was used was probably not the best. From the git-go, lots of things didn't work. That seems evidenced by the numerous electrical type problems - such as the stereo not working on all of the speakers in the gym, 50% of the TVs at any one time not getting reception, etc.Still, there is significant cash-flow to the gym and insufficient maintenance. Also, the layout / choices of cardio equipment not the best -but apparently the least expensive. I stand by my assessment of the gym being run by a company owned by an LBO firm intent upon strip-mining  our membership dues and fees. :-)"
