b'Luchita\'s was a huge disappointment. The food quality was very poor.  I ordered tacos and chicken fajitas.  My 6 year old held up her taco and said , "mommy look." grease was pouring out of the taco so much so that her plate was filled with grease. I showed the waitress by picking up the taco as more and more grease poured out. In sheer disbelief she said nothing and walked away.  Trust me Taco Bell is a hundred times better!  On my way out after expressing to another waitress how bad the food was\' she said "they just didn\'t drain the meat." Poor quality food, poor service.'
