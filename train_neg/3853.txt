b"My friends and I decided to come here b/c of their happy hour. It was in our hotel as well so we figured, why not? This place is not terrible, the chips and salsa were good. I had one of the burritos and it was not good at all. It was chicken, rice, black beans wrapped in a tortilla smothered in red sauce cheese and sour cream. Believe it or not, it was gross. I also had a Cadillac Margarita, all sour mix. We didn't receive happy hour prices b/c we were not sat in the bar area, which is fine. Our waitress was awesome. The service is prompt and friendly.p.s. Where I come from you get complimentary tortillas with your meal, they charged us $1 for each tort and didn't let us know they charged for them."
