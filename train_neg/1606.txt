b"Perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high for Vegas hotel eateries, or perhaps this place just sucks. A friend and I were visiting Vegas and staying at the Circus Circus hotel when our dinner plans suddenly cancelled. Hungry and tired of searching, we settled on just eating at the hotel. First, there was live music, which is to be expected at a Motley Crue restaurant. What was not to be expected was a man in leather chaps and a cowboy hat belting out country music. I'm sure many patrons would love this setup, however, my friend and I despise country music, so this was equivalent to sitting right at the gates of hell. Seeing as it was pretty late, we anticipated we wouldn't be there long so we stuck it out. I got the Mac and cheese, which took waaaaay too long to come out. We waited a while for the server to even come to the table so we were able to order immediately when he first arrived, then waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. The bacon in the Mac and cheese was way too salty, the plate was hot as if it were just thrown in the microwave, and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out a while. Not appetizing at all. We had a total of three encounters with the server: once to order, when he brought our food, and when we asked for the check. In summary: long waits, terrible atmosphere, sub par service, and disgusting food."
