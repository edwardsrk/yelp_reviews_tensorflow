b"So Captain America: Civil War was sold out, except for the handicap seating. Which there are only 5 of. We bought two, bought our pickles, and sat in the seats we purchased. Right as the movie is about to start and all the seats were filled, a sixth person shows up with the seat number that was next to mine. We didn't bother looking at our tickets, assuming AMC workers would know what they are doing, but my boyfriend's seat number was actually non existent. We proceed to go to the front where they notify us that we purchased a non existent spot. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??? How the hell do you sell a non existent seat?! They sold us the middle section in between the seats!!! And all we got was a refund for the tickets, not even for the pickles."
