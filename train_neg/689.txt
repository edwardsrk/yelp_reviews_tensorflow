b"My husband and I came for a Valentines weekend and were rudely awakened by construction at around 6 AM. When we checked in we were not told about the construction otherwise we would've booked another tower at the same hotel, when I complained all they did was return my resort fee for my inconvenience. Beware if your planning to stay here any time soon"
