b'We love eating at Chipolte, but this location was the worst experience I have ever had at one of their restaurants. They were out of chips (no chips at a Mexican restaurant?!)They were out of lettuce.Black beans were crunchy (must have just come out of the can).Bathrooms were gross.Tables had not been wiped down and cleaned.This was on a Saturday night at 8 pm, so it was inexcusable to not have the basic food items available.'
