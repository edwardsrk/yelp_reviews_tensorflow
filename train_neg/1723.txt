b'We really wanted to like this place!! We love Ground Control in Litchfield and we were so excited that a new pub-style place was opening in Surprise. Unfortunately this didn\'t live up to the hype. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (even though we saw open tables) and then were seated in the noisy bar in a very strange table. We asked to be moved and you\'d think we asked to move to the moon. They put us near the pizza area, the only people seated there (which was weird). We ordered beer, pretzels and cheese, and a burger to share. The "beer cheese" was really bad. It tasted like it came from a jar...they need to try the Mellow Mushroom beer cheese!! The burger was small and bland, fries were greasy. With two beers and the small burger, it was over $60!! What a waste. We won\'t be back.'
