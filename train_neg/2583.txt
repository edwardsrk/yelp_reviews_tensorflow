b"Meh, not impressed. The portions are small which is fine, it's the pasta that's the problem. Way undercooked pasta, with watered down sauce.....yuck !! And it's a pasta place!!!!!!!!!!!! The chicken piccata and veal marsala were fine, as well was the bean soup & Caesar salad. Ordered the broccoli rabe, it was over cooked to the point of almost mush. The best thing we had was the caesar salad."
