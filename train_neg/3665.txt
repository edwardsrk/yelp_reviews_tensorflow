b'Ordered take out to be delivered to my hotel after a conference I am attending.  The only reason that they get two stars instead of one, is that the salad was fresh and just fine and the garlic bread was okay.  However, the eggplant parmesan was HORRIBLE.  Overcooked, completely soggy, with soggy overcooked spaghetti.  I had ordered it in order to save half to take on the airplane for lunch on my trip home-- and instead, I threw it in the garbage.'
