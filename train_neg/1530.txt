b"The worst hotel experience I've EVER had on the strip. I am a local and was looking for a place to take my nephew, that had a great pool, for a little staycation. First, when we walked into our room all lights were unplugged and we had find our way in the dark. Then we noticed a poorly patched up hole in the wall, all the furniture was dusty and old, the bathroom was very outdated with scratched, peeling cabinets and the sink didn't even drain. Because we were only there for a quick night, we chalked it up to being an old hotel. But then, the next morning, we found bed bugs in our bed. When we called the front desk and it took four phone calls and an hour and half wait time for he security guard to come to our room to make a report. After the report, we had to go down stairs where we were rudely helped by the front desk and then had to wait another hour to speak to the manager.  The manger was nice, but couldn't help us, all he did was give us a card of another manager and told him to contact him in a couple days. We spent the rest of the day in the pool, which was very small and crowded for families as they have cut off 3/4 of their pool (the main reason we chose the Flamingo) to accommodate their go-pool (adults only) which I can understand, it is vegas, but they took away their lounge chairs around the slide pool (where my kids wanted to spend all of their time) so we had to sit on the hot concrete. Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel, I will NEVER stay at the flamingo again or even visit it."
