b'We came here with an open mind since there are many negative reviews about this place and we want to be our own judge.Unfortunately, just like most reviewers here have experienced.  Don\'t waste your money and time here...go to Hot N Juicy.   Everything is better at Hot N Juicy EXCEPT their soft shell crab basket is a little better than HnJ.  Service:  They don\'t seem to know what you are talking about.  We asked about the market price on one of the special crab, the answer was, "I don\'t know what the price is... plus we don\'t have it anymore anyway".  10 minutes later.. saw another table that came after us ordered a bunch of those crab.  Asked for a Sapporo, never came, finally came, but a different kind of beer, and said they don\'t have Sapporo or most of the beer on the menu.  One main dish (cajun clam) came out when we were about to finish the whole meal.  Food: Shrimp are big...but tough texture and seemed very overcooked. Plus their items (shrimp, clams) didn\'t come in a bag like HnJ, so flavors aren\'t mixed and steamed together.  Corn and potatoes are on a separate plate with 0 flavor.  And the corn was cold in the middle like some other reviewers were saying.  Overall, we came in with an open mind and walked away disappointed.  We want this place to be good and do well, but they didn\'t deliver.  Staff was friendly, but not very good at servicing people.  The only good thing about this place is it\'s on restaurant.com, so we were able to save $50 off by using the certificate.  Didn\'t have to pay very much for the unpleasant dinner.  We will definitely NOT returning again and will continue to go back to our favorite still ; Hot N Juicy!'
