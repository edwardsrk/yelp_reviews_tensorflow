b'A crepe place with savoury as well as sweet options. The service was a little brusque. The savoury creeps are not worth the visit. Spinach and egg very overcooked on both fronts. Overdone spinach and solid and meagre egg. When the waiter took the leftovers away and asked about it, we expressed to him our poor opinion about it and he walked off without responding.'
