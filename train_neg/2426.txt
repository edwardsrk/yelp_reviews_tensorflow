b"Not going to lie, it's gotten ratchet. The exam bed wasn't prepared, I'm not sure I even trusted that they wiped it down before we were showed to the room. Outdated looking vital equipment.  There was a sticky spot on the floor that kept bothering me. Just didn't seem to clean. There are discolored water spots on the ceiling right in the waiting room. The doctor completely brushed off my concerns or had any advice or referral for me. Like he was on auto pilot just going through the motions. Ive been taking my son to Pioneer since he was born. He's almost 6 and I think it's time to move on and find better or at least more informative care"
