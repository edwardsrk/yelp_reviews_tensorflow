b'After checking into the Hard Rock, and making our way to the pool area.  We thought, lets grab a bite, so we made our way back into the Pink Taco.We waited to get sat in the outside area connected to the pool,  After about 10 minutes we were sat (there were several tables open out there, and I hate when you have to wait to be seated when there are plenty of open tables.)  We decided on the appetizer platter for the two of us, and it had a couple of things to snack on, to hold us over for dinner.Sweet corn tamales, cheese quesadillas, chicken skewers, carne asada skewers, taquitos and guacamole.  The guacamole was a very small portion.  The cheese quesadillas had NO FLAVOR.  The chicken skewers were over seasoned and dry.  The sweet corn tamales were good, and something I really enjoyed.  The taquitos were ok.  Overall I would say pass on this place after the meal we had.  You get free chips and 3 types of salsa when you get seated, and that was the best part of the meal for both my wife and myself.The service was OK, but I would never expect that much from a chain place like that.Overall, I would have rather ate at Taco Bell.  It is way cheaper, and has better overall food, in my opinion.'
