b"Visited this place for lunch. It was pretty empty and I sat at the bar. The bartenderess was nice enough and attentive except when it came to bringing the check. That came out very slowly. The food was surprisingly plain. It started with thick tortilla chips with hot and mild salsa, neither flavorful. Both were thin versions of salsa, which is fine with me, but some flavor or even heat would be appreciated. For starters, I had the queso fundido, which was pretty good and came with soft corn tortillas to eat it with.  Then I had the steak tacos. These were completely flavorless, and improved to decent with the addition of a few good shakes of bottled hot sauce.The margaritas were actually pretty good, but they were insanely expensive, and I'm not one to complain about cost, especially on vacation."
