b"I would not recommend this place at all I've lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and get massages all The time I called this morning to book an appointment and told the receptionist we were driving in from California she asked for a credit card number to hold the reservation and unfortunately we hit some unexpected traffic I called over an hour to let her know we would not be able to make the appointment at which time she threatened to charge us for the full service and hung up on me stating she was the owner... I was never told about anything being charged on my credit card it was just to hold the appointment she did not offer a rain check or anything with that said I would not recommend this place and I will gladly be calling up my credit card company to dispute the charges!!! Very unprofessional"
