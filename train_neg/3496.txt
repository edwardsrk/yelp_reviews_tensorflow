b"From started the outside of this place looks like it's run down and there's two separate entrances but only one works but the other one doesn't have like any sign or anything Came in on a Sunday around 3pm with my dad and we kind of expected it to be busy and it wasn't. In fact, Us and another table were the only ones there and his place is huge. As we walked in there was a really nice waitress who showed up our seats and was really helpful but The service was VERY SLOW.  even though it was basically empty. the food was good. I got the chilaquiles verdes and my dad got a cocktail 7 mares which he said he wished there was more than just 4 shrimps but it was good. I didn't like is that they aren't consistent on how you pay your check, The other table had the waitress drop off and pick up the check and we were told to go to the front cashier which I don't mind but I just don't understand why would be different."
