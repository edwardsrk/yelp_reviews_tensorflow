b'The 2 ladies working here were very nice. The soup I ordered was very good. I ordered a sandwich to go and was surprised to see it was wrapped in plastic wrap. Sandwiches wrapped in plastic makes rolls rubbery as well as making the sandwich soggy when the sandwich has mayo, mustard, tomatoes etc. anything with liquid (if not eaten right away). I hope they change this to a paper wrap because the ham was good but by the time I got to eat my sandwich it was rubbery and soggy.'
