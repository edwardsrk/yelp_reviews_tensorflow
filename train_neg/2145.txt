b"I stay at Caesar's a lot and never went here before, so I tried it out. Big portions. Hella expensive. Mediocre food. Alright service. Not coming back here again, so many other places to go then here. Plus my waiter was kinda judgmental. Must've thought there was no way someone so young could afford all that I ordered. Was happy to prove him wrong. Two stars for the fake nice treatment"
