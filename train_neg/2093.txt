b'Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they\'re better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as "kind of like Coors Light".  If I wanted Coors, I\'ll pay half as much and have one.  The food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though.'
