b"The Service i will not say rude but is so pushy.  i only come back here when I am really craving Korean BBQ but I don't have choice to go anywhere else for those places have to wait in the line for table. But here you got to seat right away so that's why I gave 2 stars. Food not bad but they allowed you order only 3items per 1time. Inside it looks clean and the rest of it just OK for my experiences."
