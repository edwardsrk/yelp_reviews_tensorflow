b'I started seeing the new family doctor. Dr Grewal. She is amazing and I am happy I found such a great doctor. But the receptionist service are POOR. Every time , i call I, they put me on hold for long time and most of the time they forgot. sometimes I gave up and hung on after 7-8 mins but it is always like that. I am so unhappy of front desk services.'
