b"Its totters between Meh - I've experienced better to A - OK.  During game day for football its pretty fun.  Always a good place to have that last drink before heading to the stadium.  But for pregaming before basketball... well it was kinda dull.I never had food here, and I have no desire to even try the food here.  The brews can be improved upon.  I know its a brew pub, but I recommend getting a well drink or something.  Like I said, good place for that last drink before heading into a game.  Sadly, not for much else."
