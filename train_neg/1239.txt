b'I think it i so overrated and I love Bobby Flays in Atlantic city.   Both the chicken and the pork tenderloin were dry.  Ashame, because staff was great.  I never expected to have a thigh with my chicken for the price.   Never ate the thigh but breast was dry as well.  They tried to make right for my partner and did not charge her. I though maybe it was just her because I can eat anything so I tried her pork tenderloin it was so dry I could not eat it.  Too many great food places for us to ever go back there.  Hope they listen and get a chef who knows how to do southwestern food and make it moist.'
