b'After waiting almost a decade to share my favorite pizza with my parents I now know I should have kept waiting.   I expected a bit of a line but I was rushed through checking and They were onto the next customer before my family could ask about pre ordering.  Luckily a while later we heard some one else pre ordering so we did it too being told to pre order our deep dishes only.   45 minutes after ordering we were seated , just a few minutes late.   We ordered appetizers since they quoted an hour and a half for deep dishes.  And ordered a child\'s pizza and my father who loves pizza ordered his favorite pizza pepperoni asking the waiter which pizza he could order to be out no later than our deep dishes. He got a thin crust. Our deep dishes didn\'t come out until we had been seated for over an hour, it took almost another hour for the KIDS menu pizza and the thin crust. We were there over 3 hours.  OH and to top it off when the final pizza arrived it had no pepperoni on it.  Instead covered in olives which he hates.   I regret going there and feel embarrassed at telling them years how much I love this place. The servers were scrambling the whole place was behind while a non stop of carry outs and delivery were being paraded out the door.  Save yourself the trouble of relying on their service. Just get a delivery if you must eat their food or better yet get a frozen one mailed from Chicago as this place doesn\'t deserve your money until they can meet the expectations they set. "We swear 10 more minutes max and it\'s out" waited another 20. This place doesn\'t deserve to wear the name.'
