b'Located inside the Dundas Square AMC building 3rd floor food court.  There were escalators going up the stairs, but we couldn\'t find the down escalator so we took the elevator down.The food is cheap, but so is the taste.  I got a Combo #1 (one meat + one vegetable) for $7.  The quantity is generous.  I got steamed rice with the pepper pot steak.  The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn\'t bad, but it wasn\'t good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled "Carribean" on their receipt on purpose when it\'s supposed to be 2 b\'s instead of 2 r\'s.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.  They had jerk chicken and assorted other meat dishes.  I also tried the fried plantain, which was sweet but could be softer.  The food court wasn\'t too busy and there were plenty of seating.'
