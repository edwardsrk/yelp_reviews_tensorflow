b"For some reason, I liked the place better before the overhaul. It used to have a home-y feel and the previous waitress was a lot friendlier and more attentive. Ever since the change, they have been messing up my take-out orders and I just don't enjoy the experience as much anymore. It's convenient for lunch because it is close to my work but it is also extremely over-priced. $11+tax for a portion of perogies (and they forgot the sour cream) is not reasonable in my opinion. Probably won't be returning for a while, if ever."
