b'Really disliked this place.1. Nobody greeted us as we came in 2. When we were standing in line there were 2 ladies at the front desk, we stood in front of the one that was clearly doing nothing but sitting and starring at a computer and when we approached her she looked up at us and said nothing and went back on the computer. Not even a " somebody will be right with you" 3. Out of a few staff 2 people (the lady who cashed us in and the gentlemen that told us the rules) were nice 4. We were probably the only people in here and staff kept following us around didn\'t let us jump in peace.                 ****NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN DRIVE A LITTLE LONGER AND HEAD TO GRAVADY! *******'
