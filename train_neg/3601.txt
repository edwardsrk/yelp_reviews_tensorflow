b'Went here for the first time because they had an awesome Groupon special. I won\'t be returning. The guy that actually did the oil change was nice and got my car in right away but the man in the office didn\'t greet me when I walked in, his first words were "groupon code please" (I had made an appt so they knew I had groupon). And then had me sign a receipt and it\'d be about 10 minutes. He then walks to the back. We wait in the small but clean area, he then walks back in and says "everything looks good so $4.00". Didn\'t explain what the $4 was for but the receipt said oil filter- that\'s fine... But it wouldn\'t hurt to say more than two words to a customer. Oil change took longer than most places, and the lack of customer service is why I won\'t be returning.'
