b'This has to do with the delivery trucks they contract Central Valley Auto Transports Drivers Suck!!! One almost hit a school bus on the highway this morning and cut me off in the process with my daughter in the car.  I know for a fact he saw us because he had his turn signal but we had cars all around us and he just cut us off anyways. I honked at him and he flipped us off.  He was dropping cars off for Enterprise Car Sales in Henderson NV.  We have pictures of license plates and video.  Hope Enterprise would address this matter with them.'
