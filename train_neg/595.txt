b"We were staying at the Aria hotel (6/6/13). When making the reservation for the Showtime Tours shuttle, they suggested a pickup of 9:25pm since our flight was at 11pm. I agreed. We went to the lobby to wait for our shuttle at 9pmAt 9:40 I called because our shuttle was late picking us up to take us to the airport. They said the shuttle was there on time but didn't see anyone so they left (A huge lie)Thankfully (after many phone calls), they sent someone within 10 min (His name is Brandon and he was super friendly )Next time, I'll do research on more reliable transportation"
