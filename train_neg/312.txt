b'From the hassle of having my receipt checked for bagged items to not knowing the products you sell was one thing but being carded for a video game at 30 is down right stupid. Then the clerk said "well you can never know these days" are you kidding me, you can\'t tell the difference between a 16 year old and a 30 year old? To make matters worse, we had our child there. What are you telling me, I had my kid at 9 years old?'
