b'Mediocre and uninspired dishes made only worse by the size of the portions and high price tag, should rank Woods as your top 10 to skip while in Toronto. My first Yellowfin Tuna was served so well-done that it no longer resembled fish; how this even left the kitchen is beyond me, as they seemed to think I was crazy for not liking it this way. The second attempt, while cooked properly, had zero flavour and the sides (poignantly touted on the menu) were no where to be found. I paid $30 for two meagre slices of tuna that could have been a sashimi appetizer at your local sushi joint. My girlfriend got served cod despite ordering duck, and aside from the over cooked duck breast she eventually received, her plate was bare aside from a few butter drenched croutons. Highly disappointing and ridiculously overpriced for pub fare.'
