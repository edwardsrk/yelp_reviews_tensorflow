b"Went there for lunch on a Wednesday, were seated and served very quickly. Ordered the lobster roll which was good, and then had the bacon bleu burger and the stuffed chicken burger and the baltimore fries (gravy and cheese on them). The burgers were ok (I've made much better at home), but the taste did not match the presentation: the chutney on my bleu burger soaked through the bottom bun making it a soggy mess and they drizzled this weird honey concoction on the chicken burger which just dripped everywhere making a giant sticky mess. If you have to go wash your face half way through the meal, there's something wrong with the ingredients. There are definitely better places to go for a burger, like the Red Rock, especially for the price."
