b'The hotel walls were so paper thin I could hear someone farting next door! ! They were screaming and yelling and we could hear every part of it! ! Since the flamingo installed the fake wooden floors, we could hear every single click of their heels as the group of girls came and left, it was terrible!!! My husband was trying to study for an exam he had the next morning, and I was under the weather, and neither of us slept well at all. You could literally hear every person walking and talking in the halls, aside from hearing our neighbors all night.  THE BATHROOM WAS OLD AND DISGUSTING!! The shower fixtures were corroded!! There were cracks in the tile where the wall and the ground met!! I was worried about possible roaches coming in!  It was a dump! I felt like I was in a cheap motel, not a Las Vegas Strip hotel and casino! The blankets on the bed were SO THIN, I don\'t even think there was a duvet or coverlet!  It was a thin pad of some sort between two sheets! The top layer was a sheet!!!!HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING EXPERIENCE, WE WIll NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN!! I feel extra terrible because we booked a room for my inlaws and their experience was exactly the same!  All four of us said "NEVER AGAIN"!!The check in kiosks were nice, until I realized it probably puts you in the dirtiest rooms so the hotel benefits, never the customer.  I advise anyone going here to check in with the front desk, and demand an updated and CLEAN ROOM with privacy and dignity!!'
