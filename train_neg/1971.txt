b"We chose this hotel because it was close to where my brother was getting married. We stayed for 2 nights. The curtain would not close completely so there was a strip of sunlight that woke us up each morning. And housekeeping missed our room. No clean towels, beds were not made, trash was not emptied. They simply didn't do it. Disappointing because when we came back to the room later that night after the wedding with friends and relatives, we were surprised to see it had not been touched. Embarrassing.  The next day when we checked out we told the front desk and they barely squeaked out an apology. It's as if they didn't care. So, I guess we stay elsewhere next time. The only reason I gave it one star is because it had a nice deli, and ice cream place."
