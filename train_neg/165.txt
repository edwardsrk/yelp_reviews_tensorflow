b'If there is negative rating, I will choose for this place. We came to this place with group of 5. After we finished disappointed dinner, we asked the waiter for the bill, they add 15% tips on top of it WITHOUT notify us, then we tiped them again, before we left the restaurant, one of our friend figured out the number was not right, so we asked the waiter for the receipt, he told us "Sorry, we don\'t have your receipt anymore after you guys paid", then we asked if the bill add tips already? The waiter did not willing to response and just told us" I don\'t know" then walked away. What a shame.All in all, very bad experience, their cheap price come with the consequences. Cheap quality of the broth and food, especially their "famous" lamb slices, bad services, unethical business conduct.Will NOT come back agian.'
