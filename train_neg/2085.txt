b"This is the second time I've been here with my mom. We ordered the cold noodles, kimchi soup. The cold Noodles were still raw, you could even bite through them. The kimchi soup is suppose to have pork in it, and it had no meat. But it was still okay. The service was another thing that got me. The waitress, she wasn't friendly at all. She came up to our table after we were sitting here for 10 minutes, she didn't even say a word to us, just looked at my mom and myself as if we were just ready to order. Do they normally not greet people here ? Even if there was a language barrier, my mom speaks fluent Korean. She could at least tried to greet us. My water wasn't even refilled. I've been a server at numerous places , this isn't how businesses are handled. It was $40 dollars for lunch speical for 2 people and it didn't even taste good. Ugh!2 stars because we still ate the food,but taking home a lot of it. I don't think I want to come back here though."
