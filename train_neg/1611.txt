b"I have to be honest here... I went inside this place last week and it just seems like a disaster. I walked in around 6 PM or so and was looking to buy a vape pen.  The place seems like it had a ton of selection but the place is tiny. With two people in the store, I had a hard time negotiating around the store. I wanted to pick up a vape pen but didn't know where to start. No one said hi to me when I walked in.  I could see that the woman behind the counter didn't really seem like she knew what she was doing. She was on the phone with a guy on speaker phone and it seemed like he was guiding her around the store to show her where stuff was while a customer was waiting for her to find it.  I was behind someone else and really didn't feel like I was going to get any level of knowledge  out of this place so I just took off. I went online, researched and bought  a pen online that had good reviews.  I went to this place cause the amazing reviews on yelp and google but seems like the place where you need to know what you're buying, and just pick it up.."
