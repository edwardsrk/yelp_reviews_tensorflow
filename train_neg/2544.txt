b"For what you pay, the value isn't there: better to eat elsewhere.  The service is spotty (may forget about you for a while), the menus are a bit tattered, the place could be cleaner, and the food is not remotely on par with the price, although not bad.  I don't really recommend the seafood chow menu, but the tea seems decent (at lest not flat or bad).  Main perk is that it's open 24/7 and that the service is not terrible. Also, they're unable to split the bill between a hotel bill credit for food and any amount you might want to charge to credit (rather than room)."
