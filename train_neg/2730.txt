b'So I stayed here because the event I was attending was here and they offered a great price for Memorial Day weekend.  That is where the good stuff ended.  We waited close to an hour to check in...at 1am!  Then to help us feel better about that we got an "upgraded" room.  Got to the room and there was a dressed up Murphy bed that folded into the wall.  To be fair it was comfortable...however if that was an upgrade, I really do not want to see the regular rooms.  Next the Internet was $14 per 24hrs.  When we went to use the safe it wasn\'t working.  To their credit they did say it would take 30 min for someone to come look and it only took 10 and he fixed it within five minutes.  Just felt like if the room price wasn\'t so great on a holiday weekend I would have been extremely upset.  Know you are not getting super customer service...just getting basic stuff without the class even if they try to say it is classy.'
