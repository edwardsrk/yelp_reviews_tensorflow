b"3 years ago i gave Zinburger a great review. Today we stopped in after not visiting for quite awhile. I immediately noticed the burgers appeared smaller. We both ordered burgers medium done.  My husband's Asian burger was medium well. Mine was well done,  meat grown all v the way through and crispy outside.  I ate too the middle hoping i would find a nice pink  center.  I had no such luck.  I hate well done beef. I let the server know of our over cooked meals.  She advised the cooks and removed an appetizer less than half the cost of the over cooked burger.  A customer at another table presented her well done burger also that was supposed to be medium. The server said there had been no changes in management or cook staff.  Our server was pleasant,  but appeared rushed.  The burger was Absolutely NOT a $16 burger.  If you want appetizers and beer during Happy Hour,  Enjoy yourself. If you're looking for a delicious,  juicy burger,  try In N Out."
