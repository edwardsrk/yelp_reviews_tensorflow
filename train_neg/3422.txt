b'Meh, Oriental Express doesn\'t do it for me. Their vegetarian selection on the Chinese food menu is extremely limited and of that, they only have one dish with tofu.I gave it another go recently for lunch, ordering up the 2 time mushroom with fried tofu. The tofu isn\'t breaded or particularly interesting, just cooked and then slathered in some dark sauce with mushrooms and a few other veggies. It\'s an okay dish and will work in a pinch of you like mushrooms.The vegetable eggroll was just disappointing. Soggy exterior and not so great.I will probably go back, just to try out there veggie "sushi" rolls, but I\'ll be going elsewhere for regular ol chino-american food.'
