b"Creepy little bar.  Dim lighting. Old.  Creepier bathroom.  My group of 6 walked in because of the good reviews on yelp.  The waitress ignored us.  We were the only ones in the place.  Finally we asked if they served lunch and she seemed really annoyed that she had to give us menus.  She warmed up to us after she brought the menus though.  It was super awkward.  She made all the food herself.  The food was good, however I won't be back.  Not my cup of tea."
