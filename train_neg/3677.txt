b'Hmmm... I\'m conflicted and a bit perplexed by this one.  First, let me admit that I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place and accidentally let it expire on Sept 3rd.  Knowing this, I called the restaurant and spoke with Jerry the manager.  After I told him the deal expired, he told me, "Don\'t worry about it, we will still take it." He was extremely pleasant on the phone and I presumed that he meant that the full deal would still be honored. On the same day that I called and spoke with Jerry the manager, I went over to Garcia\'s.  After sitting down at my table, the server told me that she can only accept the "paid value" for the deal (which is the amount that I already paid) and that it will be deducted from my bill.  I explained that this was not my understanding after talking to Jerry the manager, but she said that she, "just talked to Jerry about it."  While I did not ask for Jerry (because sometimes I just don\'t feel like fighting), I am very displeased at the miscommunication that took place here.  I am deducting four stars for this whole debacle.  With all of that said, the pollo fundido was very good (even though my spellcheck keeps changing it to "pool funded")... and the house margarita helped to turn my frown upside down... but the crowning moment of this visit was the fried ice cream.  Took me back to my childhood and all was good again.  For Garcia\'s Mexican Restaurant, this means I added a star back.I\'d go back because of the food and fried ice cream, but not the service.'
