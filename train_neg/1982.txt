b"This review is against the sales and finance department.  Never have I felt so taken advantage of in my life!  We have purchased new vehicles from Nissan in the past and had great experiences - this dealership obviously doesn't hold itself to a high standard.  Lets start with the sales process - we informed them we didn't want to be in there for hours and would appreciate them respecting our time - 3.5 hours later with the ridiculous back and forth we agreed on a price - mostly out of exhaustion.They made so many mistakes with our service plan and extended warranty that it took over 9 phone calls and an hour and a half in their showroom trying to get our issues resolved - at the end of it all we were offered an oil change and  a tire rotation - big deal!We will never buy Nissan from this dealership again"
