b"I wanted so much to love this place as my new local bar. Beer prices are decent and good tvs and atmosphere. The food is disgusting and so overpriced. Like they're trying to be trendy and hip. And the staff is bad too. Small girl bartender may want to smile once in a while. Its a shame...nice place, close, but trying to be something its not when it would be great if it had good basic food."
