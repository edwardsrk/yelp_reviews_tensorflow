b'I came in here with my grandmother, and my mother the other day for three pedicures and one manicure. We were there two and half hours and there was only one other customer at the time. Three different women rotated doing my pedicure(which chipped the same day). The "manicure" that we paid for consisted only of the manicurist applying over 10 coats of gel polish that pooled at the end of my moms nails, only to peel off the next day. When doing the callus scrub on all three of us they used a CHEESE GRATER and scrubbed my grandmothers feet raw. She could barely touch her skin without being in pain. Overpriced and overall awful experience. Will not be going back.'
