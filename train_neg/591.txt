b"I have had this membership for a year. I thought it would be cheaper then LVAC, but after about a year adding everything up using the cheapest one it actually ends up more expensive. They have a hidden yearly maintenance fee they don't tell you about. Another thing they do is if you miss a payment by a day they charge you around $35. This gym is always packed in the mornings. The parking lot is not that big and so people have to park on the street. The equipment is actually decent for the size."
