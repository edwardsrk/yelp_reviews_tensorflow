b"I'm from New Jersey, and was a police officer. I have met my share of rude people. Having  said that I have to say that this man is the rudest  and  the most condescending a** hole I have ever met. I was dumbfounded at the extent of his rudeness and his insults.  To top it off his store is a rat hole filled with 99% crap and junk. Do yourself a favor, do not even go in there.  AGAIN.......do not go in there. And most certainly do not buy anything from this J**K A**.   Such a shame that I had to actually post a star to get my comment posted. Yelp should change this because if anyone deserves no stars, it's this j**k a**!!!!"
