b"The worst service I have ever experience I've had and I've been coming to Serrano for years. First they forgot the lemon then they got my and my grandmas order wrong the whole time the server was rude from the beginning. They couldn't understand I asked for chicken as a substitute or nothing and gave me ground beef then remade it into something completely different. Server and manager are rude and incompetent. We were here for so long for them to remake food and still expected us to pay full price. Never again"
