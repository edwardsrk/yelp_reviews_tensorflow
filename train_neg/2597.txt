b'We were underwhelmed. My boyfriend had eggs benedict and everything was overcooked or lacked any real flavor. Came with a thin side of burnt to a crisp barely edible hash browns. I dont know how you could make that meal bland but they did it. I had their buscuit special with eggs. The eggs were dry and taste like they were going bad. The biscuits were served cold and again, everything was bland. Its not the worst resturant, but I wont consider coming back. There are much better places out there.'
