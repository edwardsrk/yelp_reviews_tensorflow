b'We stopped in for something light and a few cocktails. Our waiter, Saul, explained his favorites on the menu and gave us time to look over the menu since we\'ve never been there before. We ordered drinks, then he proceeded to talk me out of my drink order. I gave-in to try something different and waited 20 min. Drinks came and this Ginger drink was horrible. I returned it to get my original order and waited another 20 min! We were also talked out of our food order!!! He told us if we don\'t like it, he gets to eat! It\'s a win-win situation. We said "we\'ll try the Quesadilla", he said "the Nachos?"If you like being up-sold by a car salesman and slow service then this is your place! As more people came in, the slower the service became. We had to call the water boy over to get service and the check. We became irritated with the Sauls scheme. Our $90 ticket for 4 drinks and Nachos could\'ve gone a lot further for better service and authentic food elsewhere.'
