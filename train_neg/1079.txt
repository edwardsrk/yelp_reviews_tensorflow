b"Every once in a while I love to remind myself as to why I don't order delivery from chain pizza places like Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised and tonight I was not. Over an hour and a half delivery time and I received a soggy medium pan pizza. But what had me most concerned is that my pizza was pulled out of the oven and checked at 6:35ish and was sitting there for over 45 min before it left the store. After delivery fees and tips for $16 I recommend eating a frozen pizza because at least you can pull it out when it's actually done baking. Me, didn't have access to an oven. Otherwise I know what I would've done. Baked a pizza."
