b'If the food was as good as our waitress, it would have been fantastic.  Unfortunately, I ordered wings and when I bit into one, it was bloody and raw.  Tried two more...same thing.  Our waitress was very apologetic and got another order for me...but by that time I really was not hungry.  Service was fantastic...food, not so much.'
