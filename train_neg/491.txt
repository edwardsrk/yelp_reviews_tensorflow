b'I was visiting a friend at Sunrise Hospital on June 2nd.  My friend was admitted on the 3rd floor by the elevators the hospital refers to as "schoolbus" by Subway.  There were students with grey scrubs on that said Everest Nursing.  All the students I saw seems professional and eager to learn except one.  I overheard someone call her Cheyenne.  I had asked her a question and she was completely rude. She acted like she didnt know and wouldnt even point me in the right direction or find someone to help me. She basically said that my friends room was not her side.  I cannot believe you have such rude students at represent your school and are able to take care of sick people with an attitude like that.  I feel bad for any patient in the future who has to be taken care of by her! Please save the public by better screening your students.'
