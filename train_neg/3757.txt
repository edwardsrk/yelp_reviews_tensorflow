b"Panchero's is a low quality version of Chipotle, but with similar prices. The burritos are also smaller than Chipotle's. The employees are friendly, but I don't like their food. The meat is often overcooked, the rice is mushy, the beans are dry. The guacamole is bland and not worth the extra cost. The queso is slimy and generic. Overall, there is nothing worthwhile about the food. The only time I eat it is when it is getting late and I need to grab something quick, because there is a Panchero's right near my house and they are open until 11pm. It is only ever a choice I make out of convenience."
