b"Worst Sprint store in town. Their staff are theives and the managers cover up for them. I'm currently disputing  fraudulent charges from this store. No one wants to take responsibility and I'm out 500$ Horrible customer service and untrained staff. I proved one of their sales people stole from me and threw manager did nothing!I'm also reporting this store to the BBB.DO NOT GO HERE!"
