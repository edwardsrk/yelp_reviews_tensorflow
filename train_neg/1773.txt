b"I think this is my first time I'm actually giving a 1 star in my review and they don't even deserve it. This place is filthy! The girl behind the register, ohhh to tell you I was afraid to drink my smoothie for the fact that I have to watch her make a drink, not wash her hands, and her HAIR is all over the place! Her hair is not even in a bun or a hair net at least and did I mention her hair is thick!!! It took them 5 minutes to say hi or acknowledge the fact that we are staring at them waiting. I WILL NOT COME HERE AGAIN!!!"
