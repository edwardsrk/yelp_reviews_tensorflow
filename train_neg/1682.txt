b"Customer service is horrible. Came in to buy a fronto leaf. Get home to find that it's stale and growing mold inside. Drive all the way back to EXCHANGE it for another. The clerk returns my $ but would not allow me to buy another one. Not sure what his deal was. I was 100% polite and professional. Completely unnecessary for him to treat me like that."
