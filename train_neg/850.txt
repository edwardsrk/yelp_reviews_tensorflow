b"I feel bad giving this hotel a low score, but our experience  was terrible and we wasted lots of money just to feel like we were staying in the cheapest room possible.We reserved a GO view room and lost our reservation despite the fact that I called the day before to confirm and I called again while we were en route, explaining that we will be arriving at 1am. He said he made a note that I called and he documented our new ETA. Here's what we ended up with on arrival:A king size, not the 2 queens that was requested No viewFurniture with lots of tears in the leatherHoles and stains in the beddingHard bed and either hard pillows or really worn out pillows that need to be thrown away.Water damage to the ceilings A rollaway, which the attendant said she had requested since we had 2 kids with us (the rollaway took 2 hours to arrive)The rollaway was sunk in the middle. My poor kids looked like they were folding in half.The attendant told us the rooms were not guaranteed and said we could switch rooms the next day, but we were so busy that it would have been an inconvenience. She also said our room was originally on hold but the manager had to give it away (and give us a downgraded room instead). We paid over $500 for the original room we requested for the 2 nights and the only way they could comp us was to take off the $30 resort fee and provide us with that sorry rollaway. Housekeeping even opened our door after the first night even though the do not disturb sign was up. They thought we we due to check out!Unfortunately we did not have a good experience and ended up checking out at 6am bc we were highly disappointed. We were in room 23008 which was not worth the money at all! I really wanted to like this hotel too so I'll end on some good notes...Pros:Nice decorFree parkingGreat location, walking distance to miracle mile24hour food court on site"
