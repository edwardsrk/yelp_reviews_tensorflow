b"I have been going to this dealership for over two years, the experience is always good, but the wait time is awful.  I called last week to make an appointment because I received a recall notice in the mail.  My service advisor was busy so someone else set up the appointment.  I told her I was coming because of the recall and would get a oil change while I was there. I changed my work schedule to make this appointment.  It was at 7 am so I could get right in.  Guess what, they did not have the parts for the recall, so it could not be done. I was told we will send out another notice when the parts come in.  My service advisor said well you are getting an oil change anyway.  I felt as if my time is not important because I didn't spend any money this time.Please do not respond with , I will look into this."
