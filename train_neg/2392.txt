b'Most disappointing meal of my week-long trip to Vegas!  Wish I hadn\'t gone.  Actual food quality was 4 stars, but minus 2 stars for being CRAZY over-priced for the quality ($85-$90 per person without alcohol).  I felt pretty ripped off spending such money for food that is barely better than mall pan-asian food.  Their snow crab legs tasted less than fresh (slightly fishy taste and lacking the sweetness of truly fresh shellfish) and it also had an odd sauce that reminded me of some amateur combo of ketchup-and-mayo-and-sriraca.  The Laksa Noodle "soup" had, instead of broth, a strange paste-like liquid base that was gloopy and unpleasant.  Their version of wasabi friend shrimp was no better than my local restaurant that sells it for half their price.  Admittedly, those were the low-points -- much of the food was decent enough -- but I felt ripped off after paying over $400 bucks for my family of five.'
