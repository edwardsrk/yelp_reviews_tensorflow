b"Great place for a laid back drinks night. It's relatively cheap for the area and 3njpyable if you want to watch the game or chat the night away! The good- drinks specials- central location to financjal district- dead so you'll get a seatThe bad-washrooms are not the nicest- crowd is so so- Food looked only ok- drinks cheap but wine but pricy-overall place uppity for what it wasWon't be back 100$ for a few drinks? No thanks!"
