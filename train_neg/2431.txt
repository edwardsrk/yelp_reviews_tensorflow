b"Wanted to try out a new nail place, and wish I wouldn't have. The only reason for 2 stars is because of the polish colors, so many to chose from. I got a gel manicure. If you can even conifer me having a manicure. I wasn't asked if I wanted my nails cut or filed, wasn't asked what shape. I got a quick file down. I came home and filed where they were I ever and where the polish was on the sides of my nails. Again, the only male in there who dis my nails.I will not be back."
