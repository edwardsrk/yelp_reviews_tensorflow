b"Been here twice, and haven't gotten to eat anything.First time was on an already hot summer day, for brunch, and where we were seated had hot air blowing on us (likely from the open kitchen). Add to that, the lackluster menu, we decided to leave.Tried again yesterday for lunch, and after waiting at our table for 10-15 minutes, we were never approached by a server (although they were at the table next to us at one point). There were only 2 other tables, so they weren't busy. Obliviously we left. Ironically, as we left, the guy behind a counter thanked us for our business.Only restaurant I have ever walked out of. And TWICE!Disappointed, because I love most of the restaurants in my neighbourhood (Ronces), and had heard great things about this place."
