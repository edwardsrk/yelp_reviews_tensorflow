b'Le Gourmand is okaaaay.  The coffee is pretty good, and yes - those chocolate chip cookies are delicious and a meal in itself.But, the service totally sucks.  I went in for a coffee and a sandwich as my office is right around the corner.  First I ordered the avocado and tomato sandwich, which they rang up for me but didn\'t have.  No biggie.THEN,I asked for the vegetarian sandwich (as I am a vegetarian).  They toast it up or whatever, I bite into it - and there is MEAT IN MY VEGETARIAN SANDWICH!  Ahhhhhhhh! (no offense to the meat eaters, but that is...ugh - not okay!!!).I take it back to them saying "hello, there is meat in my VEGETARIAN sandwich and I am a VEGETARIAN!!!"  I got a very minimal, blase response from the girl at the counter.  She didn\'t seem to care much, gave me an obligatory apology, and poked around to find an actual vegetarian sandwich.  Poor customer service. What if I had a food allergy? What if that was a religious problem for me?  They just don\'t care.Aside from that, this place is just a little too faux for me.  It\'s a cute decor, but they try way too hard.  I\'d hit the Dark Horse up the street instead.  Much cooler.'
