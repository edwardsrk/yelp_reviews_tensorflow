b'Will not be back. Poor service by the hostess & waitress. Very limited menu. The deviled eggs were much better at the nearby Carson Kitchen. The only silver lining with this place is that the bus boy filled up my drink when it was low. Maybe if he was promoted to waiter the service would be better.'
