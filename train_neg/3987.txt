b"I've been to this business several times, food and service was always good. Tonight was no exception. I ordered the lobster mac which had a really good taste. But as i was wrapping up i mentioned to the bartender that it didn't really seem to have the lobster there, only in one bite. I was sort of given a cold shoulder about this. Which was weird, i didn't ask for a manager or a comp. Just let him know what i thought which is why i gave them 2 stars. Always address a concern no matter how big or small. I also noticed the gentleman next to me consumed less than half of his large plate and declined to take a bag with him but didn't voice any concern so i did when i thought it was questionable. However the glass of wine and cocktail was Great. I'll definitely go back."
