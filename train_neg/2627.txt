b"Beckett's achieved a neighborhood feel-good joint  that was rustic and casual; however, the high-end service did not meet the expectations of the food.I found the food lacking in flavor and pizazz.  Comfort food seems to be a fad now-days but for someone watching what they eat, this joint is not for you!They had some great choices for wine but all three of the entrees we ordered were dull and flavorless.  We ordered the zucchini appetizer which was nothing exciting.  We also ordered a fish entree and short rib entree which lacked major flavor and disappointing to the palate.  We  will only return for the wine in the future."
