b"Visited there on 9/29/07.  Had a 50% off coupon.  The clerk handled this purchase ok.  Then when I went back in the same time frame, I ordered two milk shakes for my wife and I.  The clerk charged me once for the milkshakes at 1/2 price and then turned around a charged me full price for each shake.  When we got the shakes, they were not even mixed up.  To hell with this place, I will never go there again.  Seem likes they don't give a dam about there customers-The only reason for them being there."
