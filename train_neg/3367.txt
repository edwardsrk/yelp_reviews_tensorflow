b"Worst service in history at a hotel, the front desk fell asleep after I called at 4 am for a cab she had just woke up. After falling the front desk the operator the ballet and the bell desk nobody answered my call nor called us back. The casino is decent besides the waitresses. They won't come up to you unless you're the chosen one or you annoy the hell out of them. The hotel itself smells a little funky. Honestly this was the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. I've been to countless hotels and never received service like this."
