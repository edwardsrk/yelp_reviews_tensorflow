b"So first off, there is no parking in the parking lot.  So you have to pay on the street.  But that's fine...if it is worth it.  I went in around 1045am on a week day, not busy at all. I wanted a smoked meat sandwich and was rudely told they don't make that until 11am, I had to order breakfast.  So, reluctantly, I ordered a bagel, cream cheese and lox.  I explained it was for a child so to make it plain.  After paying over 8 dollars, and the cashier who couldn't seem to find change for a 10, ok...just call it a tip...so between parking and the bagel, I'm now up to 11 dollars...for a bagel.  Get home, open it, and it is covered in capers and red onions.  Not sure how this is child-friendly.  I am a BIG deli fan (from Montreal and Ottawa originally), so I KNOW good deli.  This isn't it."
