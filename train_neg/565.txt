b'The first two words in their Yelp description is "fresh food", but my order was anything but. My order is simple - a strawberry banana French toast delivery. Cut up, juicy fruits on top of a lightly fried bread - simple right?What blows my mind is how they used canned??? strawberries. I\'m not from Vegas, but I\'m hoping fresh fruit isn\'t that hard to find where restaurants forgo it. They have a preservative taste that once biting into, makes you think that these strawberry slices have been sitting in a plastic container somewhere for a couple of weeks. Then... the BANANAS. The bananas are blackish and gummy. Blackish and GUMMY!!! Who uses those words to describe bananas??? These bananas literally look like they mummified before being delivered to me....And the piece de l\'resistance is the French toast. Oh boy. You know the texture of stale bread is like? It rips a certain way, it\'s fluffy, flavorless, and dry all at the same time? That\'s this French toast. Unfortunately, this entire order reminded me of those questionably "healthy" cafeteria breakfasts from high school, slapped together by pissy lunch ladies, but worse. A lot worse.'
