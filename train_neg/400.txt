b'Great concept,  just not executed properly.I had seen this idea online and thought that it would be a great double date idea. Unfortunately it turned out to be a terrible idea.Pros:- great idea of "snookerball"Cons:- value. For the price that you are paying,  my group of 4 were barely able to finish 1 game. 5 minutes before the end of the game we were given our warning. -Service. A majority of the waiters and waitresses were just standing around. Hovering around the bar eating and doing nothing.  It was difficult to get our waitress to even help us out or place an order for food. -I have never felt so in the way. At our 5 minute warning essentially the hostess lingered around our lane and waited for us to break and told us we had to leave. We still had 5 minutes left, but that didn\'t matter. We still had food and drinks, but were told to hurry up and leave. -Food. Terrible. You definitely do not get what you pay for.  We ordered the nachos with beef. Order anything else off the menu. Save yourself the disappointment!'
