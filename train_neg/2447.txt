b"this place just looks super cute. has that old town feel but not really worth going to unless you are grabbing some desert to go.came here for lunch a few months ago..not impressed with the food. with so many places to go around old town, i would say skip the food. nothing special.the service is also very ehhhit's more of a to-go dessert place if you are craving a sundae!  they have a decent selection of ice cream but it's very rich and a pint of ben and jerrys or haagen daaz will probably satisfy your craving (for cheaper too)"
