b"I was not impressed.  I have to wonder how their food was deemed to be one of the best burgers in Toronto.  The bun was fresh but way too much bread for a burger. I didn't find the list of toppings to stray too far from any other burger place.  I had the hand made onion rings.  Awful with way too much batter on the onions.  In a few rings the batter was three times the thickness of the onion.  The chocolate milkshake was decent but not epic like Mr. Greenjeans (a la Eaton's Center).  I left feeling very under whelmed especially given the price which is similar to Five Guys."
