b'I felt like I was in a used car dealership getting the hard sell.I recently broke a tooth. I have no insurance and I\'m only employed part time at the moment, so money is tight. I know exactly what I need is to get the tooth pulled, plain and simple.I should have known something was up when I made the appointment here and couldn\'t get a straight answer regarding a price for a simple tooth extraction.I went in and used their $39 exam/x-ray/cleaning special, got the xrays done fine then the dentist saw me. He immediately started pressing for me to get a crown that would involve a root canal, tooth shaping and the crown. I told him several times if I had the money I would get a permanent implant, but I can\'t afford it so how much to just pull it?Well, then in walks the finance manager (sounds just like a car dealership) She details all the options from crowns to partials. Thousands of dollars she\'s quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.OK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don\'t have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their "discount" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I\'m looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!Well, needless to say I said no.Even though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither. I should have demanded it, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there.Beware, these guys are only out to bleed you dry.'
