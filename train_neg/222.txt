b"One of THE worst pizzas I've ever had. The cooks are really cheap when it comes to cheese (the pizza was almost all tomato sauce) because the cheese was missing. Absolutely no taste. I don't usually bad reviews unless earned and these ppl working here certainly earned a bad review. Maybe the owner is a cheap person and is forcing cooks to be cheap with toppings."
