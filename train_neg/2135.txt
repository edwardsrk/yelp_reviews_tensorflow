b'You know, for the price, this isn\'t a dump.  If you\'re looking for something cheap and acceptable, this is it.  However, what I really didn\'t like was the deception.  That\'s why I\'m dinging them down to two stars.I booked this through expedia, and the Website clearly stated that there were no resort fees, just $45 total for two weeknights.  Okay, no resort fees.  So on check-in, I asked what the final rate would be."We can\'t tell you, because you booked this through expedia," she said.  "They don\'t give us any numbers."Okay, all right.Then upon checkout, they charge a $20.22 resort fee for two nights.  WTF?!  That brought the total for two nights up to $65.  Okay, so that\'s still a good rate.  But why deceive us?This is an old hotel, and it shows.  It didn\'t disgust me.  The room was clean.  There were some small problems.  I had a problem with the shower when it suddenly went cold on me.  And for some reason, they don\'t put blankets on the beds, only sheets, and it took me a couple hours to figure out how to turn down the A/C.  Small things.But hey, they had free wifi and all the cable I could consume.  I felt safe in the parking lot because they have some pretty strict guards making sure that everybody who comes into the lot has a room key.  So I used the El Cortez as home base to do business away from downtown.When I did stay downtown, it was fine.  At 2 am, I saw a couple hookers, and even one walking into the hotel, but during the day, it was nice to take a stroll down the Fremont Experience, which is just a block away.'
