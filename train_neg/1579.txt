b'We ordered a pizza for delivery, and waited 2 and a half hours with no delivery. Called and the manager said they overlooked the order, we asked for a full refund and they gave us $10 off.  Delivery guy finally showed up and we had already ordered chinese.  Horrible customer service.  If the pizza is over 2 hours late, give it for free.  Better yet, NEVER order from a pizza place that takes 2 hours to deliver!!!'
