b"I have been using rinse and ride since it opened and have always been satisfied. March 6th my opinion changed. I took my 2008 Infiniti through like I have a million times. When I was through and started drying off my car, I noticed that the trunk molding had been knocked off. I know they aren't responsible for things like that happening, but when I asked the guy running the car wash to get it for me, it was like I was putting him out! Not a sign of human kindness at all!"
