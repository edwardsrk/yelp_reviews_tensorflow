b"I came here with a coupon that I got from work that basically gave me 25 dollars off, that alone may have saved them a star.  The place was touristy and expensive.  I don't mind paying high dollar for food, but it better be good.  I ordered a three item combo for 18.00!  There was about 2 tablespoons of beans and rice (tasted like box rice) and they were both gross.  My chicken enchilada possibly was the worse I ever had.  The chicken seemed to be a grilled breast that they rolled into a tortilla and put canned sauce on it. Huge chunks of dry chicken does not make for tasty Mexican food.  The taco was ok but greasy and the taquitos was drenched in crema.  I am so glad that I had a coupon because if I paid 52 dollars for that pig slop I would have been pissed."
