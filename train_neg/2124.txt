b"I originally came in here in January for a dislocated big toe that happened over the weekend and have been here a total of 6 times at $35 co-pay each time. Every time you show up for your appointment, expect to wait 15 plus minutes in the lobby and another 5-10 minutes to see the Doctor once you get a room. My last 3 appointments I see the Dr probably a total of 5 minutes each time. I'm satisfied with the initial care in resetting my toe, but these last few appointments have been a waste of money and time.After my sixth visit, the Dr also recommended a customized orthotic to fix the way I walk, I honestly didnt think I have a problem walking, but the custom orthotic cost $550 that was not covered by my insurance. Needless to say, I passed. P.S. My brother also went there for a fractured ankle, after his surgery procedure and after many follow up visits, the doctor also recommended orthotics to him as well."
