b"I was really really expecting more from all the reviews.  I made it there, dining solo since I was out of town, around 815p and there was NOBODY IN THE PLACE at this time (Tues nite).  I asked if they were still open and realized the woman running the place doesn't really speak English.So I made it through the menu but then asked for suggestion and she suggested the fried noodle with beef, chicken and shrimp and the fried spring roll.It was out and delivered together, which I found strange.  The spring roll was nasty.  Possibly slightly over fried and a dark brown.  I ate just one of the two.  The pan-fried noodle was decent, not anything I'd write home about.  Not much meat, plenty of vegetables and not much flavor to inspire me to eat more.  So if that was her suggestion since I told her I might only be able to make it once to eat there, I'm a bit disappointed.Good value, but not really great food.  I have enjoyed better in my travels."
