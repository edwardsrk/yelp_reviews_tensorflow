b"I thought the lunch was $17.99 but during the weekend it is all day dinner price for $24.99 per person.  The only difference between dinner and buffet is that you get only one order of short ribs and one or two other item.  That is a rip.  This is not a self serve buffet, where you get you own meat.  You have to actually order from the waitress and they get it and cook it in front of you. The problem is sometimes you want more of one item than another.  The items they have are very limited.The reason why I gave two stars is because they only give you two small bowls of rice for an all you can eat .  Also I am Asian.  Just like most Asians, I eat a lot of rice, especially with all you can eat meat buffet. I don't know of any Asian culture where you get more meat than rice. After I requested a second bowl of rice the waitress actually warned me that she will have to charge me for an extra bowl.  What the What. And this is a SMALL bowl of rice. it is less than 8 ounces. How can you eat hot and spicy foods with out rice.  This might be worth it for $12.99 but not for $17.99 or $24.99. It is not worth it. I hate going to a restaurant and feeling ripped off and I felt ripped off here."
