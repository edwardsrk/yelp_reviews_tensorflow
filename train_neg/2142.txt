b"After eating at this place for many years I was disappointed at the higher prices after the remodel. I liked the old place more and wasn't too thrilled with the change of market they want. Sorry guys but $23 for a pasta dish puts you on par with some of the pricier Italian places. Rigatonys down the road is just as good for half the price."
