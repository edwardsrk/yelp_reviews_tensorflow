b"Ten minutes minimum in the drive through. Constantly have to hand them back the tater tots (I patiently waited for) because they are old and cold. I gave it an extra star because I feel the management is trying. I hate to complain but they are understanding and eager to correct the mistake. I hope this location gets better because it's close to my house and I do like the food when it's hot."
