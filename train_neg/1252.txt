b'This place is a joke I walk in to make an appointment the lady stated I am the only person working and one person ahead of me so I made an appointment less than an hour. When I come back to the appointment I was told there are 3 people in front of me and the same women was in the chair and the wait was going to be 45 minutes more after waiting 15mintues past my appointment. I would never come here again. Can believe this is how they treat customers.'
