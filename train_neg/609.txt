b'I do not recommend going to this location what so ever. Please drive a little out of your way and avoid this location. Absolutely nothing hot n ready. While waiting 20 minutes for two pizzas one pep bestest the other a cheese bestest one would think the pizzas would be hot but they were room temp with no pizza sauce and hardly any cheese. Please do not waste your money and time here. I grew up with little Caesars and have been to many in different states over the past 15 years and I have never had such a bad experience food wise I have never left a little Caesars Pizza and thought I was ripped off but this location had me felling like I was ripped off which I was and you will be too. Please go to any other location do not waste your time or money at this location.'
