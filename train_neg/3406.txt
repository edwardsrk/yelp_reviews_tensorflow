b'We tried this place for the first time and it was just average in my opinion. The atmosphere is great and the decor is nice. The food...is very average. The fish taco and barbacoa were the only good ones. The carne asada meat was super fatty and super salty. The guacamole and chips were delicious as well. We got the jamica drink and it had no flavor what so ever. The lemonade drink was ok.'
