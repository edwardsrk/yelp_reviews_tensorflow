b'Rich is such a cool guy he could sell just about anything to anyone at a high price. He is also smart, so I think that is just what he might be doing. If you dont care about getting screwes on price, I think there may be a good chance you could be happy here. But if you are on a budget (arent we all in one way or another) then you may not appreciate their "you have to come in before I tell you what it costs" game and even when you come in they still dont tell you what it would cost, only that their guys charge hourly and almost as much as lawyers. That was not was I was personally looking for. Finally he tried to sell me a DIY polishing machine that he supposedly invented himself because he is a chemist, and instead of telling the specs he gave me some sales pitch how it "circulates instead of rotates". That was probably a salesmans way of describing what ordinary people would call an orbital polisher - that is not unique but he tried to present it as such which I percieved as dishonest. Sorry. So instead I went and waxed the car myself with high quality Meguilar stuff I got from Walmart at around $30 and now it is nicer than new!'
