b"Went here for their Groupon $99 deal.  That is six 5 minute laser hair removal sessions for $99.  Of course the hair removal sessions were spread over 6 months.  After the last session, the female attendant burned me slightly, and even after all of that time and patience, only about 75% of the hair growth has been reduced.  Glad I didn't pay more.  Obviously laser hair removal requires much more time and effort in the goal of ridding oneself of unwanted hair.  However, you wouldn't know that with the information you get from the people who work at Bellair.  They encourage you to keep coming, and attempt to pressure you into more ridiculous deals, such as 3 body parts at a time for six sessions at $400 or more.  If the laser treatment didn't completely work at $99, why would I want to pay $400?Do your research and skip over this place."
