b"Slim pickings at this buffet.  Half filled containers of cold food.  The food was a little better when they finally refilled.  The shrimp and hot and sour soup were good.  The deep fried stuff was mostly bread with a little piece of meat.  The salad was basic, lettuce only and maybe a carrot or two.  Wasn't really worth the $6.99.  Rather pay a bit more for something edible.  We won't be back."
