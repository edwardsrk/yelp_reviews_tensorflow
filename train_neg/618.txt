b"Don't recommend what so ever. So terrible, we tried to bring one of our friends to try pho for the first time and the service was terrible, we ordered a Thai tea Boba, the Boba was hard and the tea was too strong. It was so gross we didn't pay for it and we're not allowed back but I don't even care, I'm never gonna go back. It was just a waste of time. Don't go here, go up the street to pho Kim long they're pho is way better and cheaper."
