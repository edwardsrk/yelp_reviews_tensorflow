b"Now I understand why there are so many negative reviews. I came here today to get my discounted car wash and it might just be the worst car wash I've ever had.My rear and front windows had smudges all my over and they didn't properly clean the console area.The Armorall on the dash board was only half way distributed, which means when I get home I'll have to wipe it down evenly with a rag.In all honesty I'll most likely not come back and start looking for another oil change/car wash place.This joint needs to get their act together. I don't recommend this place at all."
