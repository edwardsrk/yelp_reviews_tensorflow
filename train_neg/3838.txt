b"Had dinner here the other evening.  None of our party were impressed.  It wasn't horrible, it was edible for sure, but good?  No.I had the Squid Salad (Yum Pla Muk) and it had a really strange flavour, and the calamari (squid) was very very rubbery.  I also had the Coconut Chicken Soup and it was very watery and a very thin consistency (although the flavour was ok).Really wouldn't go here again - too many other dining options at Yonge & Eg, and if I want Thai, I'd go elsewhere."
