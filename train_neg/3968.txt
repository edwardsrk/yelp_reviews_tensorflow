b"Came for the first time for a friends's bachelorette party and I'm slightly disappointed. I've heard nothing but good things about arrogant, but as of right now I don't really see what the hype is about.Spent 9$ on a drink (the pink drink) that could have fit in a shot glass. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, didn't even seem like it had alcohol it it.And too top it all off there is a total of ONE vegetarian entree. I get that they're called the arrogant butcher, but come on...At least I can say the service was good."
