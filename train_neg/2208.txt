b"Yikes, the prices are crazy for what it is and what you get.  If you are going to charge $18-22 for an entr\xc3\xa9e an all the salads are a la carte, you should have at least linen napkins.  The waitress is the hostess, no salt or pepper on table, and entry is messy.  The food was a tremendous disappointment and with one waitress on a Sunday night, we had to wait for just about everything.  Food was overcooked and just weird.  The fried zucchini and spanokapitos were good, but entr\xc3\xa9es were tiny and just not tasty.  For six people our bill was $160  plus tip closing in on $200 which included some desserts too.  Everyone felt the same way and although we all live nearby we won't go back.  I can get a better meal at Denny's with better service.  I give them another 6-8 months and they will be closed. My recommendation is to go to Silvioni's or Monte Cello's."
