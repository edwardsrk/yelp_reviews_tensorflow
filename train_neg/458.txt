b'Chicken had a terrible and dry taste. The brisket was smoked for 2 minutes, if at all. I asked the person behind the counter if the lemonade was homemade and they said yes,  absolutely no way it was. Portion sizes are awful and they are not flavorful at all. I threw the chicken away rather than taking it home to my dog. I will never come here again or recommend it to anyone I know.'
