b"Awful experience. My girlfriend gifted me an Amazon local deal for an ultimate detail valued at $275 dollars.  I made an appointment for 11 am during my lunch hour so as I can drop the car off and pick it up by 3:30. Long story short, Diego from the shop and his coworker told me that I would need to pay $55 extra because there was dog hair in the back seat and I would have to leave it over night. I told that that that's not possible so they said to get a refund on Amazon and that they could not help me. I wasted time and gas to bring it to the shop and my buddy from work did the same so as he can drive me back to work. Unprofessional outfit with unrealistic value for money.  They also expect a tip on top of the $275 value that the voucher is for. Ridiculous and definitely not worth the money."
