b'Update Two (the morning after): So when I booked the movers, I was told I only need two men, so that\'s what I paid for and budgeted for. When they finally showed up for the move (two hours late and after all the phone calls and messages), the "manager" brought an extra guy, which I figured was a customer service gesture because they weren\'t even STARTING the move until after 8pm. It wasn\'t until 10:30pm, when they were finishing up, that the manager informed me that he was charging me for the extra guy and the trip fee had increased as a result. Ugh. Additionally, four pieces of furniture (out of 13) were scratched, chipped or dented because they did a shoddy job wrapping things and were hitting them against stair railings and columns. I watched one of the movers try to carry a chair into the house by walking in between two columns and he hit the chair against both columns at a full walking speed. This wasn\'t my first time using movers, but this was definitely the first and last time I\'d ever use Skinny Wimp. Update One (mid-move): after quite a few phone calls of increasing anger, I finally was able to get movers out....two hours after the end of their "time frame." I will give credit where credit is due though, those boys hustled their butts off. Had the scheduling and communication not been a nightmare, I would give them five stars but we just got off to a really bad start.Original: I would love to write a review about their moving services, however these guys took my deposit and never showed up to move anything. They missed their time frame for the move, and now no one is answering calls or returning messages. They charged me $275 to reserve this time frame and now I\'m stuck with an apartment full of furniture that I have to somehow move at 7pm on a Saturday night by myself. If I could give them less than one star, I would.'
