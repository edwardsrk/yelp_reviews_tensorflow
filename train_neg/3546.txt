b"Like most people who have visited Charbar I was really impressed by the room. Beautifully decorated,  definitely one of the more esthetically pleasing restaurants in the city. The view from the patio is also gorgeous. As with most new restaurants it needs to iron out a few wrinkles. There's a sign near the entrance that  says the main floor hostess will help seat you for the patio so we checked in with them. After about a five minute wait (a headscratcher because there were plenty of vacant and unreserved tables) we were taken upstairs Interestingly enough there's another hostess at the top of the stairs who seemed to be seating people who just walked right in. The patio menu is great if you're there just for a drink but very limited if you're hungry, offering only a few dishes from their main menu. Perplexing, as we could've had dinner there but felt compelled to leave in search of more options for food. We did order an appy (tripe chips) just to be able to say we are there. While tasty, it was a little high on the salty side. The accompanying sauce was quite overpowering and probably unnecessary. We also ordered some cocktails, one of which came with the kind of ice you see in McDonald's soft drinks (not a huge concern in the big picture but definitely not acceptable if you're a cocktail snob!). I'll come back in a few months to try the menu properly and to see if time and experience helps smooth things out."
