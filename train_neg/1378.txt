b"Very disappointed. I went with my fiance and a group of friends for a birthday celebration and waited for almost 2 hours for our meal. I had the ribeye which was just ok and my fiance ordered the lamb pave, that she couldn't eat it because the meat was very chewy and the curry rice bland and hard. Worst dish I ever tried to be honest. Unfortunately no one at the party was happy with the meal and service.I really wanted to like the place, which is nice by the way, but I won't come back again"
