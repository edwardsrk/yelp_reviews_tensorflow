b'We came in to check out smart cars and they had plenty, so they get one star for that.  However, all of the cars were locked.  We walked into the office and requested assistance and waited nearly 30 minutes for the guy who was joking around with coworkers to come help us.  We were never offered water and it was a warm day and we had been there for well over an hour.  We asked for the water fountain and were told it was out of order and still no offer. That annoyed me. Finally we go out to test drive the smart car and the salesman says nothing! Nothing the whole ride. I ask questions about the car and his response is, I\'m not sure" and "I don\'t quite know the answer to that question." I am not asking how many cups of water the car can hold, rather the fuel efficiency, the weight, how often service is required, estimated costs of service and service plans.  Seriously, I will just wait for a preferred local dealership to have a Smart.'
