b"Avoid the salads. What a rip off. If you get a salad that mentions a specific ingredient in the title you probably will see the tiniest amount of it. My chicken cob with avocado salad had the most depressing amount of avocado like.. 1/6th of the avocado.. One small crumble of bacon and two thing strips of chicken.The same situation happened the last visit. With the Mediterranean chicken quinoa salad. A teaspoon of quinoa and two lovers of chicken.What a complete joke.I'd be OK if I could just go to a different location and have a better experience but happens in all the Paneras I go to...The Italian combo was great, on the bright side."
