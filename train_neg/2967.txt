b"We know and love good restaurants and this is not one of them.  The Camelback Inn is fabulous, elegant but this restaurant missed the mark.  A previous reviewer was correct:  the chicken liver pate/ the amuse bouche was the best dish of the evening. The staff were bland, left the used dished sit a long time before clearing and the room was half empty.  The hostess was strange.  The ceasar salad which they plated for two was served in soup bowls and it looked and tasted on a par with Denny's.  The onions rings were floury, doughy and greasy and served in a peculiar small dish as a spire.  The steak was disappointing in taste altho cooked well, and was served in a warm, not hot, cask iron pan.  The sauces were uninteresting and served again like at a coffee shop.  The hotel is great and the room is nice with a very nice chalk board mural but the food and service left me cold.  I hear that Katie's Kitchen is a much better choice in the Camelback Hotel.  Ruth's Chris is a far better bet for a steak!"
