b'Been here 6 times, but am not a stranger to the area since I live in it. The place is nice, prices expensive for what you get, and service is poor. 4 of the 6 times I received the wrong order, takes forever to get service at the bar, and tons of staff just standing around while you wait.Want a better experience and better happy hour, head over to Saddle  Ranch at Westgate... way cheaper and A+ service.'
