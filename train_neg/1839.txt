b"Decided to try the monthly membership. Went down to cancel it because I noticed a few scratches that weren't there before and I didn't plan on using it anymore. Canceled two weeks before the end of the month and I just looked on my card statement and I have a new charge for the monthly membership again. Seriously? When I signed up not only did they say you can call and cancel(asked specifically) and then I called to cancel and said I had to come down. So I drove all the way down there to cancel. And NOW I have a charge on my card."
