b"Worst airline experience ever! I have never been treated so poorly. Went back east for my grandfathers memorial and on my way back home EVERY American airline employee was extremely rude and unforgiving when my flight itinerary email said my flight was delayed and they said wasn't. (It was) I got to my gate 30 min prior to the flight, they insisted the flight wasn't delayed and I couldn't board. I had my 5 yr old son with me and they were rude to him and made him cry. After asking for a manger and being declined, I finally got through and made it on the plane. Never again will I fly American."
