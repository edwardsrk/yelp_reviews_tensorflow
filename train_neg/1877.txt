b"This is a terrible company. We waited an hour and 20 minutes for the shuttle to show up. We called several times to ask about the shuttle and we told that the driver was in their way to get us..... You might as well walk to your hotel you'll get there faster. I would give them no stars but unfortunately that's not an option."
