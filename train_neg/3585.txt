b"This place is confused. It wants to be a sports bar, restaurant and dance club and as a result, it does none of them very well.The food (I had the $3 tacos during happy hour) was decent, but nothing remarkable or earth shattering. The $3 beers were a hit with our group, but to a person (there were six of us), no one had anything nice to say about their food. Just sorta good, but not great.Other than having some TV's which you can't hear over their music, I don't see how they can call themselves a sports bar...that doesn't even make sense. Maybe it changes during football season, but it isn't anything like a sports bar at the moment.As for a dance club, we didn't stay to see it, but there is a large rectangular bar in the middle of the place and a DJ station at one end. I guess the dance floor would be between the DJ and the end of the bar which is not a large space. They were preparing for bottle service while we were there, and the wait staff was preoccupied. Overall, I think this place needs a manager who cares about customer service enough to impart that to the employees, because it feels like they believe that you should be grateful to be there and not the other way around."
