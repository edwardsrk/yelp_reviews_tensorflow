b'Well, I\'m seriously underwhelmed.It\'s not that the wings were bad -- it\'s just that the hype of "the best in the city" means they have a lot to live up to.  Couple that with their own hype machine of  "our medium is VERY HOT", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.What I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I\'m not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I\'m left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:I call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their "Hot" was, I would have instead ordered "Superhot" or "Death".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   I\'ve been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their "hot"... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn\'t even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.Listen, I get it, marketing is king... but c\'mon.  At least try to back it up!  I\'m a bit sad to do it, but Duff\'s clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.  Not only have I experienced better, I\'ve also experienced hotter.*  I am surely wrong, but I\'d swear their "hot" sauce is Frank\'s Extra Hot mixed with butter.  It was that generic.'
