b"Hard to explain how bad their Shrimp Pad Thai is. But I'll give it a shot. Imagine cooked rice noodles and cooked shrimp. That's it. No sauce, no flavor, no complexity, no effort, no passion, no purpose, no sustenance--need I say more? I have no clue how this passes as Thai much less a restaurant. I would ask for a refund but I'm going to pretend this experience never occurred."
