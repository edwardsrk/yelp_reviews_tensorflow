b'This St. Hubert is literally the worst I\'ve ever been to. The customer service was absolute garbage. I took the time to order my food online a half hour before getting there. This is an express counter which means it should take less time than the restaurant - but I get there ready to pick up my food and what seemed to be the manager tells me that they just started cooking the meats because he told me he wanted it "fresh". First of all, don\'t bullshit me and tell me you haven\'t started my order instead of lying about the freshness. We waited an extra 15 minutes for our food and then once we left in a hurry - they forgot to include my soup. I called back and demanded a delivery of the soup and I never got that delivery. Point is - WORST St. Hubert I had ever been to and WORST customer service.  You won\'t be getting my business anymore and if anyone ever asks me about you I\'ll tell them to go elsewhere. GARBAGE.'
