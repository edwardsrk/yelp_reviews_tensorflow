b'We are locals that frequent M Resort. Decided to try Pasta Bar for our anniversary dinner. We were seated promptly and we were served water and 1 roll each on our bread plates. No butter was served but we used oil and vinegar that was on the table. 15 minutes later (place was not crowded), our waiter, Pedro, came to take our order. We had not even been offered a cocktail or any other drink. He was very disinterested and even had a toothpick in his mouth! Hubby had veal Osso bucco and I had veal piccata. Food was OK, but service was just awful! When we declined ordering dessert, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away! Needless to say, we will not return.'
