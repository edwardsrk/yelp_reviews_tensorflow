b"Food is suspect but service is very good. Haven't been there for a while but went a couple times in the last month. The nigiri had a bad odor and the chef did not do a good job trimming the fish. Screaming O and jalape\xc3\xb1o yellowtail sashimi were also cut poorly.  To top it all off the rice had a rock in it which resulted in a visit to the dentist to fix a filling!  I would choose many of the other local sushi restaurants long before this place."
