b"I hate to be the bad news bear, but 3rd visit last night for dinner, and the food & service were both not the best.  I had the 3 veggies plate with mac & cheese, collard greens, and cream squash.  I also had a few bites of the fried pickles.  Fried pickles were good.  Mac & cheese was moist and cheesy and acceptable.  Collard greens was under cooked in my opinion and I have had better home cooked greens than that.  Cream squash was OMG kinda not good.  It was so watery, for a moment I thought I had ordered cream OF squash soup.  Waitress wasn't too friendly at all.  I doubt it's a surprise that it's going to be busy at dinner time, so why not put that frowny face away and put a freaking smile on!Seriously, I'm getting tired of all the hypes floating around town about these hip new places.  So far I've been disappointed by most of them."
