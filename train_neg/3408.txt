b"I got the large chicken on rocks with extra garlic sauce and the bill came to $11.73 or something. I don't think it's too much for the quantity you get. It should satisfy 2 people. However, 75c for extra garlic sauce is bullshit. My 2 stars are not for extra change I had to pay for the sauce, but for the quality of food and how it tastes. The garlic sauce is god damn too sweet and the rice is bland as hell. I definitely won't be going back and I would recommend you the same."
