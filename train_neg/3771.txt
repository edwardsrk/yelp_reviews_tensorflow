b"Food is subpar. Service is good. Ambiance and decor is nice. Unfortunately when I go out to eat I can care less in regards to how much was spent making the place look cool, I'm more concerned on how mind blowing their food is. I ordered the diablo shrimp tacos and they were just ok. I've had better. Nothing to make me want to come back."
