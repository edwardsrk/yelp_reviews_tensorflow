b"The village is one of the worst places to live near the UIUC Campus. Their staff is very unprofessional and they have no empathy toward any of their tenants. They provide late notice about everything while expecting you to pay on time. I have never seen such horrible customer services and treatment toward tenants. DO NOT LIVE HERE. Don't get sucked in by the low promotional fees. They don't last and at the end of the day the head ache isn't worth it."
