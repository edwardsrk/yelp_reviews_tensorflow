b"Wow I see a pattern here with the other poster. Gabe came out almost two weeks ago to give me an estimate to thin out my bottle brush tree. We agreed to this past Wednesday 6/14 to be out between 11:00&12:00 we agreed then about 11:00 he called and said a job went long they wouldn't be able to get there until about 2:00 and due to the temps that afternoon he said he'd rather not have his guys out. I agreed plus I didn't want them rushing or getting sick. So we agreed on today Saturday 6/17 between 7:00&7:30 in the morning. My wife called him about 8:40 to see where they were Gabe's phone was off. She left a message. No response about an hour later she texted him to say they don't have to worry about coming out today or any day. It's now after 1:00 pm still no calls. Wondering how they stay in business. Like the other poster we found their number in a My Guy flyer and yes I also thought these businesses were screened. They probably are. If their check clears to purchase the advertising space they are recommended. First time I paid attention to My Guy not going to make that mistake again. This is another business I have to give one star too because Yelp doesn't allow posts with no stars.Call anyone else do not call these guys."
