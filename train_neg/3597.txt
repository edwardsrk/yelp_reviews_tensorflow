b"Really want to like this hotel... but struggle to truly enjoy it.  First the good:- we booked a loft room.  It was quite spacious although calling it a loft isn't that fair.  It really just has a sitting area to the side... we didn't even use it. - it's in an excellent location.  Close to shopping, old Montreal, etc.  You can really get almost places within a 10-15 minute walk. Now the bad:- we found the hotel extremely dirty.  It's not what we saw that worries me (dust everywhere, dirty sheets, toothpaste on the side of the bed, sticky hairdryer, etc) but what we didn't see that really scares me. - I have no idea what it was but there was a foul smell in the room and many hallways.  Might have been chemicals but it was tough to smell. - the hallways and rooms were extremely dark and depressing.  They were painted black... a coat of white paint could have made things way brighter. Not sure that I would stay here again..."
