b"We heard a lot of good things about this place, but we were totally disappointed with the brunch and service.  The French Press coffee is great, but we didn't know it was French pressed, so we were frustrated with the 20 minute wait. The waffles showed up at our table cold, without plates or syrup.  Our poached eggs with the Benedict were literally not cooked. It was like a raw egg was cracked on top. The waitress tried to explain what poached eggs are to me. I assured her that I eat poached eggs all of the time and I know how they are cooked. They did comp our breakfast, but we would have rather paid for a good meal."
