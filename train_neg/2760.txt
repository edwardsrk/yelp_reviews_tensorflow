b"ahhh... so much potential!!! If I had to rate The Suffolk punch purely on decor and ambiance, I'd give it a whole 5 star rating. Unfortunately, there's so much more to consider.The food was average at best, the service was really quite terrible (the drinks took foreverrrrr to get to us, some things never made it to us at all, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time)The first time we went there in the morning for a cup of coffee, we were so excited because 1) the coffee was awesome 2) the decor was even more awesome. We couldn't wait for them to be open for dinner. and when they were, we decided to check it out with some friends.We ordered a lot of food, almost everything on the menu - from the potato croquettes to the foie gras popcorn, from the beet salad to the pickles, the punch burger to the market fresh fish - and while non of the food was terrible, none of it was memorable either. The overall experience however was a memorable one because it was expensive and underwhelming. The drinks that did make it to our table were good, but when you have to wait 20 minutes for a drink, they ought to be amazing - either the drink menu needs to be simplified, or the bar service upped.There's tremendous unrealized potential here... perhaps things will improve with time?"
