b"False advertisement!!! In new year, the stated it is the best place to see the fireworks and the ball drop. Nothing close to this. I complained w/ the manager and he said u can watch it in the TV, hahaha. We were just able to see the Monte Carlo building. We got a table and pay extra ticket to see OT Genesis that night. He did not sing or play any song.. this place sucks and had false propaganda. I drove to Las Vegas to have fun in New Year's Eve and we waisted our money in this place. Don't trust on this place at all."
