b"Was here for the Yelp Burger week and did not have a good experience AT ALL. Forced 20% gratuity for a larger group. Very poor customer service also. I ordered the $5 burger special especially after the fact that we had to pay for ....gasp! water. It was a MAJOR turn off for me & I already didn't want to order anything else after that. While the patty was nice and juicy, the bun was a different story. I feel they could have at least toasted the bun lightly to give it a bit more texture. I felt like I was eating lunch in a cafeteria. It was also missing the so called advertised mozzarella cheese.I got to try some fries (regular and sweet potato) and felt it could have been crispier.Overall, I will NOT be coming back to Satan's little burger place again even if I were starving. Find something else around the area. Too much meat isn't good for you anyway."
