b"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it appears as though the high end stores have decided to fore go their zip code on this one.  On the plus side, it does have a two huge arenas in its corner, so at least you have something to do while waiting for your event to start.  I would have liked to have seen more Kierland type stores in here.  It's a bummer since this place had so much potential."
