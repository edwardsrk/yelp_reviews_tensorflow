b'This is a typical HK diner so I didn\'t walk in with much expectation. Ordered: Laksa with shrimp and chicken: I didn\'t personally eat it but it seemed very watery. Also, theres 2 different types of noodles in the dish. I haven\'t seen that before so don\'t know if thats the "correct" Laska or not (I don\'t think it is though).Ox tail with rice: Very SALTY and very FATTY.  There was a whole layer of fat with little meat in each piece. I\'ve definitely had better ox tail before. All combos came with a drink, specialty drinks were a minimum of 0.50 extra depending on which drink you order. I ordered Ribena soda with lemon and it was okay. But recommend you to ask for less ice as the ice made it very difficult to poke the lemon. Drink was eh. Nothing special and not worth the extra 1.75.Overall: I don\'t think I will be coming back. I would rather eat at Phoenix than here.'
