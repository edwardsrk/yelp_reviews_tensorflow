b'As an O&B restaurant chain, I expected a lot more. I went here for brunch, the service was terrible. The waitresses were unfriendly and unattentive, you would have to call them three-four times before you can get their attention. I ordered the eggs bannodict and my boyfriend ordered the croissant French toast. Both were sub-par. Nothing out of the ordinary. If you are looking for overpriced and bland brunch. This is the spot. Will not be coming back.'
