b'The ONLY reason this place gets one star(aside from the fact that I can\'t give it NO stars)is that the security staff is cool when I bring  my dog for early am training.Actually I think they might be relieved as he is a working dog,and probably looks like added security.One morning I was going in with him and all the crackheads who hang by the Bank of America ATM were already amassed.One of them asked me"Hey.is that a po-leese dog?"My reply was "Sort of.He\'s a drug dog trained to find meth." I never saw so many disability claiming neer do wells scatter so fast.They were still gone when I went to leave.The place is sketchy,nasty,and the parking lot is NOT safe.More often than not,skells are perusing it looking in vehicle windows and trying doors.The malwart there is one of the nastier ones I\'ve been in,so much so,that even with gas prices being what they are,I will drive further away for a less frightening shopping experience.The shops in the actual mall part are gehttofab,so if you really need a chola version of Marilyn Monroe on a t shirt,there are a few places that sell really nice ones.There\'s one shop that sells really cheap costumne jewelry,but for some unknown reason,the place REEKS of formaline.I don\'t know how anyone can actually work there and not incur liver damage from whatever the toxic waste they\'re storing there is.The excure for a food court is terrifying.Yes,I\'d like the deep fried ptomaine on a stick with a side order of Shigella please.Ick ick ick and ick.'
