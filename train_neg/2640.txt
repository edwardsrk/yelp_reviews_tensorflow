b"This office is so unorganized. I've been here coming here now for about 6 month. But today was the worst. I have to drive 45 minutes to get to this office. So then when I get there you have to get this card before you can get your shot. So they tell me we're sorry we are out of cards. Ok... Then when shot lady calls me up for my turn (had to wait an hour just for that) i procede to tell her that the lady at the front said that they ran out of cards. Of course she's like you need a card. Maybe you should do something so you don't run out. Then on top of that I tell her that my asthma and allergies have been really bad this week. So she's like I can't give you your shot. Wow!! So I ask them could you ask the doctor if he could maybe prescribe some predisone because I'm having a hard time breathing and my inhalers are having no affect. So surprise surprise they can't do that either. You have to make an appointment for that. Wich of course will be like a month out. Now I have to suffer. Thanks for nothing!"
