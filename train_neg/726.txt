b'Had a reservation.  Got dropped off and they had no cars. No attempt to help just we have no cars and we are closing soon. I am serious. No attempt to find me another location or offer me a cab to the airport where they are open 24 hours, just nothing!  Walked 5 miles to the airport in south Phoenix at night.   Just terrible.'
