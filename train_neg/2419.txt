b'The food is good but definitively overpriced. If you compare with a place such as smoke, the tako are about 50% more expensive for the same quality (in my opinion). The place itself is very noisy and this is almost impossible to really discuss. The service pressures you to order, which is very inconvenient when you want to take your time. Finally, the drinks prices are ok but the size of some is totally ridiculous ...So, yep, the food is good but when going there, I was feeling I am paying the price for the hype, not for the food ...'
