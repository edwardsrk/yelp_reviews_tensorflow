b'Not recommended. I booked and was told I would be picked up at my hotel and taken to a ticketing office and there would receive tickets for the USBR 1 hr tour of Hoover Dam for $132. Instead after  paying they gave me a different tour, NO offer of a full refund. I did not receive the Hoover dam tickets. When I called I was told I booked with their agency so they were not responsible for not providing what I paid for. The booking agency said they weren\'t responsible either. After over a month of back and forth including talking to managers for Airbridge and Best Tours I was given $33 back as "FULL" compensation. I paid $132. The face value of the tickets I did not receive alone was $90 so definitely not a happy customer. I was even less satisfied when I complained and $33 not even being the cost of the tickets I did not receive and still being out $99 and having never received the tour learning that the Airbridge Manager and Best Tour manager had talked and it was decided "You have been compensated" "You got exactly what you wanted."If I were to go again, which I will be to actually see the dam, I am renting a car and avoiding the bus tour. The bus "tour" was about an hour and a half driving behind motels and hotels, did not include fund Hoover Dam facts on route, and did not include Hoover Dam tour tickets which in the advertisement were included. Instead it was a $132 bus ride to walk outside the dam and see the visitor center. Definitely not worth it.'
