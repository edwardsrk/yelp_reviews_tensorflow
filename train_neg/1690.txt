b'This is the MOST UNPROFESSIONAL company I have had to deal with. Total was $70.00 and driver charged $90.00 for tip without my consent. I have called their office several times to see how we can resolve this issue and they continue to hang up on me. First time I called, the woman answering the phone couldn\'t stop laughing and sounded like she had food in her mouth. She answered the phone by saying "yeah?". I am so displeased and overall disgusted with this "company". Do NOT waste your time and/or money with them.'
