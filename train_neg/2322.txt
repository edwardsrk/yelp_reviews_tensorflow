b'The food was pretty good! Went there for dinner on a weekday and they were not busy at all. All attentive hostess and the food came out fast.The bad news is that it gave my bf diarrhea after eating it. It was the only thing he had the whole day and he woke up at midnight with a bad case of diarrhea... So if you go there, go at your own risk....'
