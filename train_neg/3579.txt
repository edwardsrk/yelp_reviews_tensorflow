b"First of all, Paradise RV Resort is not a RV resort; it is a mobile home development. Of the roughly 950 spaces, only about 150 are for transient RVs. I suspect these will disappear as they are sold to permanent residents.The remaining 800 spaces are occupied by permanent single-wide mobile homes.What does this mean?- Very dense living- No green space in the RV spaces- No picnic table on the site- Only a single central building with showers and toilets and few of them- No cable TV for RVs- WiFi is very spotty. I think I am now using a permanent resident's unsecured WiFi connection. Thanks.Otherwise- The staff is helpful and friendly- There is a large pool, several excellent tennis courts, saunas, a computer room, library and many other amenities.- Over the air television is excellent- There are many scheduled events- Age 55 and over; no childrenJust know you won't be among fellow RVers."
