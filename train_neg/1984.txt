b'Slowest service.  Drive thru took 25 mins...Just got home and updating my review. The drive thru was a horrible experience. Multiply cars just left in front me after placing their order and before paying. So they had no idea who placed which order once I arrived at the pick up window and no one even cared either. This place has a great location and they seem to be busy at most times during the day, but if they do not approve their customer service and wait time they will not last too long.  Great location for a Chick-fil-A is this place goes under...Food is okay.  General Tso and the Kung poa are the better options I have experienced so far.'
