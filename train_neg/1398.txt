b"If I was able to submit zero stars I would!!!My mother and I had a reflexology appointment yesterday and we were anticipating a great experience.  However, I was VERY disappointed with the customer service, cleanliness, inability for the employees to communicate and comprehend my questions/concerns.  There were wet towels on the chairs in the reflexology area and when I mentioned (twice) to one of the employees (who was a male of Asian descent) he either didn't understand my question or completely ignored me.  Additionally, the same male employee demanded that another customer pay a 30% tip.  She expressed that she wasn't satisfied with the service and her massage was cut short by ten minutes.  Therefore the tip was reflective of the service rendered.  Disregarding her concern, the male employee was very persistent that she pay 30% tip.  My mother and I decided to leave the establishment and will never return."
