b"Well what can you expect it's a Burger King. This location seems to be fairly clean in comparison to other BKs. There always seems to be long lines inside the restaurant (15 minutes wait).  The thing that spites me the most is the fact that the men washrooms needs a key but not the women's.  I guess all men are bad -_-    It's a mediocre place to get a cheap lunch."
