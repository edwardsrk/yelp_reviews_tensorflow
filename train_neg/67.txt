b"Worst Experience Ever! The customer service reps were very unprofessional and I was unable to get contacts, even though I had a prescription already written up. I tried to order contacts online through another company because they were so expensive. The company needed doc's approval, but was declined because I didn't go through the check up process that I wasn't notified about to make sure the contacts suited me. The entire process just to get in for an eye exam before was even more ridiculous."
