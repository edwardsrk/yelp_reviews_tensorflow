b'Very cold/bad customer service. You\'d ask a question about an item on the menu and he\'d reply with a semi brag and then tell you that it\'s sold out. No list for available coffee. and when you ask about the options he\'d reply with "choose whatever". Seems very disinterested in customers, and when we tipped him almost 25% (yeah, i know) he didn\'t even utter a simple thank you. Just a poker face a la "why are you still here". It seems like the positive reviews are from family and friends, cuz this was not a nice place. The coffee we did get was good though. If kind service isn\'t that much of an important factor to you, hit it up. Otherwise, there are plenty of decent and better places to go to.'
