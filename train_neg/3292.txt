b'Waiter had a bad attitude. We took a while to decide, which we thought wouldn\'t be a big problem since it was mid-afternoon and the majority of the place was empty, but I guess it was for him because he came up to us at least two or three times, looking and sounding impatient each time as he asked if we were ready yet. When we were ready to order, he asked "So are you guys going to order anything at all?" which sounded pretty rude. Also our food was sooooo greasy. I don\'t think any of us finished our plates. My friend\'s omlette had more cheese than eggs in it. Don\'t think I\'ll be trying this place again anytime soon.'
