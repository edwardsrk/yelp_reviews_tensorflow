b"This is a white person's Indian restaurant. It caters to King and Front street crowds. The prices are decent ($12 or so for the buffet) and the food isn't offensive, but its not the remarkable experience you expect when going to an Indian restaurant. The flavors are subdued, the spiciness is at best a  suggestion not a feature, and overall the food is just...there. you eat it, you see full, and you go back to work. If you're expecting Indian food like you're used to in Little India you will be disappointed. If you're going with a bunch of work friends to ear together and need something inoffensive and not very threatening, go here."
