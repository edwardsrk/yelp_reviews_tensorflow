b'If only 0 stars was an option: Worst haircut ever. After moving to Toronto for the summer I realized that I would need to get a haircut at some point while I was here. After doing a bit of research I found this place and saw that they had a Groupon. I bought the Groupon and booked a hair appointment which ended up being with Azar. When i got there, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and served tea and biscuits as others described (pretty normal for any higher end hair salon) and was brought to my seat. Azar and I spoke about how I wanted a small trim, keeping my hair long which is the way I liked it. From the start it seemed as though she wasn\'t really listening to what I was saying and had her own vision for what she wanted to do. However, when she showed me what she wanted to cut off, which was approximately 1 inch, I thought that it would all end up ok because WHO can\'t do a basic trim!? Apparently Azar can\'t. I walked out today with approximately 3-4 inches off of my hair, not a trim by anyone\'s standards. I was holding back tears the whole way home because of how horrible it is. Not only that, but she did not layer my hair as I asked nor did she straighten my hair like I requested. She instead, did some form of weird blowout saying that she thought I might like it "naturally straightened" and then when i reminded her i wanted it actually straight, she did a half-ass job to try and please me.I\'m sorry Azar, you are extremely nice but you need to learn to listen. I have always loved my hair and now I can\'t stop crying at the sight of it.P.S. If that wasn\'t enough, there was a deep-conditioning treatment included in the Groupon which involved sitting under heat to activate it. I was told she would be back in 10 minutes, however I was left stranded under this boiling heat for 20-25 minutes.'
