b"How can this place still be open !!!!I order a large ox tail $16. Plus tax .To start off food was warm looks  like food inspector  hasn't been there for a while .A few pieces  of meat that was very plan tasting. Worst that I've ever had .  There was no spice bottle around  . There a great place just on 10  or sure what made me even go there .I blame YELP for my bad decision . See picture  of my shiny oxtail ."
