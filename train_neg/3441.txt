b'A year later and a lot of changes happened to this restaurant. Not all of them for the better.Place is bigger, able to accomodate more. They also hired a lot more servers although still as busy so service depends on when you dine.Most importantly, the taste of both their sushi rolls and ala carte specials such as yakisoba and baby squid salad changed.Went back couple of times to make sure but I can no longer reccommend their rolls as the go to sushi even their famous las vegas roll. There just wasnt enough taste for the price. As for their yakisoba, there was a lot less ingredients than before - might as well boil plain noodle with food dye and sprinkle a packet of microwaveable vegetables....yes it was that bare. As for my old favorite baby squid..Taste was spicier and definitely saltier although they did try to mask the difference by adding more fried squid...So disappointed....'
