b'Walked in the door and my 9 year old pointed out that the place smelled like a bathroom. I shrugged it off and told her they must have been cooking a lot of eggs. I should have listened to my kid.Ordered a specialty margarita that looked nothing like the picture and tasted like a watered down regular margarita. The waitress, who was doing double duty as the hostess, explained that all the bartenders "do them differently" and offered to take it back. I kept it, as I\'m always afraid to send food back, who knows what I\'ll get in its place. Luke warm, bland food. So disappointed as I have been to a location in San Diego where the drinks and food were great. Oh well, we had to use our coupon...'
