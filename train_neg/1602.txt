b"Avoid this place at all costs.  Ordered a brisket for Easter about 5 days ahead of time.  Called the day before to see if I could pick it up that day, was told, no, the delivery for the day hadn't come in yet.  So fine, no problem. Went the next day about 11am.  No brisket.  No call, no apology, not able to contact the delivery man to see when/if arriving. Had planned to cook that day so the meat could rest a couple days in the fridge, having company and a tight weekend so had to re-arrange everything because of these incompetents.  I am puzzled as to why they asked me for my phone number in first place if calling never occurred to them. Thankfully was able to get Butcher on Butler to help me out.  Great service, great brisket."
