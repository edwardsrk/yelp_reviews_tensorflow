b'I effin LOVE hot dogs so when I found out that this place was opening down the street I was delighted, and went opening day.I order the basic naked dog since I find it\'s just to judge a place on how the they cook something simple.So what does a $6.50 hot dog taste like?Not much different than one for $3 that you can get on a street corner.The sausage was average, nothing special. The bun was a dissapointment and wouldn\'t surprise me if they get it from the same place your corner hot dog vendor does... it was also burnt a little. I understand that during a rush this is something that might happen to a piece of bread left over fire but the place was empty. Common guys.The toppings were creative but unnecessarry, rhubarb this, blueberry mayo that, somekind of crab flavoured sauce. Why would I want to put "fresh" soaking wet mozzarella on my hotdog? The relish was good.They didnt appear to have yellow mustard, which I am assuming isn\'t goumet enough, BUT they had ketchup.While I was eating, 2 of the workers were discussing what appeared to be a sausage at the end of a long fork that one of them was holding. After some deliberation he threw it into the garbage. That\'s 6 bucks doooood, I could have taken the bus twice with that sausage. That sausage couldve helped me pay my phone bill last month.I wanted to try the maple lemonade I read about but it was $5. That\'s five dollars for lemons and water people.Save your time go to WVRST for a larger, cheaper, more interesting hot dog/sausage selection.'
