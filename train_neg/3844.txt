b"Nice atmosphere and service was good. BUT... food was very basic and bland. Also portion sizes are so so small. My mom and daughter decided to split raviolis. Mom even asked the waiter if it would be enough food. The waiter said of course! The entire order consisted of five ravioli. When you split that it's 2.5 ravioli. We told the waiter we were disappointed that he said it would be enough. He said he usually eats 2 or 3 and is full. Setiously!!! Who eats 2 ravioli and is full? Atmosphere and service definitely not enough to save a restaurant, you need to have good food too."
