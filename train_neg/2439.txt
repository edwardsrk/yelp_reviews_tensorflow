b'Sip offers a choice if you are with a group and Connor decide if you want coffee or beer. As the name implies, you can get both here!The coffee for my taste, was ok, just not to my tastes. The beer choices looked decent enough to satisfy most.They have a limited food menu, but I did not try any.There are tables both inside and out, where you can get some work done. However, My one suggestion with Sip and most other coffee houses, is the lack of outlets. I realize adding outlets can be expensive, so run some cords!'
