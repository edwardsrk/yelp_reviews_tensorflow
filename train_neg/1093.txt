b'Consider seriously before joining.  I canceled my membership but they still charged me for an "annual fee" several months later -- and then I caught a charge another year later!  (My credit card company refunded me.)  I had experienced issues like this before with LA Fitness, so I went out of my way to avoid this very problem.  When I canceled the girl at the front desk (who wore WAY too much makeup looked at me like I was an idiot) assured me it was no problem.  WRONG.  Gyms are known for these unethical practices but with so many negative reviews, until they go out of their way to change these practices, you\'d be SMART not to join Smart gym.'
