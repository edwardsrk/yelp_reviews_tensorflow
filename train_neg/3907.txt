b'I am a little biased on this, as I was completely unnerved by a creepy by-stander. But anyways. I was meeting someone here and I personally hate coming to the signal hill/westhill area, especially on a week day during the day. No offence to stay at home moms, good for you, but you drive me insane. You are slow moving, have no care in the world and live in your own bubble. First off having to walk through the Chapters is annoying, it is full of people and screaming children (I thought places with books meant quiet time?), there is hardly any seats and the place is a zoo. Chai latte was a chai latte, tastes the same as usual. And then I as mentioned before was entirely creeped out by a patron. My whole experience here was terrible. I hope I never have to go back.'
