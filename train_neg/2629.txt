b"The rooms stunk. It smelled of strange cleaning product. Didn't like the location as it was in an undesirable area. It didn't feel safe to walk around at night. A motel guest was blasting music between 11 pm and 1:00 a.m, which could be attributed to the thin walls or lack of action from the motel night staff. The cleaning staff were unfriendly. They did not greet or even acknowledge us as we crossed paths. However, the front desk ladies who checked us in were nice even under pressure of having to turn guests away during the busy long weekend. Overall, my wife and I would not stay here again or recommend anyone to stay here. We appreciated the low rates during the holiday weekend but for more rest and peace of mind we will stay with a different franchise on our next visit to the Tempe area."
