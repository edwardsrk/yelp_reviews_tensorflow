b'This restaurant is below par to say the least.. the service was below average; the waitstaff was not attentive and the runners had no clue what was being dropped at the table so it caused a lot of confusion.. some of us ordered the same sushi rolls but they were ALL plated differently..  I\'m more than willing to spend good $$$ on a nice meal but this place was extremely over priced in every aspect.. the generic cut rolls, hand rolls and 2 piece sushi will cost you about $12 and there will be more rice than fish.. the specialty rolls were about $24 and were nothing "special." I would simply bulldoze this restaurant and put something else in its place..'
