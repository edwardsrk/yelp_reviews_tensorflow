b'Waited 1:30 hours to get to the main dish.  Service was erratic at best.  The food was OK (dried due to the lack of service and probably standing under the hot lights for a while) and the ambience was noisy. Server used the same cloth to clean 30 table without ever cleaning it, the place is dirty, the service is a touch and go.  The prices are well overprice, most gelato have a crust on them and they still serve it the way it is.  Overall a 2 star experience.'
