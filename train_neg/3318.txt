b"Although the burgers are great quality and pretty tasty, they are VERY expensive for what you get. Try to go to happy hour in order to save some on the delicious zucchini fries, or else yo'll be wondering why you came here instead of In-n-Out burger for a double-double animal style or Smashburger for something with a little more kick."
