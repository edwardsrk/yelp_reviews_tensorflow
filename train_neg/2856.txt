b"Friendly service, but very disorganized and slow.  The restaurant was packed for Winterlicious which led me to believe that I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the food was merely ok and came out very, very slowly.  They auto-gratuitied a table of 2 for 15%, it was definitely not deserved but lesson learned, I won't be back."
