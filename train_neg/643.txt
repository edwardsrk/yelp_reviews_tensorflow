b"The absolute worst, the girl at the counter was unbelievably rude and snotty and quite frankly dumb as a stump... as I'm trying to order a sandwich she's talking over me and rushing me along, I'm trying to ask what veggies and she's telling me the cheeses and the condiments, for god sakes shut up and listen .... I'm only asking about the veggies and she just kept spouting out the entire sandwich. I then told her to just listen to what I wanted and after that she was still asking me if I wanted the other stuff such as  peppers and mayo and cheese. She was the dumbest millennial yet. She is what gives this generation a bad name."
