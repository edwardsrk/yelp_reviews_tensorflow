b'I just want to note that I am all about eating quality sushi. I have been to many sushi places  and I know when the sushi is worth the money. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there. We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor. If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest.'
