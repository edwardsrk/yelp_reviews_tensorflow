b"So we decided to try this place for Taco Tuesday. It was busy as expected , waited in line about 20 minutes until we got to order. This was fine and then they put the orders together like chipotle or subway telling them what you want on down the line. Price was good and with their app we got another $5 off the total price. The tacos however IMO we not all that good. The chicken and beef were very bland and not a lot of meat to boot. The pork one had some flavor but again very little meat. Staff was nice but due to the taste or lack of taste of the food we won't be back."
