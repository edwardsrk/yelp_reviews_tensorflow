b"Good food. But don't order online. Their lines are usually butt to nut, so I ordered online, with their cool new app. I placed my order for designated time.  Got here and no one was ready to take my order. Waited a few min at the register to find out it wasn't ready. I paid. Waited. Saw 3 people walk in and get their food who arrived after me. Might as well walk in and get it. Those people are long gone. I'm still sitting here."
