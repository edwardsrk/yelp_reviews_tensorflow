b"Awful! Where is the flavor?! I ordered delivery tonight and got the egg rolls, Tom Kah soup and Authentic Pad Thai. Every single item lacked any flavor. I even asked for the soup to be medium spicy and the pad thai to be medium to hot. The Pad Thai has got to be one of the worst I have ever eaten. There is no egg, no tofu and no peanuts which is listed as included on the menu. It literally is just greasy noodles with a few pieces of chicken and a wedge of lime. Terrible, I won't be ordering from this place again. Do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else."
