b"Went for brunch two times. Same bad and slow service both times. Second time we got a smoothie bowl. It arrived melted. We also order dessert which was taking to much time to arrive. We decided to just ask for the bill and leave. Even the bill took long to arrive. If you are very hungry don't waste your time."
