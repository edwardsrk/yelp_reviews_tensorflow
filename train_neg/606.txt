b"So we stopped in for a late lunch 3:30 and the staff is not very friendly did not give a receipt for our meals we ordered separately . The food is fine spicy chicken was good . But when I go to the bathroom and see they haven't cleaned all day that's just wrong! Don't put up a clean schedule if your not going to do it. Went back to the table and this couple rolls up , leaves there lite cigarette right by the door on the window . Very classy move if I say so my self . I'm thinking  it was the owner or the manager because the couple and their child walk around behind the counters and proceed to take money out of the registers . And than pack their stuff and leave . So if your concerned with hygiene and cleanliness I would pass this place up ."
