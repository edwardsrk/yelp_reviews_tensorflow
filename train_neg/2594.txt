b"Utter garbage. Service is abysmal and the food isn't much better. I got excited by some of the novelty items on the menu like bangers in a blanket and Irish nachos but everything was terrible. The cooks make the food and bring it up from a flight of stairs. I don't understand what the waitresses are good far."
