b"I had this place as a 5 star spot. That's because I only did breakfast here. I went in 3 times at dinner before I updated the review. I just found out one of the worst servers I've ever had is the manager. Ashley I think her name is (stocky girl who sets at bar alot doing nothing, with dark hair) is the worst server. The word serve is in server and she is more of a setter. She and the bearded bar tender were last night actually bragging while I was there to hear it about the lack of effect they put in because the owner doesn't care. Well then I seen the comment cards and I gave a few opinions. 2 girls who work there mostly mornings (tall black hair gal, and I believe her name is Amanda with dirty blonde hair and a cute smile) are only people I'd keep and fire the rest! I've owned places and managed others. This place has awesome food, beef up the staff guys!!!"
