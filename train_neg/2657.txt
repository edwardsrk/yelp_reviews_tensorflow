b'I hate to give just a two star when I literally go to Starbucks daily. Sometimes more than once a day. But this experience was super annoying. Customer service however is great. They are very friendly and comfortable with their coworkers. But they cannot seem to get this whole coffee making thing correct.I generally order the same thing every time I get a Blonde Cinnamon Almond Macchiato for me and Americano  Nuevo for my bf. The girl at my Starbucks makes his Americano Nuevo on the clover. So I get here order the same thing. First the cashier doesn\'t know how to type them into the register, asks another guy and he tells me they usually do it w brewed coffee. I said ok but I usually get it this way is that ok. He says oh ye and tells the cashier he has to put it in as some other coffee and add a shot of this and a blend of that. I was confused but maintained my faith since I love me some Starbucks.The girl finally hands me the coffee( huge line up btw w only one cashier and 3 ppl stocking and "cleaning", 2 on coffee). i look at it and see bubbles on the top and automatically know its incorrect. Taste it and its horribly. Iwait for the second coffee and my bf comes in from next door. I tell him taste it, he asks what it it i said same thing I always get. no its not lol, yes it is.So I tell the girl its incorrect and she says do I want her to make it again , obviously it would taste the same . I wasn\'t sure if it was how she made it or what the guy wrote.She asks the other girl to make it over for me, But I wasn\'t impressed at all either way, so I said no just give me a caramel macchiato. I figured should be easy its a popular drink. The second drink came up as well, tasted so burned and gross. My bf didn\'t believe once again it was his regular drink. He said it tastes like Ikea coffee smh.First time we had more than half a starbucks coffee gone to the garbage.Never again!!'
