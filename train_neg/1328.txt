b'Please please please do not rent here! Before I even moved in they gave me an apartment that had broken tiling in the front, as well as, stained carpet. They consider themselves a gated community but half the time the gate is broken and open to anyone. Also beware they will try and jipp you out of your money! They took no security deposit from and then tried to charge me$450 two weeks after I moved out for cleaning purposes, when I left the apartment in better condition than what they gave me. They have complete morons working in the front office, so if you like dealing with incompetent people than this is the place for you. Enter at your own risk. Recommendations are the only thing most businesses have these days and I will make sure they get none!'
