b'Ugh. For a restaurant to have won accolades as "Best Chinese Restaurant" from the Phoenix New Times, I expected way more from this place than what it offered. You walk in and you feel you\'re more in a sports bar/English pub than a Chinese restaurant. The hostess seats you and then you\'re not served for 10 minutes. Eventually a server comes by and takes your order. I got the hot & sour soup and the eggplant w/chicken. I then proceeded to wait for 15 minutes before the soup arrived. The waitress was a little frenzied when she brought the soup and then disappeared again before I could ask her for some hot sauce.  I flagged down a busser for it instead, and he seemed pretty annoyed that I asked him to do something beyond wiping off tabletops. The soup was decent but it wasn\'t nearly the best that I\'ve had.I then waited another 15 minutes before got my entree. The eggplant tasted alright, but the ground chicken it was mixed with was downright disgusting. Smelled and tasted completely rotten. After four spoonfuls I decided I couldn\'t eat it anymore. But my waitress was nowhere to be found. I then spotted her from across the way and gave the "I\'d like my check" hand signal. I then waited for 15 more minutes. I didn\'t see my waitress anywhere. I walked up to the hostess and ask for my check. She gave me my bill and asked if I want to pack the food for home, to which I declined. I pay and leave the place, and see that my waitress is hanging out at the bus stop. Apparently her shift was over and she was going home, but I was left sitting there at the booth with a plate of smelly ground chicken and a mood of anger something large.I\'m really hoping this isn\'t the "best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix" because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it. If there aren\'t any excellent Chinese restaurants in Phoenix, then I\'m going to forlorn. Very forlorn. And that\'s not a good thing.'
