b"I've only been here for lunch and after work drinks / snacks. I work in the area and went to Jump for a business lunch recently. The food was not good.  It was like they had the dishes ready and sitting under a heat lamp, waiting to be served. Our food came out very quickly after ordering, was rubbery in texture and didn't taste all that great.  I don't think anyone at our table of 6 finished their meal.  Really disappointing. There are much better restaurants in the area..."
