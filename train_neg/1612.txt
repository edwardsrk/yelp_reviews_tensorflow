b"Had lunch with work colleagues today and the eggplant parmigiana was the worst ever! I swear to God, the thickness of the eggplant was 1 mm I repeat 1 mim!! Can't even fathom how someone could create such a ridiculously thin slices and then have the nerve to serve it and then call it eggplant parmigiana! The layers were 95% floured coating then heavily deep fried - never order that. Next time I crave eggplant parmigiana, I'll just get the Costco,'s frozen version - so much better! The  accompanying sad garlic bread clearly tasted stale! The restaurant is just riding on its reputation- cannot imagine how."
