b'Horrible customer service. After getting blamed for stealing I emptied my pockets for them to show I didn\'t take the item. Then the "manager" blames the 2 kids I was with who were 12 and 14 and they also empty their pockets and too no surprise we didn\'t take nothing. Then I ask him why he continued to look at us like thiefs and he says "I can look at you however I want". Yup that\'s the autozone customer service right there'
