b"After reading previous reviews of how good the brunch was, a friend and I decided to check it out. I was disappointed though. I ordered an eggs benny with back bacon and white cheddar potato cake. The potatoes were  just roasted with some herbs, no cheese in sight and the back bacon on the egg Benedict was a small piece of deli meat that I couldn't see under the poached egg. I had one bite near the end where I actually tasted back bacon."
