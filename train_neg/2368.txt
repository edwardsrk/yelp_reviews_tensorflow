b"Every now and again we have a craving for Church's chicken however your craving is only as good as the last meal that you got there.  Some of the chicken pieces that we got you could tell the chicken came from an old chicken.  Seriously! You know when you get a young fresh chicken as opposed to a chicken that was up in age.  Also the fries were over crispy bordering on burnt. So no more cravings for Church's chicken. Craving has been satisfied."
