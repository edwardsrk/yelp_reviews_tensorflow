b'Unfortunately This place was a huge disappointment, from the lack of flavor to the additional $1.00 they want to charge for a refill to the extremely high prices of each item of food, I will not return, there are many more places within a 5-10 mile radius that offer much more flavor and better quality food at a much more reasonable price. I absolutely hate to dismiss a "family" owned business however if the service was at least half decent I would have let it be.'
