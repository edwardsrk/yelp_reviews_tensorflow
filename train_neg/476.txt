b"Stay away. The rudest staff in Toronto. I spent $4K on a Cervelo; you think that would warrant at least some level of respect. When you walk in the doors, no one looks up to greet you, and Michael can't be bothered to help you with anything.I'd taken my bike in for a spring tune up, and was told that it would be ready two days later (Wednesday). Friday night...haven't heard a thing. Terrible service. I can't believe this store is still in business."
