b"This place is conveniently located in the Stratosphere, but the food is NOWHERE near the quality of the price. I could have been unlucky or just picked the wrong dishes, but I felt a little robbed. The service was great - attentive, professional, and just charming. My water was never half full, and the complimentary bread was awesome. I ordered the eggplant parmesan, and my boyfriend got the Mediterranean seafood linguine. The portions are really huge, which some people like, but I'd choose quality over quantity any day. His dish was full of seafood and linguine, but the seafood was not well-cooked (some was good but other pieces were rubbery) and the flavor of the sauce was really bland. My eggplant parmesan had a good flavor, but it was a tad oily and the side really wasn't well-planned. Every entree includes a side of either pasta or potatoes. Potatoes as a side didn't fit the eggplant parmesan, so I chose the pasta. I assumed, since Fellini's is an Italian restaurant, that the pasta would be good, but I swear the pasta I make at home is better. They served the spiral pasta with the most bland marinara sauce, no cheese or anything. It was something out of a cafeteria. The eggplant tasted really great; it was breaded and cooked well, so it melted in my mouth, but the sauce was the same average marinara sauce. Of course, like most chain Italian places, they put an overwhelming amount of cheese over everything. Overall, I would not go back."
