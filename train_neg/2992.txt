b"My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a pricey dinner for our 10th anniversary. A first for us! We were seated, and based on the service, we were so impressed, and resolved to do this more often. However, after we ate our food, we quickly changed our mind! For the price, our meal was DEFINITELY not worth it! I would have rather taken the money spent and put it toward the couch I've been wanting for like a year...there's only a little resentment here ;)I would give a 5+ on service, but food, really just average, and no where near worth the price."
