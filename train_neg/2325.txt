b"Well, after being a loyal patron since moving to Mesa, AZ in 1991, it's sad that Matta's and me will be apartin' ways. I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. A few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. Today, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of. Matta's, it's been a nice run with you but I won't be coming back."
