b'While Cox maybe overprice and give crappy customer service; they are HEAVEN sent compared to these jokers. I called to get a quote, I made sure to ask him that no service will be started. I didnt agree on a price or speed. They started the services anyway. I called to cancel after I got notified of a pending bill. $151 still. If you like your a$$ , stay away. If I could give negative stars I would. I think they paid someone to write the 5 stars reviews.'
