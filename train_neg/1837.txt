b'After walking through the cloud of cigarette smoke at the back entrance we found the hostess stand and were greeted with "we are out of bone in wings". Um ok, table for 2 adults and 1 kid. We got the last table right next to the bar. The bar tender waited on us then we really never saw her again. Food took forever, was brought by the hostess and was cold. That is the worst - waiting for cold food. cause you know it got cold cause no one bothered to bring it to you. I sent my cold nachos (the cheez whiz kind) back and they microwaved them. Let me repeat that. They.microwaved.nachos. Lettuce and all. It was disgusting. I woulda drank some water to get rid of the one bite of soggy lettuce taste but we never got any refills. I asked the manager to take them away and to just forget it and bring the check. He made me some new ones  anyway - but we had to go, we\'d been there forever already and did not want to listen to the insanely loud dude with the guitar who set up shop in the bar with a screeching amp. Never again.'
