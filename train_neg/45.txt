b"Problems popped up after we dropped off the vehicle. This location doesn't have an after hours key drop box. In the past, we simply left the keys in the locked vehicle.On Sunday we parked the SUV in a spot directly adjacent to the front door. On Monday at 5:45 pm; I received a call from  them asking where the car was. After they figured that out; they claimed not to have a spare key and we would be charged continued rental until WE found a way to actually put the keys in their hands. Or we could pay a $50 fee and an extra day rental and they would handle it. After demanding to speak with a manager; we were told that they would drop all extra charges this time.Looked at our checking account on Tuesday. Found out that they had debited our account for the rental plus the initial deposit. (The deposit is never drawn at the end unless there were damages involved; there weren't.) Had to call our bank to contest the extra charges. The bank handled this for us and we only paid the agreed upon rental price. This was the ABSOLUTE worst rental experience we ever had."
