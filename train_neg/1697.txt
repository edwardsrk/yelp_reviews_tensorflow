b"A group of us from work spent $10 on a Groupon and went for lunch.  The waitress was extremely upset that we had Groupons and CURSED at one of us when she found out we were using them. After she scanned all our vouchers she tells us that we are losing the remaining amounts left on the voucher. If we knew that before hand we all wouldnt have used our vouchers at once.  Overall terrible experience.  She should have educated us about how to make the most of the groupon rather than getting upset and cursing. I've never been so appalled with service in my entire life. The food was approrpriately priced for lunch and was pretty good. If it wasn't for the terrible service we would be back again."
