b"If you want to talk during your breakfast don't bother coming here. It's extremely loud. The music is totally unnecessary. The food is good but we won't be coming back since you leave with a headache. People have to scream in order to be heard over the music. If your looking for a nice quiet breakfast go somewhere else. Also the prices are as high as the noise."
