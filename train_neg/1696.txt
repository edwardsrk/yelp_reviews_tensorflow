b'I called and placed an order for 2 veggie burros because I\'m a vegetarian got about a third of the way into one and there was MEAT in it. Also a veggie burro is suppose to have cheese which it did not and fresh avocados in it but instead it had the pico de avocado and they did not tell me this would be substituted. Just ended up throwing them away. Also the first time I called a girl named Hailey answered the phone but said the wrong address and then said "wait what" and hung up on me so I had to call again and a different employee answered the phone. Very disappointed in this Someburros location. The one at 101 E. Baseline Rd. in Tempe is much better!'
