b"My co-worker and I went for lunch and the service was horrible. Gave us plate with hair on it, then had to get up and go to bar to get another plate because waitress disappeared. Then bartender was rude, didn't say sorry about that, took plate and handed us another one no words exchanged at all. Won't go back!!"
