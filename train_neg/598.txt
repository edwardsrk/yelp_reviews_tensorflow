b"I wish I could have reviewed this restaurant based  on the food. My girlfriend and I came to Fernando's after passing on this place many times. Upon entering we were greeted by the server and asked to sit anywhere we wanted. The place at the time was pretty much empty save for a small group and two couples. Granted we had taken at least 5 minutes to order but we had ordered in time to beat a rush of hungry customers as the venue filled up another 5 minutes after we ordered. 20 minutes of waiting for our food turned into contempt as we saw customer after customer order and get their food before we did despite us being there before. We wouldn't have left as 'quick' as we did if not for a small family of 3 across the way receiving their food, having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already. The icing on the cake was that as we left the waitress made it a point to come out to us and rudely inform us that our server would have to pay for what we had ordered and that we had to wait because it was busy. Surely for someone who works in customer service one would think that the general principle is first come, first serve, especially in a restaurant. I suppose however that things are done differently in Mexico."
