b"Pretty stinky service today. Although the food is usually good bar food, we didn't get to place our order today.  No less than 5 servers passed our table while we waited to place our order. Maybe we just caught them in the middle of a shift change. Ended up leaving, but not too upset as we went to Taste of Buffalo where their wing are just better."
