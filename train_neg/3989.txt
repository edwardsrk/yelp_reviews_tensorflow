b"I was in Toronto for a concert with my mother and a few girl friends, and we desperately wanted a nice lake front patio with some seafood.Pier 4 seemed to be the only place that fit the bill, so we ventured inside.   To get to the patio you have to walk through kitschy, dank smelling pirate and ocean knickknacks.   I would not want to eat inside, it smelled terrible.The patio was lovely, and the server although a bit strange, was polite and did his job with relative aptitude.Why anyone wouldn't order seafood at a seafood place is just ridiculous, so of course I ordered the catch of the day - and it was delicious, not memorable, but a good bite to eat,   My friend ordered crab cakes, and they were mediocre.Overall, the patio was exactly what I wanted, but the food was nothing special."
