b"What an unpleasant experience...Birdsong not open yet so I came across this place...totally uninterested and surly barmaids, obviously not interested in serving a new customer....one tells me the beers, I ask for a sample, she walks off...another serves the sample, I order a pint for me and my friend from Texas, she tells me she can't serve me two beers at once per state law...I take my beer outside to the table and then return for his beer...what BS...start a tab? Nope, we finished those subpar beers and left...needless to say no tip and won't be back...apparently you have enough patrons who aren't treated this way or put up with it...on to Divine Barrel for a   5 star experience...Heist is aptly named; glad to see others have also had a bad experience here so it's not just me...hey Heist: without customers you don't exist. Plenty of great breweries in CLT, you ain't one of them."
