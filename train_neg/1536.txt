b'I have been to pretty much all the restaurants in Toronto and this is probably the worst (how ironic) one with the poorest customer services. We had a large party for reservation at 7:00pm and I arrived at 7:30pm (bad traffic on a Friday) and was denied entrance by a bouncer:" we are at capacity.". After lining up for 15 minutes and I saw people walking out, I asked again, and yet was denied again :"sorry you are only allowed 30 min grace period from your reservation even thought the other 19 ppl are all seated." Now it is 8:20pm and I am still waiting. If I could, I would have avoided at all causes. You have a choice, so do not go there as a large party especially you have ppl commuting!!!! Avoid at all causes.'
