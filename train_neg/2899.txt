b"After reading reviews, I was super excited to visit this salon! I recently moved here and have desperately been trying to find a salon that does great nail art.My first time there was amazing! Kaitlynn was super friendly and patient as I tried to figure out exactly what I wanted. I left super impressed and couldn't wait to come back.The 2nd time I came back knowing what art design I wanted. I had a different nail tech and as we started the nail design, we couldn't quite get the look I wanted. I was trying to get a bright ombre but the colors weren't quite sticking. I told her it was okay and I understood, so we went with a 2nd design. I could tell she was getting flustered with me as my appt. was taking forever. We went with a second design but it wasn't at all what I had wanted. You can still see my old gel color on the sides of my nail, the gel already looks chipped by my cuticles and my nails are rough to the touch - all of which I am not used to. I also didn't receive a hand massage which is fine except the first tech I went to did give me one. I am super bummed as I thought I had finally found my new nail salon :("
