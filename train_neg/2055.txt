b'This is not the place to go if you want to have a good conversation - it was so noisy it was difficult to hear (the same can be said for all the restaurants in this group so it wasn\'t a surprise to us, but be forewarned). The tacos are varied and really delicious. My big gripe is the cocktails. I\'m a huge tequila fan so I was excited to try some interesting twists. My first cocktail was supposed to be "spicy" and it barely had any heat. If you\'re adding jalapeno to a drink don\'t be timid. My second drink was, according to the server, not going to be too sweet but it was so syrupy I couldn\'t finish it. A big disappointment, and while we might go back for tacos we definitely won\'t linger over cocktails.'
