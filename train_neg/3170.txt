b'Rated so low based on $260 price tag for 2, when I\'ve had much better overall experiences for less than half the price. Food wasn\'t terrible, as long as you don\'t like pairing wine with dinner. We tried wine that the waitress suggested and literally never tasted the wine due to completely scorched taste buds. A filet that roasts your mouth? I expected to taste a top quality piece of beef nicely complemented by wine. Instead tasted...hot pepper and was that wine? Not sure. It was red but had no chance at coming through after my mouth being blown out by pepper. Weird thing is I like spicy food, this just didn\'t go with a steak. Not up to the hype or the price tag. Apparently Mr. Flay hasn\'t checked in with his "chef" lately.'
