b'This location provides horrible service! I waited in the drive through for over six-seven minutes even though there was only one other car ahead of me. My food was cold (especially the curly fries) leading me to believe that they had prepared my food and then left it sitting while they prepared the order for the car ahead of me. No thanks!'
