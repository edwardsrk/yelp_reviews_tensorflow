b'I took my daughters to Petco recently to consider purchasing a hamster.  My girls were heartbroken as their two year old hamster had died about a week earlier.  An employee was paged to come and assist us.The first thing Stephan said to us was, "Are you going to buy the hamster.?"  I said, "What kind of question is that?"  Stephan said, "Its store policy that we can\'t pull the hamster out unless you are going to buy it."I told Stephan, "We can\'t even see the hamster as he\'s completely concealed in his shelter."  My girls were becoming noticeably upset by his resistant attitude so we left.I called Petco at 888-824-7257 to share our experience.  The person I was speaking to had difficulty understanding me and I had difficulty understanding him due to a language barrier.  I asked him to transfer me to someone more fluent in English.  After waiting on hold for a long time, I hung up.As an American, I don\'t appreciate being outsourced to the Philippines to express concerns here in the United States.  Petco and Stephan would do well to remember the retail adage, "Without the customer you don\'t exist."  As palsrewards members we find this unacceptable and will take our business elsewhere.'
