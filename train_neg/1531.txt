b'My husband and I were to another MedExpress location a week ago for cough, congestion, and fever.  Neither of us were feeling much improved today, and went to this location, as it is closer for us, to see what else could be done.  They seemed dumbfounded as to why we were both sick, and sent my husband on his way with Flonase, and me with Flonase and a bronchial inhaler commonly prescribed for asthma, which I do NOT have.  Dr. Demko literally told me she didn\'t know why I was still coughing...that the medications I received the week before should have "fixed it".  The other location (Washington) had done a chest X-ray on my husband, and a nebulizer treatment, yet missed the fact he has pneumonia.  This was discovered only after we went directly from MedExpress to another healthcare provider.  That provider concurred with MedExpress on our need for the Flonase for the nasal congestion and drip, but could not understand HOW they missed his pneumonia or did not do ANY testing on me whatsoever.'
