b"Worst customer service by the staff and the supervisor. This is the 3rd time we went to the DMV and we have all the proof of the documents between the insurance and the car. Long story short, the supervisor wants another proof to be printed out even though we have these 28 pgs attachment from the insurance. The lady who helped us her name is Dominique.  The supervisor who didn't even waste her breath on us should not be working there. I guess people who worked there for too long are grumpy and hate their life!"
