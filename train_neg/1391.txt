b'I have taken my car here a few times now and have been pretty unhappy with the service. The first time I took it in for an oil change and everything was good. The second time I took it in to get my tires rotated and I came home to see that my hub cap had fallen off. Luckily it fell off in the parking lot at Firestone so I was able to get it back. The next time I came back to get my AC fixed. I had them run all of the tests to see what was wrong. They said it was "possibly" the compressor, but they weren\'t sure. They said I for sure needed the freon evacuated. They did that and had me come pick up my car and said the AC was fixed ($300 later). I drove off and the AC did NOT work! I brought it back and they looked at it again and said it was the compressor which would be another $600 to fix. I don\'t understand why they would send me away saying it was fixed! There goes $300 down the drain!'
