b'My review is based on my experience with the management, not the food. The food is just ok, nothing to write home about. Secret pizza at Cosmo is better.The manager on duty failed to do his duties when I requested him to call security to come assist me when I was being harassed by a drunk belligerent man while in line. I felt unsafe and wanted security to come but the manager NEVER CALLED them. He in fact lied to me saying that they were too busy to assist me. I spoke to security later on that night and they told me they never received a call. SHAME ON YOU manager on duty Sunday 1:30AM for lying about calling security.'
