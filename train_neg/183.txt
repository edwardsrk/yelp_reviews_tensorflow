b"Dropped in on a Saturday night....thankfully prior to the rush beginning. We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc. We will not go back"
