b"This club is by far the worst in town. Bouncers have no manners, treat people with no respect. They forget that they're there to help customers, not to give attitudes. Dress code policies seems to be very random. One day you're allowed in with this outfit, that shoes, the next day you're not. We all left because one of our friends were refused of entry by the same outfit that he wore the week before, and he was able to enter with that same outfit the week before. Cover is $20 after a certain time, and IT IS NOT WORTH OF YOUR MONEY. I repeat, NOT WORTH OF YOUR MONEY."
