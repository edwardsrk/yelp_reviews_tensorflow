b'I like panda express, and I like this new layout. However if I\'m going to eat somewhere I want to ne treated a certain way. I\'m buying THEIR food with MY money. I can easily go to a different location. Fix the staff attitude please. "they\'re high schoolers" is no excuse. There is still a professional standard everyone has to follow. Get a shift manager that makes sure the restaurant is running smoothly and everyone is treated with the respect they should be given. Don\'t gossip the entire time.'
