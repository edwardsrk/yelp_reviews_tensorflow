b'On our way cross country we decided to stop and get one of our favorites ~ a 23 Skidoo. We have been stopping into the Sugar Bowl for YEARS on our travels to the Scottsdale area. We were sooooo disappointed. It is not the same. The restaurant itself was dirty, paper on the floor, customers standing around without anyone greeting them.A 23 Skidoo is (was) one of my all time favorite ice cream treats. The wonderful chocolate coffee syrup was nothing like it was. in fact, it was like coffee had simply been poured in the middle with one scoop of ice cream on the bottom and one scoop above the coffee (see my picture of the 23 skidoo). The glass was sticky from where ice cream hands had handled it. When I asked about why the difference, our waitress responded with, "we have knew people we\'re training and everyone makes it different." I ask our waitress to bring me some chocolate syrup ~ it never came. She said she asked another wait staff to bring it over. Umm, if you are a waitress waiting on a customer you respond directly and then follow up with our customers. Perhaps more customer service training is needed. I also ordered the tea sandwiches which is a combination of 3 triangle tea sandwiches; egg salad, tuna salad and corn beef salad. The bread was dry as if the sandwich had been made up and left out until someone else ordered the same sandwiches. This restaurant is in a prime location in Old Scottsdale ~ it is incredibly sad to watch this \'50 style diner show they do not care about their customers/restaurant like it use to.'
