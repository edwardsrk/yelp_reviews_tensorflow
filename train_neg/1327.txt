b"Make no mistake, this restaurant does not serve dim sum in the evenings.. We went there and ordered three dishes the lemon chicken, beef with green pepper in black bean sauce, and a house fried rice after waiting approximately 25 minutes we asked the waiter what was taking so long and it was obvious that somebody had screwed up in the kitchen and we didn't get our order. So we just got up and left. For such a fancy looking place they really can't step up when it comes to serving dishes on time. Also this place is very expensive. For a simple house rice it would have cost almost 20 bucks. In a way, their screw up was technically a blessing in disguise for us as we went elsewhere."
