b'The young woman working the drive-up was incredibly slow tonight. She only had one speed. She tried to look busy by walking to various points behind the counter but always came up empty handed.  And I caught her looking at her phone.The guy who was maybe the manager also wandered around behind the counter.Meanwhile, the cars are stacking up behind me.I think they were hoping that people would give up and drive off.The food was actually good.'
