b"Went here last night had 2 appis, and 2 entrees. The appis were booth sub par. The fish tacos had no flavor at all! The texture was fresh but nothing more. My girl had salt and pepper wing and they were not very good. We couldn't put our fingers on it maybe it was the non granular salt, or the fact that they felt like they had too much skin. Entrees were good we had the prime dip, and the duke burger. The prime dip looked good and came with a strip of really good candied bacon. I had the duke burger with a side salad. The dressing for the side salad was almost in edible, but the burger was amazing! The burger is the 1 extra star out of this meal."
