b"I have been shopping at Smiths since I moved to Las Vegas. Recently, I've noticed the quality of fruits and vegetables were not top quality. I can't tell you how many onions and potatoes I've had to throw out after only a few days. I know not to store them together. The last time I bought onions I purchased them separately,( because I noticed the bagged onions and potatoes ALWAYS had one rotten piece in them, which makes the rest go rotten). Not two days later, the onions were completely black with some type of mold. It's not just root vegetables either. I bought cucumbers that I put into the crisper in my fridge. Couple days later I went to grab it and it was mush. So now this brings me to this. A couple of weeks ago, ( I just had no time to post this until today), I bought a family pack bone in pork chops. I brought them home to divide into portions. When I opened the cellophane, the smell was so bad. The chops were green underneath the first layer. My husband took them back and they gave him another pack. I opened them and again pork chops were smelly and green. I'm honestly going to try Albertsons or even Walmart. I probably won't go back."
