b'So this show has been running for 28 years and unfortunately it feels like it. The queens I saw tonight, with the exception of the Cher impersonator, looked old and moved like they were lacking energy. Now I love drag queens. Ever since Paris is burning, I\'ve been hooked. I have a healthy respect for queens who have been in the business for a long time. I know it\'s never too late to teach an old dog be tricks... Also, the show is titled after this famous queen Frank Marino... Where the heck is he? Don\'t have a self titled show if your not going to show up!!!There was so much potential especially with the music choices. But when the Lady gaga impersonator did just dance, that queen just sat there! The song said "just dance"! You better dance! I was doing more dancing sitting in my seat than the guy did in the whole performance!Now the Brian person who hosted the show was hilarious. Every one of his jokes were funny and delivered perfectly. However he was one of the only highlights of the show.I was disappointed. I\'ll have to definitely check out somewhere else if I want to so l see drag queens in Vegas.'
