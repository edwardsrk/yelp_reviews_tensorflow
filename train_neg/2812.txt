b"The outfield fence is very tall when it doesn't need to be; move the wall out and shorten the height.You can't bring in food.  This is the only ballpark I've ever been to where this is the case.  To add to it, the food options once you get inside are very unimaginative.The grass is always half dead, even on opening day.There arn't enough windows for buying day of game tickets / will call.Metal benches are very uncomfortable.  You would think that after 30 years you would eventually upgrade to seats.Don't go on dollar beer night.  The douchebaggery is at sky high levels."
