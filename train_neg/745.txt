b'Let me just begin with I have never been treated so rudely before and I have used plenty of Groupons. I arrived for my 4pm massage to only be told I don\'t have an appointment for you. I then told the lady I made it with you " distinct accent" only fir her to ask my my name and then say I don\'t have a video camera on my phone . I don\'t have repeated my name or (and then said three other names ) so you can reschedule or cancel your groupon. How rude Avoid this place NOONE VALUES YOUR TIME'
