b"I needed a last minute notary for a car title I was selling and I called the branch and spoke to a teller apx 10 minutes before they closed. The teller on the phone was kind and told me to have her hurry and I assured her she'd be there no more than a couple minutes past at the most. She said that was fine. I called them back to let them know she was on her way. My wife walked up at 7 and no one made eye contact with her until 7:01 and they turned her away. They refused to help her, even though the process would've been quick. The notary was apparently with another customer, even though the teller told us that my wife should come in. They were closed.Another customer walked up while they were turning away my wife and they helped that customer. My wife called them on the way home, at 13 minutes after 7pm.. and they were still answering the phones and doing business. But yet, they had my wife rush in to make it before 7 and refused to see her 30 seconds after 7pm. And when my wife complained about it at 7:13pm to the teller still working on the phone, she got hung up on. Take your business to another branch that has the decency to not treat their valued customers so poorly. Customer service at this location was a joke. But had she gotten there 30 seconds prior maybe they would've been kind and professional?"
