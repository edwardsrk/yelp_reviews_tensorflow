b"Overall Experience:The wait staff was inattentive and rude.  Our waitress was at the end of her shift and made several attempts to take plates while we had food in our mouths.  After she left, other servers kept coming over.  It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.I am big fan of Tex-Mex and I really enjoyed the food.  I was looking forward to going here as I have a friend who raves about it.  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience for me and I would not come back and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone beyond saying food is good, service is awful."
