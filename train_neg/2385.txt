b"I ordered a lap top battery from the site and you got a 10% discount to pick up in store. Then I get a call. They don't have the battery and need to look for it. Then I get a call the battery is nowhere in the universe for some reason and they offered my money back. My question is WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU OFFER IT ON THE SITE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BATTERY? What a waste of time."
