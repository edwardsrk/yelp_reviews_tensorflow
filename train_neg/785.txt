b"We been to this restaurant on Sunday . We ordered gobi Manchuria as appetizer which was so salty that we couldn't eat and for main course we ordered malia kofta which had no salt in it then panner butter masala was very sweet and not authentic at all. There was no one to even come and ask how the food is. Worst customer service. People who have babies be aware there is No CHANGING TABLE IN RESTROOM I had to put my baby down on floor to change diaper. We will not be going to this restaurant and I do not recommend this place to anyone."
