b"I wanna like this place more. Fairly priced, good (not great tho) pizza. But the delivery times are sooo bad. Worst I've ever experienced anywhere. They are always and forever late. And for the life of me, I can't understand why they can't keep up. Every other pizza place can have it all done and delivered in an hour. I've even ordered sandwiches and waited for more than an hour and a half! How is the bad delivery the only thing consistent?? Fix it!"
