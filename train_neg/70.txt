b"The menu is too large and they can only make Vietnamese food. We ordered Singapore noodles and vegetable fried rice, neither dish looked or tasted line their name sakes. It looked lime they didn't fry either one.They brought our dishes out one at a time with 15 minutes between each. My wife asked for the Singapore noodles not to be too spicy and they cooked it without curry.We will never come back here."
