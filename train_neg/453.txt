b"Since they started delivery, in-person service has become very hit and miss. I've had 15-20 minute waits for my order, including one situation where they forgot to put the order in, and one where they forgot to give me my completed sandwich for 15 minutes. My most recent visit resulted in a sandwich with what I'd consider to be ingredients-gone-bad. I brought the sandwich down and returned it and felt like the manager in charge at the time was defensive and unhelpful. Since I can no longer trust the food, I have since not been back (nearly two months now). When Byte is good, it's great. But recently there has been more bad days than good, and I hear constant complaints  from co-workers about how good it used to be and how shoddy everything has become. I suspect Byte has been a victim of its own success, and doesn't really have the infrastructure to handle both delivery and in-person pick up. I'm really disappointed. The sandwiches can be really decent, if over-priced. But it's so unpredictable."
