b"So disgusted and disappointed I hate when I feel like I'm being ripped off and I will spread the Word all over so others don't experience my disgust the company I used to book the party bus platinum ride limos apparently just like to rip ppl off and take there money and are the most unprofessional ppl I have  ever dealt with I was late 15 mins from being dropped back off and they charged me an additional $135 which was a full hour fee for services they did not provide once I saw this additional charge on top of all that I spent for there services not to mention leaving the driver a Big Tip outside of all the money spent to basically be dropped off. I called the owner who basically implied that money meant more to him then his customers or future business. I personally will spread this throughout Arizona. DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM.If I could give a negative star I would no need and sending a pretend response on the bottom of the review actting surprised or as if your company had no knowledge of this attempting to make fellow yelpers believe differently because I attempted and spent majority of my morning conversing about this with your company who could careless. No regards or even a comparison to the amount of money spent with your company this past weekend not to mention the future business that would have came from business associates, family and friends. Sad to see people could careless about customer service, dignity, and the good of there so called businesses."
