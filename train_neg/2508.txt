b"I was excited to eat here, due to all the hype of the restaurant.  As I had Saturday brunch here, reservations were no problem.  The food is tasty. I admit.  I had the salmon quesadillas, with salmon roe for appetizers and scrambled eggs with jalapenos and ham.  My only complaint was that they couldn't make my eggs with all egg whites or egg substitute, as the waiter said that the chef would not do it. I would assume that they would try to accommodate with my request, but they didn't. I guess customer satisfaction is not a top priority here."
