b"I've pretty much liked most of the places in NoDa that I've been to, but this place missed the mark. I felt that the waiter was not very attentive at all. There were only 3 other people in the bar area where we were seated. Also there is a little window where you able to see into the kitchen and I noticed that the staff where eating out of this big bowl of fries with their hands. I thought that maybe that was just for the staff when their hungry or swinging by to pick up food. But clearly that is not the case it's the same bowl they serve customers out of, how gross! This was a first and last overall the food was ok."
