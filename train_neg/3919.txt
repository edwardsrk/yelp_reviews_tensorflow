b"I had enormous expectations for this place - with word of mouth and almost 5 star Yelp rating.  I have to admit I was a bit disappointed on my first visit here.  I had the combo plate with 3 meats - burnt ends, ribs and pork belly.  I don't understand the allure of these burnt ends - most of mine were nearly inedible.  It's like reverse Russian roulette - 5 bad bites to each good bite.   The ribs were tasty, but not the best I've ever had.  The pork belly was scraps of dried out meat laced with chunks of fat - pork belly should never ever be dry.  For the sauces, I had the vinegar sauce - hey, it's just vinegar - what up with that?  The mustard sauce was delicious.  On the brighter side, the sweet potato fries were good as were the beans.Hype is scary, scary thing."
