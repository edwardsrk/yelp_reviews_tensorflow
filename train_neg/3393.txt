b"Any place that prices rolls at $20 and pawns off imitation crab is NOT cool in my book.  Very disappointed.  Great service, nice individualized bathrooms and booth seating.  Former China Grill location.  Seaweed salad and miso cod were overly sauced.  Two pieces of toro were $34 and not the best quality.  Haven't ordered or seen a lava cake at any new restaurant in years, so of course I had to order and it tasted like something I could make at home.  Not great.  Everything edible, just really mediocre compared to Yellowtail and everything else on the strip.  Skip!"
