b'About a year ago they destroyed my hair the "hairdresser" spent the whole time watching tv and no time paying attention to my hair it ended up completely uneven and it\'s taken me a year to grow out evenly! Going back they have now destroyed my moms hair! THEY should know what type of hair style fits a persons face shape, they\'re "pros" right? I do not recommend.'
