b'This place is killin\' me! Such a great location and view, but the service is really awful. We\'re locals-this place is a tourist trap. You have to chase the bartenders down for service and then they give you attitude when you do (He even gave us the "be right with you" finger when our neighbors spilled their beer and broke glass). And I\'m talkin\' actually sitting at the bar for drinks and dinner over an hour. The beers are so expensive. And the food isn\'t all that much better and is just meh. Our bill was $150 for 3 beers, one appetizer and 2 entrees plus a microscopic side. The most attention we got was when the bartender was changing shift and wanted us to cash out. So, raise your hand, say hey! and hand over your wallet if you decide to come here.'
