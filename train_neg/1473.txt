b"Weekend hours for this location suck big time ! 10-6 on Saturday and Sunday? Really CVS ? U can't afford to pay for 1 more shift for your pharmacy on the weekends? AND u don't have any signs in the drive thru so we could see where the concrete barrier ends so if u have a low riding sports car like I do u end up hitting the barrier because u CANT SEE where it ends !! Otherwise the staff is awesome, just pissed about the hours and damage to my car !"
