b'I am a makeup JUNKIE! So naturally I have to visit the stores of all my favorite brands. I went to Vegas on a trip and discovered there was a new nyx store. So I come to visit and I walk in, and no greeting. I\'m used to warm welcomes at cosmetic counters/stores. I think the only person who remotely said hi was this pregnant lady and that was toward the end of the experience. There was a young brunette fair skin girl doing makeup and walking past me to grab things and doesn\'t even say a word to me and I had so many questions. Anyway I figure out what I want and I grab it and I walk to the front and there\'s a young African American girl minding her own business. I believe her name is Amanda, as it showed on my receipt. She doesn\'t say a word to me as well. I wanted to look at a gloss but there was no tester so I hand her the live product and ask her if she had a tester for it. She grabs it from me, still no words said to me, checks that there is no tester and then goes to make a tester then hands it to me. Still doesn\'t say anything. I\'m ready to ring up and I let her know I wanted the gloss. Still no words!!! Only thing she said to me this whole interaction was, "your total is $13.14." And that was it. That\'s insane!! Give your job to someone who will appreciate it!!! I would never get away with that kind of service at my job! But maybe the difference is is that I love my job and she doesn\'t. Horrible service and representative for the brand!'
