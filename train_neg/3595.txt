b"I used to take the monorail here just to visit Star Trek:  The Experience.  Since they've shut that down, I really have no reason to return here.    Nothing else about the place really appealed to me at all.  Everytime I've checked their room rates online, they've been quite expensive for a hotel that's not actually on the strip."
