b"I had my sons 3rd birthday party here and the kids enjoyed themselves but the woman owner made it very uncomfortable for everyone. I felt like we were being watched like hawks. And when the balls would come out of the play area she would pick it up to throw it back where it belonged and told the kids they needed to keep the balls in the play area. Its a playground for christ sake. I spoke with the other parents and they too felt very uncomfortable because of this woman owner and workers actions. They charged us $240 for 15 kids which is actually suppose to b for 20 kids but it's a flat rate so we could not get reimbursed for the 5 kids that we didn't have RSVP for. I will never ever go back to this place again. Id rather go to the park where my kids can play freely and I can feel very comfortable."
