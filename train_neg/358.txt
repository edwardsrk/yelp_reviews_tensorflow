b"I booked a FREE OFFER King non-smoking room about 2 months ago. We arrived today at 3pm and were told by the front desk that our room was not ready yet and go come back at 4pm. I asked what time check in is and she said 2pm. She said they were sold out last night and the maids weren't finished cleaning the rooms. So we hung around and went back to the front desk at 4pm. She told us the rooms still weren't ready and to come back at 4:30pm and that the rooms should be done by 5pm. We go back at 4:30 and after waiting around still another 10 mins, we got our room key. We go up to the room and it's a double queen room. We go back down and tell them we booked a king and they said they don't have King rooms because they oversold them and a queen is the only room they have for us. We were furious and asked how could they give away King rooms that we had already booked???!! She said to come back and talk to management in the morning. So we will. So in addition to all that, our toilet doesn't flush and runs constantly. The beds feel like cardboard. Then the noise outside is insanely loud!!! It's 12pm and the music is still thumping. This is crap even if it's free!!! I'd rather pay money for quality! No wonder they beg people to come back!!! We'll never stay here again."
