b'My husband and I went here after stopping at the farmers market. We were seated almost immediately by someone from the kitchen and then completely forgotten. I\'m not sure if the person who seated us shouldn\'t have, but  we sat for about twenty minutes thinking that someone would be over soon, but we finally had to flag down a waitress and ask if someone could take our order. Her reply was, "Well, this isn\'t my table, but I guess I can." We ordered and then waited for probably another 20 minutes. Keep in mind we had ordered nothing that would take this long to cook and the place was not excessively busy. Seems that they had forgotten us again. By the time we finally got our food, my husband and I were very hungry and cranky. The waitress completely forgot to bring me the milk I ordered, but at this point I just wanted to eat and get out of there, so I didn\'t even say anything. When I was finishing up my meal, she finally remembered my milk and apologized. The food was good, but definitely not worth the wait. The wait staff kept apologizing, but it was too little too late. We will not be going back.'
