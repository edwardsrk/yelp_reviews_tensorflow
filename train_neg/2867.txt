b'We stayed here for two nights over a weekend.  The clerks at the front desk were friendly enough.  There was a conference happening, so I was willing to cut them some slack after listening to them deal with some of the attendees.  Checking into our room, first thing we had to do was call room service and order some towels.  The room was adequate; it served our purpose for the weekend as we were seldom in it.  Free wi-fi, but it was slow!  Maybe the conference attendees was using all the bandwidth.  I would venture to say that the housekeeping was problematic.  There were crushed chips in front of the elevator doors on the third floor the entire time we were there.  It was really noticeable as they were the only two elevators that we saw and it seemed like one was out of service most of the weekend.  If that was how the common area was maintained, you had to wonder just how clean the rooms really were.  Exercise room was small, only a few machines.  My wife complained about that.  The husband of another couple actually went across the street to the local mall and paid to use the fitness center there.  In summary, this being a Holiday Inn Conference Centre, I expected more than I received.'
