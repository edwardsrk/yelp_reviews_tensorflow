b'I will give it a 2 for the horrible service I had at the bar. The bar guy didn\'t know s___ about beer or wine. It took him about 5 minutes to even say hi. I asked for "menus" and he gave me the drink menu... after 5 mins. He asked what I wanted... then I asked for the food menu... another 2 mins. then another 10 mins. \'till he asked me about the food. There were only 4 people at the bar an about 15 in the restaurant. Food - I really liked the food and think the $9 app. happy hour is well worth it. Try the Hot stones.'
