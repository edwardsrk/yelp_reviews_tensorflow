b"I took my wife and the girls last night to happy hour at Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was very crowded and loud.  The waitress was not that friendly and started by asking for my i.d. along with my wife's.  I find this somewhat irritating since I am in my mid forties and it is obvious that I am not under age.  We service was good but not exceptional and it matched the food.  Nothing special!  I think if you look around you can find a better deal with better quality food."
