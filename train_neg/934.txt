b"This is the second time coming to this establishment. The first experience was great but the wait was way too long. this time they were busy and did not have enough staff. We got the large beef combo for $90. It wasn't even enough to feed two let alone the 3-4 that was advertised. Overall value for price paid was not worth it at all. Also the service was terrible, how many times do you have to ask for items from the waiters. Is it worth the hype? Probably not."
