b"It was our first time there and we were looking forward to a great meal however we were very disappointed.  If it's your preference, the facade of a trendy hipster restaurant is alive and well, however the menu is very limited and they missed the mark regarding the meal itself. In my opinion our meals were extremely overpriced for what was delivered.  The service was fine and the employees were polite.  I wish them the best of luck but I don't see us going back."
