b"This may be a knock on all trop smoothie shops. When ordering a smoothie they ask you if you want sugar or an artificial sweetener??? How about providing us with better options like agave syrup , stevia, etc? After all, you guys are all about nutrition. Also, why have a refrigerated case next to your cashier stand when it's only 1/4 full of items. Looks extremely cheesy! Come on mr owner, get with it!!"
