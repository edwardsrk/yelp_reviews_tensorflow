b'Somewhat disappointing...WAIT VERY disappointing. I had high hopes for this place. Good location, lots of marketing here and there..but once you walk in...you think "Is it just this??"I roam around the room looking for a secret room that will expand to make the place bigger but alas there is no secret room.It\'s quite small. Hardly anywhere to sit!The only good thing is the music. I really liked the music but with such a tiny dance floor..it\'s just very disappointing.'
