b'Went in for an estimate to add Bluetooth phone capability.  They told me I had an amplifier with optical cables - WRONG.  They told me I had to replace all my speakers - WRONG AGAIN.  Estimate came to $900.  Went to Soundwerks and Sun Valley Stereo.  The Soundwerks guy actually spent the time to remove my stereo to see what I actually had.  Both estimated around $600.'
