b"Went in with the hubby and the kids. We have 4 kids, 2 in high chairs so the 5 min wait was no problem. What was a problem was that the minute I sat down, one of the benches in the front ripped a hole in my previously perfectly fine $50 jeans. I told the hostess who seemed not very concerned and apparently the manager wasn't told as I requested.... After being seated, it took several minutes to get a server, including water to go with the too spicy salsa and beans. We ended up getting several appetizers because of the happy hour special. We had the nachos, mini- chimis, the hatch chili cheese crisp, and the queso dip. Our server seemed very inattentive and not at all helpful. He was not overly friendly, could not keep up with water, and forgot the side of beans we requested for our little ones. ( which means we had to go home and feed them because eventually we just said forget it!) All of the food was mediocre and was barely worth the half off happy hour price. The hatch chili cheese crisp was even too spicy for the hubby who likes spicy food. The chimis were ok, the jalape\xc3\xb1o cream was too thick. The queso was hot, although it tasted like it came out if a can. The nachos were plentiful, but seemed like the beef was not good quality. Overall with the hole in my jeans, the bad, inattentive service, and the mediocre, too-spicy food, we will not be back. I would not recommend this Mexican restaurant. If you want good service, good quality, and good prices, go to Manuel's about 2-3 miles East on McDowell."
