b"We live in mountains Edge so this new location is pretty close. I give 2 stars because every time we have been there (5x now) the bartenders are soo moody, u never know what you're gonna get! We gamble a good amount of money and still get a tab for $60. We are locals, support all local bars and restaurants..but here is a joke. I hate to review poorly but I also hate leaving a place feeling the way we have on multiple occasions."
