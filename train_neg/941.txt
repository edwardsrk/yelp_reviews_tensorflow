b"Just left the concert, it was a wonderful concert. However, I was completely shocked at the staff. First, when I entered I was told to leave my water bottle at the front because it's metal. That being said I brought the water bottle to REFILL. Instead they'd rather you pay 5 dollars for a plastic water bottle. So I left it, as I was asking how they keep track of them I was brushed along in the line.  The security guards seem to have no issue screaming at a man for smoking but if a female was its a invitation to flirt. I wish the venue could have matched the great concert, but I was left with a stolen water bottle and no explanation. I will not be coming back any time soon."
