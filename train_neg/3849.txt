b"Not really what I expected when I booked a hotel under the Hilton name. Sure they use the same bath products, but I've stayed at other Hiltons and the Las Vegas Hilton really needs a facelift. Checking in was easy -- and actually, I enjoyed it lot. The front desk attendant was courteous, talkative and very helpful. Turns out you have to pay a daily fee to enjoy to gym amenities, but since I'm a Hilton Honors member, we was able to get the fee waved. The rooms are just old -- that's the bottom line. The varnish on my bathtub is peeling and the room had a musky smell. Beds are comfortable, but nothing extraordinary. My TV was also not working, and I called to the front desk to send up someone, but they never showed up. After a follow-up call two hours later, the TV technician arrived and said the outlet was blown, and fixed it in two seconds. Restaurant selection is minimal in the hotel -- you have to go to the strip if you want real food and shopping. I had a shrimp and pasta salad from their wine bar in the main lobby - avoid getting it at all costs. The shrimp looked microwaved (multiple times) and there was so much pasta, I started feeling sick after a few bites. Overall, definitely not the WORST hotel I've stayed at, but compared to others in the area, nothing that would make me want to recommend this place."
