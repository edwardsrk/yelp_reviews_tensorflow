b'Awful service!! The floor boards I needed were in reachable, walked around to find help and a group of employees were standing talking, when I asked for assistance with the floor boards they all started at each other as if to say "I\'m not taking it, you take it" after a good 30 seconds of silence, one finally came to help. The board on the top was VERY damaged so I asked for the one below and and the other 3 I needed. The associate did not say ONE WORD to me the entire time!!!! Rude!!Then, I went on to find a ceiling fan adapter kit I asked another associate for help and he stated "I don\'t work in this department, I don\'t know what you\'ll be needing, but I\'ll look" then I asked about the kits and he says "This is all we sell." I had to ASK him to try and find someone in this dept. to assist me and answer the questions I had....Absolutely nuts!!  I will NEVER go back to this location....in fact... I\'ll just go to Lowes!!!'
