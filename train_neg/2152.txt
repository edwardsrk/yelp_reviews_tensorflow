b'This airport is freakishly scary! The food selection is minimal and lacks "traffic" to provide enough interesting people watching moments. The only redeeming quality about this airport would have to be a cheesy photo op with a mic stand located in Concourse C. I would not even wish for my worst enemy to have a layover at CLE; or worse...get stranded...in Cleveland!'
