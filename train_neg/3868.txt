b"Not sure what first caught my eye about this place, but something did.  I'd been wanting to go to this place for awhile now.   I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.  However, seeing as this seems to be a fairly new place, I'm willing to get them a second try when I'm feeling 100%, rather than just 90%."
