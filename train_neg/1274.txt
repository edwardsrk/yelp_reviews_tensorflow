b"If there was a negative star rating, Yellow Cab Pittsburgh would get it. Try negative 5. After calling about 1 hour before the bars closed, we were given a 30-45 minute timetable to wait for the cab. That was fine. But 1 hour later, still no cab. Call back. They 'honestly' told my husband that their timetable was total B.S. & we essentially weren't important enough to receive their 'services.' We were told that they may or may not show up & that we should just wait another 30 minutes & see what happens. Really? By this time it was almost 3:00 am & we were only 9 miles from the city. Thank goodness for family, who just so happened to wake up at 3 am & give us a ride. I will never depend on a company that so blatantly tells untruths to potential customers just to keep them waiting for the possibility of their business. Our business is forever lost & I hope that this never happens to any of my fellow Yelpers. What a horrible feeling, to be stranded."
