b'Cheap but NOT worth it. My bus was delayed by 4 hours. We were left stranded in the dirty bus station without any customer service updating us on our situation. When people started to ask questions staff became aggressive towards the paying customers. Horrendous customer service along with overall transport service. Never again.'
