b"I was at store #1665 and the mechanics on duty recommended that my Serpentine Belts be replaced. Person on duty was P. Garippa. I went to a real mechanic today and they said my belts were fine and the Jiffy Lube people were lying. It seems like a cash grab to me at that store. Very shady. I talked to Justin at the store today and he apologized , but offered nothing else. Something must change at this location.That was my letter to the corporate office. I would never let a Jiffy Lube dude (really, just a minimum wage employee with oil training) touch anything important on my car and now I will never believe another one of these yahoo's. I did spend 45 minutes at a real shop which equals Jiffy Lube wasted my time and I want to be compensated for the idiots you hire that are trying to get money for things that do not need to be fixed.   Take your serpintine belt and shove it boys."
