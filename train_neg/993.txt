b"We booked a non smoking room email earlier in the day thru vegas.com... When arrived we were given a smoked filled room that smelled like crap. The technology exist today that this should never happen.  South Point doesn't care and neither does Vegas.com... All they want is your money.  This is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegas.com again."
