b"My husband and I have gone to this place for a few years now. Definitely noticed that there is either new owners or new cooks. We've always ordered the same thing. Ribeye pho, wonton & bbq pork egg noodle soup & egg rolls. Several months ago I was pregnant and wanted pho. We ordered our usual and we both got sick. My husband has a pretty strong stomach & he was a lot sicker than I was. It's been a while now and we tried them again last week. I had food poisoning for 3 days. We'll never go back again. We like our health."
