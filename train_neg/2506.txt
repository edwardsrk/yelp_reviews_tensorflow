b"We decided to try Vince Neils, not only because we're 80s hair band freaks, but also because there as a great Groupon and it sounded like fun.  The restaurant is in Circus Circus and I wasn't thrilled with that casino.  However, the restaurant itself was generally inviting.  The food was average, the staff response was slow.  It was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The most fun part of the experience was that it was the World Finals of Karaoke.  That was fun and very entertaining.  I was overall happy we tried it because I love new things, but I have had better service, food and experience in Vegas."
