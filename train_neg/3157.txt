b'Delicious grilled meats as always, fun atmosphere as always, just as savory as the original restaurant in Niagara Falls.. Unfortunately if you are in a large party or have been seated for longer than 50 minutes, the service grinds to a slow -almost non-existent- halt. This happened in both Niagara Falls and Toronto, it was not a fluke occurrence, and my friends experienced the same.I will be back for the food once in a while, on an indulgent and patient occasion, but I will not be making a reservation for the consistency in service. I think a big downside is the "built-in" service tip of 10% for parties 6+... which doesn\'t let you tip more OR less, and basically tells the servers to "stop trying" because they are going to get 10% no matter how hard (or not) they try. Grill on, keep the bacon wrapped sirloin coming... But for Brazil\'s sake, don\'t leave the large tables hanging, like your meat-juice soaked skewers.'
