b"It's a solid sushi place with a very convenient location on King Street West.  The service is what makes this place what it is and the people who work here are extremely friendly.  Maki My Way is meant for quick and efficient consumption if you are quickly on the go in my opinion and it is solid.  Used Ritual to order the Spicy Salmon Crunch Roll (8pcs) and the Korean Roll (8pcs).  The spicy salmon crunch roll was alright, nothing special and just the traditional roll you would find anywhere.  The Korean Roll was a bit more unique as it consisted of beef and kim chi to create a different type of taste.  I was expecting more from both rolls I bought, in taste and fulfillment factors.  All in all, the staff are wonderful and are extremely friendly.  Whilst, the food just makes you seem like you're missing something. Nothing special, small portion sizes with prices that don't match and quality that turns you towards another establishment."
