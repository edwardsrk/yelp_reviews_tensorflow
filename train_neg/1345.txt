b'Went to Walmart to get a battery replaced. What was I thinking. I waited over an hour to have my car looked at. I waited in the waiting room which was disgusting. The tv had no reception and the couches they have for their customers were filthy and full of who knows what kind of stains. I expected more from a neighborhood store yet I was disappointed. Never again bad customer service.'
