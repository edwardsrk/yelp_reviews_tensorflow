b'The last time we ordered from this place is took an hour and a half to get our food. We decided to give it another try, we ordered tonight, they said it would be 45 mins-1 hour. THREE HOURS later we call them ( for a second time) and they say the pizza is still at the restaurant, "we got busy, we can\'t help it". I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that\'s been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we\'re less than 5 miles down Durango from them. The food is decent, but we won\'t be ordering from them again. Don\'t waste your time.'
