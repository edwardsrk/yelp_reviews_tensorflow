b"I arrived two hours before the Chris Brown concert to assure that I will get good lawn seats. They said they would open the lawn at 6 but they didn't open it on time, which sucked because it was way too hot. Food and drinks are overpriced. The drink I got was 16.00 - it was delicious but not worth the price. Venue failed to mention that opening acts weren't gonna show up. Concert was supposed to start at 7 but we had to listen to crappy DJ's whose sound system was malfunctioning. Chris Brown came on two and a half hours later. Getting out of the parking lot was hell. Took almost an hour to get out. Park at the end of the lots if you are going to come here for a concert."
