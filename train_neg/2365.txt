b"It's a NICE center bar, but it's still just a center bar.  My friends and I have been here quite a few times, and it's great that there's no cover for a spot that seems very loungy, but the drinks are ridiculously overpriced.  I paid $12 for a Crown Royal & coke, which is more than I paid for the same cocktail at one of Mandalay Bay's clubs.  Pass."
