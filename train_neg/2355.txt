b"I have been to many other Cheesecake Factory locations in the past and they were all amazing.This location has some issues.THE PORTION SIZES ARE SO SMALL! I got stuffed mushrooms and they are usually about the size of quarters or larger. These were the size of dimes and burned. I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame.Great manager, but I won't return. I'll stick with the Chandler Mall."
