b"We tried a lot of items on The Brunch Menu. I would not recommend The Shakshuka or The French Toast. The Shakshuka was terribly seasoned and The French Toast had this off taste my daughter took 2 bites and was done. I would possibly go back to try their normal menu. I've heard good things about the vegan options. But brunch ... no. DJ was awesome food was not."
