b"Called after making a reservation online to change the pick up location to Glendale Airport where were flying in - spoke with a two separate people - neither of whom did their job - no one changed their own internal tracking - waited 45 minutes for no reason even AFTER calling. Did not pick up the car timely - so they just kept charging my account until they did.  These folks don't do customer service-  so if you can avoid it - don't give them business."
