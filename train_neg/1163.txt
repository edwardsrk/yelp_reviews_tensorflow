b"Pretty lousy service, and drinks are small and overpriced. We sat for a good 10 minutes before being acknowledged, we ordered a cocktail for my wife, chips and guacamole, and a Diet Coke for me. When the waiter brought the coco-rita my wife, he spilled part of the drink on the table, he left immediately with the drink tray for other tables, as the flow of my wife's spilled drink spilled off the edge of the table. We were left to scramble for napkins from empty tables to soak up the spill. Her drink started out mostly ice anyway, and she had just a few sips left before it was gone. Just a margarita glass 3/4 full of ice. The guac was ok, the salsa was a dark tomato pasty looking thing, not much flavor. Almost $40 for 1 drink, chips and guac, and a Diet Coke. What a lousy time."
