b'We have stayed at El Cortez 5 times so obviously we liked it. Key word is liked. Bad experience from the moment we arrived. We pulled in to the valet and instead of a hello or welcome the valet stated "I need to see your room key" when I politely informed him we had nor even checked in yet and without a word he took our key and car. Check in process was extremely lengthy, we had booked a Cabana Suite, our first time staying in that part if the hotel. They had no rooms ready and it was after check in time. We finally get our key and head over to our suite. Seriously, it was the saddest excuse for a suite ever. The room was TINY and uncomfortable. The room was dirty and had the worst lighting. There was no where no put your bags so they had to be placed on the already cramped floor. The cabana suites are more expensive then the regular rooms. If you are planning on staying there, don\'t bother upgrading to a suite, you will be quite disappointed. The service on the casino floor was terrible, the worst I\'ve ever experience. I spent about 2 hours gambling at a machine and not once did a waitress come by to offer a beverage. I took notice that they only ask the people playing on tables. This has not been my experience at any other casino, ever. I am sad to say that is probably our last time staying there.'
