b"We will not stay here again. Parking was insane and we we couldn't get valet because we weren't casino members. Other casinos in Vegas we have not had this issue. We had to park way out behind the wheel and cart our items in the heat. The parking garage was conveniently full. We got in and staff was not overly friendly. In the room the hardwood floor was nice but our shower leaked all night and the walls were dingy. We won't stay here again, you get what you pay for in Vegas."
