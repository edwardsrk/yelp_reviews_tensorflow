b'Things have changed since I was last here. They now charge a $9 resort fee... some resort, wtf. FreeWifi but it is weak... I get better WiFi using my Freedom pop hotspot. The included WiFi was the sole reason I chose El Cortez. No poker room. Vintage rooms are above the casino and stairs only, no elevator. The room itself is okay,  but it is located on the edge of Fremont Street.'
