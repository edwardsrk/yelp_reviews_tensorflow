b'This restaurant is so loud inside that one cannot reasonably speak to their dinner companion over the plastic topped booth tables.  The open kitchen adds to the chaos.  We had the sea bass and crabbed stuffed chicken.  Both were dried out and over cooked--possibly pre cooked and put on a warming table.  When I spend $100-150 to go out for dinner, I expect a good ambience, great food, and a full menu.  Except for the service, this restaurant had none of the above.  We suggest other restaurants in this area.'
