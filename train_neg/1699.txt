b"Went there on 8/13/12  Was the worst chicken we ever ate. After our first couple of bites my wife and i looked at each other and both said this chicken doesn't taste right. In fact it tastes like it was spoiled, we just threw the rest away. Was not planning on going back anyway, the service was just as bad as the chicken and its very expensive for what you get considering on those 3 blocks of rainbow there is cane's, Popeye's, albertsons, el pollo loco, and the worst church's. Now I know why its called Church's because you have to pray you don't get sick."
