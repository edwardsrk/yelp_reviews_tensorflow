b"I've heard great things about this restaurant and was so excited to give it a try.  Honestly, I wish I didn't.  I made reservations (highly recommended) and we got there about 10 minutes early.  When we got to the hostess stand to check in, the hostess saw me and didn't even acknowledge me, the girl standing next to her said hi to us and kept looking at the hostess but she was acting like she was busy. She looked like she hated her job and seriously if you're gonna look and act like that to your customers, then get a new job.  After a few minutes the other girl asked us if we had reservations and that's when the hostess looked as us and finally helped us but was being really rude.  We finally got seated, our server was really nice and helpful.  The food was alright, nothing special, I've tasted better.   I got the lobster surf and turf and it was $125, my boyfriend got the prime rib and that was only $45. We also got sides to share and that was alright too.  Overall I don't think I would be coming back here."
