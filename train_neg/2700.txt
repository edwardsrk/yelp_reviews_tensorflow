b"I hate to say this, I just can not recommend this place.  It's nothing wonderful and it is pricey.  Service is great but, for the price of food and drinks, there are SOOOOO many better places to try.  The Jerk Chicken salad was OK, and the Paella was bland.   However; the bowl of strawberry/red pepper gazpacho was the best thing we ate today.  Maybe its hit or miss here but, for me... it's been more MISS.Ill take my business elsewhere... OH and FYI Kaya is part of the Big Burrito restaurant food chain which encompasses my FAVORITE place  MAD MEX !!!  Just not sure why Kaya is so inferior.  So I guess it does not matter if I wont come back to Kaya because Ill still go to Mad Mex every chance I get; ether way, Big Burrito gets my cash."
