b"This place sucks.  If you're going to pay over 10 bucks for a meal consisting of a sandwich, fries, and a drink, it better have actual table service.  This place is a cafeteria style establishment which serves inferior versions of all your favorite deli sandwiches.  I've eaten at this place for lack of alternatives within walking distance of where I worked, but eventually decided that as far as overpriced sandwiches are concerned, Duck and Decanter across the street is a notch above this."
