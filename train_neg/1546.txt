b"Needs better management. Only waited 30 minutes. Cold Tacos.Bathroom very dirty. Don't remove my post. This is the truth. Other people have put bad reviews and you guys take them down. How long has that meat been setting out. Over night but you guys still sell it. How long has the beans been setting there more then 2 hours. The health department should close this place down.You guys are totally gross you guys never wear gloves. And what about the hair in my rice Bowl. The guacamole taste like avocado all of your food has no taste. I nominate this place as the worses Mexican place to eat in Vegas!!!!!!!"
