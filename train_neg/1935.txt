b'The assistant manager Allie was super rude the minute she walked out to inform us of the delay in check in. They kept having us come back and forth to check on and no positive or professional manner of answering our question. She was yelling from the beginning without any word from our mouths. And slamming pens and business cards on the floor while the girl checking us in was laughing in the back. This is so rude when we come here every year with our entire family as a trip. We love the classic ambience of el Cortez but as of today. I feel and know we will never return . It is such a rude and disrespectful hotel employee environment that makes me want to cancel my check in and go somewhere where I would pay a little extra for some quality decent service.'
