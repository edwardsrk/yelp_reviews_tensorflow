b"Let me just start off my saying everytime my girlfriend and I go out together we always get the worst service possible. We came to this restaurant hoping to find good service in a more local restaurant (we both live near GVR). But needless to say we won't be going back. We sat in the lounge area so we could have wine and an app, and when we sat we were greeted almost immediately by a bartender. We ordered wine and a lobster & clam chowder which were both served promptly. This is where it goes downhill. We didn't like the soup (too much bacon), and waited for our server/bartender to check on us so we could send it back for something else. 20 minutes went by (I'm a restaurant manager and timed him), and he never came by. My friend even waved at him from across the room, he looked at her and kept working behind the bar. My friend then asked the hostess to get the manager. Once the manager came over everything was rectified with our food, and she got a different bartender to serve us. She even comped our food (we ordered mac and cheese and she gave us cheesecake), and took the time to listen to our complaint. The other part that sucked was that you pay an automatic 10% entertainment fee for a crappy piano player. Is there a fine dining place for locals, or do we always have to go to the strip??"
