b'We just finished eating here. The food was just fine but the service was so sad. Our waiter was pleasant enough but could not seem to handle more than one table at a time. My son wanted a refill of his soda and practically had to trip another waitress to ask her to get him a soda. Thank god we were able to pay at the table or we might still be there waiting for our check.'
