b'We stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas in the past, but DON"T confuse the LVH with the HILTON! This is no longer the HILTON!! I didn\'t realize this when I made my reservation on Expedia (my mistake). This place is smoky and run down. The first room we were given had broken curtains that would not close. I called the front desk and we were sent to another room several floors down from where we were. This room was clean, but the ceiling had a huge water stain. The carpet also had stains. We kept the Do Not Disturb sign in our door. We didn\'t trust anyone going in our room. The safe was $13 a day to use!!! What??? That\'s ridiculous!! We went to the diner cafe place and it is way overpriced!!!! My husband and I split a $11 bacon and cheese omelet...blah! What happened to the cheap Vegas prices?? Not at this place! We also tried the Vince Neil restaurant (see review..NOT recommended!)  Most of the staff working this hotel and casino had no personality or seemed rude!! I ordered a drink at the bar and I was playing video poker. I noticed a bill in front of me, so I asked the bartender if my drink was comped for playing. He picked up the bill and said, "don\'t you see? what does this say?" RUDE!! The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star is for my winnings of $600, but we do not recommend staying here!'
