b"It's quite sad. But no surprise to why DQ is filing bankruptcy with this kind of service. If you don't want to work around people, don't. But don't take it out on my kids and I because you hate working here. Food made wrong, reminded several times our ice cream order and still got it wrong 3 times. And then got pissed when we asked for the right ones... figure out the simple stuff and the big stuff will take care of itself. Not very complicated to treat people like they matter."
