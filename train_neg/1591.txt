b"Just like Culvers except not as good. Pricey because it's in Scottsdale. Went there for lunch on 3/29/16 got the smoked stack burger and a small shake and it was $13. Went with people from work all 4 of us had stomach issues and felt ill the rest of the day. Save yourself the trouble and go another trendy burger place in Scottsdale than this one. I can think of hundreds."
