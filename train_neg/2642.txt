b"Today was my first time there, the environment and the staff were awesome but my barber (Jordan) was not skilled. To be fair, he didn't not have the proper tools for a 000 cut with a line up. My biggest issue is the price, I got a cut with a goatee line up for a massive $39.95!! WowI was going to go back and try again but my neighborhood barber charges me $20 all in so it's a no brainer. Good luck boys!!"
