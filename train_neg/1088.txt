b'The only thing this place has going for it are the portion sizes. But if the food is gross, than you don\'t really want a lot of it. Had the mixed burrito with chicken. Very little flavor. Got it "wet" and the enchilada sauce tasted like tomato sauce. No flavor. Doesn\'t come with chips or anything. 10 minutes after eating about half I have a terrible stomach ache and have already run to the bathroom twice. I do not recommend.'
