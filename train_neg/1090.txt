b"I've ordered from here several times, and EVERY single time they've gotten the order wrong and tonight they also forgot to deliver the liter of Pepsi. We called and asked for the Pepsi we paid for, and they said they can't deliver one tonight but next time we'd receive a free Pepsi. I said it's not free because we paid for one and didn't receive it and they didn't understand. Don't ever order from here!"
