b'So, we came here a few years ago and had a bad experience with the service and the food. Fast forward to 2012 - we decided to give the Grill another try - it was good. We continued to patronize the Grill and even told friends that we enjoyed it!  Huh, what a HUGE mistake! We went with our neighbors who were VERY reluctant but were willing to try again. To say it was a disaster is being kind. The manager Mike (yes YOU MIKE) was a total jerk. We waited a good hour for our food and my husband who ordered a sirloin burger, got his order WITHOUT the burger!  What a total joke this place is! The manager MIKE (yes YOU MIKE) is a first class worthless idiot!  There are plenty if other good places that would be delighted to have our business!  I felt sorry for the waitress who had to put up with pathetic MIKE (yes YOU MIKE)!Do yourself a favor and patronize somewhere other than the Grill.'
