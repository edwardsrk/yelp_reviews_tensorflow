b"We had done a reservation and no one ever told us that the main street to get to the restaurant was closed for a parade. Drove 45 minutes just to be told by a police officer at a barricade that the road was inaccessible and we needed to park our vehicle 2 kilometers away if we wanted to get to our destination. Tried calling the restaurant but no one ever picked up the call. Some 30 minutes later, on our way back home, some lady called to ask if we were still planing on showing up. I explained what had happened and she didn't bother doing or proposing anything because of their mistake. Bad customer service. Shame on you people. No sense of business relationships. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
