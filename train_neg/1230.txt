b"Brian was the rudest person I've ever delt with especially because I'm a woman. I want an oil change that's all I need. Not new tires I have a new car. He kept trying to up sale me. My car was towed here and they had the keys he kept trying to take the keys to my other car and didn't understand what keys were for what car. He wouldn't listen rolled his eyes and was beyond rude. Then lost my keys for my car. Then acted like using my boyfriends rewards card was illegal. Worst service ever. I was highly recommended here to talk to some one else and won't be returning due to his attitude. Treated me like a pos because he lost my keys that were already there."
