b'The gal who took our order never looked at us and seemed disinterested (at best) in taking our order. I was less than impressed with the customer service!Following the completion of a poor customer survey, I had three contacts about my concerns (two from their corporate offices and one from the location manager). All were very responsive and apologized for the substandard service. I certainly appreciate the commitment to making things right. After a quality response like that, I am willing to give them one more shot at earning my business back.'
