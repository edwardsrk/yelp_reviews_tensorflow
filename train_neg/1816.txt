b"I feel really bad because they are really nice, but the food was not edible. I ordered a ton... wontons (both pork and cream cheese) were chewy and gross, shrimp noodles I couldn't even pick out the shrimp to save, the orange chicken was the most edible.  Nice place! Nice people, but the food needs work"
