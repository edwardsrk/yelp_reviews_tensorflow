b"We came here at 8pm of a Sunday evening.  We've been warned at the reception that they close at 8:30pm.  We said 'Ok' then went in as we can definitely eat for 30 mins.  It's understandable that the kitchen won't be making any fresh food for the buffet 30 mins prior to closing to avoid food wastage.What bothered me most was not the food BUT the service.  Staff at this location seems to be in a hurry to leave by 8:30pm!!!  There was still enough food at the counter (not the sushi rolls counter though) and you will feel as if the staff were trying to hurry you.I've worked in the food industry and when you say that you close at 8:30, it doesn't mean that you stop accepting customers at 8:15 or even at 8:25.  You accommodate those customers as they still bring you income, turning back a party of 6 is a lost income.As for the quality of food, just a mediocre...maybe you should start slashing the price at least 30mins prior to closing to attract more people and avoid food wastage."
