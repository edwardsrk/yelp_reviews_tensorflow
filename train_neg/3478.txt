b"This is a relaxing pool to go to. Girls are free per usual. Guys are only 10 bucks. If you check in on yelp you can get a free admission pass. I went with four girls and one guy, Daniel, so I made him use the yelp offer. Daniel had already paid the ten bucks so I told him to get a refund. When Daniel went to the man in the front, the man was giving so much attitude. This man told Daniel that he had never seen this yelp offer and that he could not honor it... I was watching all this unfold from a distance. So I went up to the worker and told him that the yelp offer should be valid. I mean at this point we didn't care about the admission cost, we were being taken advantage of. So Daniel asked for a manager. The same worker said the manger didn't pick up. We told him we would wait. Finally, the manger came down and he instantly honored the yelp offer. They manager just took down my yelp user id and that was that. The manager was so professional and didn't make a fuss like the other employee. The manager was nonchalant about the mix up and gave us three free drink vouchers."
