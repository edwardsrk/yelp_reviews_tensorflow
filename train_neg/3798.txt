b"The employees here are super nice, friendly and helpful. However, the vendors are basically storing there stuff there for you to look at. Things are way too overpriced. You can't throw a postcard in a cheap walmart frame and ask $9 for it. Its a great store to see history, things that are no longer in use, but if the vendors are truly wanting people to leave with items and spread the beauty of antiques they need to lower the prices and make things a little more affordable."
