b"An absolute joke of a branch. The customer service is extremely poor, especially from one specific teller. I wish I caught her name. I have been a preferred customer for years and my family is seriously considering taking our accounts to another bank altogether. Don't expect to be helped if you don't arrive with plenty of time before they close - because they'll take their time to greet you to ensure that they don't acknowledge you until 7pm and spend time telling you that they can't help you because now it's 7:01pm. I was standing there behind another customer for at least 2 minutes before the open teller (who wasn't helping a customer while I was waiting) even looked at me. I'm pretty sure she was just waiting for the clock to turn 7pm so she could tell me she couldn't help me. Oh - but that same teller still answered the phone and does business over the phone well past 7pm.. probably hoping it's a new customer wanting to open another account for her own commission. But when she realized it was the person she turned away at 7:01pm, she hung up on me. Completely unprofessional."
