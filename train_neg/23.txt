b"I purchased the Groupon and I honestly shouldn't have. I could've painted my nails better at home and saved $30. It was a rush job. The nail polish isn't even covering the full nail on some nails and other nails, the polish covers the entire nail and a lot of skin too. I had to ask her to clean up the nail polish on both my hands and feet. A customer should never have to ask that question, the nail tech should be able to see that themselves and fix it. Well, she cleaned it up... and there is still polish on my skin surrounding my nails. Needless to say, I won't go back."
