b"It used to be that Safeway was VERY customer service friendly and would go out of their way help you. Now they seem to have flipped it and gone out of their way to being rude, offensive and downright UNhelpful. And don't get me started about the long lines at the cash register! Ridiculously clueless and lazy employees. I wish someone from corporate would visit this store for the week and DRAIN THE SWAMP of all the bad employees, and turn it around. This store is a sinking ship and I blame the management. Your customers deserve better than this."
