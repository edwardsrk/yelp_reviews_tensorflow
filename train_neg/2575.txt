b"I'm now convinced this place just isn't worth the hassle anymore. We used the NoWait app, which was fine enough. We arrived and waited another 20 minutes before we were seated. Fine. The reception and service though, are just pretty awful. First of all, we were asked to look on our phones for the menus on their Facebook page because they couldn't get them printed in time. Really? Couldn't even write them down on the chalkboard? Now I have to use my data to look up your menu in your restaurant? Then, you have to literally chase someone down to get any kind of attention, from checking in to getting refills for water or coffee. Even trying to get the check was a process. After a while I was so tired of waiting I just got up to the counter to get charged so we could just finally LEAVE. Oh, and 40 some people for ONE bathroom. Food was alright. My shakshuka was good but my boyfriend's omelette was just...an omelette. Definitely not worth the wait, which was at least 40 minutes. I've been here some 3 times now, and don't think I'm going to subject myself to this nonsense again. Spare yourselves the same and find somewhere else, where the staff will maybe care at least a little bit."
