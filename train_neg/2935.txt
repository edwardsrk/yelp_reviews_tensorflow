b"Customer  service  was rude and had me pull to the back to wait for my food which was no biggie at first.  7 minutes later someone comes out and hands me my food. When I opened my food at work I found about 5 soggy hash browns in a large bag . So I thought ok I get it let's move on to the sandwich and with no surprise at all the sandwich was crap too. Burnt until black on the edges of the chicken, the biscuit  portion was over cooked as well. It's almost like that was the biscuit that's been slow cooking in the back for 2 days. If you're going to pride yourselves on breakfast  foods and coffee at least put some effort into it. I get early mornings suck ,but you don't have to suck too."
