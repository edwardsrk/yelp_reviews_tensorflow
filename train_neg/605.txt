b'If you\'re planning on using the drive-thru, be sure to check your order before you leave. It\'s almost a guarantee that they\'ll forget to put something in there. It\'s annoying. Screw up once out of maybe 10 or 20 times, you\'re human. Screw up my order five times in a row, you obviously don\'t give a rodent\'s derriere about your job. I would think neither does your manager about his. I eventually stopped going to this place and went to the remodeled one on 75th and Encanto. They\'re "open 24 hours" but may as well be closed. I went there for a burger and baked potato around 2 a.m. and first asked for the baked potato. "We stop serving those and chili after 10."  "Can I get a Baconator - Single?" "We stop serving meat after 1." "Then, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?" "We have chicken...um...." "Never mind, then."***Drives off in an late night, unending hunt for food***'
