b'Way too salty. Seriously, even the bread was too salty. The scallop dish was creative but the salt levels ruined it. Super expensive given the very small portions and few ingredients.The service was slow and unattentive. Saw our waitress only twice. The hostess texted that our table was ready but had no idea what table it was and kept us waiting at the counter another 10 minutes to figure it out. The drinks were good. I liked the pink drink.'
