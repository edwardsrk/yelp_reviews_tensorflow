b"So, I Had The Chicken Yakisoba (Chow Mein) I was not impressed at all. Sadly as soon as I took my first bite I knew I wasted my money. Didn't have enough chicken and  the noodles were over cooked the flavor could have been better. Now I'm now saying the place was horrible that's why I gave it two stars not just one. The atmosphere wasn't great either that should have turned me away in the first place but I had a friend that was telling me how good this place was so I gave it a shot. I will not go back"
