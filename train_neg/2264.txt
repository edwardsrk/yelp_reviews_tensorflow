b"I have to be very honest this place was disappointing. I've been to both the other two locations plenty of times and this one is just not up to standard. Food wise, the sushi and the deep fried brie cheese was good. However, everything else was not good. The worst was the raw shrimp because it wasn't fresh. It looked fresh but it wasn't. It was mushy! We ordered the calamari? It was also not good. It's suppose to be deep fried but it was soggy. We asked for them to take it back and they said they can only make a new one because they can't take it off the bill. The service also wasn't as great either.Just go to the other two locations!"
