b'Unfortunately the long wait to talk to a human continues....I have had the mid fortune to have to call them 3 or 4 times over the past few days...and the wait time was upwards of 30 minutes each time which is almost as bad as calling Social Security!!!! When I mention it, they say that the call volumes are heavy.... same answer as I received last year... management .... hello... help your people! I wonder how the managers or owners would like to be on hold for that long when they needed assistance from another provider ???'
