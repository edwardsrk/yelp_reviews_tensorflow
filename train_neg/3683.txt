b"Sigh...I used to eat here 3 times a week. It is no longer great food; it's not even good anymore. The flavors are different. The food doesn't seem freshly cooked, just reheated. The food is more grey/brown in color.  I'm not sure if it went downhill do to the Persis competition a block over from here or if it's new management. They don't even bother to give you diced onions anymore; they are just huge wedges now. I'd pass on the naan. The other reviewer also mentioned the sweet korma. It's quite off putting. The mango lassi is bright orange, clearly not fresh and the samosa was so unappealing as to be inedible. RIP."
