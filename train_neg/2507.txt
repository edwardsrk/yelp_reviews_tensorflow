b'If I could do 2 1/2 stars I would-because the people were very friendly and the salad was amazing. But for the money, that\'s about it. I went about 3:30pm, and I know that\'s an "in-between" time, but there was only 1 other table seated, they had eaten already (if they did) and was still there when I left.I saw the sign, and since I enjoy Pappadeaux, but it\'s so far- I was game.You walk up and order, I was looking for creole or cajun food, then asked re: Shrimp Ettoufee-which is a tricky dish I guess, but a good test run.He said oh yes! So I ordered it. It came with a super delicious salad and rice. I just had water, and it was very good and cold and served in a canning jar-nice portion. Ok...so far so good. The salad was soooo good-it was very fresh, diverse and delicious! I had the Creole ranch dressing-which I liked a lot. PLUS!Then after a bit of a wait the Ettoufee arrived. It looked a bit different, but there was a lot of the brown gravy (it was clear though-kinda weird). The shrimp were pretty small, maybe a "small-medium" size, which were really one bite each. There were enough not to feel cheated, not enough to feel you could have a shrimp with every bite (I cut them in half to try).The shrimp were not overcooked-a plus. But the gravy? It was...BLAND! If there was ANY spice in it at all...well, there couldn\'t have been! I did not order it bland, nor did he ask. I have had it several times in different states, and I have had worse and I have had much better too. It was like eating...shrimp in brown gravy. Period. Cajun? NO WAY.Hmmm..The bread was pretty good though. The rice was nicely done. BUT THE ETTOUFFEE!  UGH.At  $16.00 (+ tip in jar) for lunch, I can not justify this.  Maybe that\'s why it\'s basically vacant when it opened back in December-I looked. Too bad-we NEED some cuisine cultural diversity in this city! This AIN\'T it...'
