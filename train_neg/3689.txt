b'I road my motorcycle to the theater and after buying a ticket, I was informed that I had to leave my helmet and gear at guest services.  According to the representative,"My helmet is a safety hazard to other viewers".  I can\'t fathom the logic and I wasn\'t about to leave my prized gear behind.  Luckily I was able to get my money back.  Looks like I will need to find a theater with some common sense.'
