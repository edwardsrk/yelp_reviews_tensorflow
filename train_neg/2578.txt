b"Don't know why this place is so popular,very average food at best and OVER PRICED.You can get far better quality at Portillos.They don't even offer Italian beef sandwiches.I really wanted to like this place but by Chicago Standards it is sub-par ! Skinny winners,uninspired hamburgers,I have ate here four times,not worth the drive.I can't believe people give this place 5 stars,makes me wonder where they normally dine."
