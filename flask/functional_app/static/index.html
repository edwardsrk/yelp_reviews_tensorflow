              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

          While this model was originally designed to disambiguate three star reviews it can be used on just about anything. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This model is designed to classify a user review for a good or service as either positive or negative. It does this by taking in a written review, cleaning the data, then pulling out important words or features which are weighted more to one classification or the other.

        <p>
          Please type a review into the text box and hit the big blue Predict! button to get your prediction.
