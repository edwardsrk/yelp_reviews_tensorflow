b"This tiny shop is located in the Golden Nugget lobby and has nice-looking displays and a huge nugget of chocolate you can spot from a distance. The only thing that's different about Chocolate Box is the Golden Nugget branded chocolate bars you can buy as gifts and souvenirs. Other than that, many items are standard and you can get at other stores. In their glass display at the counter, they have truffles, cupcakes and macarons. In addition to chocolate, they had gummy candies-with their store label-nothing to write home about. They also have ice cream and I was so excited to try some but it was outright nasty. There are only 4 flavors available and the texture was grainy and not smooth at all. Taste was alright but it was also melting as soon as I got it. They also had candied apples that looked amazing but for $10 a pop and after my ice cream experience, I passed. A clearance section is also offered for of course the items that will go bad within the next few months. The concept is great but execution is subpar. Customer service was ok but I probably won't stop back in."
