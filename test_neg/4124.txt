b"First time here getting a mani+pedi. I liked that I was seated right away upon arriving, and everything seemed to be going quite well. This was until I noticed a few of my nails formed bubbles as they were drying. I asked the person  to see if she could fix them, and she said she would maybe 30 minutes later.It definitely would have been nice to have gotten this taken care of right away. Waiting 30 minutes/longer for her to redo nails and then extra for them to dry. Not very considerate towards paying customers.Won't be returning."
