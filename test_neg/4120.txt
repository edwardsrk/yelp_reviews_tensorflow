b'I am very disappointed in the new place.  The setting is perfect and sets up this feeling for an amazing experience, then you get your food.  I have eaten at the original location many times and have always had great food.  I think this is a classic situation where the company has grown and something had to be sacrificed (quality).  Our party had three people in it and we ordered different items.  Veggie burger, rueben, and the courtyard club.  All warm food was cold and the club was poorly built with stale bread (bacon was amazing).  The sides were fruit, frys (cold and greasy),and potato salad  (very good).  For the history I have with this place i just would expect better.  Manager was not helpful, had no answer other than he would check on the kitchen staff.  Hopefully he does so your meal will be acceptable.'
