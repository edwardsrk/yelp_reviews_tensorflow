b"Came here on a Thursday night maybe like 15 mins before they closed. The service was super slow and my friend and I waited like half an hour just for bubble tea...Maybe we just came at a bad time but it took way too long. I decided to try the mango smoothie for the first time. I got 30% sugar as I do with all my drinks. They don't even use real mango, I saw them pump in mango syrup lol. This drink also contains one of those little yakult drinks, then it's just a ton of ice and like a cup of milk. Taste is like artificial mango. Ya not getting this specific drink again. My go-to for coco is usually the regular milk tea with pearls since you can't really go wrong with that (unless they mess up the tapioca or add too much water). The black tea they use is nice and strong and the drink is quite rich."
