b"First time I went it was really great. Second time was awful. Second time I got a full set with gel and art. First as she is applying the tips I notice one of them is very crooked, I point it out she tells me don't worry I can fix it. So I point it out again when she applied the acrylic and she acts surprised and then has to file like hell and makes it so uneven. It was bad. Then she applied so many coats of gel my nails were a thick hot mess. When I complained about two of them looking awful she got mad. 4 hours including a pedi. And my nails were a wreck.Two days after I had them done 3 nails came clean off while I was at work. How does a brand new set just fall off?I called and asked for a refund, was told no problem. They called me the next day to do the refund to my card that was 3 days ago and still no refund.They lost my business. Also just an FYI:Any place that charges extra for the manicure part of a gel manicure should be suspect."
