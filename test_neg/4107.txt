b'Been coming here since they reopened! At first service was decent but it been on the decline slowly ever since ! Always running out of one thin or another today it was steak and spinach ! Now service is shabby at best sorry to say since I do support local businesses! This is how businesses fail ! You need to step it up because me personally today might be the last time I eat at this restaurant !'
