b"First of all, I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  I was not offered a menu, but saw the order forms in front of me.  Initially was going to order a burger and a shake, but without a menu, figured you couldn't get shakes at the bar, so I just ordered a coke and burger and fries.I ordered my burger pink, with romaine lettuce, tomatoes,grilled onions, and bbq sauce.  The burger was TASTELESS.  Onions were non existent, as was the bbq sauce.  Fries were average. Got a refill on my coke without asking, then was offered a milk shake as a dessert (why oh why didn't I get a menu at all though?).  Don't know what the attraction of this place is.....personally when you walk in and stare at this big walk in freezer staring at you, you figure it is going to be reheated, microwaved crap.  These people figured out how to make it look nice, but it is a far cry from the burgers at the Squirrel Hill Cafe or Tessaros.  Not impressed.And I would hide that walk in cooler if I was designing the room, especially if what I want to eat is FRESH food, not FROZEN."
