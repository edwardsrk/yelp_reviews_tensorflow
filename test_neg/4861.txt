b"Had high hopes for this place, but I was totally let down. First off, got a pitcher of sangria for $50 that was well overpriced. Next ordered about $120 worth of sushi and was so small I fit it all in one frame. Their sushi orders are only one piece instead of 2. It honestly wasn't that good. Kinda bland. I will totally tell people to avoid this Disneyland style price rape."
