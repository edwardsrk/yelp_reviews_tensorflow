b"We came in and ordered two chocolate shakes, two vanilla and a chocolate blended. I was really not impressed. The chocolate just lacked flavor and my blended was barely half full... if that, and I'm talking below the clear bubble cover too. Even though we ate them inside the shake was just a complete liquid mess. My son finished half of his and didn't want any more. We thought this place would deliver a quality product, but honestly Culvers is better and like half the price. If we do come back we definitely won't have the same thing. Maybe thier Italian icees are better? But we are used to NY style icees, which are much creamier, so afraid to try it. Either way this was disappointing...even to my kids."
