b"I wish they had better management, because the food itself is decent. I used to work close to a different pei Wei and loved it. This one is within walking distance, but after giving it MANY attempts I'm going to drive to the other one, or satisfy my pad thai craving elsewhere.Never has it been an issue to have sweet and sour sauce with my egg roll, here, they charge you for it. Their fried rice is always white rice poorly fried, so you have globs of white rice and 1/4 fried rice. They don't even put silverwear in your to go bag...this place needs a big management change if it wants to make money at this location, or people will continue to boycott it, or drive to a different pei Wei location 8min away...**Update ** Contacted pei wei corporate office to tell them about the bad food preparation and service at this location and they gave me a gift card to try again. They got a star back for the customer service at the corporate office."
