b'Melonheads is 5-stars in several departments:  friendly service, decor (brightly decorated salon with character chairs including Thomas), free photo and certificate for the first haircut, free hair accessory and glitter hairspray and most importantly to my little one - free lollipop at the end.However, the quality of the haircut is where it falls to 1-star.  I know, they\'re toddlers and don\'t need perfectly coifed styles.  I\'m not one of *those* moms who will cry "They ruined her hair, just ruined it!".  But I think the hair cut should still be quality - one that is not uneven and looks like I took a bowl to her head and trimmed around it.  I had to do some of my own maintenance and trimming of longer pieces when we got home.'
