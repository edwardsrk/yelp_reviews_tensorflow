b"Usually have good confort food...but last night, not so much. The tomatoes in the salad were dirty, the soup which is usually great, the tortellini was disintegrating. Got the chicken fried steak...which I've had their before and it was excellent, but this time was served with sausage gravy? The mashed potatoes had an unidentified  object that seemed to resemble a watermelon seed. There was one in my potatoes and husbands. At this I point was done."
