b"I was huge starbucks fan until I ran into the starbucks at Gate C. One of the baristas there was extremely rude. She tried to pick an argument with me- All I was doing at that time was addressing my concerns about the drink I ordered because she kept saying the wrong name of the actual drink. She kept blaming me for what I had ordered and was extremely stubborn. One of the other baristas there stopped her, and offered to make a new drink for me but I still left feeling very upset. This ruined the brand name Starbucks for me. They made me feel like there was something wrong with addressing my concern. Starbucks baristas are usually very nice- believe me I've been all over the world but this starbucks in particular for some reason was very off."
