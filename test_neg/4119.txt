b'I hate to give this review but I think I have to... We went there on the day Steelers are playing the Broncos. We were there around 9 and there was a long line.. My friends and I always thought the long lines mean good things.. Boy we were wrong.. Half of us ordered the steak and eggs and it was the most disgusting steak I had, Bland... Not cooked to what I asked... My eggs had all sorts of black residue.. The bread came after 10 minutes of giving us our meal... Customer service was okay....'
