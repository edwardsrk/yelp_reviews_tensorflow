b'I\'ve been looking forward to trying this bakery for a while now, and today I finally did.  I expected the cupcakes to be expensive, but I was still bowled over by the $3.50 price for a single, very average sized cake.  The selection was pretty good - everything from the standard chocolate and red velvet to peanut butter and cherry.  I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation, which had coconut and a pineapple filling.  I purchased my cupcake and took it back to the office with me to enjoy.I was impressed by the packaging, and I suspect that\'s where the bulk of my $3.50 (plus tax) went.  The plan white cube had an interior cupcake tray so the cupcake wouldn\'t go sloshing around.  It was a nice touch.  I just finished eating my afternoon treat, and here are my thoughts:- Average size- Heavy, but that\'s due to the huge amount of very heavy frosting- The consistency of the cake was very nice - not dry, not too dense, just right- The coconut flakes in the cake itself was a very nice and unexpected treat.- I expected the cake to be coconut flavored, but it wasn\'t - it was just a white cake.- The pineapple filling had absolutely no flavor aside from "sweet"- Way too much frosting.  The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided.- The frosting itself was way too dense.  I was able to pick it up and break off a piece without it getting messy or falling apart.I really, really wanted to love Cupcakes by Design and would have gladly paid $3.50 for a really spectacular cupcake, especially when the flavor selection is really unique, but I can\'t imagine I\'ll ever go back unless their prices drop by a couple bucks.'
