b'I go hard at Sephora...usually the Walnut St. location but Ross Park is more convenient.  I go there 2x/month and spend 200-500 each visit (I know thats awful). You\'d figure at this point I\'d be able to get some friggin\' help from the sales GIRLS, but no.The only reason I go back to this location is because of the sales GUY. I don\'t know his name, but he has a shaved head with a spider tattoo and is AWESOME. Every time I\'m there, he remembers me, my skin type, what we\'ve gotten in the past and what I need. He spends times with me...he doesn\'t hawk over me and bug me. He\'s SO MUCH more knowledgeable than the other girls there who are just plain RUDE. I went there yesterday and unfortunately my guy wasn\'t there.  I asked for help, and told the girl I wanted to try a new primer. She pointed at one, and while I was checking it out, I told her that I needed some new eye contour palettes and needed help picking one out. But, she had already walked away. Weird...? I continued looking at palettes my damn self, couldn\'t pick one out, so I said screw it I\'ll just get them all. I picked up a basket and threw 3 palettes in. The SECOND these birds saw me pick up 3 palettes they all stopped their little side convo and came hopping on over "can I help you" "would you like me to hold these at the register for you" blah blah blah...oh NOW you all are interested in helping me? When a minute ago you wouldn\'t even help me pick out a primer? I see you, ladies....I continued, on my own, and took all of my product related questions to you tube. When I was finished about 90 minutes later I took my basket to check out. There was a laminated Sephora slip in my basket...I know exactly what this is...but I didn\'t put it there. When someone helps you pick out products, they give you their card with their ID and a barcode on it. This helps them "keep track" of who helped us pick out products. NO ONE helped me pick out anything. One of these girls actually slipped their card into my basket wanting credit for my purchases. How disgusting is that!!!!From now on, I\'ll be calling ahead to see if the gentleman employee is there. Otherwise, no thanks.Sephora, if you read these, you need to make this kid a manager or something (if he isn\'t already) and do some serious training/revamping. Judging by these reviews, I\'m not the only person who thinks these girls are rude and only interested in commission, not actually helping the customer. I am so grossed out that some creep got credit for 300 bucks worth of goods. Transfer it to the guy, he\'s the only one who deserves it!'
