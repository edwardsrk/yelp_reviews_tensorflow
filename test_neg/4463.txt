b"The sandwiches here are filling. I like the cole-slaw because it's made with oil and vinegar, and not mayonnaise. There's really nothing else to write home about. The meat is decent, but the fries on the sandwich are somewhat soggy. The fries and bread have the same texture, and so it's kind of the same consistency throughout most of the sandwich. Maybe if the fries were a little crispier it'd taste better, but that's just a hypothetical. A sandwich is about 7 bucks and certainly is filling, yet it's not all that palatable. I think it's mostly name recognition at this point."
