b"My order here arrived fast and was passable but it just felt so slapped together. Really not good quality Chinese food. It's Americanized so much it hardly has any flavor or anything very good about it. I'm gonna say if you're ordering delivery, for me I'd pick another place around here. There are so many that are better than here."
