b'Very average breakfast food. Everything came out quickly, but for a place that\'s based around breakfast I would expect a little more. I had 3 eggs, bacon, hash browns and wheat toast. I ordered the eggs over medium and they were slightly runny. Bacon ordered crispy and it was slightly chewy. Hash browns were cooked ok a tad under seasoned and then there was the bread, Jesus Christ it was the size of a phone book. Coffee was normal weak crappy diner style coffee. If you\'ve ever been to a place where you walked away thinking "I could easily make this at home" this would be the place for that...Our server was very nice and attentive on the upside.'
