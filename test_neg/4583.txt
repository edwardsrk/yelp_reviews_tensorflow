b"Was really looking forward to it. Had dinner there last night. The food was okay but the a/c must have been broken because it was brutally hot there, resulting in us leaving after the first round of apps.  I have eaten at Cure twice and now Morcilla and two of the three times it was uncomfortably hot.  I don't know if I just hit it wrong or they are just not appreciating that the experience is as much about the comfort as it is the food. Don't think we'll be back."
