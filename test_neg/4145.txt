b"Bad service. Had been looking forward to try Pappy Van Winkle for months. When I went to order the waitress acted like I couldn't afford it. Insulted I still tried to order then she went to check and said it was out of stock. So I just ordered one of their mixed cocktails which tasted like any other."
