b'First off the order taker messed up my order. I didn\'t pay much attention when I first paid but after I looked at my slip. Although no way should have it been a mix-up because when I said "Mac Jr" that sounds nowhere near a Grand Mac which is what I was charged for.Anyway fixed that without much trouble.Then the lady calls out order 394, which was my cancelled order, however she really wanted to say 393, the order before mine. I don\'t know how you mix that up (orders not at all similar). She then calls out 394 again but this time it has the Grand Mac on it. I informed her of the mistake and she fairly quickly turned around and got the Mac Jr on there. However she rudely set the tray down, and oh by the way, no apology.Most McDonalds I\'ve been to have improved customer service, this one has a way to go there.One additional thing though is the fries were undercooked compared to other McDonalds. They were barely cooked. They tasted ok, but not cooked the way I usually see them, usually a little darker colored than these.So I think I\'ll skip this McDonalds in the future - though I have actually rarely gone there anyway but now have a reason to avoid them.'
