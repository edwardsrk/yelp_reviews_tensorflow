b'My emergency room visit was fine, although it took two nurses to start and IV and several needle pokes. I am here to talk about their billing department. I received a CT scan because I had a serious headache (probably the worst I\'ve ever had). When I left I told I would receive a bill in the mail. I received this bill shortly after and paid it (it was for $125). Now, FOUR months later, I receive a $493 bill for the CT scan on a paper that states I have no insurance information on file. I called the Dignity Health billing department number, but can\'t get a hold of anyone because their automated system asks you to input your phone number, but again my phone number was "not on file". I checked the hospital website and apparently  everything is billed separately and everything is contracted out, including radiology. I was not told this upon leaving the hospital and am irritated my insurance information was not passed along to the imaging company. This whole billing thing kind of feels like a scam and wouldn\'t recommend going here unless you want to be lied to about the billing process.'
