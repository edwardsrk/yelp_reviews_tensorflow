b"The bar looked great and they had some rocking live music but it was too packed to get in to so we had to take a seat in the restaurant. The decor was nice and it was great that the doors opened up on to the patio. They should crack down on smokers right outside though because the smoke blowing in is like eating at a smokers house--gross! The drinks were ok. Nothing special and they featured a big like up of slushy drinks. I was hoping for a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned but they were not to be found. My friend ordered off menu for a whisky sour but it came in a mason jar and looked radioactive yellow. I had a sangria which was good and a Hendricks with tonic (hard to mess that up). The food was unimpressive. The thin crust pizza was disappointing with a soggy crust and light on the toppings. The risotto balls were dry and tasteless rather than the delicious cheesy molten goo I was hoping for and even the flavourful tomato sauce with chorizo and capers couldn't revive it. The only good thing about the food was how fast it came out.The service was good and our server was friendly and accommodating."
