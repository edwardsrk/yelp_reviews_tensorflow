b'Two stars only because the wine was great, though we waited an incredible 35 minutes for it to arrive at our table and it was the first thing that did arrive, but not the first to take a long time. The server seemed nice, though ill informed and overburdened with customers. The owner was flitting about, not being overhelpful and scantily dressed. Is it wrong to have something like a uniform in a restaurant these days or at least dress like you have some kind of pride in what you do? To pay 125$ for a bottle of wine and ROOM TEMP oysters, cool fried cat tails, sad sad sad greens, a few pieces of duck breast and some unidentifiable deep fried stuff( best thing we ate) is a bit scandalous I think. It took an astounding 40 minutes after our ordering for the food to arrive in the sad state it did, the temperature suggested perhaps it was ready and waiting 10 minutes before.The general vibe is one of confusion and frankly I cannot imagine ever going back, shameful as I found the concept intriguing and inspiring.'
