b"Not sure what they're going for here.  Looks like a night club, tables all have a mix match of goodwill type chairs.  Large tanks on the wall with some impressive live fish and shellfish.   Too bad it's dark and not displayed as it could be.Seafood dishes are ok, but found I was picking at little bits if lobster and crab, to get it out of the shells.  Just overcooked and over battered."
