b"I'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place. The wait staff was nice - that's the only reason I gave then two stars instead of one. We should have known to skip this place when we saw the cheesy plastic sign and neon logo, but we decided to give it a chance. Our waitress asked if we wanted to sit somewhere quiet or not (which was considerate), but when we said we'd like a quiet spot, we ended up gitting a table right next to some annoying doorbell thing that gave three loud beeps every time someone walked into or out of the door, so we asked to be moved. We were also given lunch instead of dinner menus, so we had to ask for the right menus. When we finally ordered and got our food, the quantity and price looked okay, but the quality was seriously lacking. The duck in the duck spring roll seemed to be prepared well, but there were none of the other subtle ingredients and flavors that one would expect - no rice noodles, carrots, mint, basil, ect. - just iceberg lettuce and cucumber! And the dipping sauce was overly thick, way too sweet and tasted like something that came out of a jar. The wonton soup broth was bland and oily, and the wontons were okay but tasted like something I could get out of a box from the frozen section of a store. The pineapple fried rice was okay, but didn't have as much chicken or pineapple as we would have expected, the chicken was a bit dry and again - none of the subtle flavors that we're used to in this dish that make it so tasty - cilantro, raisins, cashews, ect. The beef rendeng was terrible - a pile of beef bits in a disgusting looking sauce with a side of unseasoned brocoli and cold canned pineapple. The sauce actually had a decent flavor, but it looked so unappetizing and the beef was so dry that I sent it back. The waiter took the amount of the bill, so we were grateful for that."
