b'My friend and I chose this company for a Hoover Dam tour.  There were two options. Option 1. The Hoover Dam Tour only. Option 2. The Hoover Dam Tour, with a lunch, and Ethel M\'s Chocolate factory tour, and a Cactus Botanical Garden tour.We opted for option number 2, which was a great deal!The Hoover Dam tour was pretty nice.  The bus driver stopped at the famous, "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign for everyone to take a picture.  And then he took us to a check-in place with a gift shop/small airport with helicopters and Cessnas.  After checking in, we got onto the bus and headed to Hoover Dam.  The driver was very informative, and tried to be funny, but in a way that no one knew he was joking, so it really wasn\'t funny.We got to Hoover Dam, and went in for the power plant tour and then went to take some pictures. It was for an hour & a half.After this tour, everyone got back on the bus and the driver took us to lunch. I was happy since everyone was so hungry.The bus stopped in front of this really dirty, old casino, and I was wondering why we were there, perhaps to pick up more people?Just then, a real hillbilly with no teeth and super long braided white hair comes on board the bus wearing really dirty overalls.  He started introducing himself and the casino, and "the buffet" and that\'s when my friend and I turned and looked at each other horrified and mouthed, "Oh My Gosh". It was one of those moments you only see in movies.We went into the casino, past all the gamblers that looked quite different from the gamblers on the Vegas Strip.  When we got past the mutant people that looked like they were from the movie, "The Hills have eyes", We arrived at "The Buffet".We got in line to what must\'ve been the smallest buffet ever.My friend and I each grabbed our plates. First came to some bread bins. The bread looked super old. I didn\'t touch it. I decided to pass on everything but the celery, carrots, and a piece of fried chicken that didn\'t look so scary.  The rest of the food looked like globs of mysterious "stuff".  I could barely look at it.I sat down at the table and ate just enough to get me through my hunger pains. My friend\'s plate had some "things" that looked like bbq ribs and bbq chicken, along with some other stuff. My friend has a strong stomach, so I figured she\'d be okay.We finished eating as quickly as we could to rush back to the bus.Next came the very disappointing Ethel M\'s chocolate factory tour. When we entered, there was a guy standing there with plastic glove on one hand, and one small bag of coconut flavored M&M\'s. Ethel\'s last name was Mars.... *sigh* He gave each one of us 3 pieces of the M&M\'s. Really? Why bother giving "samples"? And then we got to the factory tour.  It was a small hallway area with glass between the chocolate makers and the visitors. The chocolate makers were laughing and pointing at the visitors, like they were in a zoo, and the visitors were caged animals. hmmm... interesting?We got outside and that was the Botanical Cactus Garden. Ummm... really? You call that a garden? It was a big space filled with different types of cacti and cactus fruit. We got back on the bus and the driver took us all back to the hotels, but not before having us shell out some cash, since "that\'s how they make a living", doesn\'t the company pay him?  I hate it when they pull this trick.  I\'d rather have paid more upfront, instead of being harassed by the driver to give him a good tip.When we got back to the hotel, my friend was sick. Yes, from "The Buffet" at the oldest casino. (#4 to be registered back then)She was so sick all night, she barely made it to her flight the next morning. She also missed her NYC vacation that was already planned and booked for the next few days because she was still sick for a few more days.This dam tour taught me that next time, go for option#1. Don\'t trust them to take you to a nice dam place for lunch! =)'
