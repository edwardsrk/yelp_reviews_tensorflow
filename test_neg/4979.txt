b'This place could be great, really.  Unfortunately the place as rather unattractive, the decor was sparse and forgettable, the only sounds were the people talking and the annoying television, and the waitress was shy, not very talkative, and wasn\'t great at helping you decide what to get.The menu is rough-looking, has nothing to describe the food at all, and doesn\'t really appeal to a first-timer for Peruvian food.  It lacks the polish of a good restaurant, really.  The food, you ask?  Decent.  The food on the menu is just a bunch of names, and how those names relate to the food at all is a mystery to the uninformed, so you have to ask your server.  As I stated earlier, the server has not forthcoming with explanations, so you had to just pick whatever you thought sounded nice.  The Chinese is lackluster and in fact a little more pricey than other Chinese-only places.  Don\'t come here for that.  The Peruvian food has more character, but even so, it\'s so hit-or-miss that it\'s not even worth the time and effort.Suggestions for improvement?  They need to put a bit more capital into the decor, take the TV out of there, lower the amount of light and get indirect lighting.  Drop the Chinese completely, and change the name to an exotic, Peruvian-sounding name.  Play to your uniqueness, and you\'ll get much better attention.  If you feel you must have Chinese food there, due to Chinese immigrant influence on Peru\'s cuisine, then add it as "Asian-Influenced" or something to the otherwise Peruvian menu.  Add some photos of the dishes, as well as a description for each and every item.  For a non-Spanish speaker, the food on the menu might as well have been gibberish.This could\'ve been great, but as it stands, it\'s kind of dismal and not worth your time.'
