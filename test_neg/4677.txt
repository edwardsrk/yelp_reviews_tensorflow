b"We used a groupon to check this place out. Despite having a pleasant sever, the service was poor. We ordered the dumplings (delicious), spring roll (not tasty at all. Probably the worst i have ever had), and chicken and steak hibachi (very salty). I can't say I will be back any time soon. It was just okay for us."
