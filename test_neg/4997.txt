b'Before I get into the review, I want to say that I really really really wanted to like this place. My husband had been discouraging in trying the place out and I insisted that with so many raving reviews on Yelp, the restaurant surely had to be doing something right. SO we went on a Saturday night after making online reservations for 3. We were seated at the window overlooking East Blvd, with a street lamp glaring in our face from across the street (Perhaps some sheers will help this?) We placed our drink orders and then a secondary waiter gave the complimentary hot and fluffy naan w/ chutney tray. We then ordered a salad and the samosa potli (pouch). The salad was average and plentiful, however the samosa was tasty yet very small portioned. Both were $7.Next we ordered our entrees: 2 \'modern\' vegetarian dishes and 1 non-veg. The goat cheese malai kofta was not flavored or seasoned. The only taste was of the goat cheese. The other veg dish was a tomato-potato dish. This was also the same way. According to the Yelp reviews, the chicken tikka was a must-order. I couldn\'t differ more on that opinion. The dish was wayy too creamy and not flavored at all. Add to the fact that you can only make the tikka more spicy and not the veg dishes because it\'s already prepped?! What Indian restaurant has that policy?Needless to say, the only things above average were the naan and the secondary waiter\'s service. Below average was the tasteless food. Copper, please don\'t insult the Indian diner by serving this food that you call "authentic and modern." And this is before I even got to the price point of the food. Simply highway robbery when you charge customers that much for flavorless entrees.  I would not recommend this place to even a person trying Indian food time for the first time.'
