b"Two stars only because of the staff, otherwise would be 1 star for no wait to  be seated. My chicken tortilla soup was EXTREMELY salty, the red wine was so watered down that it was near transparent, my mother got the wrong dressing, and why why do they water down the salsa so much that it's like vaguely seasoned water? Free is no excuse, everything served should be up to reasonable standards....but at least the waitress was nice."
