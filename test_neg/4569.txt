b"The food was okay, although lower in temperature than it should've been. The problem was the service. I ordered a veggie burrito and the employee didnt even put veggies on it until I asked, twice. (Yes they are supposed to come with it.) There was one girl on the line and she made our two meals along with the three people's orders behind us, so my food stood there for a very long time before she came back to it. I had paid and was looking at my completed meal (it was to go so all someone needed to do was cover it up) for quite some time as she put beans on other people's food. The workers were slow and they were maybe understaffed. I would not go back."
