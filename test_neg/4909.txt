b'My wife and I were there for a late lunch today.  My wife ordered a salad with blackened chicken.  The first attempt came with uncooked chicken.  They did remove and replaced it with a properly cooked chicken.  By the time it arrived I had completed my burger.  Which was very good.  I was disappointed that we were not compensated at all for the inconvenience.  We won,t be coming back.'
