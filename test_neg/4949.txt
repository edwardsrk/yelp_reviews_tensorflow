b"The buffet at the casino is just that.....a buffet.  Nothing over the top.  I ate at Corky's in the food court last week and got sooooo sick.  Was not in the least bit impressed.  Never mind I was out of work for a week.  Food poisoning perhaps?  Not cheap either.  $16 for a sandwich meal.  Never again eating there."
