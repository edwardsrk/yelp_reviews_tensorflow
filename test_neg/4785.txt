b'I really wanted to like this place, I really did. Unfortunately, our dinner just kept disappointing. Thank baby Jesus for Groupon, because if we had spent full price for our meals, I\'d probably develop an eye twitch. I went with their $18 vegetarian dinner special (poblano stuffed peppers with white beans, covered in a creamy tarragon sauce) over rice. My boyfriend ordered the Gallina Frita (shredded fried chicken breast with onion and Moros- rice and black beans).The presentation of the food left something to be desired, but then again, so did the taste. We got pretty small plates (perhaps because I let it slip that we had a coupon?) The vegetarian poblano pepper entree ($18 mind you) had only one half of a stuffed pepper, over plain white rice, and was covered with a cheese sauce that was Velveeta-esque. There were no subtle nuances of flavors, just a bit of creamy slop with boiled tomato bits floating in the cheesy sea of regret. The corn bread that came with the meal was clearly microwaved and was 2"x 2"-- a sad display. The chicken entree was dry and almost tasteless, except for the overly salted moros. My boyfriend didn\'t even finish the chicken nor did he want my corn bread. This is a first on so many levels. This was Cuban cuisine?! Where\'s the seasoning? The spices? Where is the flavor?! We left the Havana cafe and bid adieu to the plastic chairs and the tasteless plates of microwaved sadness.'
