b"Under new ownership and not what it looks like online. One person working at 4pm on a Saturday and it took 2 1/2 hours for two manicures. Disappointing, but hopefully they can get it up and running satisfactorily. Outcome was not the color I asked for but - re-doing it wasn't an option. It'll have to do. Disappointing at best. Bummer."
