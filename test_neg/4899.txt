b"Really austere, creepy interior. It's all white and chrome and too OPEN - gives me a weird vibe. The girl working there was really nice and came right out from behind the counter to offer us samples of flavours. BUT they had hardly any flavour choices I'd want (coconut, pistachio, hazelnut, pomegranate all sound gross). I went with typical salted caramel and vanilla. They had a lot of different toppings I haven't seen at the other yogurt places I've tried (like whole Hostess Zingers and donuts?!) but a lot of the bars weren't chunked up so you couldn't really mix them into the yogurt, just kind of add it to your lot. Overall, another typical yogurt place that's trying to be a little too high-class for what it is."
