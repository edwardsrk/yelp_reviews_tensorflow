b'Been there a couple of times for lunch. Terrible!1. Do not order any item containing meat, it tasted funny the 2 times I had any dish containing meat (I get goosebumps just remembering the taste, yeah, yuck).2. Not real pho, the owners are Chinese, not Vietnamese.3. Bad service and bad taste for decoration.'
