b'Along the lines of greasy Americanized Chinese take-out, Chopstick Express is pretty good. We used to order from here once in a while on lazy days when I\'d stay at the boyfriend\'s house. We\'d get our fill of breaded, fried, and sauced meat dishes like the lemon peel or orange chicken, but my particular favorites were the oily and comforting lo mein noodles with char sui pork. Cheap, quick, convenient...their tofu dishes are also pretty decent, but this is by no means "real, authentic" fare...think: better than Panda Express and cheaper too...'
