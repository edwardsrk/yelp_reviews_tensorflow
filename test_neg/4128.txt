b"Stopped in for a to go. The BBQ is pretty good, but the service is terrible. They sent me to the bar to place my order, no kidding the bar-tender turned her back on me as soon as I walked in. She started talking with her co-worker who was eating. I waited a few minutes, the did the ol' hello! She never smiled, never even said hello. Simply stared at me....no smile, just stare! I placed my order, waited and she brought it out, and NEVER said one more word, not even when I paid 14.00 for a plate of BBQ, 1 oz of slaw, 4 hush puppies, and three cold onion rings. First and last time visiting lancasters BBQ. And this is one BBQ eating boy....."
