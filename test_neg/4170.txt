b"The food was excellent, the location is terrific ,however the waitstaff and management on duty the night we ate there were either indifferent or inexperienced.  We were a party of eight and ordered appetizers, expensive meals, numerous bottles of wine and drinks.  The waitress had difficulty opening the wine bottles with the corkscrew, obviously hadn't done it too often. She tried hard and we worked with her but the food came out very haphazardly with big waits for some of us after others had gotten their meals. After our dinner we wanted to sit outside for an after dinner drink but the staff removed all the cushions telling us that rain was predicted. Not sure what forecast they were looking at but suspect people wanted to get out of there early.  By the way it didn't rain for two days. Also made to wait at least 20 minutes, we did not have a reservation but the place was not busy at allNot sure how long they have been there but if management doesn't improve they could blow this great location."
