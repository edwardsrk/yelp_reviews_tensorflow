b"So Ive been to this place twice. I didnt like it the first time I went I had the Dan Dan Noodles way too salty and l like salt I threw it out. I also ordered the House Fried Rice and it had no flavor, two of their Special Rolls both were flavorless and mushy. I threw away all of the food it was just tastless. I really push for people to support local businesses I thought well maybe they were having a bad day all of the reviews were great and maybe it was just me. So I waited another month and tried again same exact order and it tasted the same. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I still believe you should support local businesses just mybe not this one.**Ok so to answer the businesses questions I got take out the first time and ate in the second time thinking that maybe I did not get it home in time. I'm not sure what cost has to do with anything. In MY OPINION I did not like your food. I don't want my money back I pay with cash btw, I got the food and I ate some of it, It was my choice to go back and try again. Good luck with your business and enjoy all of your positive reviews"
