b'Great concept but the execution is sorely lacking. The interface is fairly self-explanatory but the computer locked up several times while trying to upload photos from my phone. Several staff standing around and no one came by to assist. Just seems like there are some missed opportunities. We were close to the front door, and got up from the photo bar and headed out. Seems like the 2-3 staff chatting at the entrance might have noticed us in revenue-generating mode and said something besides "thanks for coming in."As a Mac user, it wasn\'t lost on me that the Microsoft logos were covered up with stickers. Cntl Alt Delete. We are outta here.'
