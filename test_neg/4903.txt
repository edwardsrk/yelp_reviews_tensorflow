b'I went with my sister in law before the ballet on December 18th. When you walk in, it smells like stale cigarettes which is odd since you can\'t smoke inside. So we sit down at the bar and the bartender looks at us and practically rolls his eyes. I\'ve been in f&b long enough to know he was thinking, "oh great. They\'re young." We order our drinks and he makes them then immediately gives us our tab and doesn\'t Check on us or even look at us again. It wasn\'t busy and other people were being tended to, so I was pretty offended. We intended on staying for a while and I\'ve rarely encountered a golf bartender who doesn\'t Check build. We were going g to eat but the smell alone was too much. Fortunately, a cute little blonde wAitress was really sweet and ended up closing us out.'
