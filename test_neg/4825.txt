b"This place ladies and gents is a Korean sushi restaurant. Don't confuse this with a Japanese sushi restaurant. The fish quality was sub-par. The sweet shrimp was probably old because it was cooked. Usually par cooking is a technique to somewhat hide the fishiness of seafood as it gets old. The sea urchin was horrible. It looked dark and tasted off. Usually it will taste creamy with a lil briney flavor but this was of bad quality. Appetizers were good. They were hot and crispy when expected. The place was empty at 9pm. Not sure if that's just the lack of traffic in the area but it seemed more like the public knew about the quality."
