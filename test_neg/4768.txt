b"Have ate here a few times the only thing worth ordering is the pot stickers ! Food is made haphazardly with low quality ingredients and it's poorly prepared!! After tonight's order I will never order from them again the items were just thrown in the bag several items spilled and the pepper beef was awful ! Never going back"
