b'Their bagelwichs taste pretty good. But expensive compared to other options around the financial district. However, today the service was horrific. The lady gave me attitude and gave me the wrong order and still claims it\'s the "bagelwich". Only ordered one thing and she still gets the order wrong. Not returning to this particular Michel\'s.'
