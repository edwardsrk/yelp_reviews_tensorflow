b"A burger joint hidden inside a dim sum place. That should have been the first warning sign!  We were a pretty large party of 19 and everyone felt the same way.  The burgers were average, the service wasn't great, and fries were just 'meh.'First off, the burger seemed a little undercooked. I mentioned it to the waiter, and he said that's just how they cook them.  The buns were a under-whelming. They were not even toasted, so for me, they seemed like plain buns right out of the supermarket.  My first bite seemed like it had decent flavor, but the taste of the burger just died after subsequent bites. I guess I just wasn't digging the 'Asian' flair.The fries were okay, but with the price of the burger, you'd think fries would be included!  Hey, it's Vegas right?If you measure service by how long between being seated, ordering, and getting our food,  service also gets 2 stars. Our waiter was new, and he had a good sense of humor, but it took 30 minutes to get our food!  It's just a burger!  Anyways, we don't live in Vegas, so there's not much of a question about re-visiting this place. Many more places to try the next time we're in town."
