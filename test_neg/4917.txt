b"It was OK, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing (both had lasagne) or perhaps my expectations were too high based on the other reviews.  Menu selection seemed limited and pricey as well for the area (maybe because it's close to Hudson). The lasagna was $17 each and didn't come with anything except bread. The portion was generous, almost too big.  Personally, a nice side salad and a smaller entree portion would have been better. We won't be back."
