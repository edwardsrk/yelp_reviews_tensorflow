b"Slow slow slowIt's mostly Sysco and Shamrock Service food, ya know flash frozen then thrown in a deep fryer, then some 'specials' but they're competing for the lunch business of Vermont Sandwich Company next door.During the day and weekends you have the 'regular' Off Track Betting clients and evenings it's so hard to find a freaking parking spot. It's 'Cheers' of East Scottsdale, all locals and hard to break into their 'clique'. Last Friday their toilets were backed up and no one could use them (had to go over next door to use their competitors, who were sympathetic & friendly), I thought as a health code violation you had to close your doors over this.But if you only have one hour for lunch and plan to go, be prepared in a slow slow afternoon return to work."
