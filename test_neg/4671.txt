b"I planned a bachelorette party for my friend and there were 6 of us. At first  we chose the $25 pp package with limo pickup, admission and 2 drinks until I read in fine print does not include limo ride back to hotel. So then we went with the package of $45 pp to include limo pickup and drop off, VIP entrance, reserved seating, and 2 drinks. All along they tell you please do not be late for limo pickup so I made sure we were on time, however the limo was about 40 min late and not only that they show up in a shuttle bus!! Not cool! And there was another group of girls with us which was ok but not what we paid for. The driver did apologize and said there would be a limo to take us back. Then we pull up to Hustler club. No where in the info I looked up said it was at the hustler. Again no big deal but would've been nice to know that's where it was at. No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty. And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early. Seated limited! Ok so the male strippers were good with the girls and bride to be, however their bodies were all so stubly or prickly as though the hadn't been freshly waXed or shaved. A big turn off! Never the less we had a good time. I just wish it was a little more organized! Ands since we paid that much money and then had to pay another $60 to get bride onstage was a little much."
