b'The food was decent but for starters the Chicken Parm was not hot when they brought it out. We were in a party of 16 and several people had the same experience. One of our group ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the meat was very undercooked. The floor manager was too busy flirting with the younger women at the bar to be of any help. He tried to tell the person who ordered it that this was normal. The person she was with ordered the same thing and hers were cooked just fine. He was a very rude Italian "rocky balboa" wannabe and should not be in customer service. They took the meal back and never brought her a new meal. On top of that they didn\'t take it off the bill! He should be fired!! Overall you should save your money and find a better place to eat!'
