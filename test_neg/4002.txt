b"The girl who did my gellac was really rude. My nail had broken just the day before, you could still see the blood. When she applied the solution it hurt like crazy,  I told her this she gave me the dirtiest look as if I had inconvenienced her a big deal. She said ' There  is no other way to do it' Her colleague suggested to use a lot of oil and it was perfectly fine with that. The second I got my coffee it was cold and undrinkable. I felt really uncomfortable around her. Even though its right around the corner for me, I wouldn't go here again."
