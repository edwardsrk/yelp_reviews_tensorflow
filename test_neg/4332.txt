b"This was not a groupon purchase. I went in for lashes, not fond of the online booking process which required CC info without being able to ask questions first. Everything is done on the website, and responses to questions are slow at best, if they are even answered. The lack of communication continued after service-- more on that below. Lashes looked fine the day I got them. Would have preferred a more natural look with varying lengths but they worked.Finding the location was challenging.  The service itself in the salon was fine, relaxing, clean etc. I followed directions given following the lash application. I even continued to wash  my face without direct shower stream for another few days. It was around day 2 that the lashes started to fall out. At first I thought natural shedding, however it continued for days. They would fall on my phone, into food, in the sink. Upon examination my lashes were not attached to most of these fallen lashes. I actually took a picture on day 8 to document there was a visual gap where the lashes had fallen out. I wrote to Modlash via email about this on day 11.  I was out of the country so not much could be done, but wanted to provide feedback.  No acknowledgement/no response. I resent a few days later with a follow up message. Still nothing.  I even DM'd  Instagram with no response. It has been 18 days since I had the extensions and they are all but gone. I was trying to provide feedback prior to writing a public review. See photos."
