b'For over 2 years we\'ve  enjoyed a stop at this Chili\'s once per week after pickleball.  As seniors, at the suggestion of one of their food servers, a couple of the members of our group have ordered off the children\'s menu.  But 10 days ago we were suddenly told that ordering off the children\'s menu was not allowed.  I understand a change in policy or perhaps a new manager wanted to enforce an old policy.  No problem.But after this we submitted feedback on the Chili\'s website inquired about what other options (senior menu , smaller portions, etc.) might be available.  Like any "family", could some of us select children\'s portions as long as others were ordering adult entrees? Received a prompt (canned?) response that this was an area of concern for them and a general manager and/or area manager would contact us within 2 days.  But as you might expect, there has been no follow-through on contacting us. Oh well, we made an effort to make it work but have found several other restaurants willing to meet our needs.'
