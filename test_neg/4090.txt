b'Father\'s 75th Surprise Birthday Party-Owner took advantage of a joyous occasion. Months of planning to create a surprise party for my Dad. There was myself and my mother working with the venue to help plan the event. Overall the event went well, but not because of the owner. Family and friends made the event great.Upon arrival we were expecting a private room for 31 people. We were placed in the main dining hall with portable 6 foot dividers to separate us from others. I inquired about a private dining space and was told by the owner the private space could only hold 30 and she decided this was the best fit. She told me she would waive the $50 room rental fee. Which is ridiculous to charge anyways because we had a section, not a private room.(charged anyways)My brother also told her that we would like only 2 bottles of wine placed on the tables for a toast. She insisted on pouring everyone\'s glass and then charged us $7 a glass(30 glasses) to equal over $200 of wine(4 bottles). We asked for 2 bottles since it was a cash bar and guests had their own drinks already.Also, the owner decided that it was her right to make their traditional toast and then let us make a toast. Thank you for forcing yourself into our event.We also had a table of 3 that was served last after other tables had already completed their dinner.We brought in a professional chocolate cake and were charged $15 to cut the cake. We asked to cut it ourselves and were told they have to cut it and charge us for liability reasons. My mother asked for a slice of White cake since she was allergic to Chocolate(oversight by us). The owner brought out an 8" cake and then charged us $24 for that cake as well, after she told us she would be able to find a slice in the back.When the final bill was due, the owner pulled my mother to the side to settle up. As I watched the transaction, she kept her left arm over a majority of the bill and showed the final price at the bottom of $1300+. Upon further inspection after the check was written, we noticed the wine issue and she charged us $50 for the room fee, even though she said it was going to be waived. Upon inquiring with her about the charges she immediately took offense and said "Don\'t try and nickel/dime me". Really? We verify the bill and catch you over charging and we are somehow in the wrong?The venue was not very busy on a Saturday night and we brought in a majority of their revenue that evening.It was a great event for our Dad to share with family and friends, but to witness my 75 old mother being taken advantage by the owner was very disappointing. Fortunately, my brother and myself were able to step in and have the owner cut us a check for $200 to cover the over charging. There was another person named Gary who was excellent that night. Very helpful that evening and was able to find us a speaker to play music for the evening. Gary was a pleasure to work with.Fortunately my Dad was not aware of the drama behind the scenes which is the most important thing.The front of the building also needs a good cleaning or a paint job. Very depressed looking building upon arrival.We spent another hour or so in the bar after the dinner, which was also a highlight of the evening. Cool little bar with live music and the bartender was great!I applaud the staff who worked very hard that night.I wish I could give a better review of the venue, but people make the difference.Their ambiance is fine, but if you want to host a private event I suggest you look elsewhere.'
