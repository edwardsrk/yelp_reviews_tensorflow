b"So this place is a step down from No Frills. Less selection, not as clean and way more cramped in the aisles. I found the entire shopping experience pretty unpleasant, except the cashier was quite friendly.Things were cheaper than at No Frills, for the most part. Don't think I'll be rushing back here any time soon."
