b"The only reason why the Garden Restaurant is worth checking out, is because it's open late (we went for dinner there at 12 am on a weekday) and because you can get vegan friendly chow. If you aren't going there because you need grease in the wee hours of the morning, I would avoid this place.Numero uno, it isn't real chinese food; numero deux, it is greasy as all hell, perhaps even too greasy. We felt absolutely disgusting after dinner.  The food arrives quickly because all the stir-fries are made with frozen vegetables. Several items we ordered from the menu were not even unthawed or the noodles were burned. You don't come here for a culinary delight. It's also waaaaaayyyyy overpriced for what it is. If you aren't vegan and want a late-night chinese food experience, I recommend walking over to China Town which is just a stones-throw west."
