b"Good prices you'd be able to work with. Great tasting daily specials but you can't compare pebble street to the sister restaurant, Calgary court (downtown). The service isn't great here. Seems like a lot of sass coming from the waitresses and the worst attitude when taking your payment. Whether your left your tip on the table or tipping with change instead of on the machine, not to worry, they'll remind you!"
