b"This place should be called Zabas Mexican't Grill.  I just paid $20 for three flavorless tacos and some gross nachos.  The whole time they were making our food I was hoping there would be some magic in the taste because it looked really sad.  I think I ate 10% of my nachos before I had to give up.  They gave my son the wrong kind of tacos. He ate about 50% of his food before giving up. We won't be back."
