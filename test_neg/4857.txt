b"Definitely not impressed. The first time I went in the girl was rude and did a horrible job. I called and complained and they were super nice and great about getting me back in to get them fixed. But while I was getting them fixed the girl who messed them up just kept hovering over us the whole time. It was super awkward. Figured I would give them the benefit of a doubt and try again, but it's just not quality work. I went last week to get a mani pedi and by the third day after, I had 6 nails chipped off. Not worth going back to get them fixed again."
