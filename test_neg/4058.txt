b"The food tastes great... However, as I walked in there's only one lady at the front ringing in orders and answering phones. The line is to the door. I tried to call our order in before I left work but phone lines were busy or disconnected so we had to place our order once we got there.  We finally got to the front and ordered our food at 12:05. We received our food at 12:46, after I asked where it was. (There were about 30 people waiting for their food at this point )  They didn't even have our order, they found half of it but had to make my husband's. After receiving our food mine was not even hot anymore because it had been sitting out. I also had to leave to go back to work and left my husband eating alone. I got an apology but it ruined my lunch. I wouldn't recommend going here on lunch break. Food is good but not worth the trouble."
