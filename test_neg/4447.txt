b'"japanese" steakhouse for the masses, serving mayo-slathered "white tuna" improvised-roll CRAP. perfect match for the Bell Road restaurant abyss of HELL.HEAD TO FRESH WASABI SUSHI BAR DOWN THE STREET.yeah, yeah... benihana chop chop, zing zing. that\'s all great, but i look for the seeds of real japanese cuisine, and they\'re almost nowhere to be found here... (and I gave it 3 hopeful visits before writing this.)--love the tempura. crab stick tempura is my comfort food, and the tempura is expertly executed. kudos to the kitchen. +star#beverage menu boasts a broad sake selection, but none of them are ever in stock.#when asked, the sushi chef promises "all the fish is the best". when your chef says that, it means that NONE of his stuff is fresh.#chef refuses to speak with you when you sit at the bar, inches from him. you must order through the server, and she will speak with the chef.BUT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT!#and the server does not know the japanese words for anything on the menu!#after my ticket comes up on his printer, he looks at it briefly, and then continues his side work.#wait for it.#entry experience paying attention to all the wrong things.fused-to-the-sidewalk bird poop all the way to the broken entry door with taped paper sign, "use other door", complete with arrow.exposed water spicket rusting and leaking all over the walkway. Uh oh. reminds me of "Diamonds Chinese" (see review)glass is filthy as is the rotting wood door handle. ew. "i wonder what\'s inside" as i pull the crookedly-hanging door from its frame...real japanese experience takes pride in the cleanliness of your entryway and the approach of your guest. not here.'
