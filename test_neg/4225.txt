b"I generally like the food I order from here. My calzone this time was a little more bread than I'd like, but by the time I got to the good part I was happy. My issue is that I don't remember the last time this place didn't mess up some part of my order. This time I wanted italian crust, got regular, making it bland. Last time I didn't get any marinara, again making it bland. The time before that I got the wrong meat. The time before that my friends didn't get their salads delivered in our group order. It goes on. I don't need a perfect meal every time, but always having some part of my order messed up by them sours my experience. Their inattention to detail is more consistent than their ability to make a simple meal."
