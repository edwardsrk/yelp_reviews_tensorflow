b"Genuinely surprised at all the good reviews on here, after telling friends and fam about my verbal review I wanted to make it official on Yelp. The beer was awful, I had been told by many people on the beer culture of Charlotte that it was but I had to find out for myself. I have a deep rooted love for Noda Brewery, Birdsong and a high respect for Triple C and Old Meck, and Heist's beer makes our town's brewers look bad. Food was good, tasty, and impressive, but I got only four of the Parmesan Garlic Tator Tots. Note to owners, no one who orders Tots wants only four, regardless of quality. I rarely write negative reviews, so here is more good: service, top notch. Decor, lovely. Sorry, back to negative: pricey, a bit pretentious and how do you screw up a red ale? I'm a homebrewer, that style might as well be training wheels! I'd go back if I were with work people who didnt like beer and were paying for the food. Otherwise, I'm getting a better burger at Jack Beagles down the street with a better beer to boot, then going to Noda brewery for the real draft."
