b"Waaaay overrated burgers.The quality of the meat, which is what I'm looking for in a burger, is ok at best. It was cooked fine and with a decent bun, but instead of giving me 100 different choices of toppings and crazy burger styles, just make a good burger man.I'm always suspicious of places that cover their burgers in a tonne of cheeses, sauces and condiments...I feel like it's hiding how good or not good the burger ACTUALLY is.Plus they screwed up our order and it took considerably longer than it should've."
