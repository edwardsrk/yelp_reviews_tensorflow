b'We visited due to a groupon offer. Came here expecting good food and great service. Only received mediocre service and food. The enteee was tasteless so it was dipped in excessive teriyaki sauce. We tried the beef and the salmon. Tempura is not an entree but a side in japanese cuisine, yet it was listed as an entree.The service was mediocre when we asked if there was wifi, and the reply we received was that "we want our customers to enjoy the food", yet with their incredibly slow service, it was impossible not to fiddle with our smart phones. I believe this place is worth a try if you get a great deal with groupon or other alternatives. Otherwise I recommend another place for japanese cuisine.'
