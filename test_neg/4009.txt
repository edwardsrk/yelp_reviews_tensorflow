b'My husband and I went to StripSteak during a a recent visit to Las Vegas.Being a fan of Michael Mina, I was very surprised by this experience.  It felt like a TGIFriday!  The waitstaff appeared to have been on roller skates, given the amount of time they spent with us.  They appeared to always be looking around to see what else was happening while trying to take our order.  And when we asked for the sommelier to make a wine selection, he was there and gone before I looked up from the wine list....  Will not go back.'
