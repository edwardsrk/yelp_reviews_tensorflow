b"Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.So why the 2 stars?Quite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate."
