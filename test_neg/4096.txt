b"Friends raved about this family owned restaurant so we decided invite a couple friends for dinner - nice decor & friendly staff - portions very small, several of us had mussels & clams, they were size of a nickel -  spaghetti with red sauce tasted ordinary  & saltimbocca  looked like layered lasagna without the pasta.The bread and olive oil was the best  maybe we just ordered the wrong entrees - don't think we'll be going back anytime soon."
