b'Winghart\'s is yet another addition to specialty burger places in Pittsburgh. They have a very nice beer selection, and the service was fast and friendly. After an appetizer of Tatonka dip, my wife and I split the shipwreck burger which has brie, caramelized onions with bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli. We got it cooked medium, and it came out more medium rare inside and well done outside. I was expecting more flavors from all the amazing toppings, but I think they were shadowed by the burnt outside of the patty. The fresh cut fries were some of the best I\'ve ever had anywhere.One big complaint is that they only give you enough pita wedges for half of the buffalo dip. She came by when we were finishing one of the last ones, and said, "Would you like more pita? It\'s $1.99". So they knowingly do this just to get an extra $2 out of you. For this reason, I\'m dropping them to 2 stars. It\'s just a really shady business practice.'
