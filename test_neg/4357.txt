b'Was here a while ago and I am not sure what happened to the quality of food since my last visit. I ordered the blackand blue burger with garlic parm fries. The burger was overcooked, with mushy, hot lettuce on top. The fries were cold, soggy and not worthy of being considered a "premium" side. Not worth the 18 dollars I paid for it. You would think given the location they would have a better craft beer selection as well. Very generic.'
