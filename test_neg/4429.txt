b'Just squeaking in that extra star.... On a recent trip to Vegas, we were a little hungover and a lot hungry for something to eat. After wandering around we just decided to head back to our own hotel and eat there. What a mistake! It was just after 12:00 and on Saturday and Sunday, the breakfast stops at 12:00. They have some breakfast \'specials\' available on the regular menu, but it was things like omelets with french fries. I just wanted an egg sandwich or something very simple, but no.... We sit down, decide on what to have, and wait, and wait, and wait. Shockingly enough, I was getting very irritated. Servers are walking by and no one is stopping to take our order. We waited, and I timed it, 15 minutes for someone to come over and say, "we didn\'t see you sitting here. How about I take your drink order and then find your server?" My response was, "just take the whole order and don\'t find someone to else to help us. We\'ve been waiting and you\'ve been serving the table right next to us the whole time." I ordered water and a $14.99 grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, no bacon with fries. Dining companion ordered a Diet Pepsi and Reuben with chips. Then, after I complain the manager comes out and is bending over backwards, and a little too far at that, to help us. Food comes out and the grilled cheese was awesome, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. We received the Diet Pepsi comped and 20% off, but think of it this way, if someone had helped us to start with, you would have made a whole lot more money. Go with caution, it wasn\'t even busy and now I know why. I gave it the extra star because that sandwich was so damn good. I just wanted my sandwich and to be left alone.'
