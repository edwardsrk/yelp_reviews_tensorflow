b"Upon reading all of these four and five star reviews I decided to try Thai Orchid. My experience was either drastically uncharacteristic of this eatery or it is a mediocre rendition of Thai cuisine. My entree dish was dry and over cooked and the spring rolls were underwhelming. How are they spring rolls with salad lettuce from the grocery store? I just think that is unacceptable. The service was slow, but I don't blame it on the two workers in the front. I am sure they were aware of how the night was going insofar customer satisfaction. A family next to me received the wrong meal and they voiced their concern. Overall, I don't recommend going here as it is not even close to the best Thai food in the west valley as many have claimed on the Yelp page. I dislike lambasting restaurants, but I can't hold back on this occasion."
