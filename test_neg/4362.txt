b"Pros: 1. Clean 2. Fast service 3. Prices ($25 for white tips with gel polish) Cons: 1. Did not have me wash my hands 2. Did not clean under my nails 3. Did not place the tips correctly. (I did not want to cut down my regular nails. There is a gap between my nails and the tips which shouldn't be there) 4. There were bubbles in my nails.   5. I asked him to round my nails and he thinned them on the sides which is not the same thing.  Overall, the service was OK. The nails look neat at first glance so I won't complain too much. Plus I still left a tip just because I always do. I may return again."
