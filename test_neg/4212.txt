b"Been going to Nello's for years, but after last night, I'm taking some time off and spending my pizza $ elsewhere.  Not crowded, table for 3 in the bar....2 entrees came out quickly while I waited for a woodfired pizza.  My wife's salad was missing the pancetta as advertised.  My pizza finally arrived but was made incorrectly...I was told no problem, we'll make another one....waited, waited and bingo ANOTHER wrong pizza - this time it wasn't even close. After 2 hours I asked for the check and I'm gone.  Nello's get it together please and do something about your pizza dough - it's like cardboard lately.  Headed to Florencia for a while....and so is my $."
