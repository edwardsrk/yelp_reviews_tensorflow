b'Not the worst Walmart I have ever been to, but by far not the best.  No one in the store knows where anything is or knows how mix paint either.  The lines are very very long so you better bring a book.  Unfortunately Walmart has a monopoly so we as Americans really have no choice but to use their store.'
