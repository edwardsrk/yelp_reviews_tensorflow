b"Easy-going caf\xc3\xa9s are hard to come by in the areas between Bishop and Peel, and I once thought M was different. Unfortunately in the past few months something has changed, and not for the better. M caf\xc3\xa9 now feels like a cheap, bad diner without the food and prices to match. The same salad I had last time was now drenched in oil. When the servers weren't clinking down cutlery or leaning over us mid-bite to pour us water, they were loudly chattering being the counter. Was this a one time thing? I don't know. I'll do my best to avoid this place in all its synthesized-music-medley glory, unless I'm picking up a box of macaroons to go."
