b"This place has a nice look and lots of friendly wait staff but the food was very bland overpriced for the quality.  They only serve beer and wine and the beer is all cheap stuff like bud light and corona.  We ate here our first night at the hotel and decided not to eat here again.  I'd suggest going to Luna Rosa just across the street."
