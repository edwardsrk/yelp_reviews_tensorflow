b'Have been so disappointed in them. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me 3 times I\'m never going again. First time (about a month ago) I ordered 3 chicken veggie bowls. When I got home, none of them had veggies. I called and said come back so I did. When I got my second order, I checked to make sure they had veggies. The first 2 did so I figured all of them did. When I got home, the 3rd didn\'t have veggies. I called them back and they said to come back. At this point, I was hungry and tired of driving so they said they would give me a bowl for free the next time. I called the other day to redeem and to order 5 bowls for my family and they said they could only give me the veggies and a side of rice as a replacement for the bowl. Huh?!? When I got home, the chicken and veggie bowl was more like chicken and cabbage bowl. About 98% of the "veggies" were cabbage with little to no broccoli or carrots. The meat was as close to jerky as can be. It was so close to being inedible. Will never go here again.'
