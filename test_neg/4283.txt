b"We live in the community and have gone here a few times. The menu is nothing to write home about, the food is mediocre, the service varies from a couple of amazing waitresses (I've never seen a waiter) to more very unpleasant ones who make you feel like an imposition and after they deliver your food, which takes forever, they never come back. Then, unless you're lucky and got one of the few good servers, then you'll have to hail your waitress for the check as if you were hailing a taxi during a rainstorm in NYC."
