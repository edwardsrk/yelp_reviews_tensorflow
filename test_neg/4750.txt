b'Came here with a friend for dim sum last week for the first time. The decor was very nice and it is evident that effort is put forth to make this place "classy and upscale".  That being said, you do get a feel that it is not the usual dim sum digs. The decor is modern and attractive, though where we were seated was rather chilly! There is a nice reception area where the host greets you. I made a reservation in advance and so no waiting was required. For some reason, they automatically speak to you in Mandarin. I had to tell them in English, that I don\'t speak Mandarin but then I added, in na\xc3\xafve hopefulness that I can speak Cantonese though! They proceeded in Mandarin with me and lead us to our table. The food was ok, not exceptional but not too bad. The thing that made me want to write a review was the attempt at being high end but neglecting that what goes with that is customer service! The service was meh at best. In fact, the most off-puting was when a dim sum lady brought our dim sum to our table. She had a tray of a few more dishes but was obvious that there was room on her tray. I politely asked her in Cantonese if she would be able to take an empty dish for me. She responded very curtly, "Of course I cannot! Can\'t you see I have little space?!"  I felt like I was scolded by this lady! Is this the kind of service you\'d expect? Wasn\'t there a less crass way to respond? Management needs to train ALL their staff if they want to provide "upscale dining experience". Like most Chinese establishments, initial efforts are there but attempt to try and stand out as "upscale" is futile. It will soon be another run-of-the mill York Region Chinese restaurant. Won\'t be much to write home about.'
