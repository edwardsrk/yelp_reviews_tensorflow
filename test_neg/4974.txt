b'I went here last Wed for a gel manicure and a pedicure. I got there around 11am and there were only 2 other customers. I still waited about 30 mins before anyone started my pedicure. Pedicure was average. Before they put polish on my toes they had me get up and move to a table for my nails. I was impressed with the large selection of colors they have, but the manicure was terrible. After they finished my mani, they had me go back over to the pedicure chairs  to finish my toes. My manicure was way too thick, and pained over my cuticles. It was peeling off just 5 days later. The picture I included was taken exactly 5 days after I got the manicure, I took the rest of the polish off myself that night.'
