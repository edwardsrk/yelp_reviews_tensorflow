b"I kind of expected more from this place. I've been a huge fan of anime since I was in elementary school and the idea of a cosplay cafe appealed to me so much, it was like a dream. Who doesn't like hearing J POP while eating?!The ambiance of this place was nice, the waitresses were cute yes, service however was lacking. The bf and I were waiting for quite some time for some napkins and it wasn't the waitresses who noticed but some man who I suppose works there as well. We both ordered noodle soup, I the tonkatsu and the bf some beef noodle. I noticed that the bf didn't really enjoy it much, and this being my first time having ramen outside of home, I wasn't sure how its usually suppose to taste but the ramen here was way too salty to my liking. The meat was nice and tender though however. The gyozas we ordered were good as well but pretty small considering the price."
