b'Reviewing the Cajun Ahi Tuna Salad (Portabella mushrooms, saut\xc3\xa9ed carrots, and some other stuff).  I have been to Tryst at least seven times and each time I am very impressed with the quality of food that I receive.  This last time was a take-out order and I have nothing but complaints about the $16 salad that I just bought.Problems:- Quantity of greens is far less than eating in house- Quantity of seared tuna was also less than eating in house- QUALITY of Tuna was atrocious** (Most frustrating part)The tuna was low quality and had white lines throughout each piece.  These white lines are tough and are similar to the texture of ligaments in a piece of steak.  The tuna, the most expensive part of the $16 salad, was the most unenjoyable piece of tuna that I have ever eaten (cooked, seared, and raw).  I will go back, but only because I know of other menu items that are of quality... but I will not be returning as often as I have in the past due to the inconsistencies in the dishes (that I am more than happy to pay for, as they are of quality ingredients).  This meal was not worth $16 and I was not satiated.'
