b"You really can't beat 24 hour pho... if you're drunk and don't mind a drive off the strip, definitely go here. All food is good when you're drunk.For us, we weren't drunk and we were searching for a pho place to eat at during the day. Our taste buds were extremely alert and ready for stimulation. I was left a bit unsatisfied, mainly because of the service.Pho LIttle Saigon is a large pho restaurant nestled in Vietnamese town. We all had pho in our group and only one person wasn't happy with how the pho was. The pho, in my opinion, had enough flavor for it to be a little above average. What I wasn't happy about was the service. They just weren't very accommodating, nor friendly. No greeting, no smile, no warm fuzzy feeling inside. To add insult to injury, the server spilled water all over my friend and ALMOST his iphone. Forget my friend... save the iPhone! I understand servers don't run around intentionally spilling water on customers (I THINK), but he didn't even apologize.Whatever.The pho was okay and it was priced a little higher than what I'm used to paying out in the Bay Area, but hey, we're on vacation. We're meant to get ripped off."
