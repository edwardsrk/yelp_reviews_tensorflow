b"Akahana...hmm. There's not really many positive things I can say about this place.  I was in the mood for sushi and saw on Yelp that they have a daily, BOGO deal on their sushi - even for take out orders - which sounded good to me.They are located in a strip mall right across from the Plaza Harris Teeter. Based on the time of day, the parking lot can get tight and spots fill up quickly.When I walked in, I was hit with a strong body odor aroma. Oddly it was only at the entrance. Once I walked inside, the stench was gone. At the hostess desk, I placed my order for two rolls: the Florida and furious dragon rolls. My total for both came to $16 and change. While I waited, I noticed how unkempt they keep the restaurant. Everything needs to be renovated.The hostess brought me my food and once I got home, I was pretty disappointed that avocado pieces on my furious dragon roll were already turning brown. The sushi rolls tasted no better than what can be found in the sushi section of the Harris Teeter across the street."
