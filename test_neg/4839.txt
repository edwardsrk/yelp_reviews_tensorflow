b'I have been to another Red Bowl, but this was my first time at this location. We arrived a little after 1:30, hoping for the lunch rush to be over, and it was. We were greeted right away and led to the dining room, which was less than half full. The hostess proceeds to sit us next to an infant in a high chair, when there were clearly better decisions that could have been made there given the empty nature of the dining room. The hostess came right back and said she would be taking our drink orders, 2 minutes later she delivers a Pepsi and a water. So far so good, except for the screaming kid next to me. It is then at least 10 minutes before we first met our waiter, and he was clearly flustered and over-sat. He took our orders quickly, and was off. I ordered Mongolian beef which I love, my better half went with beef lo mein. We quickly got our egg & spring rolls, which were great, and fresh. The wait for the food seemed a bit longer than it should have been, but again, that could have been the effect of the screaming infant in my left ear drum. When our food was delivered I was just about out of my soda, the waiter says "i\'ll grab ya some re-fills, be right back." That was the last time I saw him until my plate was just about empty, my glass had sat empty for at least 10 minutes, and I was just about ready to go. He never stopped back to check how the food was, I never got my refill and ate more than half of my lunch without a beverage. There seemed to be a "manager" who did a real good job at walking around looking pretty, but never had a thing in his hands while everyone else is running around crazy. The sad part is, other than not being piping hot, the food was great. Both my wife and I loved our meals, but the experience was ruined by absolute lack of service. On the way out, I asked the manager if there was a customer service e-mail I could have or some kind or corporate contact, and was directed to redbowlusa.com. That was it, he obviously did not care that there was something I was un-happy about, that could have been solved with a quick apology and acknowledgement of some sort. Oh well despite the great food, I will not be back.'
