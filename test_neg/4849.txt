b'First, I have to say, that is one of the best acai bowls I have ever had.  The store is very nicely decorated and has a nice vibe.  The food and atmosphere are not the issue here.As other reviewers have said, the customer service is lacking.  I ordered one Vitality Bowl this morning.  From when I walked in the door, to when I left with my food, took nearly 40 minutes. There were only 3 people in front of me when I ordered, and they got juice.  This should be a fast casual restaurant, like a Jamba Juice or Chipotle.  I do not understand how it can take so long to make a few items. Also, their menu is absurd.  They have it displayed on two 50 or 60" TVs and I can hardly read anything on there because there is so much text.  I think they need to go the In N Out route and simplify the menu.  Maybe that will improve their productivity.I was absolutely shocked to see that this is a large franchise.  The way this store is being run, I thought for sure this was a small independent company.'
