b'Really went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars but when it comes right down to it, a steakhouse with a $46 steak that\'s allegedly their best (being that it is the only dry-aged offering) and is underseasoned and slightly overcooked.. I couldn\'t bring myself to give the third star. Slow service and underwhelming steaks left us fairly disappointed. Upon specifying that I wanted my steak cooked rare, the waiter gave me the always-slightly-condescending "that\'ll be cool and red in the center" speech before eventually bringing out a steak that was somewhere in between med-rare and medium.  Meh.The Mac and cheese was delicious, though- had a delightful smoky flavor and thick chunks of bacon. Really delicious. Wish the meal overall had felt like they were putting in more effort.'
