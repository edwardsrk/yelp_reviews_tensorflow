b"Was excited to check this place out. Service was very slow for a Tuesday night around 8:00. (Place had 4-6 tables with people in them) waited 10mins for anyone to come over and took our drink orders. O rings were average at best. Burgers had very little flavor, I got the smokey BBQ burger and the brisket was good but burger was just ok and cooked well done when I asked for medium) Food came out really quick, it didn't seem very hot or fresh. Will I go back? If I'm in the neighborhood I would think about it, but I wouldn't make a special trip. B spot is still the king...by far."
