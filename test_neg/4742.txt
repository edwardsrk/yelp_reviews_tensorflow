b"Way too slow, way too salty and enough to get me to break my long streak of not leaving poor reviews. . One table when we arrived, people finishing up outside around 1930 on Thursday.  Food took a dog's age to arrive  approx 25 mins ( kids , love to wait, oh yes they do)  My poutine was awful,easily worst in the valley, and about as salty as this review.To be  beaten by Food trucks and several bars may not be a disgrace but there are better offerings at ice rink restaurants within the valley. Not saying anything else on the menu is awful but that was the main reason this restaurant was chosen.    I  left it mostly uneaten which didn't raise a comment.  Barely any gravy, curds that couldn't squeak if you tried , fries  limp as all hell, I.E.,  Just vile phoning it in crap.   when people don't ask why you buy things to just sit on the table it suggests it's a known issue.  The kids fared better and really liked their waffle kid's meals which appeared reasonable value and came with a mountain of fries , insultingly bigger than the poutine for adults,but I digress. I didn't eat their food. I just can't forsee another outing based on our being in Westgate is event based and if takes this long on a quiet non-event night I'd hate to imagine the lead time before a game."
