b"Ok, I have combined my two visits into one review because the first visit was a total disaster. I won't go into details but service (new waitress not enough training), manager (told us we had to pay $5 extra for the waitresses mistake) and food (poor value, overcooked) were all lacking. We got an invite back from the GM to give it another try and service was better but bread for the table still came out after all the food and most of the food ranged from ok to tasty, chicken tacos were soggy. Burger was good the first time and good the second time but overall the value for what you are getting is simply not there. Toronto has so many great food options, I would not waste money here."
