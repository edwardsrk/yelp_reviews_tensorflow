b'Kind of surprised by amount of good reviews. We were on that side of town and wanted to get something sweet. Happen to see this place in a sketchy corner, but my boyfriend suggested we just go in and try it. It was very small inside, I believe there were 2-3 small tables with foldable chairs, and the menu was creative looking but "different"...they had random food choices from greek salads, elote\'s, to being a juice bar...We just weren\'t too positive on how this place was creating all of this fresh food and drinks with one adult worker and 2 kids walking back and forth behind counter and partially helping the adult with the orders. The adult also spoke limited English, so we ended up just getting a banana split, handed it to us in a meal size styrofoam container, nothing like the picture we saw on their site, it was a good regular banana split, of course because its ice cream.. but definitely not worth $7...Sonic makes bigger and better for cheaper. The people before us ordered a drink that had scooped in fruit with juice, a salad, which looked like a flat, quick, put-together salad with pieces of chicken and some veggies... anyway, that was our experience, nothing worth us raving about to anyone and may not go back. Maybe there isn\'t too many places to choose from around that area. I gave it 2 stars because it states a "meh. I\'ve experienced better".'
