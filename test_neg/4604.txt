b"Sad to say... That night that you go out for your cheat meal and it wasn't worth the cheat. I was so looking forward to this date night with the fianc\xc3\xa9, celebration and a cheat meal, what can better? But unfortunately the dish I ordered was terrible and cheap tasting.... I could have gone to macaroni grill or out back, but I thought we should splurge and eat some amazing food, food that should have stood out from the rest. But I was sorely disappointed and wish I had choose some where else. The waitress was friendly and the service was fast but I recommend that you stay away from the smoked salmon pasta salad that advertises sun dried tomatoes, smoked salmon, spinach, pesto and bacon. Sounds delicious , but it wasn't! The salmon, pesto and sun dried tomatoes where no where to be found and I could have made it better myself.If only I had read the reviews before I ate there... I had high hopes for this chain in Henderson, because driving across town for the other locations was always a hassle, but if they keep this up, this restaurant will be closed in no time. #canigetmymoneyback #hashhouseagogo #$72"
