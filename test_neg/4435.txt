b"The only reason this place has any customers is because it is the only restaurant in town (aside from an upscale French restaurant). A few of the dishes were fair (mussels, panko-coated fish, burgers) and everything else is terrible (crab cakes, beer-battered fish, salads).  The servers started out angry and it went downhill from there. We ate there three times and each time we felt like an imposition. If they didn't like a request, they would avoid our table for 15 minutes. The one standout is they have terrific fries!  Not a reason to go, but a plus."
