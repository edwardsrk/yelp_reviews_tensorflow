b"I used to be a Los Sombrero's local. Started going (1998) before they were in their current location. The past few years Los Sombreros has gone hill. Increasing prices and food not as good. Marg's are subpar now. Los Sombrero's is no longer living up to what it used to be. Food is still good, just no longer great. All great things change and I am sad to see Los Sombreros change for the worse. The original chef/owner Jeff Smedstad has left and started Elote in Sedona - I must try there as I here it's what Los Sombreros used to be."
