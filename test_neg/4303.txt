b"Room was clean, but FREEZING! It was average quality overall. They did not turn our heat on, and we shivered the whole night. The service was ok, food wasn't good, but it's expected in Vegas. Seriously, could not keep warm in the room. Location is pretty good, but they need to fix the temperature and would do good to improve the food to be healthier! Overall, would not prefer to stay here again."
