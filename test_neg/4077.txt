b'Tonight we decided to try Nani for the first time. We went on a Saturday night around 6 for dinner with a group of 4. We had heard good things about their dim sum and had high hopes. Once we sat down we were greeted immediately and our server explained how to order from their menu w/ pictures. We had to ask to see a cocktail menu and did not get water immediately. Actually, we had to ask again for water and were only brought one water and had to ask AGAIN for all 4 of us to get a glass of water. We ordered 6 different dim sum entrees with the assumption that we would order more. That ended up not being the case as our food was quite underwhelming. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, pan fried veggie rolls, pepper pork ribs, fried sticky rice, bbq pork buns and the sesame balls. When we tried to order cocktails, we were informed that they did not have any tonight but that we could order from their sake and martini menu. So I ordered a martini with the exact same vodka as the cocktail I initially tried to order (??) The dim sum plates that we enjoyed were the bbq pork buns, the shrimp dumplings and the sesame balls (our favorite). Unfortunately we did not like the other half of our meal. The fried rice had small pieces of a dried jerky like meat and small fried shrimp. It overall was very fishy tasting and none of us really liked it. The ribs were full of gristle, fat and bones leaving very little edible meat. We agreed that the flavor was good but the meat quality was poor. We also thought that the veggie rolls were greasy and flavorless. Lastly, our waiter never came and checked up on us to give us water or ask if we wanted to order more plates. Then when we gave up on that we could not even get him to bring the check. All four of us agreed that we would not be back. Very disappointing.'
