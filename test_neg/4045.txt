b'A disappointment!  Upon ordering my croque monsieur, I was terribly surprised how poorly it was made. It lacked freshness, taste, and quality. The authentic croque monsieur has bechamel sauce, good quality cheese and ham. Mine was cold, rubbery and flavourless cheese, stale baguette and served cold with midocre fries. When politely approaching a waitress expressing my negative opinion on the sandwich.. her response was "The issue is that you don\'t like it, not a problem of the sandwich" I was amazed by her lack of professional people skills and how rude she was. Soon after I was offered by another waitress to order another dish. Which I I did. I requested the quiche Lorraine with fries. Luckily it was a bit more pleasing to my belly and palette. Fortunately, the raspberry tart I have ordered was outstanding! A lovely balance of sweet and tart with a generous amount of fresh raspberries. All this to say, the service was poor, the main dishes lacked authentic French taste and freshness. I will be seeking another place when craving French cuisine.'
