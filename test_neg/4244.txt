b'Wow, what happened here!? I had heard that Giuseppe left and much of the staff with him. Now the place is a shadow of its old self. No cocktail menu, because they wantyou to focus on the wine. That would be cool if the wine list were longer, I guess. The area needed the cocktail bar that was the old Livermore, not this new business when we have Dinette and Taglio for Italian style food. They do have more filling food now and it looks a lot like the Bar Marco menu but vaguely more Italian. I\'m sure it\'s fine but I don\'t really care to try it because I was coming here for a cocktail before dinner elsewhere. Thankfully, they made me an "off menu" Last Word from the "off menu" list of five cocktails they still make. It was fine, but I won\'t be back since I came here for the drinks and Giuseppe. I\'d give up one or the other, but to lose both changed this place for the worse.'
