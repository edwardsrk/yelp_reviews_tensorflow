b"Pros:Nice bathroom and large jetted tub.They did bring up an additional blanket and shampoo quickly when we asked.Cons:  Plan on walking through tube alotPlan on paying for taxisPlan on getting charged a $22.50 resort charge per day.  I complained about the resort charge and eventually got them to refund the charge.  I would never stay somewhere off the strip again.  It was a blunder on my part and I didn't factor in all the extra expenses of staying somewhere off the strip.  The buffet was dingy and had old food.  You could taste the staleness.  I also got a little sick after eating there.  The free wi-fi is only for speeds of 256k - that's just too slow.  They'll charge you extra for a reasonable speed.  The hotel is already expensive enough, this is blatant gouging.Maintenance:  I stayed there 3 days.  There was a light with a burned out bulb.  I reported it to 2 different people on the front desk and it was never replaced during my stay there."
