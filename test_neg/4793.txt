b"It was a rainy sunday afternoon and all of the korean restaurants were either closed or full. We decided to come here since it was the only place that wasn't full (it actually only had 1 other customer lol) and we were desperate. We ordered a beef and octopus hotpot for $20 and shared it amongst 5 people (even though it's usually only for 2 people).I have to say it was pretty bad. There was barely any beef in the hot pot(which was honestly the only thing we wanted to eat anyways). The soup was way too spicy and lacked flavour... it was like drinking spicy water. The octopus was just plain bad (way too chewy and had a weird taste). There were some vegetables in the hotpot too but it wasn't anything special. I was really let down by this place and will not be returning."
