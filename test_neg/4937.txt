b"Very nice atmosphere lots of TVs and literally the worst chicken wings I've ever had in my life. They were very tough and over done. They gave you two little skinny pieces of carrot and celery and blue cheese dressing was very very runny. The drinks were good but my wife had a turkey wrap and you had to look twice to find a turkey. It's really too bad. The french fries were awesome. I spend the winter about a half a mile from there and it's disappointing that I won't be back."
