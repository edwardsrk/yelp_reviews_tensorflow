b'Although in a questionable location, the inside appeared clean and open. The dining area was darker and I didn\'t go in that side. I was greeted upon entering by Juan. Both men in the kitchen were friendly. I ordered to go and was brought a warm garlic knot while I waited; it was delicious. I took my meal home, the price was just over $30 for a 10" pizza with about 4 toppings, and 10 chicken wings. The wings were ok, not great, but I don\'t care for breaded chicken wings - they get soggy. The pizza looked great but had no flavor aside from the anchovies. The crust was as bland as eating a pizza box. The dinner didn\'t sit well in my stomach. Sadly, as nice as the owner was, I can\'t recommend the food. The gelato looked good but I didn\'t try it. Great service- not great food.'
