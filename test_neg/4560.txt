b"Yes... I experienced much better. lets start with the entrance... so i walk in, and there is this guy at the entrance asking me if i am on the guest list... 'come on buddy' i have been through this show before.. why does he even bother asking me... nope. i am not on the guest list... and guess what... in 2 seconds he will welcome me in... so why even bother with making this 'show'. [I am sorry, I just cant get it... guest lists, and stuff, who do they think they are, open the gate, let me go in... now! :)]anyway, 2 seconds and i am, I am going downstairs for an expensive coast check.. at least the lady there behind the counter was extremely nice.. on her Tip jar she she says she want to go to Paris... so i left enough tip to help her... and i also got a big big smile...from there ... it is just going downwards...  the service is bad... not all the barwomen know how to make the rights drinks and how to shake them...  nothing was real... most of the things there were fake. this place has a huge potential... but they just dont leverage it...i will surely visit again and will keep you updated"
