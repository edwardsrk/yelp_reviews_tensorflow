b"This was my first time there and possibly my last. Like some of the other sub-par reviews state - the food was quite good, but the service was mediocre. I understand being understaffed, having an off day, etc. But then tell us that and don't make us wait ONE HOUR for a meal of simple poached eggs and grits without an explanation or apology. Regardless, $40 for two breakfasts and two cups of coffee is outrageous even with the best service. To top it off... it's my birthday, so this was supposed to be my special breakfast with my daughter.  Oh well, live and learn!"
