b"Came here bc I was craving ribs, I was thoroughly disappointed in the ribs. They were not fresh they were dry and tough. The brisket we had was good, but the beans were cold and the cheddar corn bread was just cornbread? Nothing special about this place, I had high expectations given the reviews and a friends recommendation, but I was disappointed. I hate when new restos do so well and then let quality slip over time, it's unfortunate."
