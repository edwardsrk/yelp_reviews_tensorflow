b'I was very excited to visit this place after reading the reviews - I ordered the shrimp, Sonoran dogs, and the baby back ribs.  The shrimp was excellent, and this item would be what I recommend people getting.  The Sonoran dogs were fine, grilled bun is an added touch.  But where I think this place really disappointed is the baby back ribs - I would say they were downright lousy.  They were so dry and black that I went back up to the cashier and asked "is this how your ribs normally are like?" and the response I got was, "yes this is because the sauce is on the side".  I\'m a patron of other bbq places in the valley (little ms bbq, famous daves, and even joes bbq) and I\'ll say hands down this is the worst I\'ve ever had.  I would have been better off buying ribs at the grocery store for $20 and throwing them in the microwave under a wet paper towel in a brown paper bag.  Do yourself a favor and skip this item if you visit.'
