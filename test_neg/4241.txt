b'I think Circus Circus runs this place to handle the overflow from would be guests who can\'t  pass the Circus Circus entrance exam or something.  After all, they must have  "some" standards at Circus Circus.  Quite a strange crowd to be found under its roof.  I can brave it for the cheap beers and easy in, easy out, which earns it two stars.  Not much else of interest here to me.'
