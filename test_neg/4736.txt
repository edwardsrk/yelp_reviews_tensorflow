b'It\'s never good when you feel like you have to start a review with "where to begin."So...where to begin?Let\'s start with the service. If you haven\'t noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it\'s just being nice - ya, that\'s pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I\'ve ever had. Let\'s start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I "Young man" and "Young lady" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I\'m not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn\'t old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I\'m not 5, I\'m not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don\'t call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if "our food was delicious." Unfortunately it wasn\'t, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it\'s obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don\'t care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I\'m dining (unless I\'m at Dick\'s Last Resort). Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I\'m sad we didn\'t pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave\'s and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don\'t see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn\'t seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable. Upon telling the server that the food wasn\'t "delicious." She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren\'t satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave\'s. Lucille\'s at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I\'d rather just not eat than have to eat here again.Famous Daves...you are the weakest link...goodbye.'
