b"I have gone to this location twice to purchase a soundbar. The first trip the sales people went through 5 different soundbars all of which they couldn't get to work. I was in the store for nearly two hours waiting for one of these keystone cops to be able to get one of these speakers working. Same experience the second time. Nothing is hooked up properly. The staff has no knowledge of the product. This is sad"
