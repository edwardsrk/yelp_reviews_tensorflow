b"Went to Sugar Bowl for dinner & ice cream. We had a cheeseburger & milk shakes (that DIDN'T come with French Fries OR whipped Cream; who does that!) The burger was completely tasteless... Certainly NOT grilled; watery. Toppings were fresh & delicious however. The decor is definitely vintage gone bad! Johnny Rockets does a better job with better tasting food & ENERGY! Overall, Sugar Bowl is cute, but needs a new Chef, uniforms for their staff (yoga pants are unprofessional), music & life breathed back into this tired restaurant that's seen better days."
