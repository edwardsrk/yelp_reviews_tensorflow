b"Nothing special about TriSports.  Prices are usually more than other online stores, and it carries a relatively limited range of brands.  If one is racing for USAT, however, he/she is obligated to give TriSports money.  Nice gig the store has: shotty customer service, USAT uniform deal, and high prices.I've never physically been to the store, and prefer to limit my purchases to items required by USAT.  As well, I try to limit my interaction with TriSports to online sales and email support.  There has been only one person I have spoken to who is 1) pleasant and 2) knowledgeable.  I've conferred with USA Team USA teammates and they have all had similar experiences.Bottom line: With so many other online shops around, there is really no reason to do business with TriSports unless you absolutely have to.  If you must, shop at your own risk."
