b'I absolutely LOVE Korean BBQ and sadly did NOT LOVE dining here for Mother\'s Day. Our experience sort of ruined a supposed special day for my mom and here\'s why: The restaurant is clean, the lighting is bright and the place is very well-decorated but Lee\'s has the most disappointing prices, grills on the tables and customer service! It was Mother\'s Day and you\'d think they\'d be prepared for a huge crowd but I suppose not. We were seated promptly but did not get help for the next 20 or so minutes. We were a party of 8 and it was our first time dining at Lee\'s. We finally put in our orders and the first batch of food was delicious. The meats were flavorful and spicy. We were ready for round 2 and when we politely asked the server if we are able to order, she brushed us off rudely saying, "Hold on! I\'m the only server!" Sheesh, sorry for being an inconvenience! This happened several times during lunch and really rubbed us the wrong way. We asked for food, waters, sides, napkins.. things that are normally asked for but we felt like we shouldn\'t or couldn\'t ask for them. One example is we asked for one more Steamed Egg and Soup and she goes, "You already have two." Yes, we are aware of that. But they\'re delicious, it\'s AYCE and there were 8 of us so.. I mean.. we thought we could ask for more. We asked for chicken because she walked away before we could finish our order and she said, "Finish your meats first then I\'ll bring it."Honestly, the delicious food does not compensate for the extremely poor customer service.  We had one grill on our table that was located to the very right of the table so the patrons seated on the left had to wait for the cooked meats from the people seated on the right side. The prices are ridiculous for the horrible treatment you get from the workers. The server eventually got nicer at the end when it got less busy and by that time, we were ready to depart already.All in all, that will be my first and last time at Lee\'s. I\'d rather eat Korean BBQ from somewhere else after my experience.'
