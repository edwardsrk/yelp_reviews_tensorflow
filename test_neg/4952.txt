b"Any modern day traveler compares airports. It's a fact of life. The process of checking-in, going through security, and getting into your seat are all on a timeline. Sometimes we're rushed, sometimes we're way early, and sometimes we're right on the money. I tend to be the first of these three... I usually snooze twice, take my time showering, and forget that I have to put gas in the rental or time the subway the night before. Where do these all play into this review?... Well, Cleveland Hopkins Airport has the WORST security checkpoint at that I have ever encountered (@ American Airlines gates). Now, I only went through one of the three TSA checks, but that's good enough to make the above statement. The line was extremely long, with no place to go as the roped off area held 20 people max. The entire process took nearly 40-minutes, and lucky for me, I had just that much time to wait. Recommendations: Arrive EARLY!"
