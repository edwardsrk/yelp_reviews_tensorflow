b'I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it - like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir-fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.'
