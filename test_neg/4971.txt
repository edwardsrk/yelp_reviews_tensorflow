b'I was simply lied to. I took my car in for an explicit rattle in the passenger door. Rusty, the service guy stated "oh yeah this is covered under warranty". I had to pay for a loaner car and he told meater in the day that the techs couldn\'t find anything. I left a voicemail that was never returned and I had no update. We agreed I would come back the next morning. I talked to an actual tech who told me that the warranty only covers rattles for 12/12000 which I was NEVER informed of. Moral of the story is don\'t take their word on anything. Funny when the service advisor was caught in the lie, he bolted.'
