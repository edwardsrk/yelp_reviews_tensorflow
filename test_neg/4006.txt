b"Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food."
