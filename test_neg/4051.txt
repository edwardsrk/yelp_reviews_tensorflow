b'Thought it would be decent, however I did not like the service and experience I had. Visited Royaltea a couple days ago and I got the chocolate mousse with tapioca and red bean. First of all, I dont know why the mousse was salty, it was like an odd sour salty taste and wasn\'t that appetizing. So I thought, okay if I keep drinking I will get use to it but I really didn\'t. I just tried my best to get as much topping while sipping the drink and not the mousse. By the time I finished the drink itself, I still had some topping and it got mixed with the mousse and I could not finish it because the mousse tasted so disgusting with red bean and tapioca. Also the service was not the best, waited like 1 minute to get the cashier\'s attention while the other workers were facing me and me saying "excuse me" loudly. Other workers were just eating and talking to each other, 4 of them clearly made eye contact with me and I was ready to order and cashier\'s back towards me. Even my friend could hear me trying to get their attention but it took a while.'
