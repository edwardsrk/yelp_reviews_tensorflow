b"I've been searching for a Korean restaurant that served meat jun. I came across this location after seeing meat jun on yelp in their photos. When I got there I was told that their menu has changed a lot. I was really bummed but we decided to give it a try. Their food wasn't bad just not good enough for me to come back. I was also excited to eat the corn cheese but honestly it tasted spoiled. And it's pretty pricey.I loved the service there though! Edwin was our server and he was extremely friendly with great service. The owner/cook was also super nice and has great service too!"
