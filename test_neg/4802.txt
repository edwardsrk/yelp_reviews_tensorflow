b"Tried the pizza for the first time today, I was expecting NY style pizza which it was not. Was with some co-workers, one of the girls asked for the soup of the day as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have one, asked for the free passion bread when dinning in, as mentioned on the menu, they didn't have any because the manager wasn't there and the cooks don't listen to the waiters/waitresses we were told. Overall it was ok."
