b"We were a little hesitant to even try this place due to the many warnings of mediocre food and poor service. But, it was close and we were thirsty and hungry so...I agree that this is a nice looking, clean place. It would probably be great to watch a game. The country twang was turned up a little high for me but I can't knock them for that. If it was gameday, I'm sure I would be happy.Our server was new and did a decent job. Never let our beer glasses go empty. However, I must agree with many others regarding said beer glasses: do not use Mason jars, and especially WARM Mason jars to serve your beer! I get that they are trying for a theme of sorts and they are OK for mixed drinks, but the stupid jars don't work for beer. I couldn't even drink my first one for over 10 minutes because of the massive amount of head on the beer from the jar. By the time it calmed down, it was warm. On to the food. My friend ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich. The chicken was soggy and almost room temp. We think they used sauce straight out of the fridge which cooled the chicken and made it a mess. The bread was barely toasted and got super soggy quickly. I had a burger and asked for it to be medium rare. It was almost raw and was supposed to have avocado on it. It had less than a teaspoon of storebought guacagoo on it. I know because I scraped it off. We pointed this out to our new server and he just laughed. Not funny. Asked for the manager and she never came. Finished our beers, sent both plates over 2/3 full back, paid our bills and said goodbye to The Haymaker.Two stars because the fries were good."
