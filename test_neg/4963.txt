b"My first visit was last night with a friend, and we experienced terrible service. I'm not a big complainer or full of difficult requests as I worked in the industry for 5 years, but this was bad.  After we were sat and given menus, we were basically deserted. We had already picked what we wanted to order for dinner yet hadn't even been brought waters yet. We had to walk to the bar to ask if anyone was going to come serve us at the table.Finally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal. I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+. If I'd had more time I would have asked to speak to a manager."
