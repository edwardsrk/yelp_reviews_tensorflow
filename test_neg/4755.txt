b'The wait wasn\'t too bad for a Sunday morning.  But we were taken to a dining room that was just "too open".  We got no feelings of privacy or anything, being sat in the dead center of a very noisy dining room.  The bathrooms are so cramped and crowded, which is uncomfortable.  The menu.. well, let\'s just say, that sometimes less is more, and BBD has way too many options on theirs.  It\'s confusing to order and when you do, it\'s obvious that the cooks make the "easy" meals first because my food came out ice cold.  The food is nothing to write home about, in my opinion.  I really wanted to find a new Sunday breakfast spot, but BBD just didn\'t deliver.'
