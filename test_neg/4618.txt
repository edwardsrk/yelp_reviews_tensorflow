b"Welp. I don't think I have ever been so pumped to try a new restaurant before than I was when I saw Tako opened, and was getting rave review. I've been waiting patiently to get the right time to get everyone together. Finally got around to it last weekend. I gotta say, I was SO underwhelmed. We walked in and were promptly seated per our reservations, but it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come say hi. Long enough that we paroozed the menu and already picked out what we wanted. We ordered drinks; one was a mixed drink which was TOO strong of a drink.Secondly, the tacos were good but not that expensive good. I know a lot of people really enjoyed it, but I just don't think it's my taste."
