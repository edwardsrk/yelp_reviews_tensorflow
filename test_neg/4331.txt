b"I used to really like their turkey panini for some reason. Simple. Perfect. Right amount of turkey and cheese and pesto aioli, at the right temperature with the right crunchiness. But now it's served cold on a ciabatta bun, and it tastes like every other boring, overpriced cold turkey sandwich with too much turkey and bland, dry bread. Meh."
