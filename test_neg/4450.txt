b'Nothing special, manager or cashier lady acted all weird because I was using a free coupon for signing up in there email club. I also asked her do I need to print out coupons or can I show on phone, she never answered me and was rude!!! I saw bfast plates being served as I was waiting,  looks like food I can get at home. My free pastry pie though was great.'
