b'Well, we approached the entrance, only to see a "mom" sitting in her car combing her hair in blithe acceptance of the fact her young (6-7 year old) son  was - yes, you\'re reading it right - dropping trou and peeing on the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the Copp\'s front picture window, in full view of the entire world.  From the sneer and scowl set to her face, saying something would have invited an (un)righteous indignation by an ignorant woman apparently egregiously put upon by the world\'s demands, such as, uh, caring for your spawn.  About the timbre of the clientele and store, from what I can tell.  Call me a snob.....but I prefer to keep toilets and toiletries separated by at least a partition.  No thanks.'
