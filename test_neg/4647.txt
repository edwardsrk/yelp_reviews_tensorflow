b'This place was one of my favorite places to go to in China town. My whole family loves this place. However I brought a friend of mine recently for the first time and the meat was not cooked well it was pink. I ordered beef and chicken and they were all shade of pink. The new management is awful! I was not impressed as I used to. I hope they can improve this and return the old cook! Presentation was not the best!'
