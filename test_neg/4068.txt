b"When it comes to Taco Bell, I I know that I'm sacrificing quality of food and service in exchange for convenience and speed, but unfortunately this time they really underdelivered.During a recent late night drive-through visit in addition to both the rice and shredded chicken being bone dry (in their defense, it was 15 minutes before closing, but still, if it's that bad, don't serve it!), they also forgot to an empanada we ordered .  Normally it's not a big deal to forget to bag an item, but when it takes 15+ minutes to finally get just a damned empanada, that's just ridiculous."
