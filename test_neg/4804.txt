b'The acid test for a Greek restaurant is clearly going to be the gyro, just as fish and chips is the test for a pub kitchen.  If you think paying $7.05 before tax for three small half dried up strips of gyro meat is acceptable, then you might like Crazy Jims. The big chunk of raw onion and the hard pink tomato slice did not make it any more apppetizing.  Now that IS crazy Jim.'
