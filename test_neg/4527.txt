b'My fianc\xc3\xa9 and I originally drove to this side of town to eat at Yama, but the wait was over an hour. We found Sakana on yelp and after viewing the reviews we decided to try it out. Upon our arrival, there was confusion about where the line was or if the hostess took names. We were seated about ten minutes later. The decor in this place is a little confusing. The ambiance is that of a college dorm, with chalk board walls and beer signs. The seats are wooden with no backs.We ordered appetizers first which came out in 3-5 mins. Then we decided to order rolls and we waited for over 30 mins! The waiter kept apologizing for the wait. After waiting we only received one out of four rolls that we ordered and by that time we were ready to leave.We waiting another 20 mins for the waiter to bring us our check. Over all experience;The service was awful, the table next to us kept getting their rolls promptly and we waited. The place is unorganized when it comes to service, they kept bringing the wrong rolls to the table next to us.The food was decent. The cuts of fish were big and rice portions small. Save yourself the 26.99 and go to Yama sushi or Sushi Mon. Those are my go to places and this will be the last time I try a new sushi spot.'
