b'So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review.'
