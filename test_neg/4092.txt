b'Not as good as it once was... A few years ago when Pink Polish first opened I was blown away by the quality of product and service provided. Not to mention skill of the techs. I went only to PP for two years straight and recruited all my girlfriends as well. We even had a bridal shower there and it was extremely well done. However I moved away for a few years and just recently returned.  I was so excited to go back and was thrilled to find out my favorite tech still worked there!  Unfortunately though I left horribly disappointed.  The prices have gone up. Expected. But the quality of product has gone significantly down. The over all atmosphere looks inviting until you overhear the techs and management talk behind each others backs. I did try and go back 2 more times and found myself equally as disappointed. Long story short I found a new nail salon.'
