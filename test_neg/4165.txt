b'So we recently moved to Brookline and this place is just up the road. Having a great pizza shop within walking distance is a great thing, unfortunately it is not this place... After two orders of undercooked pizza we tried a final time tonight and specifically asked for the pizza "well done" hoping that way it would come out cooked correctly. Sadly this was the most undercooked yet and since neither of us enjoy raw dough we won\'t be back..'
