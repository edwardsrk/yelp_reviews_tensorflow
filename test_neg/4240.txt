b"Just ate what I could from ordering take out from this location.  Barbecue Mac with braised pork, it was soooo hot it almost caused blisters on my tongue.  I looked at my receipt to see if somehow it said ghost pepper barbecue mac, it didn't.  I called and told them they said it was probably the marinated pork, marinated in what, ghost peppers?  Could enjoy just ate around the sauce and pork, the garlic cheese bread was good though.  Thinking about it, it might have gotten hotter as I watched it sit completed on the counter and not bagged until I got someones attention.  There seems to be plenty of staff just none doing anything with the exception of one cook and the girl taking orders.  Customer service is not high on the priority list for this Noodles and Company location."
