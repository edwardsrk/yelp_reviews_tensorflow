b"Uhg. I have not gone to Chili's in a few years. The service is poor, food is so-so, and priced a bit high for what you're getting. And recently I tried them again.. they are consistently disappointing.Waited 15 minutes after sitting for drinks. Waited 40 minutes to order. Received food 1hr 15min after sitting. My burger was good but the onion rings were cold and mushy. Will not be back.For the record, I like Fridays, Red Robin, and Applebees."
