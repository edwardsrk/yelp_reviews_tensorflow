b'My bf and I are from the Los Angeles area and frequent sushi restaurants at least a couple times a month. One of our favorites is Sugarfish, just to give you an idea of the quality we are used to. Sushi 21 has the staff and a cute location, but the chefs are definitely not what we had expected. The rolls were much smaller than at other restaurants and the tempura shrimp tasted as if it had been breaded with bread crumbs (!). It was strange to taste the albacore tuna with a liquidy garlic sauce on it and the eel was tasteless. The mussels were also covered in a clear liquidy garlic sauce rather than a spicy mayo mixture that normally accompanies baked mussels. My bfs rolls were smaller than he had preferred (philadelphia but the other I forgot) and he said that the quality was poorer than other sushi restaurants in the area.The only reason I am leaving two stars is because the staff were courteous and the environment was pleasing, they also offer affordable ayce (but again, the quality of the food is lacking).'
