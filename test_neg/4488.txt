b'John came out to repair my AC and discovered that I had a leak in the line and had lost all the Freon in the unit. He offered some options for repair and I chose to go with a liquid sealant through the lines, to try and repair the leak, and to refill the unit with Freon. John said this was the cheapest option but did tell me it was not guaranteed to work. The repair did not last, so we requested a quote for a new unit. At the same time I also requested quotes from 3 other companies for the exact unit. After looking over the quotes John was the highest by more than 30%. I have not complaints about the service John gave but I would be sure to compare prices for replacement parts/service when using him.'
