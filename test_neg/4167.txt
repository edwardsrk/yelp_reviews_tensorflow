b"First I'd like to say that Nick and Angie have done a tremendous job bringing great beer to the burgh...this was my go to for one of kind, can't get anywhere else beer.  Sadly, I noticed a trend of serving beers under 7% in snifters a few months ago.  $7 or 8 for 10oz of a beer I can get anywhere else in a pint is just a little presumptous and overpriced. If you look at their draft list, there are few beers than make it into a pint glass now.  Snifters and tulips seem to be the norm. I'm sad to say I've stopped going to Caliente because of this.  While I love what they bring to the table and their pizza is really good...I can go elsewhere and spend less, and have the same experience and beer now.  I'd suggest happy hour if you want to try it out.  Half priced drafts from 430-630pm."
