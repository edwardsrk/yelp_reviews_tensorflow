b"I would give one star but I felt our server and the pizza was great. The thing that threw us off is that we found a hair in our Brussels. We have no intention of getting over on the place but the manager said he inspected the hair and mentioned that none of the workers had that blond strand so maybe it was either my wife's, or it was flying and landed in it due to the ventilation. He didn't charge us for the dish, but he did make us feel uncomfortable like we had intention of getting over on the place, in which we didn't. I may give this place a second chance, of course with only the pizza and beer."
