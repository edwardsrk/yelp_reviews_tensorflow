b'Three tables on a Saturday night should be a clue.We had shabu shabu. It was just ok. Upcharges for everything including sauce.On our way out, we saw a $20 all you can eat BBQ menu. They knew it was our first time and couldnt be bothered to even mention that special.Left a sour taste in our mouths. Will never return.'
