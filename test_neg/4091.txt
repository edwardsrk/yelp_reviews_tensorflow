b"This reviews comes as a surprise to me as I've heard how good the food is at the Cleveland location..... at the Hudson location, not good.  The bartender who assisted with my pickup order is the only reason this has a two star review. She was very nice and pleasant.  The vegetarian burrito and vegetable enchiladas on the other hand were not. The green sauce came out of a can about 15 seconds prior to being put on the food. The waxy cheese covered mushy corn and I believe flour tortillas.  Vegetarian at this location means I hope you like peppers and onions because that's all your getting.  We are fans of good guacamole and have heard there's was good so we tried it--- threw half of the 2 Oz we were given (for 6.99) away. 95% chunky onion and tomato, and really no flavor.  If the 4 people sitting at a table being the only customers at 6pm on a Thursday night wasn't a clue, the food surely was a sign to avoid Luchita's. Sadly."
