b"I have to say I'm disappointed. I love a good burger and the fact that one of the most hyped burger joint in the country was opening up right down the street was huge. I didn't go right away when it opened, but finally after a few months I was able to go. After waiting 40 minutes in line on a Wednesday at 2:00pm, I was able to order. The prices definitely surprised me for what I thought was a fast food style burger spot. I got a double burger, fries and chocolate shake and ran me $18! The quality does NOT live up to that price. It's very similar quality to 5 guys and the shake was nothing special. It costs extra just to get whipped cream. So all in all very disappointed. If you want an overpriced burger that really is nothing special, and want to wait quite a while to get it, then this is your spot. For me I'll just go to one of the other much better burger spots at that price around Charlotte."
