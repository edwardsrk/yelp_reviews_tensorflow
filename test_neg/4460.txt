b"Sadly was disappointed in this place.  I came here looking for authentic Italian food last night and instead left feeling unsatisfied and rushed through our meal.  I ordered the meat lasagna and to be honest it was very very bland.  The cheese and sauces were sporadic and it didn't seem like it was cooked thoroughly.  We were one of the last people in there and we got the feeling they wanted us to leave ASAP.  The drink menu was very limited.  When we walked in the front door, we ran into other couples eating and we didn't know where to go so we tried to make our way to the middle (as the place is a small house).  Eventually we were seated...it's a very intimate atmosphere and quiet which I appreciated.  I just wish the food and service could have been something to say I'd come back for and unfortunately I can't."
