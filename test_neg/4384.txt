b'I am not a fan of this airport.  Maybe I am a bit of a snob since I travel a lot for work , but I expected better.  Many cities fail to understand that for a lot of people this is the first impression of your city with a large number of travellers.The food selection is meager at best and even in the renovated section pickings are on the slim side.  No thanks Cleveland, if you want to get more people here step up your game a touch on the airport, I doubt that many people are going to buy Rock Band for their Xbox in the airport. Let the rock and roll thing go, let it go...'
