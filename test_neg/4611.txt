b'Despite claiming I would not be back after my last review, a friend talked me into having lunch there again.  They have pared down their menu considerably even since last fall (it seems), and they have also pared down their portion size. My friend had a wrap that was clearly made with the smallest tortilla possible (it wasn\'t even the length of my hand), and my cup of chili was smaller than the average coffee cup.  There is quite a bit of chicken on the lunch menu but only two meat dishes:  the pulled pork sandwich and the "barely naked burger."  (I really miss the steak salad!)  I guess lunch isn\'t their emphasis anymore.'
