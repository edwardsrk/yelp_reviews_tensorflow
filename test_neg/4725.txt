b"All I got was tikka masala. It cost 15$ and it came in a very small container. 15$ for a tiny amount of food is not worth it. I have been to Indian buffets that are cheaper and are still very good. It's no wonder this place is always dead. Small portions big prices. I expect this place to be out of business soon"
