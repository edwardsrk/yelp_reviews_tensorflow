b"We wen't to this place last night for dinner. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. We looked online at the menu before we went over to get an idea of what we would order. We ordered a Canadian Burger, a Meat & Potato burger, a poutine, mac & cheese and fried pickles. We spent about 50 dollars but wanted to try a bit of everything. First off the burgers were so disappointing. The Meat & potato burger was supposed to have  a crisp potato patty on it with gravy. Instead i got runny mashed potatoes mixed with gravy slopped on the burger. The Canadian burger should have had pea-meal bacon on it and from the description and photo online, several slices. When we received the burger it had one small slice and a glob of grainy mustard on it. This was quite sad since the actual meat of the burger and the bun are very tasty. The poutine we ordered was terrible. The fries were terribly burnt and the box was only half full. There was hardly any gravy on it. We threw most of it out in the trash. The mac & cheese was tasteless and was pretty much just warm cream poured over noodles. The fried pickles were very good. Over all, the meat of the burger and the bun were good, not great. WE won't return."
