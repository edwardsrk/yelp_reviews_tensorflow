b'I wanted to love this place sooooo badly. Here\'s the deal, their bagels are a tasty form of bread but in my opinion they\'re not authentic East coast style bagels which is what I was hoping for. They\'re just not correct in that regard. Outer part is wrong texture, inside wrong density, flavor wrong. That doesn\'t mean that as a piece of bread it wasn\'t good or wasn\'t tasty, it\'s just not really a "real" bagel. It should also be said that most people don\'t care about real bagels, but for me, these are a pass. I gave them 2 stars for nice atmosphere, friendly staff and having Infusion brand coffee but I wouldn\'t. It the bagels again. For me the search continues!'
