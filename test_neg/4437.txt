b'The food here is mostly very weird. The restaurant actually smelled like blood (not kidding). And nobody in our party of 6 felt right after eating there....varying levels of food poisoning with the common denominator being the chicken bucket. The popcorn pot de creme was good but $8 for probably an ounce. Overall, very overpriced and the food is weird/induced stomach problems. This was my second time there and the first was not impressive either. Would not return.'
