b'Without a doubt, the sushi here was above average. Only 8 pieces of the dynamite roll and I was beyond being full. However, the service is a different story. After first reading the reviews, Mi-Ne appeared to be a comfortable location that was close to where I worked. Upon arrival, we quickly realized how cramped up the space was. My friends and I had to squeeze sit within the boundaries of the booth, which was not exactly what I expected from this sushi place. We waited nearly 30 minutes for someone to take our order. When we signaled for them to come, they said that they would be there shortly, and not arrive within 10 minutes. We signaled several of their employees, but they appeared too frazzled to even come and stop by our booth.Nonetheless, the food quality was still on par. I would have liked to not be starving prior to the arrival of our food.'
