b"Since I found Great Wall (35th and Camelback) and Little Saigon (58th and Glendale) I don't like Panda Express. Plus my favorite SweetFire Chicken Breast is nothing but fried dough and not much chicken in it. If you want to spent $7~9 I'd rather want to eat dim sum at Great Wall or Pho noodle at Little Saigon, it worth to drive there."
