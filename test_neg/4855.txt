b"Why I wound up staying here aside (valet lost our car keys!), I suppose I do have to admit that the rooms are 3 stars (er, the new ones at least). We had a nice view of the Strip (including the Bellagio fountains). Good comfy beds. Decent bathroom (though, no tub, just a shower). The decor was decent too. No robes, no minibar. But for a place to rest your head at night in Sin City, you could do way worse. And it's a pretty good central location too.However, there isn't much else to do at the Flamingo. There's a couple of ok shows, but it ends there. The restaurant options are sucky. Room service is no more than 2 stars. The stores are sucky. Etc.So for the right price, it's a good room, but not much else.And then, of course, there's the issue that the valet lost our car keys. Yep, lost our car keys. What are the friggin' odds of that happening? Either way, can't say I would recommend valeting your car here. Why take that gamble?I do have to admit, though, that I like their pool. Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. It's free for locals (after a certain time). And the adult only pool is pretty good too."
