b'Lots of shops. Place is huge.But not sitting anywhere outside shops.Only ONE elevator working in the mall of thousands for people with strollers and infants like us. RIDICULOUS !! Three elevators, one for going up and down to floors 1-3, the other two for going up/down to parking levels. The line up was huge with other families with strollers. We waited 20+ minutes and could never get on, so we took the stairs.NOT A FAMILY FRIENDLY MALLI grew up in Toronto, and love the Eaton Centre for what it is and provides downtown. But, this was not an enjoyable experience. If the Loblaws located in the old Mapleleaf Gardens can do things right so can the Eaton Centre.2 stars until next time'
