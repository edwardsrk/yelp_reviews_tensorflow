b"Was seen as a new patient  today for a follow up from the ER for a cyst. Got an appt quick and with  a male doctor.  Would have preferred  a female but I wanted  in soon. Signed in and wasn't greeted. Did not recieve new patient  paperwork. Then I got called up to register and they got annoyed no one gave it to me. The medical assistant didn't  say who she was nor ask for the paperwork. Appointment went okay. He educated me and ordered  test. Then told me to hold on and never came back. The medical assistant  came back to have me sign paperwork and said some one would call me to schedule  an ultrasound and she walked  out. Huge office. Didn't  show me where the exit was. It was very unprofessional. I work  in the medical field and i dont know if i wanna go back."
