b"The menu looks intriguing and they validate parking for $5 so we decided to try it. We waited at the front for about 5 minutes before anyone offered to seat us, once they finally did the staff was really nice. Note you cannot substitute anything but you can buy extra sides if you like .. which to me is annoying but we dealt. The wings were not hot but room temperature, like they had been sitting under a warmer for a while, the greens tasted as though they were canned, and the waffles were chewy as though they were not cooked completely. All in all the staff, though slow, were really nice but the food wasn't worth the $40 spent."
