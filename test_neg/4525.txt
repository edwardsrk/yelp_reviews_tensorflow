b"What has happened to your food? We were so disappointed. I ordered the chicken mole pablano. . Mole Pablano in general is one of my favorite dishes but your had no taste and was so watered down.. As I tried the salsa , it was so darn hot I asked the waitress if they had a milder salsa or taco sauce whatever I said. I like some heat but this was way too hot. She said we had a child's salsa. Well that wasn't necessary to tell us, I thought, , just bring us a milder sauce.  Never came.The son ordered your fajiatas.  When ordering the dinner the waitress asked if he wanted sour cream and salsa. Usually when asked that, it is for the main course/. Ahead of main dish she brought I guess what was a salad?? with lettuce and sour cream and salsa on it. Weird.His dish seemed like the onions were cooked somewhat, peppers thrown in and this no taste, tough meat.   There was not a hint of even salt and pepper. The dinner came out so fast you knew it was just slapped together.I reminded the waitress about the salsa and she brings this little dish with hot taco sauce. Now granted I may have said Taco sauce but when originally I asked for it, it was clear I wanted milder salsa.  Finally the refried beans were so watered down that I felt like I was eating baby food.Only good thing was my son was able to use it for the fajiatas to give it some flavor. Best thing still at your place are the Margaritas.  I had just taught a cooking class that day was looking forward to one of those.Please look at how your cooks are making things.  Robert Irvine would have thrown most of it out."
