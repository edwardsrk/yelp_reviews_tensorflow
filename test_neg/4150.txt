b'Confused is the word that describes the service here. Every time we asked a question, the first person we asked had no answer so they got "the manager" of which they seem to have a lot. We were ignored for a long time, then when a server came, she seemed surprised to see us. The back room was noisy and they had a TV tuned to the Amazing Race--so annoying. When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn\'t kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was "to-die-for!" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him. The wines were way overpriced and they had no dessert wines or after-dinner drinks. I wouldn\'t go back.'
