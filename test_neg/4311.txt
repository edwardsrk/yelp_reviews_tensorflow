b'Can Pittsburgh get a new "iconic" food item please?  I come here once in a blue moon to introduce an unsuspecting visitor to this regional specialty, aka soggy bread with limp fries and wilted lettuce.  Bland and mushy and messy.  Given that they proudly sell Primanti t-shirts at the airport, I guess this place won\'t be going away any time soon.'
