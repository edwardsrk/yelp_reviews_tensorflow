b"First time.. Only time.I ordered the blue cheese mushrooms burger and waited forever for it to arrive. I was blown away at the tiny size of this $11 burger. It tasted fine, but the price is ridiculous for what this place is. If you want to feel like you're in a nicer place than your average burger joint, I guess it has a certain appeal.Food...? Pretty good.Service...? Super slow and just bad in general.Value...? Not.I don't understand why all these restaurants on Gilbert Rd. have become so full of fluff and high prices. What happened?"
