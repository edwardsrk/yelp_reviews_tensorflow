b"Friendly staff, food mediocre at best. Not all printed menu item available on a Friday night. Pastas were ok but very greasy, burger was decent but expensive. Very small mostly all Northern Italian wine list. Since I am no expert, asked for help from my waitress, telling her what I was looking for. She smiled and recommended the two most expensive wines on the list. She had not tried them. But I should? The vintage was printed wrong on the list when  the wine came but she did not notice. Looked up a few of their wines on wine searcher. Markup is four times retail, not wholesale. Quite a gouge. They seem to try hard to be hip and cool but just come off pretentious. We will not return nor recommend this place. You've been warned. Go to Lola."
