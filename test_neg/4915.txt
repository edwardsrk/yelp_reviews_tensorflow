b"LA Fitness is a mediocre gym that has pretty bad customer service. Registration is a hassle, every now and then you'll get bugged by a trainer to sign up for special training, and the facilities are not always clean.It's convenient because they seem to be everywhere.They claim to be 24 hours, but that is not true. They're only open 24 hrs on M-TH.When you sign up, make sure you don't get ripped off on your monthly plan. Do your research with competing gyms and negotiate. These guys are sharks."
