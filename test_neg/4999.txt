b"They will give you proper value for your car if you want to sell it to them, or you can use their quote as leverage for other places.The process that occurred from the time of claim to gap insurance payment went really well and the finance department does a lot to make it easier on you.The no haggle thing is stress free but it's not for everyone. It depends on what you want I guess.I would say that the finance rate posted on the windows of their cars seems disproportionately high, and researched I shopped around and checked to be sure. My friend got 4 percent lower APR with Carvana.My negative experience:Vehicle caught fire right after electrical service and they don't honor what they tell you.The representatives you talk with seem like good people and genuinely concerned with your issue... but the supervisors sound condescending and unhelpful.The service department sends your car all over the place, or so they did with mine anyway. A while back I had a vehicle in their shop for 30 days, and 2 days after getting it back, it freaking CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE DRIVING. The fire department was called and in putting it out, the car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company. I was told by the service dept. that I would get a service refund since i had the car only two days before it caught on fire. They were very apologetic. They said they would mail it. I never got it. The fire was an electrical fire and originated in an area that was DIRECTLY worked on by Carmax and friends. My insurance did not go after them because they transferred my car to two other shops and figured it would cost more in court costs than would be worth it. The claim adjuster stated that the three service shops would just point the finger at each other until the case dragged out past the point of value.There was miscommunication on the final payment after the gap insurance company covered what they did. It's partly my fault as I wasn't aware that the payment schedule would go back to normal after the gap process. I thought the normal payment schedule was over and I could work with them on what's left. Regardless, they didn't care either way. Details:I was told by a representative,after asking, that the final loan total that gap didn't cover can be split in half and allowed over two months. There was no talk of my payment being considered negative, and considering that they worked with me so much during the gap claim with extensions and whatnot, I didn't think it would be an issue, especially since they had honored what they had told me at every other instance except for the service refund.This ended up biting me as I received a call on the 31st day (after Oct. due date) stating that my payment was late. I explained the agreement, with confidence, and was transferred to the supervisor.The supervisor didn't care about my agreement made and said it was late and I needed to pay the remaining monthly payment. I set up the rest of the payment that would cover my usual car payment to be scheduled that very minute. I was told that despite it being 1 day over the 30 day grace (for negative reporting) it shouldn't be reported late and will be posted that day. Him and I then verified the final payment of loan and the date it was due. THE NEXT CALL WAS THE MOST CRAP SERVICE EVER:I checked credit report and there it was, a negative mark anyway. I called and explained my last call and was transferred to another apathetic supervisor. She said she would listen to my last call. She called me back saying they did nothing wrong despite all that I was told and that my payments and dates previously discussed were pertaining to the final payment to be made instead of the partial payment that would have finished my last payment. I told her she misinterpreted the call as we discussed both of those things at that time. Instead of seeing a miscommunication, which is what it clearly was, she didn't care and basically was being a smart ass. I was infuriated. I told her I wouldn't had even set up the final partial payment that day if I knew it would go on the report as negative anyway. I would have just paid it all and not bothered asking to have it split. She said that maybe next time, I only ask ONE question and not TWO questions (as in questions about two different payments) next time I talk to someone so that everyone can have clarity. WHAT! I'm only allowed to ask one question? I gave my permission for the final payment to set up. She then asked if I had other questions, but why bother if I'm only allowed one?!?!Update: 8-26-17 In hindsight, I shouldn't have had to pay any extra after the car caught fire and should have sued for a list of things I could have sued for. I am wiser now. If shopping for a car again, this place may be an option if the right deal is there. I would likely not use their finance company, and would document every communication extensively. I doubt I'd be unlucky enough to have another car catch fire."
