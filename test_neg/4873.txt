b"I visited on Sunday morning.  The drive thru was busy, so I went inside the store.  Not busy there, but still waited a very long time to get my coffee.  It tasted horrible, so I waited again to return it.  The staffing looked sufficient, they just didn't know what they were doing & didn't care.  Poor customer service, depressing vibe, just not worth it.  I will not return to this store & am trying to break my Starbucks habit in general."
