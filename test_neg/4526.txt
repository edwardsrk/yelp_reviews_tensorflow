b"I would've given three stars if not for the neglected, dust covered ceiling around the fans and vents. That's not a good sign of cleanliness.The food: my chili relleno was spongy, the tacos were soggy, and the enchilada had a weird taste. The rice was bland, but the beans were great.The service was lackadaisical.Wow, I guess I actually didn't like this place. Too bad. It's been here a long time, and this is the first time we've tried it.Oh, the chips and salsa were really good, and the place has an authentic ambience."
