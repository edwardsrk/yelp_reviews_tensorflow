b'Celebrated a special occasion here. Two of us ordered seafood dishes.  Both got sick in the middle of the night. Should have ordered steak like the others in our party - they were fine the next day.  Had seafood here once before when the restaurant first opened years ago. It too was bad.  Should have learned the first time. Will not make the same mistake again.  DO NOT eat the seafood!'
