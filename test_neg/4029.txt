b"I decided to give El Chino a rest and tumbled across the street to Evan'sThis was...interesting.I ordered through eat24 at a quarter to 12. I enter around 12. Ghost town. Finally Evan himself appears and assures me food is coming. Cool.I chill at the bar watching a few people mill around in the kitchen. Mind you, I ordered a Po Boy. So that's not a lot of prep time, right? Another 15 minutes tick by. Someone utilizes the bar.Eventually I'm handed my meal and I skedaddle. So the meal. It was fine. Just a hair under below average. Everything was fresh, thankfully. But the fries weren't the best and the shrimp were just fine. Overall not a super experience.I'm really hoping to change my opinion so I will be returning."
