b"had dinner with the wife for the second time here in 3 years and again a failure and doubtful will be back any time soon..our server was great and informative at the beginning and helped us order appetizer and main courses.. the problem was our main course..be AWARE of the SEA SALT.. I ordered the seafood cannelloni and it's was probably the SALTIEST dish I have never tasted in my lifetime...NOT the one to complain but I HAD TOO.. just that bad..our waitress informed the chef/manager and never introduced himself and said that it was very salty and mentioned the reason was that it depends who is cooking in the kitchen..I thought to my self what.?? what's going on back in that kitchen.?! waited for another 20 minutes for a remake and did NOT enjoyed our dinning experience.. at least they could have bought me a dessert for the inconvenience and for ALL THAT SEA SALT.. BUT nothing.. our waitress disappeared and no sorry or dessert or anything to make us want to come back...I guess I have to know when and who is cooking to expect NO SEA SALT on my dish.. OR no worry and enjoy a good dinner and dinning experience when you have LOLA or Green House Tavern etc. as you next door restaurants...."
