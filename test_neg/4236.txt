b'We saw the episode of Bar Rescue and wanted to check this place out. Had never been in it before so we have nothing to compare its "remodel" to other than the pictures on Yelp. We also read the prior reviews so we went in totally unbiased. We went on a Saturday about 7pm and immediately found seating at the bar. Place wasnt very busy so the service was prompt and friendly. I ordered a Coors Light draft and wife asked about their cider beers and bartender said they only have one. Which is weird because on Bar Rescue they devised a specialty drink for them using a cider beer! It wasn\'t even offered or suggested. So, my Coors came and her only choice of a cider beer. The Coors didn\'t taste at all like Coors and when I pointed that out to the bartender she said others had said the same thing that day and that the lines must have been switched. Then why the hell keep serving it!! She replaced it with a Coors bottle. The bar was nice and they have a big picture of Taffer from Bar Rescue on the wall so they must have taken his advise on something. But couldn\'t tell on what or where. NO ONE was eating. The 3 or 4 local patrons at the end of the bar were definitely regulars otherwise I am sure that their loud, obnoxious four letter word shouts would not have tolerated. The female of the group was the most obnoxious. What a shame. Taffer wasted his time and money.It was one drink and gone.We wont be back.'
