b"The only reason I'm giving two stars is that they were able to get me in same day, the place was really nice, and had good prices. That being said my tech was obviously very inexperienced. My pedicure took over an hour, she did not clip my nails on one side, did not do the standard pedicure steps in order, the massage was only done on my legs and hurt, finally someone else had to step in to finish. When the second lady came to finish she thankfully cleaned things up a bit before applying the polish. I didn't do a design as I wanted since the appointment took so long and I was already late for a lunch date. I may give them another try but make an appointment with the tech who finished things up."
