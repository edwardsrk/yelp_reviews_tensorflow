b"Dude.  I am so bummed.  This is pretty much my most favorite restaurant in Dallas and I was SO excited to find that there is one here.  Sadly, it's not the same and the standards are definitely completely different.  I ordered my favorite dish - the enchiladas veracruz - and they came out a bit sub standard.  You see, Cantina Laredo originated in Dallas and in the Park Cities, it's ace.  They are ON it.  The manager always comes by your table to check on you, the service is impeccable, the food is fresh, crisp, and amazing.  In Scottsdale, it was slimy - the sauteed veggies came out mushy and deluged in oil, not sauteed to perfection.  The rice tasted like it had been under a warmer for a while and in Dallas, that is a serious no-no.  I passed up on some other choices to eat here and I wish I hadn't.  Who knows what else I might have discovered.  Oh well...."
