b"The rating makes me wonder what is going on here. So came here with my colleague thinking that this is a legit Malaysian restaurant. Well seems like most people here order the Laksa noodle. So not sure if this place is only good at making that dish.My colleague and I both ordered the Rendang beef with rice combo. First off, I have been to many Malaysian restaurant and none of it tasted like the Rendang beef I had here. The color was off to begin with. It didn't have the spice kick to it. Its good that the dish wasn't salty but at the same time it doesn't have a strong flavor to it either. I showed the picture to my Singaporean and Malaysian friend and they all said the beef color is off. So this is a fake Malay place or this place doesn't know how to make Rendang beef. Also this place is not busy at all. No one really walk in. Not even take out. I feel sorry for the owner running this place. Definitely need to work on the recipe if they want to stay in business."
