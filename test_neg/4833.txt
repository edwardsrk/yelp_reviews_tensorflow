b'DO NOT EAT HERE! AFTER I ATE HERE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER I HAD THE RUNS! FOOD WAS AWEFUL, OLD AND DISAPPOINTING! The restaurant was empty on a Wed. 10 o\'clock PM. Our server was nice, (Chase), knowlegable, however when we complained about the corn it was raw. Chase, explained that it was a different type of corn so they stay firmer when cooked...I never heard of a certain corn that when cooked tasted and felt like RAW CORN when bitten into it. That is a LIE. Later in the conversation he offered to exchange it for another side, we declined. We ordered a Steampot, 2 Lobsters, sausage, 6 shrimps and a pound of clams, 5 Alarm Hurricane Margarita, a captains kid meal. Our meal was horrible! We ate what we could and brought the rest for our dogs to eat since I paid for it. What a waste of money! Your restaurant cooks seafood all day long, how do you get it wrong, your chefs need to be retrained to know that seafood cooks quick and it is imperitive to keep an eye on seafood if cooked too long it becomes RUBBERY! My 19 month old son did not want to eat his food, which was unusual, because he is an eater. So I tried his food horrible the a 1 small piece of fish, OVERFRIED! (The piece of fish was around 2 1/2 inches in length maybe 3 inches at the most.) It seemed like the fish had been refried. Old fish. I was totally disappointed. I did not speak to the manager, it\'s obvious that it wouldn\'t have helped to tell anyone. Since the manager must be CLUELESS, the atmosphere was sad. This is probably the worst seafood I have had ever.The service was not attentive, when asked for a little time to look at the menu I timed him waiting 10 minutes before I looked for him and found him NO where to be found. Waited 5 more min. He was in the kitchen. I finally had to bother the bartender by eye contact only, unlike the others he was doing his job and the servers as well. When the place is empty I expect for the wait staff/server to PAY attention to the 1 customer that he has. I asked for the server for more tartar sauce for my son, (19 months old, he can\'t speak yet.) Chase brought after I asked a second time. My son tried it and pushed it aside and kept using the empty tartar that he had?! So I told him it\'s the same thing, and pushed it back to him...but he didn\'t use it! Puzzled I dipped my finger in the "tartar" sauce Chase had brought and to my surprise it was Blu cheese dressing! :0( I feel so cheated I think I spent $60.00 on crappy rubbery lobsters. I will be YELPING THIS BECAUSE SEAFOOD CHAINS LIKE YOURS SHOULD BE EXPERTS AT COOKING SEAFOOD!*SERGIO the GM called me quick 30 Min. after I posted this review. He apoligized and offered a free meal for our next visit, I told him I will not return, but I feel I deserve my money back. He said he would return my money and asked politely to please give them another chance. He also said to give him a call and let him improve on our next experience. I will go visit again but I do not wanting special treatment, "I just want good food with good service in a timely manner" "THAT\'S ALL CUSTOMERS WANT" I just want to thank you very much for your service Sergio, as the GM you did the right thing.'
