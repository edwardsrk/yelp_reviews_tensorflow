b'Horrible service - it\'s like the waitress was more interested in talking to her friends/other servers than taking our order or refilling out waters.Wings are overly drenched in sauce, and the "most popular" flavor isn\'t hot nor great tasting. Average wing place, wing size is a little small compared to other wing places north on hwy 7, and just an okay place to go to.Would not return. Please take note manager.'
