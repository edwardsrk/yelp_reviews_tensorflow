b"On several occasions when I have come here, Autozone has not been able to help me out.Why? No idea?Latest debacle: My battery was dying. I needed a new battery and help changing it. Autozone will do it only if there is zero oxidation on your battery. There was a little bit on mine so, I was told that all of these other parts were affected, because of hte oxidation they were going to snap off, and they couldnt touch it. No recommendations on how to get the oxiation of. Referred me to a mechanic that charges $80 to touch your car if it is oxidized.... and JIC money if parts snap off...I went to Jiffy Lube instead. THey cleaned the oxidation.. took 5 seconds and changed my battery. Nothing snapped off.Second:I needed a new gas cap because I have been getting a false reading of the gas cap not being closed.I talked to one of the Autozoners asked if I needed to get a Gas Cap, or if there was just a part.. (i really don't know about cars and I don't try to hide it)He went on to explain how the gas cacpp makes a clicking noise and i had to make sure it clicked three times. I reiterated on how it was a false reading I would check every single time.. :-|Never again."
