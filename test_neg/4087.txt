b"Place is very friendly. Outdated and grungy  but that never deters me. Some of the best places are dives. I had high hopes for this place because of the yelp reviews. I was very disappointed. I was the only customer yet The rolls were all over cooked, very very dark brown. I was given the wrong order. Ordered general tsaos and got sweet and sour, then tried to convince me it was tsao. They used a microwave for everything. And the single serve mustard and duck sauce packets were tasteless and bland. Got beef broccoli for a friend, and the inside of the broccoli was still frozen. Won't be returning. But 2 stars for reasonable price and friendly lady."
