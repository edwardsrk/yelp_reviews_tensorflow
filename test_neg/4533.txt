b'I wonder why Yelp has censored some of the reviews of this restaurant. Two reviews that gave it 1 star out of 5 have disappeared as well as my initial review (3 stars) and follow up review (2 stars). This is bound to be a controversial restaurant. Some people will be dazzled by the decor and will love it. Other people will notice that the food is not as good as other restaurants. The sushi pales when compared to the sushi at the best AYCE restaurants in Brampton including Hockey Sushi which is in the same mall. The cooked food, salad bar and deserts are not as good as The Mandarin. I have twice tried the food in the "Live Cooking" area and found it to be bland. Some people will love this place and others will hate it. No restaurant can please everyone. Still I am puzzled that Yelp has deleted some reviews by people who did not like the place, but did not delete the rave review by Brian H who did not seem to try the food and wrote about Wok Of Fame\'s expansion plans.'
