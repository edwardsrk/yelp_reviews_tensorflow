b'NOT AUTHENTIC...Growing up eating the best mexican food from home it was a  disappointment to pay 60.00 for a family of 4. Food was  okay the price just was not right. Not a dine in friendly place. Refills are not free. I live really close too this place but i will not be a regular. Go to Canasta, Carolina, garcia on McDowell  and 35th ave. Pay the same with full restaurant  service. The menudo meat is good but they use  can hominy corn i know because ive used it personally  and know the difference. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH..'
