b"This was my first time there and it was empty on a Sunday night which seemed weird. The food was ok but the portions were small. The large pho I got was mostly soup. My friend's small had more food. The service was terrible. There was only 3 of us and the waitress forgot who ordered what. In addition she was not at all friendly. The location is convenient at finch and leslie. I will probably not recommend going there to anyone. If you want pho I say go check out pho 88 on yonge near empress walk"
