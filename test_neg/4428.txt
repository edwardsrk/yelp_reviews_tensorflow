b"I love their mac and cheese but sadly the burgers weren't up to par at all. They use premade patties instead of fresh ground beef. You'd think with the price tag being on level with Burgatory and BRGR they'd be the same quality. But the aforementioned competition is so much better quality.Slow service as well but likely because I went on like the 2nd day. They're decent but no Burgatory."
