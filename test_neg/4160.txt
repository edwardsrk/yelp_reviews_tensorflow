b'Tried Thai Orchid for lunch today...1st time.  Order was prompt, hostess was friendly enough but the food was less than satisfactory.  We ordered Pad Thai with chicken, two egg rolls and BBQ chicken entree.  Both orders contained chicken but are cooked very differently...both were extremely overcooked.  The chicken was very dry and neither of us ate it.  I will try again as this restaurant had great reviews, perhaps we caught them on an off day.'
