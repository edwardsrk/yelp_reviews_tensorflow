b'Service department is 5-star, put my last purchase transaction left a lot to be desired.  High pressure to purchase a vehicle on their lot, instead of finding me the one I wanted.The last 2 vehicles I have purchased from them have not been pleasant experiences.  I will keep using their service department, as they have always been great.'
