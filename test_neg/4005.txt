b'The ambiance is sophisticated and upscale. Exactly what you would expect from a Ritz Carlton "luxurious bar". The macaroons are very good and the presentation is aesthetically pleasing. However, the drinks are way too strong. I am not a fan of the over poured alcohol  taste, and the prices were too high. I was a fan of the punch, but I just couldn\'t justify paying $40+ for a punch pitcher. If you enjoy strong alcoholic beverages then you may enjoy this place. As for me, I\'ll have to pass.'
