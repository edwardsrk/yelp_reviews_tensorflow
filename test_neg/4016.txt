b"What is the big fuss over this place??? It was below average! I ordered the Ribeye steak dinner and it was awful. I requested medium well, I received a charred steak hard as a rock. The green beans were undercooked and had absolutely no flavor. The place is understaffed, the waiter was so behind he didn't even check on us once. The ambiance is average, a hybrid of Applebees and T.G.I.F totally not worth the fuss. The Food is no better than eating at an IHOP"
