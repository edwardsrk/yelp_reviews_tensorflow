b"We got a good price and the Camry we had ran beautifully.  So why two stars?  The agent tried to charge us almost a $100 more than our reservation was for.  Once that was corrected, he showed me the car.  It needed washing and vacuuming.  He washed and vacuumed it.  It was dripping wet - hadn't been dried.  We inspected the car, noting the one significant scratch, and went on our way.  About a half our down the road, we noticed the smell of cigarette smoke.  It became obvious that someone had smoked in the car and that the company had done nothing to mitigate that.  I also noticed that the gas gauge was on 3/4, not full.  Guess I need to check that rather than trust that a company like Enterprise would fill the tank or note it on the rental agreement.  They did neither.  The next day, we drove west in the morning, meaning the sun was shining on the rear of the car.  The inside of the back window was so covered with dirt, grime, and film that it was impossible to see out the back in the rearview mirror.  Finally, one of the features of the car I found while playing with the controls was the tire pressure monitor.  According to the monitor the pressures were 36 (LR), 38 (RR), 39 (RF) and 40 (LF).  Being that out of balance and that overinflated indicates a potential safety problem to me.  Obviously, Enterprise does not check tire inflation.  Again, the car was otherwise excellent, we were finally charged what we were supposed to be charged, and had an excellent 10 day trip.  I would go back here, but would be a real pain in the butt about checking our the car including making them check tire pressure before I got in."
