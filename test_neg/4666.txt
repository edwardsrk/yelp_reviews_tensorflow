b'This place is a douche magnet. When it first opened, it was pretty cool. Friendly staff and patrons, good prices on food and drinks, decent drink selection, and the billiards was a good time. My last few experiences here have pretty much solidified my stance on never returning.First of all, I wanna start out by saying that 99% of the servers are rad. However there are 2 in particular that I\'m not a big fan of, and I can\'t imagine anyone else being one either... the chick with the GIANT boobs- you gotta do more than adjust your cleavage all night if you expect anyone to have any respect for you. Yeah, you\'re friendly enough, but you need to learn to look at a person when they\'re talking to you. You seem uninterested in any of my questions or comments about the menu.My next comment is in regards to the young male server. We were playing pool, and in the middle of a game we set our sticks on the table and walk outside to smoke a cigarette. We come back in, and two drunken soccer dads had re racked our table and started a new game. ON OUR TABLE. I walk up to them and tell them "this is our table, and we were in the middle of a game." Now mind you, I\'m a little buzzed and trying my hardest not to get too shitty with these old geezers, but I\'m kinda pissed at the lack of respect. He looks at me, and tells me that the server (points at the young dude) told them to grab that table. The server walks over and gives me some bullshit story about a reservation and he had to bump them off of their table so he sent them to ours blah blah blah.  I say "what does that have to do with us? We were in the middle of a game?" He comes back with "well there\'s other open tables you can use, I\'ll put you over here." Well no shit there\'s other tables, dude. Why didn\'t you put THEM over there??!! we weren\'t done with our game! If you\'re gonna advertise your establishment as a billiards hall, know your billiards etiquette. And teach your employees.The owner, or who I assume to be the owner, is a giant waste of flesh and space. Every time I go in there, the servers and bartender are running around trying to get everyone their orders and he\'s got his ass stuck to a bar stool with a smug look on his face. One time I walked to the bar and asked him if he could change the channel on ONE of the 20 tv\'s they had. It was on an effing infomercial. During the NBA playoffs. He literally game me an EXCUSE-ME-ARE-YOU-TALKING-TO- MWAAAH look and said "probably not." I laughed and said " thanks anyways." The bartender ended up changing it a few minutes later. I guess the owner doesn\'t know how to operate a TV remote, which surprises me considering how lazy he looked. ..Red button on, arrows change channel, + sign turn up sound... I hope this helps you, sir.I heard this place changed names. Hopefully they changed ownership too. If so, I\'ll give it another shot.'
