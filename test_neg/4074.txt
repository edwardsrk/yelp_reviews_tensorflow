b'Unfortunately I decided to opt out of takeout and actually dine in for once. Big mistake. I always get to-go food here and it\'s consistently fair to middling. The same or less can be said for my food tonight, I had the lotus roll which has spicy tuna inside among other ingredients, but there was no spice at all. Pretty flavorless on the whole. But, the thing that really put me off of this place was the service. It was 845 pm, just got out of yoga and needed food and possibly a drink... Head to the bar where I\'m greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l "do you need a drink menu?"... Maybe she had been having a bad day? She was somewhat helpful selecting the sake I ordered. She was on her phone/computer the whole time, didn\'t smile once and honestly made me slightly uncomfortable, I felt as if I was a burden. I definitely won\'t be back to dine in.'
