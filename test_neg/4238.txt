b"I am visiting Phoenix and decided to have dinner at this restaurant one night because it was close to my hotel. The food was ok and the service was also ok. Nothing to write home about but acceptable. The portion was a bit on the small side, but the food came out really fast! So if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and you are not that picky, this may be your spot. HOWEVER, do NOT go there if they are busy. I went back a day later with a friend and colleague for lunch, and because of a conference that is was in town, the restaurant was packed. I understand that it is hard to provide good service when it is busy, BUT even accounting for that, the service was really unacceptable. First of all, they put a glass of ice in front of us. Not water with ice, but literally a glass ice with a thimble full of water. We couldn't drink anything out of the glass and so we asked if they could dump the ice and give us some water The waiter actually said no!! He said he was too busy to do that. I was speechless. Then they brought our main meal, which came out fast, but we did not get our soup. We had to ask for it twice and when it arrived, one person only had some lukewarm broth. The spring roll was also lukewarm and soggy. All in all, it was NOT a very satisfying meal. Then they brought the check on our table when we had barely started eating!! I am giving this place two stars because my experience in the evening was ok, but I would give them no stars for lunch."
