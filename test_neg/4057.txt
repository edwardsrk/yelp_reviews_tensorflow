b"Not the Benihana it used to be. We came in for a birthday dinner and we frankly disappointment with everything except for the service and our chef's entertainment ability. There were items listed on the online menu that were not available and the staff wasn't even familiar with. They won't give half orders of sushi even though the menus lists that they do. The portions are a lot smaller then I remember. My food was just mediocre. I don't know is that do to the chefs ability or the quality of the food they are working with. Also they apparently only honor their birthday discount program on Mon thru Thurs, which i understand is a normal policy for regular coupons but said birthday was actually on a Friday and they we couldn't use the discount even though we were actually there on the date of the birthday, This is just a bad policy. I used to really love Benihana would would gladly choose this restaurant over the other Japanese steakhouses that have popped up recently, I don't think i can do so anymore. we had a much better experience at a different restaurant a for a lot less also.This used to be a slightly more upscale location, now it is not much better then an Applebee's but still have the upscale pricing. I do realize that you are paying for the show as well as the food, but when the food is sub par and the environment is lacking, that pricing just feel like a rip off.Everything said, the chef was entertaining, the wait staff was great and on top of things, we never had to wait more then a few minutes for anything. they catered to 3 picky kids wonderfully. Which makes it even more disappointing that i cant give a better review."
