b"If you are going here please do not have Ricky (he's a younger male) do your nails. He is so rude and doesn't pay any attention to detail. I went in to get my nails done like I do every two weeks. This time I was given someone new. He was rude from the start. He doesn't like being told that his work isn't good. When he was done with my nails he put the fan in front of them and that led to the top coat smudging. I left because I had another appointment after that. I returned like 4 hours later and told them i needed to get them fixed. He did a horrible job at filing them. He left part of the powder on my skin. They were thick and crooked. He was very upset that i went back to get them fixed. He kept being rude and didn't want to do them but he wouldn't allow anyone else to help me after me telling him that I wanted someone else. I usually love this place but he is horrible at nails and customer service."
