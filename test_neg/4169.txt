b"I knocked a star off.  Last time I went the fish was just not fresh.  I had All-You-Can Eat and they served salmon roe that was just horrible.  It's like the don't taste their own food.  If a sushi place can not serve the freshest food there is a huge problem.  I eat a lot of sushi.  Right now I am ranking this place at the bottom.  Sorry.  No soup for you.  6 Months."
