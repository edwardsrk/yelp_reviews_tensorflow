b"I was interested in one of the new places of lakewood eateries so i took a shot at Something Smoking Cafe... Sorry bad choice :(    Ordered 1/2 chicken price was fine but that's where it stops... The chicken by itself was ok but as soon as i added the mustard barbecue it was like adding watered...very sour tasting.. I really enjoy mac and cheese  so i ordered  it as a side dish. BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste at all i think i took about 5 bites  waiting to find some taste but it never showed up so needless to say that wa the end of that i just put it aside and left it there..Than I also noticed ( homemade) cornbread  Sure glad i did not live in that family  it was horrible.;no taste again...So needless to say look for something soon and new to take over the store front.., I just dont see this place lasting very long at all ."
