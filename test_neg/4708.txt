b"I saw this place passing by today, and I needed a pedi badly. So, I gave them a try. No wait time on a Friday. The girl seem not very happy to be there. She didn't really want to do her job. She did my spa pedi really quickly and rushed me out the door. I'm not sure if I want to come back again. I have 3 nail spas to pick from by them that I can try next time."
