b"I've had better filipino food.I ordered the garlic fried rice with dinuguan, chicken afritada and sago to drink. The food was disappointing. It was warm and not hot and lacked in flavour. I had to put salt and pepper in everything. The sago was the only thing that was good here. The place itself is very spacious and very clean. Love the colours and how everything is set up. Wishing I loved the food just as much as the space itself."
