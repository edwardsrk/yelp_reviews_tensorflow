b"The prices on the bill were not the same as the prices on the menu, which did not contain the specials that the their website said they had ($3 mimosas and Mule specials). The service was friendly however multiple items we did not order appeared on the bill at first, when I asked that it be corrected some were taken off (but not all, the remaining once were small things and our bill was around $100 so I did not bother), then noticed that multiple of the prices were different on the menu then on our bill (mostly by a dollar or 2 off, but it was on a couple different items.) Waitress was confused but didn't bother to get a manager to clear things up, we just paid and left because the 6 dollar difference (Originally 18) was not worth the struggle and we don't go out in Old Town that often.  The food was decent, some in my party thought the breakfast burrito was rather small, another person was told they no longer carried the item on the menu  they wanted to order from it. I normally tip well over the 20% gratuity when I go to a place to watch a football game, in this case since the bill was wrong I just paid the gratuity and did not leave the extra I would have left after being at a table for over 3 hours. Disappointing that they did not have their advertised specials and that the bill prices and menu prices did not add up. The huge LCD screens are cool but they need to get their act together"
