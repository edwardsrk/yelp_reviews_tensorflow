b'All the 47-year old men in the joint wearin\' sportcoats hangin\' out with your beers waiting to catch some hot young tail which won\'t even happen but you\'re still lingering around anyway in an awkward looking sausagefest - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"To the endless video loop of the Tempe 12 Girls trying to figure out how to best flaunt their mamms for their calendar photo shoots like ohmygawdtheresnowaythatIwillnotbechosenforKipWingerscomebackvideo - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"To the dumbfuck DJ who thinks spinning 15 seconds of every song from the 80\'s and 90\'s into some megamix is like cool but it\'s actually more akin to the sonic equivalent of Sybil, raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"All our servers who were kind of friendly but more like passengers on that UFO named USS Space Cadet that you see on top of the Space Age Lodge restaurant while driving through Casa Grande because you couldn\'t get ANYTHING right nor understand what we were saying as if we were of a different species altogether, like as if we were human and you were the green hoochie that Captain Kirk got together with in Star Trek - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!" (if you can)All those single bathroom stalls where the door doesn\'t become opaque unless you lock it all the way but I\'m sure the ploy here is that as the night goes on and people get more and more drunk, girls will come in and maybe haphazardly lock the door but not all the way but they don\'t care because they have to pee so hard so they\'re sitting on the throne and watching people walk by and think that "Ohmygodit\'slikeaonewaymirrorthat\'ssocool!" but then they notice that guys are now just standing there and converging on the other side of the door looking right at them and all of a sudden the drunk girls realize that the door is not a one-way-mirror at all but.... - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!" To my Yelp companions who made all that was Six completely tolerable and proved the point that whatever the case may be with a semi-retarded-but-really-cool-looking Scottsdale venue, if you\'re in good company, you\'ll still have a great time - raise your hands up in the air and say "What! What!"And scene.'
