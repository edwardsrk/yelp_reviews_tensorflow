b"Annoyed with the representative I had. Never told me there would be any fees after I signed for insurance on the rental car. He talked through the contract and function of the car at the speed of light that sometimes I had to guess wtf he was saying. It's my fault I didn't read the tiny print thoroughly and carefully, but bad on these customer service reps for not fully explaining the bill to their customers. Not dealing with this place again."
