b'Went in the other night. The place was empty. There were two employees at the counter watching TV. The guy was shoveling something into his mouth from an orange cup. I was wondering if he was eating toppings. I poured myself a three sampler. The coconut came out like shaving cream, not frozen at all. I immediately told the girl. She said, "Yeah, that happens sometimes."  Aaaaaaand, right back to the TV show she went. After I got my stuff I went to the toppings area. The bins were half empty, some had only a few crumbs left.  Then the hot fudge pot was broken. I once again told the girl, and again I got the same response. But this time she watched as I struggled then finally gave up. The marshmallow topping was disgusting. But at least I got to pay $8.00!!!!!!'
