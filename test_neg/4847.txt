b"The real test of a coffee house is not how it prepares its specialty drinks...(let's face it, enough sugar and cream can make anything taste good).   No, the real test of a coffee house is how their black, regular drip tastes.    I like it complex, rich, and nutty.     How disappointing that Lola's regular drip is weak, watery, and tasteless.     Pastries are great, though.     Ambience is cool...though it's echo-y and a little loud if you want to carry on a conversation.     Step up the coffee and I'll be back"
