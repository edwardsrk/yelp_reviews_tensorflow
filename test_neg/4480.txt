b"I've gone twice and my experiences were very inconsistent. I had the Capitano burger and fries both times.The first time, my burger was noticeably overcooked and dry. The fries were also well-done, but quite good - they appeared to be fresh.The second time, my burger was perfect - juicy, flavourful and meaty. It was probably one of the better burgers around - better than Five Guys or the much-ballyhooed Burger's Priest. But my fries were awful - greasy, undercooked (yes, this time they were undercooked) frozen McCain Superfries.If they could figure out some consistency, this would be my go-to place for a burger downtown."
