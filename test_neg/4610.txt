b"Food is ok much like any chain breakfast restaurant but service was poor.  At first, I thought they were understaffed because our waitress seemed harried, but as time went on, it was clear that our waitress should find a new line of work.  I ordered coffee and my wife ordered a large OJ. The waitress brought two coffees and when my wife said she ordered OJ, she asked what size.  Really? It was only a couple minutes ago.  When she brought our food, she asked if we needed anything else.  Well, my coffee was empty so I had to ask for more coffee and cream.  It took forever to bring the coffee and she didn't bring cream, so I asked a second time.  When I was done with my food, she finally showed up with coffee and I asked a third time for cream.Oh, and the silverware which is wrapped up in a napkin only had a knife for my wife.It doesn't matter how good the food is if the service sucks so we are unlikely to return."
