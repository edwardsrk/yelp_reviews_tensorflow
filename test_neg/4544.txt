b'sad to see and say it, but the majority of the previous reviews have pretty much said it all. we use to love stopping by on our bikes and sipping some cocktails or having some light eats at the old location. but sadly, no mas....for starters, it\'s right across the street from that dreadful other hangout, with their techno and club music blasting. we ordered a couple of margaritas. mine, the house margarita, was 9 bucks. my wife ordered "their most popular margarita"....it cost 11 bucks! the price of those margaritas alone is enough to get us great food at other locations in the area!we ordered 3 tacos and thought 3 bucks was high, and were expecting these fish and octopus filled, large tacos. instead, we got these teeny, tiny tacos with about 2 slivers of fish/octopus...which could be eaten in 1 bite....for 3 bucks!!! what a joke! and to make it even worse, the fish and the octopus were way too chewy.i have to say, our service was good and it wasn\'t crazy busy at noon on a sunday, but we both agreed, we can get much better/larger portions of food for the money at numerous other old town locations.'
