b'I had Oasis drill out some studs on a down pipe, and hang an exhaust for me. The price was right, and they were friendly. I just wish they had taken their time with making sure the exhaust tips were on correct. Upon arrival I noticed the exhaust tips were pretty far under the bumper, not flush with it. Well while doing there test drive they melted part of the bumper. The tech was prepared to put the car back on the lift, but i just wanted to get out because I was trying to contain my disappointment that my 2014 bumper was damaged. Needless to say I brought the car home pulled the tips flush with the bumper the right way, no rubbing, no melting for several days now, why was the tech unable to achieve these same results? Large brush strokes these guys can do, dedication to detail maybe not so much.'
