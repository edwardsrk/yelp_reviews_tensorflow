b"I've been here twice now. The first time I wanted to try their pizza but the oven was broke. I ended up only ordering a shake. I went back a second time (after a phone call ensuring the pizza oven was up and running). I was not impressed. I'm not sure what was weird about. The sauce? The cheese? I've had way better pizzas. Loved the milkshake. I give it two stars because my husband likes it and I have to tolerate it for him."
