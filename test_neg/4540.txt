b'I struggled with the rating on this one, but I really can\'t give it more than 2 Stars. Yes, as shown in other reviews, the portions are very small, the cup itself is very small, and even a full cup contains less than a medium DQ cone, for a MUCH higher price. Listen, I get it that they obviously need a high margin to keep a one-trick-pony store like this afloat, hire staff, pay the rent, but $7 for a banana and a handful of berries?Still, IF the product was mind-blowingly good, then I could excuse the price, pay the extra, and enjoy the occasional yummy treat.Sadly, the product is just okay.I am an omnivore, but I cannot tell you how excited my vegan friend was that this place was right across the street from where I live, she could not wait to come visit and try the vegan softserve.Between the two of us we purchased 2 double flavour cups so we could enjoy 4 different flavours and share, but sadly, even she had to admit that everything tasted fine, but only "just fine". The basic banana was the best, pistachio was disappointing, chocolate was bland and boring. Overall, unimpressed.But her disappointment was disheartening. In the end, she decided she would continue making her own smoothies and soft serve with her Yonanas machine, in more fun flavours, all for under a buck for a much bigger serving.'
