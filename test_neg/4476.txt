b"Have heard great things about this place but was left less than impressed.  Silverskin wasn't removed from my ribs and there was a price of plastic wrap in my Mac and cheese.  Cornbread wasn't bad though and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce they offered.  Main complaint was the tempature of my food which basically just slightly warm. When your meat is sitting in a hot box to stay warm after smoking please make sure it reaches the appropriate tempature, no one wants to get sick from lunch."
