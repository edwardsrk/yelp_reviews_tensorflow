b"Pros:-price-location-shorter check-in line for total rewards membersCons:-thins walls in room (very very noisy). I could hear the neighbors and their tv, neighbors across hall, and guests walking and talking in hallway. There was also some construction noise or something late in the middle of the night.-under construction near by-entrance to park was hard to find (took an hour w/ traffic circling the hotel 3 times over). We called the hotel asking for directions and even they didn't know that the small entrance they directed us to was temporarily closed. We had to make another u-turn and the. turn onto a small street. We passed that small street twice and there was no sign or anything to help visitors find the entrance to park at Flamingo.-calling guest services took long (had to wait 5 mins before getting in touch with a person) every time we called-pool closes too early (6pm)"
