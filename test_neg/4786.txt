b"One of the owners of Fired Pie reached out to me after reading my initial review. He apologized for our bad experience, said it was not up to their standards and offered to send me a gift card to try them out again. I accepted, and was really happy to see someone higher up caring about customers.We called in an order last night, exactly the same as before. One veggie pie with pesto instead of red sauce, one pesto chicken pie and a roasted veggie salad with Italian instead of balsamic. My boyfriend had the call on speaker and I heard the girl repeat our order back to him just as we wanted it. Great!Apparently all did not go as smooth as it sounded when he went to go pick up our food. First, the girl at the register didn't know how to run the gift card. Then, when our order was 10 cents over the gift card's $25 amount, she gave my boyfriend back the wrong change. (He only had a $20 on him and she initially gave him back $19.10 instead of $19.90) THEN we get home and all looks well...except my pie has red sauce on it. Fired Pie, do you have a personal vendetta against me eating pesto or what?! I started cracking up, and boyfriend vowed that he'll never go there again. It SUCKS, because the food is so great! We received the correct dressing this time for the salad, which was delish! It just goes to show how little service details can really make or break a place for us. Luckily for Fired Pie, it looks like basically everyone else going there has four or five star experiences...I guess we're just outta luck."
