b"Mad Mexican is really all over the board as a restaurant. Their salsas are great. Tacos are very good, but for the price it's a ripoff. Add in the fact that the guacamole is $8 and miniscule, you find yourself with a place to skip. Lots of options in Toronto for food; no need to get short changed for your money."
