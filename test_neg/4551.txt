b'It\'s weird when you go into somewhere and it has the most bizzare smell. I can\'t even explain what the smell is other then "bad". I\'m not overly impressed with prices here or the service either (prepare to be pushed for a "target card" upon checkout). I\'d easily go to Walmart over this place.... department stores becoming a dieing breed, we didn\'t need another one in the mall for sure. Blah.'
