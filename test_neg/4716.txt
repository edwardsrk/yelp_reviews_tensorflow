b'Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That\'s where the delight ended. They didn\'t have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My "large" pho was ok, but I wouldn\'t classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can\'t blame him), I wouldn\'t have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the "fresh" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we\'d started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that\'s when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They\'re all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.I wouldn\'t go back here.'
