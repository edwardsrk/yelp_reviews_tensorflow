b"I'll start by saying something nice.   They had a decent selection of music playing.  It was not all hip-hop which I liked.   The place has a nice feel and was not super crowded.   Now with that said,  since the place was not packed you think they would have decent service no? Well they don't.   It took for ever for me to get my drinks.   Not to mention when I finally got my drinks they tried to drastically over charge me...  I'm not sure I will be coming here again.  I mean, I know sometimes people make mistakes, but she could have at least apologized for it."
