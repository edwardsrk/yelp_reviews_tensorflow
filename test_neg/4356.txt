b"This Target is OK.  It's never very busy, but that also means that the checkout lines open are sparse.  I sometimes have to wait longer than I'd like to get through the line.  My beef with Target overall is also the fact that the national corporate office gave $150,000 to an anti-gay candidate in Minnesota, and they've handled the aftermath poorly."
