b"I've eaten at Rocky River Brewing on several occasions. The first couple of times were great and the food was terrific! However, my most recent experiences including the one tonight, have forced me to write negatively about this establishment. I recently went during a lunch break with a coworker and we waited 45+ minutes for a salad and a wrap. We were forced to eat our food very quickly and barely got to enjoy it. Talk about slow service!! Tonight I ordered take out for dinner on my way home from work and specifically asked the hostess over the phone if they have take out to double check what I saw listed on the website. I gave her my order and my contact information, which she wrote down (or seemed to be writing it down). She confirmed my order with me and told me it would take 20-30 minutes. When I arrived I walked up to three hostesses and let them know I was there for a to-go order. None of them were of any help and told me to head to the bar. When I asked the bartender he said that there was no order under my name. When I concluded there may be some kind of mistake and it could possibly be under another name, he became very rude and said that they had not received any take out calls all night and acted like it was my fault that the order was not in. They said I could put the order in again but then I would have to wait another 30 minutes. I feel that the service has fallen off lately and instead of hiring a bunch of people to stand around the hostess table and not do their job they should be focusing more on the customer."
