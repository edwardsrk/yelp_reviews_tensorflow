b"We ordered P1 with tripe, rare steak, and tendon and P7 Vegetable Pho with Beef broth.  The Pho broth just wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping.  We read a lot of reviews and there was a mix of comments about the Pho.  When we walked in, the smell is amazing, just wish the food was as good.  Disappointed."
