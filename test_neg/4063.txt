b"Eh. Had high expectations since the place is nicely decorated, but the service and treatment was lame. Despite them knowing it was my first time here, they rushed me through and focused more on the TV rather than on the service.Deluxe Pedicure for $38 was below average; process was rushed and hence the service lacked thoroughness. Calluses weren't addressed properly, previous polish wasn't fully removed, etc. Polish was put on quickly without top clear coat. Smudged before I walked out. They used paper towels for toe separators. Overall, my home pedicures are better than their service.Won't return."
