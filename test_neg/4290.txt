b"Whenever I am in Toronto visiting friends, I always end up at Salad King, since it's such a fast, convenient, and tasty option. But, in Toronto recently for the St. Patrick's Day Parade, I decided to try a new Thai place. Thai on Yonge was passable, but I think I'll be sticking with Salad King or trying a different place next time. The restaurant is on the second floor, and we walked right by it at one point (we needed to look up to see the sign!). Once inside we waited a moment to be greeted by the only waitress, an older woman who did not smile once during our dinner. She seated us quickly and came back for our entire order in about five minutes. It was a Sunday night so the restaurant was not crowded, but service was spotty since the waitress was the only one working the floor. And, instead of using a tray to carry meals and drinks, she used a little cart which slowed down proceedings. A couple near us constantly tried to get her attention by just standing up and staring at her. The food was adequate. The portions were small and the flavor was just okay. I ordered the green curry with chicken, which is my go-to meal at Thai places. It was not spicy at all, and the veggies were minimal. My brother ordered the Ginger Chicken. I tried a bite of his and while tasty, it still didn't pack enough flavor for a good Thai dish. Overall, a quick meal but not amazing, with weird service. I'll probably not be back in the future."
