b"And to think I was pretty excited to go here.So many dining choices and we drive off the strip to come here.At least it wasn't full at all, really thought there would be a wait, but we were there pretty early for dinner.Happy hour only at the bar which we could not sit at with a kid, so we were off to paying double as everyone else there as we were the only ones at a table, they could have really made an exception.Tried to talk my husband into ordering the 3 lb $25 burrito, he went with the $18 regular instead.I had the fish tacos ($14), my son the quesadilla ($11)The prices are INSANE for what you get!The $18 burrito smaller than any other that you can get for a third that price, grizzly meat, served with black beans and salad, not rice and refried as stated in the menu.Unhappy camper.The quesadilla a sorry presentation, very lackluster in taste, $11 they should really be ashamed!!!!! Just cheese, no sides, no garnish, I was pissed!My fishtacos, 2 for $14 were ok, the second time.FIrst time they brought  me cold fried fish on corn shells when I ordered grilled on flour.Servers mistake, he brought someone else's plate that had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile.By the time my order came out the guys were done eating, so they sat and stared while I ate,  not fun.Fish tacos were fine, not stellar, neither was rice and beans.$60 for something I would have paid around $10 for in SoCal and didn't even taste good, very disappointed Pink Taco!"
