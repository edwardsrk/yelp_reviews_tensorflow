b"Terrible. Get to the location and get a seat instantly, awesome! However it was cramped and wasn't able to pull out a hair to sit without bumping into the person behind me in the next table. We sat at the table for 10 minutes waiting for the server to come and talk with us. A guy finally comes in rush asking for what we need. My husband orders a Pepsi and I get iced tea. We also order French fries. Then the waiter walks away. Who was my waiter? What's his name? I couldn't tell you because he didn't really have the customer service skill, in my opinion. He said he'd be back shortly with the drinks and take our order. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, even though we were sitting right next to the station. He dropped them off and left. He even got that wrong. He gave us 2 Pepsi's and I couldn't ask for tea because he wasn't around. Finally a girl came from the kitchen and gave us our fries. At that point I asked for the correct drink. Anyways after 35 minutes of waiting, needless to say we never order an entree. Place seemed severely under staffed, maybe if they had more people it be better. But who knows I won't be back Pros: The Pepsi was good, so said my husband  Cons: Everything else."
