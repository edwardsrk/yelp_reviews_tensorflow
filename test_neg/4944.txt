b"I'm not a fan of this restaurant using thick noodles for their pho. Using the thicker rice noodles is more Chinese than Vietnamese. It's supposed to be the thinly sliced rice noodles. That's the reason why I haven't been going to this restaurant for many years. Is there even an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto? It seems like all of them are Chinese-influenced. It's a shame."
