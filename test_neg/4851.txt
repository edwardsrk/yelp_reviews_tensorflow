b'I am giving them two because I knew how bad it was going to be. It you have ever had real Italian food or lived on the East Coast, you know better than to fall for those stupid commercials with the 12 Italian family members shouting across the table to one another while enjoying an Olive Garden meal. This is not possible, First of all, bread sticks are not bread at all. So, my friend had a birthday and this was his choice and though I tried to talk him into ANY other place, here we ended  up. First of all a note to the chef; LAY OFF THE SALT, FELLA!The salad, SALTY. The pasta sauces, SALTY. The dressings, SALTY. Soup: SALTY.Nothing worth mentioning, we tried several items and were disappointed, But we had breadsticks, so why worry?They funny thing is they had wings and they were cooked to perfection. Of course then they put spicy tomato sauce and hot oil on top. Hopefully my blood pressure will return to normal before my friends next birthday...The two stars are for service because he did bring the food.'
