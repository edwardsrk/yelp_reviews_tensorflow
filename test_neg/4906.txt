b"Old hotel, never enjoyed staying there.  Far too much smoke.  I stayed there quite a few times for business trips in my last job.  The events were usually held at other hotels that were already full, so the Flamingo was the overflow hotel used.  This hotel was one of my least favorite to stay in.  I don't think I'll be going back.  When I do come to Vegas for something, I try to stay at hotels off the strip.  I vastly prefer Red Rocks and Henderson and Green Valley even though they're quite a ways away."
