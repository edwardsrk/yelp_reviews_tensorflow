b"This was hyped out to be an awesome dog park! On paper it sounds great... multi section parks for all variety of dogs, water area for our paw pals to swim in, what a place to spend an evening. The reality of it though... only one section has the pond so why bother making your way here if you don't play in the water right? However, the water is so dirty, that my boy did not want to step foot in it. If you end up here I highly recommend you wash your dog right after due to the swampy water.  All in all, I think this place has potential to be an awesome park, if the city is willing to commit resources to clean the pond so it doesn't stink like a farm."
