b"I go here quite a bit but today my order was terrible. I got a caramel iced coffee and some hash browns. The hash browns literally taste like they were sprayed with some cleaning solution and about made me puke. The iced coffee tasted strange too. It tastes like day old coffee that was just poured in to get rid of. I know Dunkin isn't the most expensive place for coffee but, I do expect it to be drinkable and the food edible."
