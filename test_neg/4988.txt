b"Probably the worst red bean sherbet a.k.a. Patbingsu I've had anywhere. Who puts Corn flakes in a red bean sherbet? just bad.There were few fruits; and some of them didn't taste very fresh. They could have added more variety of fruits and jellies. Shaved ice was already melting when I took the first scoop. Ice cream was okay. I could have made a better Patbingsu at home. Just a note: they charge you $2.50 for playing board games. It would have been better if they had a sign up saying so or told us before we got a board game. We thought they were abandoned by previous customers. Not that $2.50 is a lot of money for playing board games; they had a very limited selection of only three board games and some of them looked worn out.I had visited this place before, and I remember having a drink here and leaving with no complaints. I probably won't come back here again though except for a cup of tea or something that would be very difficult to get wrong. I was here on a Friday night but the place was not very busy. They don't accept credit cards; be prepared to pay by debit or cash. Good things: couches, cute paper heart decorations, and some chairs fitting for the princess/prince theme."
