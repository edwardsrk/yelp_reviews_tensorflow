b'I ended up overpaying. I went on Orbitz and got this as part of the package. I paid $15 with Orbitz and Grey Line only listed $12 for the Strip and $16 for Downtown.But I also wished I had seen the small stack of non-impressed yelpers here before I went to Vegas. I arrived at midnight and still stood around for about half an hour to get a ride when there were 4  cars just sitting around. The ride was like sitting on public transportation. The return trip was the worst. I had a 3:40pm flight; they wanted to pick me up at noon. Circus Circus is only 20 minutes away from the airport. I had to kill over 3 hours at the airport when check-in and everything took half an hour only.'
