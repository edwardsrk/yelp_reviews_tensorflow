b'Stopped in here for some drinks and snacks last week and was pretty disappointed. The service was SUPER SLOW, and our server didn\'t even bring us glasses for our boilermakers. I ordered a hot pretzel with beer cheese sauce - the pretzel tasted like Pillsbury crescent roll dough, and the "beer cheese sauce" tasted like french onion soup mix dip. I will not be back!'
