b'Can\'t say I\'m a fan of Pei Wei.  The food is very safe and MOR.  It\'s the "go to" place for your white christian co-workers who don\'t normally like asian food.  Not that I\'ve ever had anything bad there, just . . . it\'s the Applebee\'s of asian restaurants . . . it feels wrong ordering asian food from white kidsI will give them this . . . I don\'t normally care for chinese egg rolls (how can you when vietnamese egg rolls with fish sauce are a billion times better), but theirs are probably the best I\'ve had'
