b'Came with my girlfriend because I heard that the head chef is vegan, and we both are. When we first walked in, we stood for about 5 minutes waiting to be seating, not knowing that we were in the wrong spot. Multiple employees walked past us, and not one asked how we were or if we needed any help. Mind you, it was not busy at all for a Saturday night. We walked around for a bit and finally found where we needed to be, and the hostesses again looked at us without asking how we were. We got an attitude-laced "just 2?" And after we gave our name, we were ignored again. The bar was fine, a nice older man took my drink orders and gave them to me promptly. The waitress was great and we got our food and drinks quickly. The food was not amazing, but not awful. Don\'t think we will be coming back again.'
