b"We went here last night before dinner to grab a snack while we waited on our reservations at a restraurant nearby. The place is charming with its 1950s traditional ice cream parlor decor all done up in pink and white. In the back room there is a half way done kid's area with a couple of old games. Although the atmosphere is sweet on the surface and the staff was nice- the place lacks in cleanliness. The floors were dingy (they need a good strip, scrub and wax) and the restrooms were hideous and dirty! I'm with the previous reviewers in that the place needs a good cleaning.Our group ordered a few cones and while my rasberry sherbert was good- we'll likely be going elsewhere for a sugar fix next time."
