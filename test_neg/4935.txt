b'I love lahaina!  i think they have delicious sushi.  Happy hour ALL DAY on fri - sat - sun    that says to me good sushi for cheap on weekends.  Whats to complain about?!The waitress i had last 2 times was absolutely just a sweetheart.  She was very tentative about us and you can tell she was just so sincerely trying her hardest to make us happy.  Great customer service with her.  I think her name was Kelly?  I\'m posting this a bit after my visit so it\'s hard to remember.  They have a bar and football games on the tv as well and they have a room for karaoke?!   I donno bout you all but i\'m a little curious to check it out. Might be fun for a night with the gang to hang out eat cheap sushi and sing your heart out.Over all i love this place.  Only reason i dont 5 star it cause i dont know if it\'s "as good as it gets"  but it\'s pretty darn up there.  i\'d 4.5 it if i could.Edit as of 4-20-13!!:They no longer serve all day happy hour.  It was the one thing that my friends and i came for.  Yes they still have a happy hour but it\'s more regular times and not 50% off.  I came here as a treat for not AYCE cheap and delicious sushi.  Is it still tasty?  Yes! But to rich for my blood anymore.  I can find somewhere closer to go to.'
