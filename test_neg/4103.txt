b'Came here for "Restaurant Week" after hearing positive reviews from friends.The group I went with all had the 3 course meal.Pros:- Reservations on OpenTable- Parking lot next to the side of the restaurant - $5 - Friendly environment, not loud- Appetizers: Mix of shrimp, Portuguese sausage and calamari were good and the portion size was perfect- Service: Although the server was a bit strange with off the wall comments, overall all the waiters and staff were friendly.Cons:- Main Course: Paella, Salmon and Filet. Salmon and Filet were not cooked properly / or as requested. The lobster in the paella was rough and didn\'t look fresh. Portion sizes were large, but not worth it due to the poor taste.- Desserts were awful. The cheesecake and chocolate cake tasted as if they were bought from local grocery store. One joke at the table was that there was freezer burn on the cheesecake.We were glad we tried it, but will certainly not be back for another visit.'
