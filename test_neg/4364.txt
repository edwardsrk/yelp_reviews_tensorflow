b'Let\'s start off with their name, "El Cafetal" which means "Coffee Plantation". You\'d think with a name like that they\'d have a REAL coffee machine to make Caf\xc3\xa9 con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant!  Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant. As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were sure they\'re a Colombian restaurant.  My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants. The Churrasco (Sirloin Steak) wasn\'t bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS! They are definitely not AUTHENTIC COLOMBIANS!'
