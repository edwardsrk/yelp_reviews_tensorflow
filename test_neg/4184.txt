b"The service was less then quality in this restaurant. I asked three times for a cup of black coffee and the waitress didn't bring it. I had to ask the person bringing our food out. Additionally, the server did not check in with us throughout our time there. We actually needed to find her to get the check. The food was very good. Overall, not a great experience."
