b'If it were not voluntary it would be larceny. The pros: Excellent filet mignon-gorgeous setting, very relaxing. Very good waiter if a bit pompous, but he\'s French.Cons: wine prices at about 1000% markups. Wine list prices are for high rollers who don\'t pay directly but you do. A "reasonable" bottle suggested for only $116 is a Cabernet with the Bellagio name on it. Vile is an understatement. No good restaurant would have this bitter mouth wash on its wine list. It was sent back. Finally ordered with sommelier help a $100 bottle that was ,at best, acceptable. They allow people who know zilch about wine to take your order and make recommendations. really unacceptable. Then again, this is Vegas, a place with absolutely no class unless it is no class. This restaurant is a perfect example, in my view, of why Michelin stopped rating Las Vegas restaurants. There are simply no restaurants in LV, especially the big French names, deserving of the old Michelin ratings, not even the forks. The place is slightly understaffed and really understaffed with professionals. We ordered a sushi dish as an appetizer. Really bad, the crust tasted like cardboard, could not find a Sushi taste with the fruit like pilings on this thing. It also went back. A $14 piece of fruited cheesecake was good, a value here. Service was good but not up to the price level. They should send their entire staff to Taillevent or the old Jamin for lessons. But why bother when most of the sheep accept whatever they are given.'
