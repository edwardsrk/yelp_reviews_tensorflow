b"I ate here two years ago and found it to be one of the best sushi experiences I had ever had.. Not so much anymore. I ordered the white fish carpaccio to start. Not only was it ridiculously salty, but the mixed greens in the middle were so smothered with dressing that I could not eat it all. For my entree, I ordered the chirashi. The pieces of fish included nearly all seemed to be the leftover scraps that they couldn't use. Some were a bit mangled and others just didn't look appetizing. Service was great, but the food lacked so much that it made the overall experience a fairly disappointing end to a long work trip."
