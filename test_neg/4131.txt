b"At $17.95 for breakfast, any buffet with half decent food is a great deal for the variety. I would typically pay a few more dollars for a higher end buffet (Wynn, Cesar's, Wicked Spoon) but with the holiday weekend all of those places had double prices breakfast buffets!The good:-ready made omelettes with standard choices of veggies and meats (no seafood)-the vast dessert bar including fresh made and glazed donuts, cinnamon buns, and croissants-they have mango lassis! (So random)The bad:-we arrived early and the buffet was almost empty. However, the hostess had everyone wait and created a long line for no reason. We waited 30 minutes; what a waste. -the sushi bar has no raw fish. It's spam and smoked salmon and sausages rolled up in some rice and seaweed.Everything else (eggs, pancakes, waffles, etc) were about average. Overall, there are much better (and more expensive) places to grab breakfast!"
