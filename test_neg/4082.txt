b'Disappointing.  Menu on line is different than real menu which is limited to chicken wings, tenders, hamburger ($17) and "steak" fries which was actually cold pieces of roast beef.  This place will be gone in 6 months.  Sad because it is a great concept if they took the energy to do it right.  Beer is good!!!'
