b"Ordered gluten free bun. They put onion straws on burger - loaded with gluten. My fault as it was actually listed on the menu - BUT, seems someone should have asked. BBQ Burger came with no BBQ Sauce. Had them remake it. Ordered shakes. They ran out of milk & had to go to a store so they could make them. Mixed up the order. They don't have it together. Excuse was that there is a new cook. Time to fix it. Food was actually pretty good. I was going to give them a 1 but they sort of recovered."
