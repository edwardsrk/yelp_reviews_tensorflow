b"Bad service, Bland Pizza, and really really overpriced. The whole night, we only saw our waitress maybe 3 times (not even busy, like four tables out of the whole place had people). With the pizza, there wasn't any pazzaz to it... Very bland. and lastly; with two people and no appetizers or alcohol, the bill ended up being about $75. For those prices, i'd expect a much better experience. With service and food."
