b'I\'m so very, sincerely disappointed to say that the service has fallen off here.  They\'re not much better than Audi Charlotte now  :-(  The waiting areas are still superior, but wait (and wait, and wait, and wait) you will.Took in for a recall on a Tuesday thinking I\'d be waiting because I\'d already been told there were no loaners available.  Out of date food options in the waiting area upstairs?  Fail.  After waiting for over two hours I\'m then told that it\'s worse than they thought and I can\'t drive it so will have to get a loaner.  (sigh)  When I scheduled my service a few days prior I had been told there were no loaners and is why I had to wait for this recall service to be done.  So now magically there is a loaner?  Ok?  So off I go thinking it would be the next day (Wednesday) but learned on Wednesday that it would be Thursday.  Then Thursday came and "they found a burned wire and needed to order it" so would be pushed to Friday.  Then when Friday came, the story was that the repair wouldn\'t be made in time for me to pick up the vehicle so would be Monday.  Then Monday morning I\'m told it won\'t be ready till 4:30pm?  What exactly are you doing to my vehicle??!??  I no longer trust these people and I hate that.  Why must they do business in this manner?  I was so happy with them on Wednesday GGGRRRRR!Good grief!??  How is this any kind of service?  How is this any better than the bu11sh!t runaround one expects at Ford or Chevrolet??  It could just be so much better if anyone actually gave a sh!t.'
