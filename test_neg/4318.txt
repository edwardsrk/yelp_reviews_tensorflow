b'First, let me state that my family LOVES Outback. This is our "go to" restaurant when we want to celebrate anything. We ended up eating here on Memorial Day when the place we were headed did not work out. We were seated and our server came right away to take our drink orders. She was friendly and came back quickly with our drinks and bread. This is where the good review ends. We waited probably over 15-20 minutes and had to ask about our salads. She said the same thing another reviewer said about a computer shutdown. When our salads finally arrived, they were all incorrect. We didn\'t say anything. Our food arrived another 10 minutes later, but my youngest daughter\'s meal was not included. We asked where it was. We got a blank look and the server went off to find it. Her meal did not arrive until after the rest of us were done eating. My filet was cooked to perfection, but my potato was cold. I asked if it could be heated and was given another potato. This one was not much better. Normally, when they bring your potato it\'s so hot that the butter is melting and the potato is too hot to eat right away (just right). My  husband\'s steak (ordered medium just like mine) was more like rare. He didn\'t say anything. Oh, and the server never came back. She kept sending others to finish up her job. We were so disappointed! We will not be back to this location again.'
