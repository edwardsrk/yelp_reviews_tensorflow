b"The location is ok but just the atmosphere is different then other angry crabs, not as exciting, music is way to loud and felt like a DMV location. The main problem is the po boy sandwitches, the portions are great but on a dry white sub and DRY!! No flavor at all, don't even think they used salt!  They should really toast the sub, add some more ingredients and make is moist!! It was something my 10 year old put together!! Very disappointed!!"
