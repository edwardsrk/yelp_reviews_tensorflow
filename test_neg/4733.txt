b"I think it's better to order and wait in the store than to order online or call it in. Not that it was faster at the store, but the wait time is less - about an hour less. So, we called the store to check on our order and was informed that it would be arriving at 8:15 PM or so. Or so. That's scary.  Indeed. It took over an hour and a half for the two pizzas to arrive. Would have been done with dinner and already at home had we gone out to eat at a restaurant. It might have been more expensive but less inconvenient. Talk about paying for convenience! Anyway, girl that delivered our pizza said they were busy when we asked what was going on. I mean, really?! Our order wasn't complicated. I don't understand how others can deliver a similar order in half the time. No, not even half the time! It's less than half! Good news, our order was correct and the pizza was still hot enough to be enjoyed. That's what the two stars are for."
