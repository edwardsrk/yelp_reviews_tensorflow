b'We went there to celebrate our anniversary. When we called to book a reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion. When we got there, no one congratulated us. No one seemed to care that we were even there. There were lots of staff walking around, but most of them seemed to be chatting amongst themselves. The food was ok, but not worth the $67 bill for 2 dishes and one drink. The jade exhibit was amazing and the atmosphere was good. It could have been better. We were interested in dessert, but got the impression that there was none, until we were asked after we finished dinner. I would have made room if I knew there was dessert.'
