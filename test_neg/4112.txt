b"Sadly my first Smashburger experience was an extreme dissapointment! Their customer service was horrible, the food was too salty, the surrounding tables were covered with trash, they screwed up our very simple order, and they didn't have any Tabasco. What burger joint doesn't have Tabasco? Obviously Smashburger. Perhaps we were there on an off day based on all the other reviews they received, but either way I won't be returning."
