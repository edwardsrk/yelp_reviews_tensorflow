b"I'm giving two stars because I can't personally say she's done makeup on me or for me. But my low rating is for my own personal attempt to book a makeup trial with Courtney. I reached out to her over Facebook because I found her post of her looking to do events for makeup. I reached out to her and we exchanged phone numbers and messages. She got back to me the first day we spoke online and promised to call me later that day. I never received a phone call that day. Which is understandable since she's probably busy with clients. She messaged me a day or so later apologizing for not getting back to me and again then stated to call me back later that day. Once again never received a phone call. About almost a week later she then sends out to me a message online about how she's having a promotion going on. Really? I understand your trying to push a nice promotion but that's just flaky and bad business. To promise a person twice you will call them and never do is just wrong. I'm not sure what others have experienced with her. If you received great makeup service great but I just can't get behind someone who can't even for one apologize for not contacting me and two for ignoring the fact you ignored me."
