b"Friday January 5 at around 1p I went inside the restaurant to order the crispy chicken sandwich meal. What I got was a longer than expected wait, employees who weren't knowledgeable of their own menu and excuses. The woman in front of me ordered the Rodeo chicken sandwich, but was given a fish sandwich, she told Michelle, the cashier who took her order, Michelle tried to relay that to the cook who responded with he doesn't know how to make that. I watched as Michelle took the fish sandwich from the customer and place it back on the warmer to be served again (EW!) once the cook came out and talked to the customer directly he was able to understand exactly what the woman wanted (Michelle kept saying 'rodeo' in a way that made it hard to understand)I had to wait about 10 minutes to order while being told that they are short staffed and that I would get waited on when she gets to me.My order took about another 10 minutes to get. Food was about warm. Definitely wont be returning after watching food get handled by a patron and then placed back to be served again instead of thrown away. I get you pay for what you get but geez!"
