b"I don't know what has changed- the last 2 or 3 times I've eaten there I've been underwhelmed with the food. Staff is always great and friendly, no complaints there,  but the meat always seems like it's been sitting out and is terribly dry. I realize it's a process and when I smoke my own meat it's obviously going to be juicier right out of the smoker or after a brief rest, but I feel like I showed up to a family bbq 2 hrs after the food was served and am cleaning up the leftovers. Not bad, but I really expect better for the price. $22 for 2 meat combo and a beer not including tip which the ladies that helped me deserved. Hope my opinion changes on the next trip-"
