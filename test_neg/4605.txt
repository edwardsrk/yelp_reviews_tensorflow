b'Service can be slow during lunch hour as sometimes there is only one person working. It\'s a nice looking place that\'s well designed for that "fun, late night food" feeling but I\'ve unfortunately always left Smoke\'s disappointed. On their menu the list of toppings and combinations they have sound really good, but no matter how many of them I\'ve tried they\'ve always tasted bland. Case and point, recently got a poutine that had "prime rib beef" but it was all grey coloured, overcooked ground beef. I don\'t see any reason you would waste prime rib meat by cooking it that way. Their fries are so/so, never quite crispy enough on the outside, or soft enough on the inside, their curds and sauce lack a lot of taste. I also find their to-go boxes make sure all the gravy drowns out the fries at the bottom so they get really soggy, fast. At this point I think I\'m done going back to this place and would encourage anyone who loves poutine to try somewhere else.'
