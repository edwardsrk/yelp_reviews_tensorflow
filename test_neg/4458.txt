b"Ohh Stingray.  How I mourn for what you used to be.This place was a solid happy hour spot.  The food is mediocre, the music is generic faux-laptop-DJ shit and the drinks are overpriced.  But on happy hour, hot damn.  It was all fantastic because the prices justified it.But here we are today, and the sake bombers have gone from lower end of the spectrum $5 on happy hour to all of a sudden $8 each without warning.  Really?  Did you think your food and vibe was justifying raising the price that much?  Now you're the most expensive sake bombers around!  I'm disappointed.  This place isn't good enough to justify that kind of price for a bottle of Kirin and some trash sake.  It isn't enough to justify 8 for two shitty small skewers of chicken when Dozo does it better for cheaper.Guess this is the last time I or my friends come to this heap, too bad because there's a lot of us and we're always looking for a decent happy hour."
