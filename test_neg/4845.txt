b"Sushi was mediocre. I do like their variety. Service was great. I just wish they'd work on one thing... My experience there was okay for my first time and the moment you step in to wash up its a nasty disappointment. I am huge on cleanliness and a restaurant should always have a clean restroom. If they can't maintain that for their customers and staff what's it to say about their kitchen? Just a thought. Not sure I'll ever go back. If they'd fix that issue it'd be a perfect little local spot."
