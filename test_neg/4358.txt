b'For years we have been going to different IHOPS.  Sadly, this is one of our least favorites.  Not only was it so cold inside, but the air-conditioning actually made our food cold too!  I had the stuffed french toast, which has always been my absolute favorite.  Unfortunately, this time, (while I was sitting there freezing) it tasted like it was stale and over cooked.  It was actually terrible!!!  My partners breakfast was "uneventful", but cold too!  I dont know why IHOP feels the need to freeze their customers out!  I realize we live in Arizona, but having to take a jacket inside to keep warm!?  There is no excuse for this!   Our waitress was nice, but not too terribly attentive.  I would have returned my meal for something that was fresh, but she never came back by to see how everything was.  We didnt understand this, since it was the middle of the week, and not even half full with customers.  Management needs to take a good hard look at why their IHOP is not only freezing inside,but their food is cold and stale. I even had to sit on a lumpy seat that was full of torn up duct tape. NOT impressive!! Being one of the larger Chains, one would think these types of problems shouldnt happen. Just reading the other reviews, I can see we werent the only ones that had problems.  What a shame!  We wont be returning to this location.'
