b"Got some fun hats and horns here for New Year's, although $3 per cardboard hat is kinda steep and they are too small for adult-sized heads. There's also something odd about the way this store is laid out. I used to work at Party City when I was 16 and I think my store had a better layout. I'm also not a fan of reciting my email address at checkout. It's a little inconvenient."
