b"My rating of the restaurant is based on a recent dinner experience. My party ordered the farfelle, tortellini, and linguini dishes. We all agreed that pasta is not their strength. My linguini came with 4 pieces of shrimp, a bland cream sauce and some wilted spinach for $16. I've been to many restaurants in that neighbourhood and many of them are pretty good but this one is NOT the place to go for dinner especially pasta. Maybe that's why it was empty when we went in at 6pm. Service was friendly, although we had a wrong order, but it was taken care promptly. Decor is nice and chic. Bathrooms were trendy though lighting is very dark inside. And just a side bar, all but one stall had toilet paper available. All this said, I do think this place would be nice for drinks and desserts. As we were getting ready to leave, I smelled some delicious intoxicating coffee brewing in the background. I was almost tempted to stay for that if my dinner wasn't so disappointing.  And I know their cakes are pretty good if they use the same supplier as the location in Scarborough. Overall, I would recommend this place for desserts and coffee after a meal with friends."
