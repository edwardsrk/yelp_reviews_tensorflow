b"They do have some excellent sandwiches, soup and bakery goods.  This particular location always seems to have problems.  Today there was no ice in the ice machine.  It's often hard to find a table that is clean.  Sometimes the turkey sandwich is excellent and other times it's made with thick, tough grizzled hunks of nasty turkey.  Other times it's very nice, thinly sliced turkey breast.  If you go here after 2:00 PM this location often they are out of the main sandwiches on the menu day after day. Maybe the other locations are better.  I don't know."
