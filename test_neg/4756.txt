b'This wings are alright and affordable.  Great atmosphere.  However was expecting more flavours for a restaurant that specializes in wings.  Their flavours are very basic and can be found at any restaurants that serve wings like mild, medium hot, BBQ, honey garlic, salt and pepper.  They need to be more adventures and play around with some sauces even as a special.'
