b'Ok. Looking for a nice restaurant to have dinner for the family. Mother had a burger, 2 kids split diver scallops, 1 kid ordered she crab and Mac n cheese off of the bar menu, wife had  , and I had the ribeye (2 pieces of meat the size of a meatball). Charged a split fee, charged for every soda refill, everything. No wine, 1 mixed drink. Bill north of 250. Wait staff was great, chef/owner great. Food to price to portion ratio? Definitely other places to go , equally as good if not better, at a fraction of the price.'
