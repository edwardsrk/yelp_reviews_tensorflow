b"So after a couple of previous attempts we finally made it to the new Bomba Tacos and Rum in Fairlawn.  It's a mixed Mexican-Carribean type menu and some of the options looked interesting. For appetizers we ordered bacon wrapped jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers and ceviche. They were good, I've had better but they were still quite tasty.  The ceviche was light with just the right amount of lime. It was served with red onion, avocado and fried plantain.  The flavor was light and not fishy but unfortunately the avocado was not edible as it was unripe and hard as a rock. It really should not have even be served.  We told our waitress and the chef took it off our bill. I really would have liked for them to have told us the avocado was not ripe so we could have ordered something else. Avocado is a huge part of ceviche so not having it edible was a big miss.  We each ordered two tacos as our main.  We ordered the duck, beef, pork and crispy shrimp.  The duck was such a small slice that we had to look for it in the heap shredded cabbage.  The beef and pork had a bit more in them but tacos need a lot of meat and sauce.  All of the tacos had heaps of greens and barely any of the sauce they described on the menu.  All were very dry.  The crispy shrimp was not crispy at all.  All in all a fairly big fail on all the tacos and at $3 to $4 each I think they should have been much better.  I was rooting for this place, nice decor, good service, nice atmosphere but the quality and taste was just not there.  I hope they make it."
