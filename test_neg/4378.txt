b"I don't quite understand the hype. I came here twice while living in Pittsburgh and the first timeThe breakfast was okay. We came a second time and I asked for waffle. The waffle came out too crispy so they made it again...which didn't change much. I finally gave up and asked for a pancake.I wish I took a picture but when I cut into the pancake batter just came pouring out. The waitress was so embarrassed. We finally just got up (the waitress was kind enough to refund us some of our money.. at least for my dish) and called it a morning. Management needs to talk to their cooks bc if you can't make a pancake or waffle at a breakfast place... you will have disappointed customers."
