b"Several months ago I walked in like always and waited to be next in line for my stylist and someone who got there after me got called first so when I questioned it I was told that they were starting to take appointments and although I was upset I continued to come to this location because after all I have been coming for almost 20 years and appointments would be more convenient. Yesterday 1/27/17 I called and made an appointment for my husband with a specific stylist for 10am cause that is what time she was coming in. So today 1/28/17 We arrived minutes before 10am and sat down and watched the stylist come in to report to work. Once she prepared herself and got ready to take her first customer whom I assumed was my husband because that is who the appointment was made for. She takes another customer and when I spoke up and said we had an appointment she said yeah but she's been waiting awhile. So my husband asked then what good is it to make an appointment. She was like well we are told when they have been here awhile we have to take them first. Which is utterly ridiculous. Never have I been in any place of business where a walk in is served first prior to an appointment. If we had been late then that would be the only explanation that would make sense but we weren't. So tell me why am I making an appointment if you are not going to honor it?????   Angie"
