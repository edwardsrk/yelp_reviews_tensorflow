b"went to pet planet and this time it is 3 strikes and you are out! 1) we called about using the self bath for our pups and no one called us back for 2 days!  2) we showed up today to purchase the same dog food only to discover they no longer take AmX, but the SAME food had gone up 20% in 4 months; that's 3. We want to purchase at smaller businesses, but no more!"
