b'well I was hoping this place would blow my socks off, but alas, my socks stayed tightly in tact. I had been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks and been checking out the menu in the window and online (I\'m at the Golds every morning, not just a creepy window stalker). We finally got a chance to go a few weekends ago and man, was I disappointed. They were busy, which is expected on a Friday night. We had to sit in the lobby of the hotel, which we did but was super awkward. We ordered a few drinks and hit the menu. I ordered the deviled eggs and wifey got teh cheese plate. I went with the short ribs with blue cheese grits while wifey went with teh ricotta pizza with pork belly. The apps were done right, no complaints there. I liked the crispy bacon under the mix in the midle of the eggs, nice touch. The entrees, on the other hand, were sub par. My "short rib" dish was a large beef rib, and not a true short rib. I\'m not THAT picky, but when I want short ribs, I want actual short ribs. the meat was super chewy, essentialy beef jerky on a large stick. The glaze tasted good but after wrestling with the knife to cut off a few pieces, that was it. The grits were also bland, no blue cheese to be found. Wifey\'s pizza should have read as Pork Belly pizza  and it would have been on point. Now I know it sounds crazy to compain about too much pork belly, but the entire thing was pork belly and there was no ricotta to be found. it was also super salty and just not very good. The server comped my short ribs due to them being inedible, which was very gracious. I had high hopes for this place and will give it another shot. I\'m hoping it doesn\'t go the way of St Francis where it\'s got tons of potential, but simply can\'t deliver'
