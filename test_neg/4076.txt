b'When you advertise that drinks are 50% off during happy hour, I expect to be charged half price. When the server asks: "any last happy hour drinks?", I also expect to be charged half price. Half of $16 is $8, not $8.50. It\'s not about the $0.50, it\'s about principle. Think how many customers, myself included, have been paying more than what we should. Shady business. This was my last time here.'
