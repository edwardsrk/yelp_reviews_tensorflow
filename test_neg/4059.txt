b"Recently here for KSU homecoming.  They were apparently unprepared for homecoming and the crowds as food and drink orders were slow (30 minutes) to arrive.  The place was so loud you could not hear the person next to you.The food was mediocre.  We had nachos which hardly had any cheese on them, some french fried pickles which were bland, and a variety of wings which were ok.  The facility is clean and bright with lots of TVs showing sports if that's what you are into."
