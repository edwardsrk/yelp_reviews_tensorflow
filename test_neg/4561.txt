b"Green Valley Ranch Resort is outstanding!  However, the spa leaves you ultimately disappointed in the entire place if ever you go there.  Had 3 massages w/my 2 best friends for our local girlfriend get away.  Room was nice, restaurants and gaming area great!  However, the spa was HORRIBLE!  The front desk girl acted like we were a burden to be waited on even when we went to pay our huge bill.  All of us make good money and are professional ladies.  We don't drink at a spa or act up-we are the guests of an establishment and we treat it as we would want a guest in our own homes.  So there was no reason for the treatment we got.  The rest of the staff was ok.  Not rude but the massages and treatments were that of a training school level-yet some of the MOST expensive we have ever paid for!  And they made the 20% tip mandatory for our party of THREE!  Which was not acceptable because the treatments were all very poor and the tip would have reflected it.  Did write a letter to the spa mgr of our treatment and poor quality massages and part of our bill was refunded, but this is not what we wanted.  We really wanted to amazing experience that GVR spa should have been able to of delivered as a true reflection of the prices they charge and the level of the rest of the property.  Will not be back."
