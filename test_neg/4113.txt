b"I was quite disappointed with this restaurant.  We visited this restaurant back in July.  The food wasn't much better than your average Kelseys with a higher price point and the service was terrible! I had the prime rib dinner which was mostly fat! There was a group of us dining and we all said we would never come back!"
