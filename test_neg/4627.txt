b'My family went there hoping for a good burger place to go to near our home. When we got there, no one was at the door to seat us, we got out own silverware and menus. Finally someone who I guess work there sat us. It was 5:30. We sat for 10 mins without anyone ask what we wanted to drink and then when our waitress finally came over she told us we had 10 mins until happy hour was done and went to get our drinks. Did not see her again for 15 mins by then happy hour was over and we could not get any of the specials. She finally showed up again and we got to order. 30 mins later finally got our food. The food was fine, not a lot of fries with the meal. Our waitress boyfriend came in and she gave most of her attention to him and did not pay attention to her tables. We left there very unimpressed and may go back to try a different waitress because most seem to be very good but ours was horrible.'
