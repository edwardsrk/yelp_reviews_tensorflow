b'Oh lord. This is a great example how a good restaurant will go down the gutter if it does not have it\'s act together.I have been to Old School at least 5 times in the past few months and it  has been an absolute joy. Sure, their food may be a tad too heavy for my stomach, but that\'s part of the charm: hearty, big meals that will make you not wanna eat anything for the rest of the day. I have had quite a few of the various options: my favourite is "Don\'t even go there." Extravagant, unnecessary and fantastic. And then came new management. Or so it seems. At least all of the staff has changed. Suddenly I did not recognise anyone. Which, in of itself, is not an issue - I could not care less in theory. In practice, what ended up happening was that there was some major logistal nightmares going on in the back (i.e. kitchen) where we waited, and I kid you not, 1 hour and 45 minutes to get our food. Now, generally, you\'d say service sucks then. indeed it does. However, I must give koodos where koodos are to be given - we had a brilliant server (Danielle) who tried to bribe us with doughnuts and biscuits while we waited. She was an absolute joy, but even she could only bump this to a 2-star review. This whole situation is rather unfortunate, as this place used to be really good. Management needs to get its act together and get this fixed, because places in Toronto do not stay open for very long if you are treating your customers to this sort of fun. The Yelp reviews have dropped from 4.0 to 2.5 from July to August... May that be a good hint to changes that need to happen.'
