b'The restaurant was not busy with lots of tables available.  However, the hostess did not make you feel welcome and had us wait to be seated. Michael the server was pleasant.  The chicken and meatball sliders had no flavor and were mostly buns.  We traveled from Phoenix for a very disappointing meal.'
