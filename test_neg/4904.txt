b'Every single dish is super salty. Just a very below average dim sum place. The standards just aren\'t there. Food isn\'t too greasy though, so there\'s that. A lot of the dishes weren\'t even decent. Only good "dish" was the egg tarts (super silky filling and super buttery crust), although that\'s probably sourced from elsewhere, not made in-house. Would not recommend this dim sum place.'
