b'I came with in hungry and with an open mind, being a huge steakhouse fan.  They charge a hefty price for their steaks; and the steaks are very good.  However, the steaks are nothing special.  I had the ribeye, and my date had the filet.  Both were obviously quality cuts of meat, but just nothing that would set either apart from other steakhouses.I did not appreciate the attitudes of the snooty staff and hostesses.  This place is over-the-top pretentious, which is to be expected, but I just felt like there was an ora that was disgusting.  In Vegas, I\'ve enjoyed Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon which are other even higher-end restaurants.  There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.  At Prime, they made it feel as though I should be thankful to be served and seated in such a prim and proper, "high" class environment.  Prime is trying to be something that it\'s not.  This restaurant is located 45 yards from a wheel of fortune slot.  There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.  We\'re not in Paris folks, we\'re in Las Vegas- king of the nobody doing his best to act like he\'s somebody, and paying the credit card price for month\'s to come (LV is my favorite city in America).Finally, the $100 seafood appetizer platter was a complete waste.  The oysters were terrible (relative).  Prime needs to lose the attitude, and focus more on special food that matches the price.'
