b"Very disappointed.  Menu sounds great, interesting and enticing.  But they missed on many points between what it sounded like. And what they delivered.Ordered 8 things.  Best was the calamari but the portion size was very small, especially considering the dish is normally 9.95-12.95 around town and those places serve 2-3 times a portion size.The pretzel with beer dip was much better after they brought fresh pretzels.  Liked that.  Beef and lobster skewers were minimal pathetic tastes of both, too salty and very pricey.  Most food was very saltyPizza was pretty good but the star of the meal was the lettuce cups.  Enjoy those.  As for drinks, mojito was ok, not special and to fill the glass with crushed ice is a trick to serve slight portions that we are all familiar with.See no reason to go back, and will go to Pink Taco or luckys next time I'm there."
