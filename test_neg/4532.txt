b'One thing my wife and I try to avoid on date night are big corporate chain restaurants; once I heard that Larry and Guy sold the amazing Eddie V\'s brand to Red Lobster I swore I\'d never go back.  However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.The KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit I\'m living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item I\'ve ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but it\'s been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than 30 times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there; every time it was like "I can\'t believe this is so amazing." That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in 1987.  To finish on a positive note: our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the "pre Red Lobster" version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.  I know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie V\'s so my review doesn\'t amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didn\'t water down great and unique recipes.  We\'ll stick with the privately owned, local places from now on.'
