b'I\'m really not sure how this place ended up with 4 stars, because I was struggling to give it two.   Service at the bar dragged it up, but that\'s about all that I have positive to say about the place.   I went there for a wine and coloring book event, but had dinner at the bar first.  It was warm in the bar, but even warmer (sweltering really) in the restaurant section.  The food was freezer fare that they made an attempt to dress up a little.  The buffalo chicken wrap had potential, but the thin buffalo sauce leaked all out of it and it ended up a big soggy, greasy mess.  The lettuce on it was questionable as well.  The sweet potato fries were passable and were served with apple butter, which was a nice touch.  It\'s still freezer food though.  I also found it really odd that they were filling their ice wells with 20 lb bags and were serving soda from 2 liter bottles. Once I moved to the dining area, I wasn\'t sure which was worse - the sweltering heat or the "entertainment".  At first, we thought "what is with this music selection?"  The bar was playing contemporary country and this was stuff my grandparents would have listened to.  Then, we thought "hmmm...this version of the song really sounds like bad karaoke".   After looking around, we see a guy out on the patio with a karaoke machine.   Oh...that explains it.  It IS bad karaoke.   30 minutes later, though, we thought "why is this same terrible guy still up there?"  And then he pulled out a trumpet and clearly, it wasn\'t just karaoke night - this was the intended entertainment.  Yikes!'
