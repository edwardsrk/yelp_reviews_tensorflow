b'This was (and will probably still be) my goto bar in Vegas because I love country, am country, and love dancing without it being a sweaty glitzy expensive Vegas scene. However, they started charging more and more cover- 10 bucks is ridiculous for a mediocre Vegas bar. The band was also meh- not necessarily danceable country (who hollers "any George Straight fans!!" Then plays "the Chair"?!? Wtf?) and overly pleased with themselves- if people didn\'t immediately cheer after a song they would remind us (um, you\'re a bar band here for my dancing enjoyment, I didn\'t come to your concert nameless egotistical dude)... Beer selection was ok and the price was fine- $10 with tip for an amber ale draft. But I hated to order much after the stupid cover charge. Pros- beer was an ok selection, not just BL and CL. Dancing is ALWAYS a good time!! Okay, I\'m sounding bitter and I apologize... But I miss my crappy divey cheap Gilley\'s!'
