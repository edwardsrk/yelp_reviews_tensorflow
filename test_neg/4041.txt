b'The first time i came it was delicious and had fast service. Second time I went i ordered a breakfast sandwhich without spinach salsa or peppers. Got it to go. It took forever. And it had more mushrooms than anything else. It didnt even have cheese and it came with peppers. I even asked before getting the bag if she had made sure it was no spinach pepper or salsa and she said yes. What a waste of $9. All i can taste is mushroom.'
