b"The only thing I usually get from McDonald's is the chicken nuggets . I decided to treat myself today to some nuggets. After ordering I asked for barbecue sauce, and this location didn't have any!! What kind of McDonalds doesn't have the SAUSE OF GODS!!! I'm pretty disappointed .. I guess there's a first time for everything.. staff was friendly still service somewhat slow.... get your act together Ronald McDonald !"
