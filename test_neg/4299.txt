b'Worst service I have had in a while.  Who only has one sushi chef  and gives the Sushi chef and hour break.  Reason I went there for my birthday.  Waitress  said sorry but any other appetizers without a menu?  Reall?  Another person order an appetizer never got it.  Ask for another fork took 30 minutes.'
