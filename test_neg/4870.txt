b"I thought it was going to be really amazing here but ....not really.1. I got a perm and my curls are not lasting very long it's been a month and most of the curls are gone. 2. my scalp was hurting a lot after the perm. I've gotten perms before and it was the first time it actually hurt. 3. the hair cut itself was just so so i brought photos but were not very helpful... I recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a Japanese style."
