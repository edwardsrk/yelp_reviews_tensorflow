b"I've been a big fan of moxies since the start, and specifically this location, I remember being there when they first opens in 2007 maybe or so, and always been a regular customer.But lately, the quality has been going down constantly..!!Last time I visited this location was last year sometime in the summer, and I was very disappointed then.So today, I decided to give it another chance, since I love the 'original Moxie's', but things are still not that good unfortunately.They have revamped the menu majorly, keeping some of their main/top seller items, while modifying/adding new items..Presentation has changed also, they now use aluminium trays for nachos for example rather than the original setup, or clay rectangle and oval plates for appetizers.We ordered three appetizers and all three were too greasy..As for our mains, we had the lettuce burger, chipotle chicken, caesar salad with chicken, steak salad and pasta. Needless to say, all plates were dry and missing flavour.On the other hand, moxie's used to have (in my opinion) the best service at a chain restaurant, hands down!This has hit rock bottom now, the service today was below average, slow and just like the food...tasteless!Sadly, this puts an end to my Moxie's obsession!"
