b"I starting coming here back in 2016 , the service was great. Coming now I wait at least 2 hours to get seen. I leave work early of a scheduled appointment and they still never see me on time. The front staff is rude well not all of them are. One day I had a app and she gave everyone else a call that the doctor was not in, but didn't give me the call. I showed up and she had the nervous to roll her eyes. I can't wait to get my braces off. The doctor is great and some of the staff members are great."
