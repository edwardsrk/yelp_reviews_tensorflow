b'Walking up to Sage Bar, we were unsure if we had come to the correct restaurant.  It\'s definitely more "bar" than "Vietnamese."  We double-checked the address on the Groupon (Rural & Chandler) and then dove into three entrees and an appetizer.  My brother in law saw the white servers and the non-Vietnamese atmosphere and adeptly ordered a burger.  I shared a pho bo and stir fry beef dish with rice.  Pho Bo was okay.  The broth was very sweet in the Southern Viet style.  Beef slices were neither plentiful or scarce.  I don\'t usually eat that many noodles, but I found the serving to be skimpy.  They used the pho cut of beef (eye of round) in the stir fry which was very strange.  It was served with a sweet soy sauce concoction and we asked for nuoc cham (fish dipping sauce) and we were given a viscous and strangely sweet sauce.  I\'ve never seen a Vietnamese person serve such a thing.  Plus they added an extra charge on the bill for the sauce, wtf.The tofu appetizer was overpriced and not worth it.  I\'m gonna have to buy a $1.30 box of tofu from Lee Lee to erase that dish from my memory.I\'m not sure what atmosphere the owners are going for.  This place gives me a weird feeling in my tummy.  Flat screens everywhere for sports fans.  Seems like if you\'re a single guy who enjoys Americanized/fusion food and often dines alone then this is the place for you.  If you\'\'re looking for a gastronomic experience you will be underwhelmed.I won\'t be coming back to Sage for any Viet food.  If I ever return, I\'ll stick to the American foods on the menu.  Hopefully they won\'t charge me extra if I want some ketchup.'
