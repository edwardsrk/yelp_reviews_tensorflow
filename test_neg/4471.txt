b'I specifically went to Yelp to find an Italian restaurant while in Vegas.  I am shocked at how many fantastic reviews are on here.  Either most people have never had real italian food OR they had an off night because my husband and I were thoroughly disappointed.I had the carbona, and despite it being made with pancetta, it really needed salt!  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was just ok.  It was also kind of difficult to find.Sorry guys...'
