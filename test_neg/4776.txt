b"Service is good. This place is opened super early and super late. It might even be 24/7Anyway I arrived on a Saturday around 5pm. I purchased a groupon hotel deal which came with $10 in food credit.No lines. Quickly seated. Service was good too. Ordered the fried zucchini. The zucchini itself was ok but the sauce made it tolerable. Spicy with some zing to it. My zucchini was very soggy after 5 min tho. Not really worth getting. I don't think I'd get this next time. 3/10Ordered 10 piece hot wings. Garlic Parmesan. Not breaded and with bone in. First bite was great. The other 9 pieces were lacking flavor and sucked though. Dry and felt like it was microwaved. 3/10This place charges 99 cents for ranch! What the heck? At least tell me beforehand!!Anyway is average stuff you can get anywhere. Only went here because of the food credit. Wish the chicken had more of the sauce on it because it was totally lacking."
