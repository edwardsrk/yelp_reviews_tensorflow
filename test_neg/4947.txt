b"It's not actually a Best Western any more.  It had changed ownership the week before my friends and I arrived.  After checking in we were informed that the elevator to our room didn't always work so we should take another elevator to the 7th floor than take the stairs up to the 8th.  Apparently they needed to work on a few kinks.  We get to our room and there is 1 queen bed but we booked for 2.  But there was a couch and ta-da!  A pull out queen.  It's all good, except wait, these queens look a little small.  Yup, this must be the first time I had my feet hang over the edge of a queen bed.  On top of that the pull out bed was uncomfortable as hell!  It sunk in toward the middle so I kept feeling like I was sinking.  I fell right to sleep since I was so tired but my friend woke me up when she bumped into my feet in the morning!  Stupid short bed.In any case, house keeping were great and we had a nice little view of the surrounding area thanks to our little balcony.  It's also close to the library, old spaghetti factory, an art museum, cafes, etc.  It was also within walking distance to 1st and Roosevelt where they were holding 1st Fridays which is pretty much a block party for the arts.The location was the best attribute here.  House keeping was nice but the beds did me in."
