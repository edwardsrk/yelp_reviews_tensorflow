b"I'm a fan of Starbucks and that's why this is getting a 2 stars. But they have very rude employees here. Employees give dirty looks while you're trying to order. The lady helping me in particular had a rude tone and was very short with her responses. I saw her intentionally ignoring other customers as well. I understand that side of town is a little rough, but not every customer deserves such disrespect. Won't be coming back to this location."
