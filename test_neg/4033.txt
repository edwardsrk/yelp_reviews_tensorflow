b"My wife (a chef herself) and I ate here because it was right next to our hotel and the ambience and menu looked appealing...which they in fact are. The problem is the food. We ordered a chile releno appetizer (couldn't taste the poblano chile at all due to heavy handed seasoning in the filling and the overfrying of the whole thing), a halibut dish with a cactus salsa (pretty good), truffled mac and cheese (very good), a chile-glazed skirt steak (completely underseasoned and cooked rare and bloody instead of the WELL DONE that was ordered and emphasized with the waiter) and potatoes au gratin (gobs of cheap cheese sauce and undercooked potatoes which we didn't eat and they graciously took off the bill). The service was OK at first, until we expressed reservations about some of the dishes. At that point the waiter started taking it personal and we just wanted to get the heck out of there as soon as we could. So 50% of the food was poorly cooked, including the steak! This is not a good score for a restaurant of this price point... an unpleasant eating experience overall."
