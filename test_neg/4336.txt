b"I am leaving a 2 star review only because in the  past I have had amazing dinners here. But tonight, I asked the chef to substitute oil for butter as I have a severe dairy allergy (which they've done in the past) and was told 'No.'. Why? I have no idea. I told the very sweet waiter that they had made the substitution before, but apparently tonight's chef could care less. What a disappointment. To be willing to pay nearly $40 for an entree only to be told that they won't substitute oil for butter. I was unable to eat anything on the menu as they weren't open to making any exceptions. Needless to say we will not be returning."
