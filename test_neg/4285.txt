b"I didn't find very many options on the menu that sounded good.I ordered the hominy as an appetizer and it was very spicy and good.  I would recommend it.I chose pork chops as my entree and the sauce on top was very heavy.  The chop itself was tender and had alot of fat on it.  I wouldn't order it again.My friend had clams and enjoyed them.The ambiance was really nice and our waiter was cool.  But if it weren't for great conversation with an old friend dinner would have been a miss."
