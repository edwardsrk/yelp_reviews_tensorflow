b"Like many of the big chain restaurants the menu is standard fare. I wanted a healthy salad and got a flavorless meal I could make better at home. The location needs a good cleaning, faster service and a better product delivered to the customer considering the cost of the meal. Skip this location and look for a local haunt to get a great meal. I won't go back."
