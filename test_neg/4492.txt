b"I've lived in the area a long time but never been to Cappy's..and now I know why. When you walk in there's no one to acknowledge you or seat you. Then a waitress came by and said to sit wherever. Our server was lethargic and just seemed out of it.. They have about 5 beers on tap- majority just domestics. They do have a lot of bottles apparently but no bottle list to choose from...so. We got sandwiches and they were decent but the fries (which they charge extra for) tasted freezer burnt. We had to ask for silverware and napkins...TWICE. I honestly don't even understand how this place has survived this long in Shadyside when there are a ton of better options."
