b'Moist, fresh food from a chain, on the west side. Who\'d have thunk?--actual STEAMED fresh vegetables, not micro frozen. see what little effort it takes?--loved the "buffalo" potatoes; nicely cooked, bite-size, drenched in wing sauce with ranch for dipping. BING.--really pricey for what it is. $14 for a basic salad? where do you think we are, Scottsdale?--too many windows, too much light to be a proper pub--decor from some pick-by-page-and-letter Irish kitsch catalog.--um. there\'s a metal fishnet thing on the ceiling!--all two- and four-tops except for a giant picnic-table size 16-top: you can\'t bring your extra 0.6 out of 2.6 children -- who needed him anyway?--ding for leaving my half-and-half on the bar for 5 minutes; this is a PUB, lady! Don\'t keep me from my Guiness and Harp!Something surreal about the popup mall that sits across from a dead field. And right on the corner is the Auld Dubliner. Far too many windows for a proper pub. Fill those in, man! And what do we get to look at? The empty dead field across the street.Although very moist and fresh, the food here is mostly bland. Thank God for Coleman\'s mustard. Between us all we emptied the entire jar onto our food; ok, most of it was on my plate, but hey!'
