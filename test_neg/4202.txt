b"Heard so much hype about Shake Shack, and was excited to try it. I got a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and a small drink. My wife got the basic burger combo. This set us back around $25. For that price I expected much more in terms of quality. The burger itself was tasty but it was ridiculously small, and the bun was a soggy mess. The crinkle fries were below average and the soda fountain is behind the counter, meaning you have to wait for refills. I did not have a shake and I'm willing to try them, but I'll never waste my money on the food again. Smashburger has much better food, far more toppings, better fries  and is a bit less expensive. Bottom line: don't come here hungry and expect to leave full."
