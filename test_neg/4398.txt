b'I used to like Reggies, and was a regular customer, but have found the quality to really become erratic recently, which is a shame.  On it\'s good days, the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts (all day).  First, when pulling in, beware, as the parking lot is VERY rough, with MAJOR pot holes.  For your car\'s sake, GO SLOW!One item that I\'ve liked here is the "old fashioned," which is a couple potato pancakes (served with sour cream and cheese), couple eggs, breakfast meat, and toast.   Another few that I\'ve liked are their ruben, their Philly Cheese steak, their ciabatta club sandwich, the hot roast beef sandwich (served open face) and their chicken enchilada soup (spicy).  Also, on the weekends, in the morning, they have a "breakfast bar", a buffet of typical breakfast items, including eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, pancakes, waffles, corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit.Their NY Strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss.  I\'ve gotten some excellent steaks, cooked quite well before, but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle.  It felt like about a 30% chance of getting a bad steak.Talking more of the erratic quality, an example, one time when I ordered the ciabatta turkey club, I got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and RAW bacon (not just undercooked, it looked like it hadn\'t been cooked AT ALL!).  I\'ve also gotten eggs burned at random times, bacon burned, hashbrowns burned, etc.  Again, this is not a 100% thing, but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately.'
