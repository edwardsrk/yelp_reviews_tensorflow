b"The doctors are fine but the wait times are horrible. I don't expect to be seen right on the dot, but always waiting for nearly an hour with a sick, whiny toddler with all the other equally miserable parents is just dreadful.  And I'm a SAHM. I can't imagine how you're going to manage your day if you're taking time off work to be at TLC Peds. The office staff can also be nicer. It's already a stressful time for parents to be dealing with sicks kiddos, some sympathy and smiles would cheer up the patient's day."
