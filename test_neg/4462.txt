b'I came here for the advertised Cinco de Mayo specials that were not available. The meal ended up being very expensive and the meal itself was just as poor as the pricing. The only thing I liked less than the watered down margaritas was the taste left in my mouth after paying $10 for each of them. I had a regular margarita and decided to go for the cotton candy martini hoping it would be better but was not impressed. Overall, the experience was not great. The food was underwhelming and the drinks were appalling.'
