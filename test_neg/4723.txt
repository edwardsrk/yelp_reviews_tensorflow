b"Decent show last night and you can take photos, but really needs a different venue.  Palazzo Theater has the worst service!  We waited over 45 minutes for our server to take our drink order, the whole time we are waiting there is an obnoxiously bright LED light lit on our table during performance.  Then, she never brought our drinks.  I didn't bother pressing button again since light was so bothersome and despite being bright as the sun, the server was blind to it.  Theater needs more attentive servers and better ushers too.  We were advised to enter door on completely opposite side of our seats."
