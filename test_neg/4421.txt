b'This was our initial time at this Iconic Restaurant. We had a business lunch and made reservations a couple of weeks ago. Unfortunately, they gave our table to another person with the same first name. Not Kool! When we were finally able to sit down  (15 minutes), we found the menu to be quite pretentious and all over the global map. Our server was neither engaging or user friendly and was not an asset in navigating the menu. I ordered the Burger which was literally falling apart as I tried to eat it. I requested the burger a click above medium and received a burnt dried out tasteless mess. I mentioned this to the waiter and he said that\'s how I ordered it. Really, I didn\'t recall asking for a burnt, lifeless, dead on arrival Burger. So taking the high road, I asked him to take it away and that I\'ll just have the fries for lunch. Unfortunately, The fires were a greasy quagmire and not eatable. The waiter, to his credit,  said the Chef wanted to make another which he did. However, it wasn\'t any better. My associate\'s had their fish Taco and a Chicken appetizer which were excellent. Their only complaint were that for a $16 price point the appetizer was hardly enough for one and not shareable in any manner, shape or form. It was same case for the Fish Taco, not enough food for a the monetary outlay. So if you want a "little" well prepared, good food at a high price point, this is the place for you. Just stay away from the burger and fries!'
