b'What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are."Also:"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I\'ve ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I\'d be all for it."And:"I can\'t wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?"Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There\'s some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn\'t really pertinent then, either.Anyway, I\'m *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.But I don\'t.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn\'t what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I\'d wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they\'d be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren\'t.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I\'ll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, "Meh.  I\'ve experienced better."  Which is why you see two stars here.In fact, I don\'t blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you\'re gonna tell the world what\'s delicious, don\'t smoke out first, because I\'ve been there and eaten a piece of my cat\'s litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.A couple of disclaimers: I don\'t hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I\'m not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos.'
