b"Stopped in to get some snacks on our way to a softball game and spent about 15 bucks. I used my debit card and asked for 40 back because I needed some cash for next day. The  attendant started to tell me that I had to notify her prior to getting cash back and proceeded to tell me that I had to inform her that I want cash back due to them having limited cash. For the weekend. If that is true then don't offer cash back and my slices of pizza was nasty maybe I'll be back but I will always get cash back with out notice just to piss you off"
