b'First I\'ll start by saying we love the B&N at Chandler Fashion Square! That being said, this location is a completely different experience...not in a good way. We found the employees to be very rude and not very helpful; and they were out of everything they said they had in Stock.  We stopped by the customer service desk on the first floor and she acted like we were completely putting her out for asking where to find a certain genre of book. There was another woman employee who scolded my children in front of me for "walking up the escalator too loudly." The kids were not being rowdy or disrespectful...they weren\'t even running up the escalator but walking! They were excited to pick out new books as they love to read! If they don\'t want kids going upstairs, they should probably keep the kids books on the first floor!  There was a young man working upstairs that was very nice and actually very helpful, he just couldn\'t find anything because, although their computer said the book was in, it was not. He tried and was very apologetic. He also mentioned how understaffed they were. I believe it! The cashier mentioned  the same thing and was also very nice. (This fact is the ONLY reason I even gave it 2 stars). Needless to say, I will NOT be frequenting this location again.  I prefer a stocked B&N with employees who are willing to help and harvest children\'s love of reading.'
