b'I loved the Go Deluxe room and if it wasn\'t for it being super cute and cheap I\'d knock this sucker down to one star cause the Room Service is god awful.3:00PM: Arrive and call for extra towels, blankets, toilet paper, pillows and cups.5:00PM: Call again for the same items7:00PM: Call again and I\'m flipping pissed this time because I said it\'s been 4 hours since I\'ve gotten my items. They told me that it\'ll be right up within the hour.8:00PM: STILL NOT THERE. So I got my ass down to Guest Services so I could speak with whoever was in charge of Hotel/Room service but they said that they don\'t even have that! WTF? WHO THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO COMPLAIN TO THEN? So I had them call those fuckers again and they were like "Oh apparently you only called once?" So I flipped out on them too. I even told them the times I called and how I was patient with them, allotting them at least 2 hours to get the shit up to the room. Anyways the guy said I could write a letter to them and they\'ll see what they can do.8:45PM: We got our stuff but the bastards forgot the blankets. I\'ve been to TONS of hotels and I\'ve never had the shittiest hotel service ever.SO STUPID! Even Hooters was better with their service but their rooms were gross hahaha.'
