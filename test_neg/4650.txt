b'Okay, downgrading my last review.  One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken "Vings" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.  Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips.  Someone else will appreciate it I am sure.  Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won\'t hurt your profits that bad!!Peace out.  Find your sizzle!!Attorney Steve'
