b'I came here last night around 8:30 with my boyfriend to get something to eat. We were greeted and then chose a spot nearby to sit and right away we saw a cricket nearby our table. I didn\'t mind it, and neither did my boyfriend. We sat down and ordered our drinks and food. My boyfriend mentions how he saw a roach crawling up the stairwell. I got gross out at the thought of it but shrugged it off. As we continued to wait, I felt something land on my right shoulder and my immediate reaction was to quickly brush it off. I asked my boyfriend if it was a roach and the look on his face answered my question. The roach fell from the ceiling and landed on my shoulder! Either it came from upstairs or was crawling on the ceiling, I don\'t know for sure. We moved to a different table and the waitress brought our drinks and asked if we saw another cricket, we told her what happened and she looked horrified. She apologized and told us that they spray the place once every two weeks. I told her it was okay. When she left I saw two more roaches. One crawling on the wall behind my boyfriend and one underneath the table next to us, barely alive. My boyfriend and I decided to leave, we didn\'t feel comfortable eating there anymore. We asked if we could just pay for the drinks instead. She understood and asked if we would like our food to go but we said "No thank you." She said we didn\'t have to pay for the drinks. She was very kind to us. I suggest you don\'t come in during summer time. I\'ll probably just come here during any other time of the season.'
