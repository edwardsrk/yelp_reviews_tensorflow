b"We stopped in to support them for dinner around 5 PM.  The place was clean and decorated well.  I ordered the fried chicken which I must say was steaming hot and deliciously tasty.  However, the vegetables left a lot to be desired.  I believe they may have sat all day without even a stir.  The sweet potatoes...no.  The steamed cabbage...salty.  The kids loved the chicken but the mac and cheese...they wouldn't touch it.  Way too much cheese that was not blended well.  When kids won't eat your mac and cheese, you've got problems.  I so much wanted this new restaurant to take off and be successful but I doubt, given the current state, this will happen. I am rating this new soul food restaurant 2.5 stars but cannot round it up to a 3."
