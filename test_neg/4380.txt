b"Bought a couch and love seat from and was promised delivery between 4 and 6 pm. Called at 6:30 and was told the delivery was from between 10 and midnight (who has furniture delivered at midnight). Asked customer service to speak with a supervisor and was denied our request. We were told that the delivery personnel would call us before they arrive, because we made it clear we would have a sleeping young child. No phone call was received they knocked and rang the doorbell waking up our small child. At least they ended up giving us free delivery. I wasn't happy, but sadly to say it was still a better experience than we have had with Ashley Furniture."
