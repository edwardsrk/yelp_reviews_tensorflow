b'I was somewhat disappointed; but I didn\'t grow up in the Northeast so take my review with a grain of salt.I was pretty excited that a lobster roll food truck was going to arrive in Vegas and I had planned with a couple friends to go. Obviously I\'m aware that lobster isn\'t the cheapest thing on the market, but their lobster rolls were $14/ea, which was higher than the price offered at their LA trucks. As lobster rolls traditionally are, this included lobster meat piled on a hot dog bun. Tasty, but just not the Vegas portions I\'m used to. I got a side of plain tots which were $4. They were fine. I just knew I was going to need more food in addition to the small roll but didn\'t want to make this food-truck equally as expensive as going to a half-decent sit-down restaurant by purchasing another lobster-garnished dish.My friend asked if the $12 lobster tots were large enough to be a dish on their own. "Yeah they are huge!" When she received hers she immediately knew it wasn\'t going to be enough food. It was the just side of tater tots with some lobster on the top.This will probably be popular with people that moved here from the Northeast, though.'
