b"Sorry for the lack of stars.. It's only cus i've only been here a few times and that was cus it's the closest to my house. The 2 stars are mainly for this cinco de mayo roll I had. It was a whole green chili pepper. The taste was more pleasant it's looks. And the other star is for actually have PLUM ice cream. Other than that.. The price is too dramatic for my belly. And most of the meat here doesn't seem as fresh. Seriously, my wallet is more in pain than the tightness of my jeans at the waist."
