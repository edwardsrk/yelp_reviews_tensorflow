b"Not very happy after tonight's visit... Food was undercooked for both of us and we ended up having to pay full price for bottle of wine because apparently if you have a Groupon (which doesn't even cover alcohol) they penalize you for having it. Tonight's dinner ended up costing more than our norm. Really unhappy and we were regulars so I'm not sure that we will return."
