b"Love their pad thai! Sadly i can't seem to find any pad thai better than this. Maybe lots of msg is the secret. Thai Express's tom yam noodle soup is pretty good as well.The service at this location is decent. However, like with many other Thai Express franchise, I wish they take hygiene more seriously. Cooks here touch ingredients barehanded and it always makes me disgusted."
