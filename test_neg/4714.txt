b"Will I make it a must see whenever I visit friends in Las Vegas? Definitely NOT!We decided to do a group date ( 3 different couples) and thought this would be a good place to go to since we had all been wanting to try it out for quite some time.  We went during happy hour which was great since the drinks and appetizers were 1/2 priced, but that was really where the good things end.We sat at the bar out by the patio area. You would think sitting at the bar you would get some faster service, especially since they were not even close to being busy yet with maybe 3 other tables in the whole place being occupied.  It took forever to get the bar tender to even get our drink orders since apparently he was deciding to flirt with one of his co-workers that night.  Finally got our drinks (which I will admit weren't bad) but then it took another 15 or 20 minutes before we were able to order any appetizers since apparently every one decided to go on break or something.After we finally got our appetizers (which were okay but nothing amazing) it was an evening full of having to ask 3 or 4 times for other beverages, even asking for water about 3 times and never getting it( again we were right at the bar, and by now there were maybe only 5 other tables in the whole place being occupied). Finally we were fed up and decided to take our business elsewhere, paid our bill and left. We took our business to another one of the bars in Town Square and were much much more satisfied.Good drinks, mediocre food, and really, really bad service."
