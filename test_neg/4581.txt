b"Mohammed, our food runner was great! Very attentive and friendly. I was also very grateful for the fact that there were vegan options on the menu. Unfortunately, the rest of our experience was quite underwhelming. Our server was double sat by the hostess, so he took about 20 minutes to take our order and we probably waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks (which were delivered by a shaky, unapologetic manager). The only reason I know the server was double sat is because that's the first thing he told us when he came to take our order; he was visibly upset and made us all feel very unwelcome. The experience only got better when Mohammed delivered our food; that was literally the only time we felt welcome and accommodated. My friends were visiting from out of town and I was so excited to bring them here for brunch; instead I left disappointed and embarrassed for having brought them to such an overrated & lackluster establishment. Living in this city, we are spoiled with so many dining options and you expect to get the best of the best at Wynn or Encore but I've honestly had better service at Applebee's!"
