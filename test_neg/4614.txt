b"I was super excited to come here for dinner from all the good things I heard about this place. However, It didn't live up to the reviews and comments I've heard.The people were all very friendly though which is why they got two stars. The decor is nice as well. But the food, left much to be desired.I ordered the starter caesar salad and it was just awful. It tasted less like a caesar salad and more of a citrus orange dressing salad. I seemed to have the end of the lettuce stock only and there was no caesar dressing taste at all. I sent it back because I couldn't even eat around the dressing. For my main I ordered the sunday special. I believe it was the prime rib dinner. It was dry and bland. I was so disappointed because it sounded like quite the dinner on the menu. Maybe I just came on the one off day but it left a bad taste in my mouth."
