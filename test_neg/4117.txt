b'Came here yesterday for brunch with my friend and was not impressed. We both did the bottomless mimosas and had to wait way too long for refills. Not fun considering you don\'t get the fair share of "bottomless." We were hungry so I ordered the Monte Cristo and she ordered a burger. It took literally an hour for it to come out. We kept asking where our food was and our waitress had to keep asking. And when it finally did, I had a hair on my plate! Disgusting. I\'m only giving two stars because our waitress was nice and felt bad about the hour long wait on our food that she didn\'t charge us for it. I\'ll stick to Hulas for brunch and mimosas from now on.'
