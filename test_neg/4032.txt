b'If the owner or management read these reviews, I am telling you that you need to review the practices in your service bay. I waited 30 minutes to check in my car after I called ahead for an appointment. I got a call to come pick up my truck and I have now been here for close to an hour to pick it up. While I was waiting, a woman pulled in that had just had her car serviced and her tire was not put back on properly... Literally it was missing lug nuts. The staff members were laughing about her situation when I think they should have been mortified. The service specialist that helped me was nice, but not nice enough to deal with 90 minutes of waiting.You have 10 employees there... Figure out a way to take care of the customers.'
