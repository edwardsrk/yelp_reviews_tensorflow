b'I was excited to hear a Via Cibo was opening close to my house as we usually go to the one in Deerfoot Meadows. We went for dinner tonight with our toddler and 4 month old baby. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and after giving us the menus, told us she would be back shortly to go over the menus. As such, I assumed she would be taking our order at the table and not at the till. We waited for 15-20 minutes before she came back. When I told her what we wanted to order, she told us that they were out of pomodoro sauce, which pretty much eliminated half the items on the menu - and all of the meals we wanted to order. We then spent another 10 minutes trying to find other food to accommodate this and the staff at the till was not helpful at all. By this time, my baby was crying and my toddler was cranky because he was very hungry. I was so frustrated that we ended up getting our meals to go. The meals we did order were fine but the staff should have let us know right off the bat that the restaurant was out of a key ingredient, instead of having us wait 15-20 minutes after we were seated to find out. This would have been more tolerable if it was just my husband and me, but given that we had 2 young kids with us, that should have been taken into consideration (especially for a restaurant that markets itself as family friendly). Also, for an Italian restaurant to be out of pomodoro sauce on a Friday night at 5pm - with no explanation as to why from the staff - is probably not a great sign for a new opening.'
