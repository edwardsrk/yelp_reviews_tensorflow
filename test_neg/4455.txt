b"Stopped by for happy hour.  Odd, because it took the better of an unhappy hour to be waited on.  Bartender,  nice guy,  kept telling me he was jammed, but the whole place was less than 1/4 full.  Finally got to order (Happy hour specials, apps and since drinks $5. I orderef 1/2 order of naked wings and a glass of the house cab). Took forever to arrive.  Wings nice and crispy,  but when they say naked,  they mean it. No salt,  no pepper, almost no flavor.  House wine wasn't something I'd order ever again.  Not that I'm coming back here."
