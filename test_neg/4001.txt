b"We got take out from here the other day and wAs not impressed at all. The chicken was so dry it was inedible. Green beans had a weird flavor and were mushy. Rice had no flavor. It was around 5:30pm, so I hate to see what the late diners were served. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my husband liked the empanadas. Won't be back."
