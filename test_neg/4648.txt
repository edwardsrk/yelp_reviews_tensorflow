b"The hot dog is average. The burger is below-average. Sorry, folks, that's the truth.I've held off on reviewing this place for awhile now. Overall I don't consider it fair to review a place after only visiting once, but I cannot bring myself to go again, and Ted's will not exactly hurt from me saying bad things about them. Also, seeing as how the food my friends had looked the same (I think I tried some of theirs but can't remember for sure) and they raved about it, I don't write this off as an anomaly and will go ahead and review Ted's.Like I said, the hot dog was extremely average. Nothing different than you would get off of a typical hot dog vendor.The burger was below average. The patty was too thin and it just wasn't that good.The workers were what I like at a place. They took my order, made my food, and nothing more. Good job. The store has a pretty cool feel to it. The line was short when I went, but apparently it can get quite long.How was the experience overall? Well, I won't go back as I would rather have a hot dog and burger from Sonic or (cue dramatic chipmunk) RALLYS. ...Exactly."
