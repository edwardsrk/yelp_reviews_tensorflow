b"I shop here 2-3 times a week. The convenience factor is terrific because there isn't anything else comparable close by.However, it has happened on many many occasions that the fresh fruits and vegetables that I have bought are rotten or just terrible quality. I only realize this when I get home and open the fruit or vegetables. It is just way too inconvenient to take the stuff back - I only bothered to do this once when the salad I had purchased was completely wilted when I opened the plastic container - it took them a solid 15 minutes to find a manager to refund me even though I had the receipt, etc.Just today I purchased some fruit, only to come home, cut open two of them, and they are both totally inedible.  There goes $15.I definitely don't recommend this place for produce. For other stuff that you can even pick up at a convenience store, it's great."
