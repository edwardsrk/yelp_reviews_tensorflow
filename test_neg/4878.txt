b"The food is just about ok and I don't really understand why the portions are so small. I've  tasted better mediterranean food in and around Charlotte. This place doesn't stand a chance in front of any other mediterranean places.For the portions their serve, I feel it is over priced. The ambience is nothing exceptional. It is a usual takeway/quick eat in kind of dining setting, which works well for regular dinners/"
