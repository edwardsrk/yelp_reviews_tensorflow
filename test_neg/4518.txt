b"Disappointed in my last two visits and Miro has always been a favorite.  I ordered seafood both times and the last time, I was told the scallops would be jumbo scallops.  It was very obvious they weren't jumbo.  The topping was simply tomato, onion and way, way too much green pepper.  This was over a very small portion of spinach which I requested instead of rice.  I could have prepared the exact same thing in my own kitchen for next to nothing and it probably would have been better. I won't return for a long time."
