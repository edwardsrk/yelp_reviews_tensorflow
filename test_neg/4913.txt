b"Too salty!!!!!   I was warned about this from a friend who had dined there, but had heard other fabulous reviews, so wanted to try it for myself.The bread board entree was good, but did not include any preserves as described in the menu (and was over-priced).I ordered the corn carbonera, a pasta dish.   None of us could eat it, it was way too salty AND too peppery.My daughter had the veggie burger...nothing special and the side salad was unbelievably SALTY.   Salty lettuce?    Just weird!My husband got the lamb burger.   I thought it was delicious, although he thought it was too pink.   But again, the fries and the dipping sauce were off the charts SALTY.   We had desserts also.   Vegan chocolate ice-cream was delicious but TINY...about two bites.   My daughter's s'more torte was ok, but even that was too salty!   My walnut ice-cream was good....but not out of the ordinary.What is all the hype about this place?    Love the philosophy of locally grown organic food etc,   But why cover up the taste of the food with all that SALT??The atmosphere dining outside is very nice, but the chairs are so uncomfortable!  And too low for the table.Overall, we were not impressed and do not plan to return."
