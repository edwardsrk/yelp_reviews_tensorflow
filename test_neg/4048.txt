b"My husband and I go to this location frequently because it's close to our office. It doesn't compare in terms of cleanliness and service to the one near our home on Gilbert Rd in Mesa. Today, we needed to order 2 dozen bagels and two containers of coffee for a work meeting. We started calling them at 5:30 this morning, which is a half hour after they opened. The phone just rang off the hook and although we tried several times, no one answered. We ended up having to place the order with the Einstein's near our home. They answered and got the order instead of this location. We doubt we will give them any future corporate business. 2 stars just for having good bagels and coffee."
