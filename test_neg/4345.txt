b"Maybe we were here on an off-day, but my party left the place scratching our heads. I had a couple drinks in me, which 100% makes me more forgiving of bad food and drink.A few of us ordered drinks, including the Crown Jewel and Downtown Pimm's. Terribly sweet because of the flavored syrup and other liquers. No finesse whatsoever. Enjoy the hangover and a film of sugar coating your mouth.We also ordered some food to share:- Crispy Deviled Eggs were an interesting texture and weren't too bad, but they weren't anything fantastic either.- Chicken Lettuce Wraps were sad. Instead of wasting your money on three little pre-filled wraps, go to an Asian restaurant specifically.- Tartare was delicious, but it was a tiny serving that was mostly unshareable.- Sea Salt Garlic Fries served with ketchup tasted very little of garlic oil. Most lackluster garlic fries I've ever eaten.- Shepherd's Pie was plain. That's all I've got.- Cheese & Cold Cut Platter was okay because it didn't require any cooking. You can't mess that up. There was a smoked cheese that was quite good.Overall, cheaper prices in comparison to the rest of Vegas. So maybe we got what we paid for?"
