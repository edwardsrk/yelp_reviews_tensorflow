b"Based on a recommendation and okay reviews, we recently gave Phoenix Palace a try.  Got there on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm.  The place was very busy and Dim Sum carts were everywhere.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were blunt and unfriendly to us and the nearby tables; not to mention they were pushy with their fellow cart colleagues.  One actually shoved her coworker's cart right out of the aisle with her cart and headed to the next table to sell her food.  As customers finished their meals and started leaving, the carts never came by our table again until we made a specific request. In addition to the poor service, the food wasn't nearly as good as other Dim Sum places in the area.  The food we received was fine, but the selection was surprisingly dismal & quite limited, and special orders took well over 20 minutes.  First time I've left a Dim Sum restaurant feeling hungry.  Won't be back and can't recommend this place."
