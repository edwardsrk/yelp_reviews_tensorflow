b"After reading many sparkling reviews and walking past the big nose for a year, I was really excited about going. As expected a table of two without reservations on a friday took about half an hour to obtain. Unfortunately they slapped us right up against the kitchen, which made it difficult to hear what my dinner friend was saying. A waitress scuttled over in due time to take our drink orders and give us menus. My drink was delivered in a somewhat timely fashion, however the woman that brought it was not our server and auctioned off the drink. When our waitress took our orders, it took a couple of times to get her to remember what we ordered, and when I asked for a glass of wine to be served with my meal, she brought it right after I ordered it, before we even got our appetizer. In fact, I had barely taken a sip of the first drink that I ordered. The mozzeralla balls that we ordered were fairly good, although three balls and five slices of tomato seem kinda skimpy for 9 bucks. (they have increased their prices) When our mains arrived, I had ordered the sexier duck leg. The duck's outer skin was so charred that I couldn't cut into it, so I just peeled it back to get to the meat, which was super dry and impressively tasteless. The sauce that they poured all over the dish was also curiously devoid of flavour. The garlic mash potatoes that came with it were lumpy, dry and watery all at once, without an inkling of garlic. I decided that maybe salt would help, and our server was so inattentive my friend had to go fetch her. I put about a teaspoon of coarse salt on my plate, and finally resorted to dipping my duck in the balsamic vinegar and oil that they had provided for our bread basket. There was a mouthful that I had to to wash down with wine due to the lack of moisture. We both had coffee, asked for the bill, which turned out to be around 87$. I put in 100$, and she took the billfold and never returned with the change, which was probably the first wise thing she did all night, as there was no way I was going to tip her more than 10%. So disappointed."
