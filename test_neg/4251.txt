b"This chipotle location needs to get it's $hi together. They may have hired new employees. Maybe. So if you know the chipotle concept, it's like an assembly line. You walk up to the first person, give your order, and she starts it. Burrito? Meat? Beans? Rice? Then to the next person. Type of salsa? Cheese? Lettuce? Then on to the cashier. It's a simple process. Right? But...what if there's a missing ingredient like lets just say, steak? Does the process stop? As the line starts growing and growing, do you just wait? Employees are just waiting. People are waiting and the line keeps growing. What do you do? The cashier starts to clean counters bc we are all waiting! The right thing to do is to try to keep the process going. Examples should be like: The cashier starts ringing people up, having the ones who are waiting for steak move to the side, tell other people who are waiting in line that there is a wait for steak, maybe it will make them change their mind to get a different meat, work on orders that are non steak related. These are great ways to move the process along and create efficiencies! The workers were like deer in front of the headlights bc there is no steak and they had no idea what else to do, but to wait and have the line grow longer and longer. The wait for steak was about 5-10 minutes. When we got there, it was about 4 customers. By the time steak was finally available and they were able to continue the assembly line, the line grew triple the size at least 12 customers. I give it two stars because the food is still good and always consistent. Seriously though, they need to figure how to create efficiencies as they are probably busy all the time due to it's location."
