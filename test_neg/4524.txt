b"We used to love coming to this restaurant, but I must say last night will be our last.   From the beginning our service was horrible - it took our waitress over 20 minutes to even come over to the table and it was downhill from there (it was  busy, but not crazy).   There were six of us, and she opened one bottle of wine, but never asked if anyone else wanted drinks.  Four others did, but didn't get them till way past appetizers (which came out at two different times).   Our salads came out about an hour after we ordered, and dinner way after that.   The chicken and veal parm dishes were very good, as was the veal jolina.  The lamb chops looked good, but were really just average. Unfortunately I had veal piccata and specifically asked about the sauce as I am gluten sensitive - she told me lemon juice, white wine and capers.  Must say I was very surprised when my veal came out smothered in a white pasty sauce and tasted the same.  I couldn't eat it, but the waitress didn't know that because she never came back to the table until well after everyone else was done eating.  She asked me if I wanted something else, but I opted out since I didn't want to make the other guests wait for an hour while I got another entree.  One would think they would not have charged me for that meal, but alas - it was on our bill (which took another 20 minutes or so).  Overall we were all disappointed and will be on a quest to look for a new BYOB.   I don't mind a long relaxing dinner with good service and good food, but this was not it.  Time to move on."
