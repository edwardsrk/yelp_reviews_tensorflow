b"I really wish that I could give 5 stars, but after my last 2 experiences here, I can't. I love the food here, the bottemless steak fries and root beer floats are awesome. I just wish that the service was as good. We walked in and the hostess was very friendly. She seated us in a booth, as we requested. It was just next to a team of softball players celebrating a girl's birhday after their game.  My husband and I were sitting in the booth for almost 20 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order, next to these loud girls.  I was already a little annoyed by this. The coaches brought in the bags of ice from the car, trying to prevent them from melting. They melted, spreading a huge puddle of water. Many people nearly slipped and fell in it, including a couple of servers, as well as myself. I complained to our sever. I am gluten free, I don't want the gluten free bun, so I ordered the teriyaki chicken with lettuce. They brought it out, but didn't bring me any utensils to use. It was 15 minutes before anyone came by us. This server wasn't even ours, but we asked for utensils. By the time they brought them, my food is cold. I also don't have anymore water. Our server finally comes by to ask us how the food is, and I had to ask for water and explain what had happened with the utensils. He apologized and brought us more water, then went back to his tables. I thought that he would send the manager over to talk to us, but nobody came. I am surprised, since they always have in the past for issues like this. The puddle still hadn't been cleaned up when we left.We had gone in a few weeks earlier, the hostess was nowhere in sight, there were 5 other parties ahead of us in line. We were all standing there for a while. Some people got really frustrated and left. When the hostess finally came up front, she wasn't smiling, and looked surprised to see so many people waiting. I heard someone up front telling her about how long they waited and that a few people left. She apologized and seated them. She finally got to us, still not smiling. It was a while before someone came to get our drink order. We always go on a Tuesday for the 50% off special. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with no bun, as I am gluten free and made sure that no onions were on the dish, they said that it didn't come with onions. The service was so slow. We were so irritated with them not keeping up with our bottomless fries and root beer floats. What was the point of even ordering them if we are not getting the refills?  They finally bring out our food, but my food has a  non-gluten-friendly bun on it, as well as onions. I hate onions, and the item I ordered didn't come with onions. The manager came out, apologized, and gave us a discount on top of the 50% off special, for the mistake and the slow service. We were in a hurry to try and make our movie. My husband paid, but he didn't realize until after that neither discount was on there. We complained again. They said that since we already paid, they couldn't adjust it. They gave us a gift card with the amount we would have had taken off. It took almost an additional 45 min to get this. By this time, we had missed our movie, which was literally across the street. Our date night was ruined."
