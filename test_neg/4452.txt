b'Ordered catering for a family event.  We had a gathering at the house after a funeral.  We ordered a few sheet pizzas, penne pasta and meatballs, garlic knots, house salad, and a mixed sandwich platter.  All items were fine except the sandwich platter.  So much so that we took the platter back to the store to discuss our dissatisfaction.The bread was VERY DRY, shredded cheese (on a sandwich?), limited meat, at first I thought no vegetables but later I was told there was a few slivers of lettuce, condiments only consisted of mayonnaise, and there was to be a variety of 5 different sandwiches but in the end we only received 3.  You can see from the photo that our guests did not find the sandwiches appetizing as the plate contains 28 sandwiches and only 11 were consumed.  Of those consumed most were left on their plates to be thrown out.The gentleman we spoke to quickly got on the defensive when we tried to express our displeasure.  He made such remarks of "Nobody has ever complained about it"  "Our bread is good"  "I eat them every day and there is nothing wrong with them".  He invalidated our complaint and instead of trying to understand why we went out of our way, on a day of family mourning to addresses this, he acted put out and offended by our desire for a refund.  This was a $60.00 platter.  You look at the photos and decide if this is what you would expect and then consider before your next dining at Zeppe\'s is this the type of customer service you want?At first we were only offered a in store credit of $20.  This was a $181 order.  In the end we received a $40 credit but why did we have to go through this in the first place?  Give us a good product and there would not have been the need to address this.'
