b'We have been here many times (about once per month from Nov-Mar) this past winter.  We returned this year with our group expecting things like last year.  The food was still good (Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, and Seafood Fried Rice), the service was good.  However as we were just finishing our meals we were \'visited\' by a roach crawling across our table.  Then of course we thought we could feel them crawling all over us.  We didn\'t of course, but did see more crawling around on the wall next to our table.  Gross and disgusting.  Pointed it out to the waitress and her comment was, "That happens."  No discount, no free meal, and no apology.  Will not return.  It\'s too bad because the food is pretty good.  No excuse for roaches crawling around the tables.'
