b"My daughter and I stopped on the way to work Monday morning. We ordered two bacon, eggs and cheese croissants, french cheesecake and a latte. When we got to the car we checked our order and our sandwiches were missing the bacon. I checked the receipt and I didn't think we paid for it. My daughter went back in to have the bacon added and pay for it if necessary. Here's where it goes south.... instead of hearing the bacon and adding it to the sandwiches the decision was made to add it to the croissants and re heat them causing the croissants to get very dark and crispy on the outside. Now what sense did that make? And why would you ever do that to those delicious croissants. Ugh... so rather than going back in we've decided to never return. The customer service was awesome until then. Oh and the cheesecake -didn't even taste like cheesecake. This was our second time here and we won't return."
