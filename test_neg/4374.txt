b'I was in the area with co-workers trying to pick a place to stop for lunch. An employee came out of Margarita\'s Grill telling us how great the food was and how they are the best lunch spot around. He was friendly and we were hungry so we went in there. The place was almost empty when we arrived but did fill up eventually. We placed our orders and the waiting game began... It took about 45 min for us to even get our food and one of my co-workers was given the wrong meal. By the time we finished eating she still didn\'t receive her meal. They eventually brought hers out wrapped up because they new we were running very late due to their slow service. We all expected her meal would be comped or discounted but no such luck. The food was "ok", I guess I had higher expectations.'
