b"This was our second time staying at South Point and I don't think I will be going back.  How is this hotel a 4 star hotel?  The rooms are big, but the beds are uncomfortable.  The bathroom is nothing spectacular and the wall behind the bathroom door was dirty all four nights we stayed.   I also wish the rooms had a mini-fridge.  We asked for extra pillows two nights in a row and they said they were out. Really?  The guy at the front desk was a complete jerk when we checked in and seemed completely indifferent to us.  I wasn't aware that the pool was closed for remodel and I called down to the front desk to find out the pool hours and the man on the phone was completely rude.  I don't know if it was the same one that checked us in.  He didn't tell me when the pool would be opening up again, which turned out to be the next day.  Thanks!  Having been there last year, I am pretty sure they didn't remodel any part of the pool area...and the water is not heated. Next time I will spend a little more money and stay in a real 4 star hotel."
