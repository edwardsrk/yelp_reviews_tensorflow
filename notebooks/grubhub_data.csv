0,3,Positive,Food was good but it came an hour early.
1,1,Negative,Meh. And driver was blasting music in his car
2,4,Positive,Best Thai food nearby!
3,4,Positive,Great food! Just not a timely delivery
4,4,Positive,The food was delicious.
5,5,Positive,Pretty good! The portion was quite big
6,5,Positive,"A kind call came right after my order was placed to double check it was okay that I had two entrees and only one rice. The food came early- delivered with a big smile and I had the sense the gentleman was genuinely kind.  Curry was hot, perfectly spiced, filled with fresh veggies, tasted wonderful and sat really well. We highly recommend this establishment."
7,4,Positive,Excellent steamed vegetables and pharmacy see lew. 
8,4,Positive,Food was great! Packaging not so much. Sauce and soup spill all over and pooled in the bag. 
9,5,Positive,Good food. Big portions.
10,3,Negative,Usually our favorites. This order the spice level was  off with one dish bring to spicy to eat and the other no spice. Just disappointed. 
11,5,Positive,Great food and service!
12,5,Positive,It's one of our favorites
13,5,Positive,Excellent food and service!
14,4,Positive,Loved the food! Would order again.
15,5,Positive,Truly my favorite Thai restaurant. We’ve had food from almost every Thai restaurant in the greater Seattle area and Bahn Thai is hands down the best every time. 
16,5,Positive,We really liked it
17,5,Positive,Delicious! New favorite Thai restaurant in Queen Anne
18,3,Negative,"Disappointment from a long time neighbor.

They made everything mild even though I noted it should be medium. There was literally no spice. So, bland. Also, don't get tofu in your Tom Yum. The chunks were huge and cooked separately. I prefer fresh tofu in smaller pieces, in soup."
19,3,Negative,Really good food but slow.
20,5,Positive,One of my favorites for many years.
21,4,Negative,A little expensive
22,5,Positive,I love their food and the staff is so kind.
23,4,Positive,"Very good, a bit spicier than expected"
24,5,Positive,"This ave was delish. The  oodles were the right level of spicy and had lots of vegetables. The egg rolls were thin and crunchy, how I like them. The place looks cute too. "
25,5,Positive,Bahn Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Seattle. Superb FRESH food expertly cooked.
26,5,Positive,Best pad Thai I've had in the US
27,5,Positive,"Bahn Thai is amazing. The food is exceptionally fresh tasting, and the flavors are bright. The menu is diverse, something for everyone. I love the family that runs it!"
28,5,Positive,"Outstanding food. Well packaged for delivery (no leaky containers, unlike some other places.) Delivery was prompt and ahead of schedule, and food still piping hot. Will order again."
29,5,Positive,Amazing!! Support small local businesses!
30,5,Positive,"Good food, lots of thoughtful choices on the menu!"
31,5,Positive,"So good. Best Tom Yum, and best panang in the city. And I love they offer proper brown rice. "
32,2,Negative,"I ordered extra spicy, but the food was not spicy at all"
33,5,Positive,Best Thai in the area! I always order it a little too spicy but keep going back :)
34,5,Positive,"I love Thai food- and I love spicy food. I literally ask EVERY Thai place I ever order from to please make my food spicy, and no one ever does. Banh Thai, upon my first order with them (just moved here), called to personally ask me how spicy I wanted it. It was fantastic all around. Thank you so much- amazing food: you have new regulars. 

Might go with a 7 next time. 😉 "
35,4,Negative,Our fav Thai place. Something the food was tasted a bit different than usual. Still good just not great this time. 
36,5,Positive,Great food! Arrived hot and earlier than scheduled
37,2,Negative,Food was late and both entrees weren’t correct. Food was ok still but disappointing. 
38,5,Positive,Great food as always!
39,4,Negative,"Tasty, but meat quality was not very good"
40,2,Negative,Food took an hour not 20-30 min. Was told it wasn't ready when I arrived but after asking several times discovered that it was sitting on the counter. Then they forgot the ice cream and I had to wait for that. 
41,5,Positive,"Great food, excellent selection"
42,5,Positive,"I’d never ordered anything from Bahn Thai and honestly have had trouble finding a good Thai place in the area, but the food was amazing!!! The food quality was fresh, the noodles were not too greasy (which can be a problem with other places) and really just had the best meal. Would definitely order again."
43,3,Neutral,"food was great, glad for the vegetarian and low carb options (caulifower rice). i wish i could have ordered extra fajita veggies- hope chipotle makes that an option or at least has a place to write in requests.  2 stars knocked off were for the driver. not very courteous, and my food was delayed twice. so i guess that's more of a grubhub driver issue. "
44,5,Positive,Great food. Fantastic guacamole!
45,3,Positive,"I have to remind myself that this is essentially fast food, so with that in mind, it's decent food.  But fast it was not.  It took 90 minutes from the time I ordered until it was delivered - from a downtown location to a downtown location.  "
46,1,Neutral,Didn’t get chicken at all. 
47,5,Positive,I love chipotle they have great vegan options
48,1,Positive,Bring fresh food!
49,5,Positive,Yummy! Love chipotle as always
50,1,Positive,The restaurant was fine. I placed my order ahead for delivery at 1pm and my food arrived at 2pm.
51,1,Negative,This order was an epic fail. Who would just order bowls of meat. They should have questioned that as an odd order. I was charged $10 for a scoop of meat. 
52,5,Negative,"Food size is much bigger in store my daughter was so disappointed by her tiny burrito- said it felt
Like being right back in the regular cafeteria 😞"
53,1,Negative,"Chips were stale, part of the order was missing, and it was more than an hour late."
54,5,Positive,Good food and well priced.
55,5,Positive,We love Chipotle
56,3,Negative,"Good food, but getting my order wrong is unacceptable."
57,2,Negative,Low quality and no recommend to others
58,1,Positive,Good when the food shows up
59,4,Positive,Food is okay. Pack is good
60,5,Positive,"I love Bonchon! Their food is flavorful and yummy. The fried chicken is nice and crispy everytime, the coleslaw is awesome, and it's fast! "
61,2,Negative,Food order was delayed about an hour and my food was cold.
62,2,Positive,I got my food without a fork for a noodle dish!
63,5,Positive,Food was good!
64,2,Positive,"So I will say the food tasted fine. But the price you pay is not worth the portion size. Especially the pork bun which may have had less than an ounce of pork each. The wings are good but again for the price not worth paying that much for so few. Even the rice was a small portion! 
Really great flavors but I won’t be ordering from bonchon again."
65,5,Positive,When we're in the mood for BonChon- they've always come through with great food
66,5,Neutral,It is consistently good
67,4,Positive,"It is always good, we order it every couple of weeks."
68,5,Positive,One of the best
69,5,Positive,"Fries, popcorn shrimp and the spicy wing (boneless and with bone) are
my favorite. Skip the house rice and bulgogi. Many other places do it better."
70,1,Neutral,Food arrived cold
71,2,Positive,"The food was great, but the driver went to the wrong address."
72,5,Positive,I like spicy chicken and rice this place is the best
73,2,Negative,I ordered all flats and they gave me the opposite of what I ordered
74,5,Positive,"It's good, we order from there regularly."
75,5,Positive,I order from here almost every week. The fried chicken has a wonderful crispy shell and tender tasty meat. Fried Rice is very good. I never get sick of Bonchon!
76,3,Negative,One of the dishes was very good and one of the dishes was so cold and bland I could not eat it
77,4,Negative,Didn't put sauce on side boneless wings
78,5,Positive,I love it. I usually go in person because they're friendly and I love the tea-and-tapioca smell in the shop.
79,5,Positive,Everything I've ordered from here has been delicious
80,1,Negative,"The pieces are crazy TINY, like 3 inches long. I would NOT order again. "
81,5,Positive,"Delicious food, good portion sizes, good value."
82,5,Positive,"Food from Bonchon was amazing and my delivery driver Talon was absolutely top notch. On time, super friendly, and professional all at the same time. Great experiece."
83,5,Positive,"Very tasty, well packaged. Would eat again for sure!"
84,5,Negative,this place f****!!!
85,2,Negative,Driver came almost an hour later than the original estimated delivery time and was taking a slower route through Queen Anne to get to U District rather than through I-5 North
86,5,Positive,Such great food.  Family favorite.
87,3,Neutral,Not a fan
88,2,Negative,"The delivery was very late (40 mins) and food was cold by then. It tasted ok, likely better if the order went as planned. I’m not sure where the order delayed - the restaurant or the driver - contacted customer service and they at least refunded small part. I’ll have to think about next time. "
89,5,Positive,Great wings and drums!
90,3,Negative,Food was cold and the wrong items.
91,3,Negative,Tasteless chicken. Not worth the money. 
92,5,Neutral,Wish there were more vegetable options/sides
93,1,Negative,"Instructions were to leave at the front door. Driver didn't do that. He called per instructions, but when I didn't answer he just left. How about a text message?"
94,4,Positive,"The food was great overall. Bonchon is pricey but really good. Note that now the wings are no longer whole, so they count as 2 pieces of chicken.

The only problem I had was that the fries were packaged in a paper bag, which made a greasy mess of the overall packaging."
95,5,Positive,The food was good.
96,5,Negative,Boneless wings were very dry and had very little of the soy garlic coating.
97,3,Negative,"My order was delayed twice. By the time it arrived, the fried chicken was no longer crispy."
98,1,Negative,"Driver delivered the food after I called the assistant.
That’s really late to be honest"
99,4,Positive,"The driver did great. As for the restaurant, the food was delicious, but the restaurant was pretty slow in preparing the order and the ETA was completely off. "
100,5,Positive,Most consistent Korean fried chicken in North Seattle.
101,1,Negative,"The driver did a great job! But the restaurant didn't -- the order was very late, and the quality was poor compared to other Bonchon locations. I pre-ordered at noon to have the food by 1, and the order was pushed a few times, finally arriving after 2. The wings were very dried out, and unevenly breaded/sauced."
102,3,Negative,The wings are over-fried. They are too dry.
103,5,Neutral,I order from here all the time. The Garlic Soy fried chicken is soooo good. Love this place.
104,5,Positive,"Not super traditional, but still good! Really spicy 🥵"
105,5,Neutral,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️‼️ love this place! 
106,2,Negative,This is the third time I received my order without the pickled radish. What gives???
107,3,Negative,Food was good but driver hung up on me during a call and didn't follow delivery instructions 
108,3,Negative,"The wings use to be the entire piece(drum,flat,tip) as shown on the pictures. Now it’s either just the drum or flat and counts as whole wing pieces. Very disappointed.  Not the best deal for the price you pay. "
109,5,Positive,Love this place! Food is 100% delicious! Not disappointed at all. lol
110,1,Negative,Very late. Cold food.
111,4,Positive,"Everything was basically perfect, but the coleslaw was a little  too sweet and had a bit of a bitter flavor to it. The chicken was amazing!!!"
112,5,Positive,The food is always very very good  and the service is prompt and very friendly. I highly recommend Bonchon
113,1,Negative,"I pre ordered prior to noon and set delivery for 3:30 pm but it didn't get delivered closer to 5pm.  Food was cold, fries were soggy.  Not the best experience."
114,1,Negative,"I placed the pick-up order at 12:01pm with an estimate of 30-40 min, and arrived at the restaurant at 12:40pm. I waited at the restaurant for another 30 min for my order. 

The receipt on my order actually shows that they didn’t start my order until I arrived for pick-up. While I was waiting there, they keep telling me that my order will be ready in a few minutes, and multiple people ordered after me have already got their food before me. "
115,5,Positive,"I have almost no sure way to tell anyone how AMAZING this restaurant is. We got the spicy chicken tacos, bulgogi house rice, and pork belly sliders. My mind is completely blown by the freshness, quality and taste of Bonchon. GET THIS NOW. GIVE THEM ALL YOUR MONEY. ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD."
116,5,Positive,Good quality and tasty
117,3,Negative,did NOT skip the utensils and napkins as requested. My main hesitation with ordering delivery/takeout is with all the extra single use package and utensils. It's annoying that you can't fulfill this request to NOT add utensils and napkins when it doesn't cost you anything.
118,3,Positive,Food was fine but they made it too soon so it was cold when I got it.
119,3,Neutral,Left out my sides. Slaw and radishes.
120,5,Positive,"Great food, expensive"
121,4,Positive,"Food was delicious. Good portions. It was cold though, but I don't think that's on the restaurant. The driver or seam less is responsible"
122,4,Neutral,The sides were missing
123,5,Positive,Always tasty! Wish there were an option to order a side of sauce.
124,5,Positive,They were very courteous. Actually called to make sure they understood my special request. I truly appreciate that.!
125,4,Negative,Side dishes were missing 
126,3,Positive,Tastes great. Good breading on chicken
127,2,Neutral,"The chicken was disappointing. The crust was soggy; seemed like they packed too much chicken in too small a box ruining the crust.

I've had better delivery from Bon Chon before, so I know it's possible. "
128,3,Negative,Chicken was little dry than usual.
129,3,Neutral,basically a Buffalo Wild Wings without the blue cheese. 
130,5,Positive,"We've ordered from here a couple times, and haven't been disappointed! We usually expect the food to come here within an hour or so, and plan ahead of time. The food has been really good whenever we order Bonchon! "
131,4,Negative,Meh. Taste wasn't bad but not great
132,4,Positive,Tasty as always
133,2,Negative,Good food wasn't as good as the first time I ordered only got 1 drumstick out of 8 pieces
134,3,Positive,For the price that I paid the portions could have been a lot more. The rice and kimchi were fine the bulgogi was 17.95 and a very small portion for that amount. 
135,5,Positive,"The food arrrived fresh, hot and crispy. It was perfectly what we wanted! Thank you!"
136,5,Positive,Very good food
137,2,Positive,Bonchon is great but the delivery and driver experience was unsatisfactory
138,2,Negative,"The boneless wings are basically nuggets, not really worth the cost"
139,5,Neutral,"Great, consistent quality"
140,4,Negative,Delicious chicken but they got the sauce wrong on the boneless wings. Very disappointed. 
141,1,Negative,"I’ve order twice from this restaurant. They always confirm your order as soon as they get the order so you can’t cancel it then, never been delivered on time. Both of time, it was delayed for an hour. So I had to wait an hour and a half to two hours to get the food. Not worth it at all. "
142,1,Positive,I found eggshells on the fried egg. 
143,1,Negative,"Arrived cold, over cooked and 90 minutes late. "
144,5,Negative,I need to see a license plate of driver’s car in the app
145,1,Positive,"Wings sucked, delivery experience was great though!"
146,3,Negative,The front counter associate was not friendly and unhelpful when I asked for extra reddish even though it was noted in the order.
147,4,Positive,It was good for those days when you just want to forget about calories and indulge in fried comfort food
148,3,Neutral,I'd order again.
149,1,Negative,Terrible. Over 1.5 hours late. Cold. 
150,5,Positive,"The food is absolutely delicious. I consistently get the fried chicken, both wings and drumsticks, as it's just so great"
151,5,Positive,Great food! I'll definitely be getting their food again
152,3,Negative,The wings are too oily and soft. Make it more crispy would be better I think.
153,3,Negative,"Food from the restaurant was fine, but the order took more than an hour longer than it should have and arrived cold"
154,1,Neutral,I like Bonchon
155,5,Neutral,I had always wanted to try BonChon but it’s hard cause I live on the east side. I was so happy it could be delivered to me. The food was packed so neatly and was bountiful and delicious. The crisp of the fried chicken is nice and the sauces were yummy too. The pickled radish is the perfect condiment. I had a combo of sweet and soy flavors
156,5,Neutral,Best potstickers on the planet!
157,3,Negative,Everything was so salty I could barely eat it :( got the boneless wings. Tenders are better for sure 
158,4,Negative,The food was great! I didn’t appreciate the driver not wanting to cone to the door to deliver the food. I am recovering from pneumonia  - that was the point of ordering delivery.
159,5,Positive,The driver was OUTSTANDING!! Best driver I’ve EVER deliver from Grubhub 
160,5,Positive,It was better than expected!
161,4,Negative,The boneless wings are pretty good. The fried rice was totally blah and tasteless.
162,2,Negative,The boneless hot wings was a little over cooked. Deep fried too long that it made it hard to split it apart and chewing was a little rubbery
163,5,Positive,"Always a good option. Solid food, and phenomenal soda bread!"
164,3,Negative,Worst corn beef and cabbage I've Ever had
165,5,Positive,"Wonderful food and service and friendly, helpful people !"
166,2,Negative,"Food as expected, but hard to be pleased when delivery was over an hour past the original estimated time frame."
167,5,Neutral,First time and will order from there again
168,4,Positive,like this entree a lot; variety is great; delivery always on time if not early
169,5,Neutral,Great food all the time love it!!!
170,5,Positive,"Our Shepherd's Pie and Beef Stew were delicious. It was great to get a taste of Ireland.
"
171,4,Positive,Great food great quality good price
172,5,Positive,This restaurant is all about quality of ingredients. I repeatedly order food here. Food I can trust
173,5,Positive,"Enjoyed the Ruben Sandwich today. It was hot and delicious. Good amount of fries  and a pickle. 

Thank you for making lunch today. 

I plan on treating a friend to lunch at Shawn O’Donnell’s next week. 👍"
174,5,Neutral,The food hit the spot
175,5,Positive,Toasted sandwich was really good. Melted just right with lots of meat packed in great for lunch or dinner. Comes with side of fries. Definingly get again.  
176,5,Negative,"This is the third time I've ordered from there so I assume it's a fluke. Also never ordered during the dinner rush. Still not going to dock a star because it was still tasty! My tenders were over cooked, darker breading, and a bit dry. (Rather chicken over cooked than under.) And they sliced my bread which convenient, caused it to dry out and be cold. I don't know if it is normally served cut, first time at home I  recieved it like so. Coupon was offered with perks, making it in my budget."
177,5,Positive,Excellent food. Very tasty
178,5,Positive,Great home style food
179,4,Positive,"Really good food, but somewhat small portions. They keep forgetting the extra clam chowder I order on the side notes! Great Bread Pudding!"
180,2,Negative,"The food was decent the missing items a bummer...not filling enough by itself
I will try again..need the rueben in my life"
181,5,Neutral,Some of the best fishnchips I've had in a very long time!  Nicely cooked big pieces of fish and lots of fries and really tasty tarter sauce. Will definitely order from them again.
182,5,Positive,I love their Reuben sandwiches!
183,5,Positive,"Shawn O’Donnell’s was the restaurant my friend and I loved going to for lunch. Great location, food, service and prices. After stay at home mandate, though, we couldn’t visit. Furthermore, living in West Seattle without a car and the bridge has made it difficult for us to meet and enjoy their food, but ordering lunch delivery for my friend, who has returned to work, is the next best thing. It’s comforting during these difficult times. Goodness, do I miss their soda bread and clam chowder! "
184,4,Positive,"Great burger, fries, and bread. However, the mac&cheese had spices in it that made it taste a bit like egg nog to me. It’s still good, but weird. I probably won’t order the mac again, but I’ll still definitely order from this restaurant again. "
185,4,Neutral,The food was great but it took Hrubhub 1 hour forty minutes to deliver my burger when the eta was 25. 
186,5,Positive,I think I’m addicted to this place. STOP MAKING THE FOOD SO GOOD! 😖😅
187,3,Negative,Food was tasty but not what I ordered. So disappointed. 
188,3,Negative,First time trying it and it was okay. My order wasn't correct.
189,5,Positive,I loved the grilled salmon dinner.....perfectly grilled salmon and broccoli.....yummy!!! The
190,1,Negative,"Food and delivery time was pretty bad honestly, nothing special. Waffle fries were really soft and soggy, burger was pretty dry. If they can fix these issues, I’d definitely reorder, but for now I’m keeping this on my “do not reorder” list."
191,5,Positive,Delicious food packaged well!  
192,4,Positive,"Just a bit of advice for the restaurant: don’t put the plastic containers of dressing inside of hot food boxes, they will melt and leak everywhere. Otherwise food was great. "
193,5,Neutral,I will be ordering again
194,5,Positive,The food was SO GOOD! Will definitely be ordering again!
195,2,Negative,I ordered a Reuben and got something like burrito filling on soggy bread. Beans and corn and sloppy southwest meat goo
196,4,Positive,I'm usually pretty happy with the food from this place but I ordered the steak salad this time and it was really rather small for a meal. It was more like a side salad. The shepherd's pie was so so.
197,3,Neutral,"I understand that there are meat shortages, but I wish I knew they were subbing beef burgers for black bean burgers before I bit in"
198,1,Negative,"Over cooked Frozen Patty ,!It amazes me anyone would give more than two stars for a frozen patty  Sad"
199,5,Positive,Pints of beer was what we were craving and didn’t disappoint. Ability to buy a bottle of tequila was a bonus. Food was as good as pre quarantine!!
200,5,Positive,The food was delicious! We will have to try this place in person once quarantine orders are lifted🙌🏽
201,4,Negative,Food presented well but too salty.
202,5,Positive,Enjoyed their food.  First time ordering from them.  Really appreciated the service and taste of the items.

205,5,Positive,Liked it. Will order again.
206,5,Positive,Food was good!  Nice to be able to get corned beef and cabbage
207,1,Neutral,Food was late and 
208,5,Positive,The Reuben sandwich was hearty with delicious sauce.  I would definitely recommend it!!!
209,4,Positive,Food was cold but nothing I couldn't warm up... great food
210,5,Positive,Excellent will certainly order again
211,2,Neutral,"Good food, incorrect order"
212,5,Neutral,The Corn beef and cabbage was fire
213,2,Negative,The restaurant was fine.  Delivery by grubhub driver was 45 min late.
214,1,Negative,"I received the most disappointing shepherds pie in existence. The portion was small, cold and came in two separate packages. This was just a hair above a Marie Calendar frozen meal... Certainly not worth the money."
215,3,Positive,Very fresh greens and good salmon but no caesar dressing.
216,4,Neutral,Food was almost cold
217,3,Positive,"Restaurant is awesome, food is great. It was just cold"
218,1,Negative,Half the stuff I ordered was not delivered.
219,4,Positive,"Food was great and still hot, very quick delivery. One problem, no condiments such as salt, pepper, ketchup etc. Overall a good experience."
220,4,Positive,Bacon was so good
221,1,Negative,"Items missing from the order. When I called driver he said call restaurant, not his fault. I called restaurant they said call grub hub... Not cool..."
222,1,Negative,"Missing items (no vinegar), no utensils, food was cold and fish was soggy."
223,5,Positive,Great place to eat!!
224,5,Positive,Their Shepher's pie is amazing!!!
225,5,Positive,"The fish and chips were great, but they left out the tartar sauce!"
226,5,Positive,"I've ordered from this place twice, and both times I was really impressed. Great flavors and delivery!"
227,5,Positive,Always love this restaurant
228,5,Positive,"Corned beef with potatoes and cabbage with horseradish sauce, it was totally amazing, loved it!"
229,2,Negative,They food was good but cold
230,5,Positive,This place has the best Shepherds Pie that I have ever tasked. 
231,5,Positive,"Because of Grubhub and the kind delivery guy and the people who made my food today, I can have dinner tonight in this stormy weather 
Food tastes warm and great "
232,5,Positive,The girl was extremely nice and I checked on her to make sure she was okay on these roads. She was very friendly and very professional. Thank you so much!
233,5,Positive,One of my new favorites
234,5,Positive,The food is fantastic.
235,5,Positive,Great food and great price.
236,4,Positive,"My family and I were visiting Seattle, and the power was out, so we needed food to come to us since the kitchen was inoperable.  None of us had tried GrubHub before, and we decided on Shawn O'Donnell's American Grill & Irish Pub for dinner. We ordered the Braised Pork, Mac & Cheese, Shepherd's Pie, Corned Beef and Cabbge, Soda Bread, Bread Pudding and the Boxty Cakes.  The food arrived  in the time indicated and the driver was very nice. The food was hot and well packaged. There was a little spillage in the bottom of the bag, but nothing major. The food was excellent, everything was delicious. As visitors to the city, we may not get the chance to try Shawn O'Donnell's again, but we definitely would if we come back. And we would definitely recommend them to anyone we know coming to the area."
237,4,Positive,I wish you could order a six pack of coke from here.   The Shepherd's Pie was pretty good.
238,3,Positive,Food was just OK. But not bad either.
239,5,Neutral,Great food for last minute delivery!
240,1,Negative,"I&rsquo;ve ordered from this restaurant before and it was very good. Unfortunately this time, on top of the order being late, the wrong item was delivered. I looked in the bag at whatever the item was, it smelled good but looked disheveled and messy and I couldn&rsquo;t tell what it had been but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t a bacon cheeseburger. I had to chase the driver down to return it to him. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is a problem with the restaurant or the driver but either way I wasn&rsquo;t happy."
241,2,Negative,"One of my items was missing.  They didn't answer the phone when I tried to get it delivered so grubhub gave me a credit.  I  would rather have my order correct than get a credit, but it's better than nothing."
242,3,Negative,Food was good but cold because it was quite late
243,5,Positive,Love the food!!! Always good
244,5,Positive,The pork shanks are amazing.
245,3,Negative,Food is excellent but delivery is messy
246,4,Negative,Ordered the corned beef and got french fries instead of mashed potatoes. I did not ask for that substitution. The corned beef was good though.
247,4,Positive,The food was amazing. The driver doesn't have very good customer service skills though.
248,5,Neutral,Some of the best corn beef and cabbage in town!!
249,5,Negative,"food was great, grub hub drivers however, frighten me, dude tried to deliver my stuff to the wrong address even after calling me and i told him where to go... unacceptable. 

the restaurant food was awesome though. nothing wrong there. "
250,5,Positive,Excellent food. Great delivery 
251,4,Positive,"Forgot my side of ranch! Oh how I love my ranch. Aside from that, however, top notch food and service."

254,5,Neutral,Food was good 
255,1,Negative,"I'm still waiting on my food. It says it was delivered, but I haven't gotten it :("

Horrible"
257,5,Neutral,Fish and chips were good
258,5,Positive,The menu looks fantastic and our orders were right on and still warm when delivered. Loved the special sauce used on the 🍔
259,5,Positive,The peppercorn bacon burger was amazing! Will definitely be ordering again. 
260,4,Positive,"Fantastic comfort food, and delicious any other time!"
261,1,Negative,"I ordered a Reuben and substituted a salad for the fries.  I got the fries anyway and the corned beef was dry, tough and flavorless.  Very disappointing, especially from a so-called Irish pub.  The fries were cold as my container was open when I received with a few fries sticking out of it.  Even the pickle was disgusting!  I will never order from here again.  "
262,5,Positive,We both really enjoyed the food.  Nice discovery.
263,2,Negative,I ordered a shepherd's pie with side salad and after two hours received a tin of ground lamb w/ veggies that had a scoop of mashed potatoes dropped in the middle... a really poor excuse for shepherd's pie from a place that should be able to do better. Also the side salad was not included.
264,5,Positive,Really good food!
265,5,Positive,"Best delivery food I have ever had. Fast, hot and delicious"
266,5,Negative,"Good food, but they forgot my complimentary soda bread, which made me sad."
267,5,Positive,"Love ordering food from Shawn ODonnell's.  Corned Beef and Pork Shanks this time.  Awesome!   Great delivery experience too, driver was very nice."
268,5,Positive,It’s a gem. I would definitely like to go there in person. 
269,2,Negative,Missed an item ordered.
270,5,Positive,My salad was fresh and delicious. I'll definitely order from this restaurant again.

275,5,Positive,Very good food
276,1,Negative,you delivered the food an hour late. it's unacceptable
277,1,Neutral,The order wasn't delivered to the correct house
278,5,Positive,I love Veggie Grill! I had the Reuben and fries.
279,2,Negative,Don't know what happened tonight- usually great- but took 2.5 hours to arrive and was cold when it did
280,5,Positive,One of our favorite
281,5,Positive,Good food w/ hints of healthy
282,4,Positive,"I really like this place.  The food is consistently good and I'd order from them every day if I could.  I wish they'd bring back the ""beef"" barley soup, though.  That's some comfort food!"
283,5,Positive,Food is just GREAT!
284,5,Positive,Only the 2nd time I've ordered from them but will do more in the future based on this experience!
285,1,Negative,"Driver dropped food off somewhere random. Never got the food, and the driver never responded when I contacted them. I got a refund, but only for the cost of the food. They kept the tip... never again."
286,5,Positive,Great food. Great service.
287,5,Positive,We love Veggie Grill!
288,5,Positive,"The food was very good, I strongly recommend the fries!"
289,5,Positive,We love 💘 Veggie Grill.
290,5,Positive,"Not the healthiest vegetarian option, but the food is pretty darn tasty."
291,4,Negative,I don't understand why the driver disregards delivery instructions!?! Apts downtown are locked and require contacting the tenant to get into the building. I order for my son and put his contact information in the instructions so that they can get into the building to deliver. The last couple drivers I had don't bother to read the instructions! It's very frustrating to have to stop work to go outside and place a phone call to my son to go to get the food from the driver. It slows me down and them. They could cut out the middle man by reading the instructions
292,5,Neutral,I could use a little more details on gluten free items.
293,5,Positive,I honestly didn’t realize it was vegetarian until I was almost done - super great quality and they really nailed the taste. 
294,5,Positive,"Excellent food 😋, well prepared"
295,5,Positive,"Delicious food, and I love how easy it is to choose gluten free options"
296,2,Neutral,Kale & Quinoa salad was missing dressing and had a non gluten free protein added - even though the order was for a gluten free kale and quinoa salad with no protein.
297,5,Negative,"Yummy food. The portion size for this salad was very small tho, which is not my usual experience from Veggie Grill. I just ordered the wrong thing tho. Obvs a salad needs to have an add on to fill you up. 😂"
298,5,Positive,"Love it, so happy to see Veggie Grill on Grubhub!"
299,5,Negative,IT's great when they don't leave the food outside or hand to someone without verifying the name. One time out food was stolen like that!
300,5,Positive,Love the food!
301,5,Positive,I love it
302,5,Positive,Absolutely love this place
303,4,Positive,Good selection of items
304,1,Negative,First driver never even showed up to the restaurant. Second driver finally made it but was so backed up with orders they didn't get to me for another 30 minutes. My food was 90 minutes from preparation time and thus stone cold and inedible. Unacceptable experience from GrubHub. Will not use the service again.
305,4,Negative,Like their food wish there was a way to order and pay for extra queso
306,5,Positive,One of the better veggie burgers Ive had in a long time. Will be going back. 
307,5,Positive,Yummiest Beyond Burgers and fries
308,5,Positive,It's really good
309,2,Negative,Poor choices provided. The menu used to be good but since Veggie Grill removed items the selections have not been desirable. We always order the tacos but the corn tortillas are always stale by the time we get our food. Bring back the food items with some flavor. This is last time we will use veggie grill as this was strike 3. Things need to change back to the quality we came to expect when we first started eating from Veggie Grill.
310,3,Negative,They changed the way the sweet potato fries are made. Usually it has no salt on them. This time it was caked in salt. I regret wasting my money.
311,4,Positive,Food was tasty. The order took a long time to be prepared. Grubhub also does not direct their drivers to the front of our building. My driver was very polite and called to figure out how to get my food to me!
312,5,Positive,Awesome food and service!
313,2,Positive,"Food is good, but the order arrived an hour past the estimate and cold."
314,5,Positive,Veggie grill is awesome!
315,4,Positive,I liked the food options. The only suggestion I have is for the restaurant to allow an area to type out customizations/requests.
316,3,Positive,Great food normally. Came to me cold.
317,1,Negative,Food was cold because of driver
318,5,Negative,"Good, but order arrived 30 min early and by the time it was to eat, the paper containers were wet soaking into other containers"
319,5,Positive,Great vegan fast casual restaurant! Consistently good!
320,4,Positive,Delicious and healthy alternative to other fast food choices currently available
321,5,Positive,Veggie Grill always makes great food!
322,4,Negative,"Additional ingredient grillin' chickin' was overburned. Grilled to black, so I ended with thrashing the whole order. Veggie Grill should learn how to grill... I want my money back, excluding very decent Grubhub service. There should be an option for a refund if the food is bad."
323,5,Positive,I love veggie grill!
324,5,Positive,Good vegan food
325,5,Positive,Delicious break from animal products
326,5,Neutral,It's a good place for vegan comfort foods
327,4,Positive,Good. Food. Wow.
328,2,Negative,Originally the delivery time was about 40 minutes. But it actually took twice that long and my food was cold. And this isn’t the first time. Just don’t promise a delivery window you can’t actually keep. If I had known my food would be cold I would not have ordered. 
329,5,Positive,Very good food when not expensive.. great that they reduced prices during these corona days
330,1,Negative,My order was missing half of the items from my kid's order
331,5,Neutral,Veggie Grill is delicious and packs their food very well. Would order there again.

333,5,Positive,Love it!!!!! Keep up the great work!
334,4,Positive,The food was wonderful but I never got the brownie I ordered.
335,2,Neutral,Food was cold and took a half hour longer than first estimated 
336,1,Negative,Never received my order
337,5,Positive,The crunchy tacos are incredible! Love the carrot cake too. Wonderful service and fantastic food! 10/10
338,4,Positive,I've eaten there several times in the past & the food was excellent!! Unfortunately not so much anymore. Still good though & I will eat there again in future ☺️
339,5,Positive,I did not think the extra avocado was worth it. There was probably only 2 slices on my burger. But all of the other food items were perfect
340,4,Positive,Love Veggie Grill!!
341,3,Negative,Usually good food. I like it. The tofu was not good this time
342,4,Positive,"Good food,  very fast today, but burger was cold."
343,3,Positive,I love this restaurant; but the food was below like warm
344,5,Positive,Great service and food!
345,2,Negative,I asked for one of my bowls to be with tofu and they gave me both with chicken. I also specifically called and asked for extra sauce which was not given either.
346,2,Negative,The restaurant was fine. The delivery was a nightmare. The driver couldn't find my office bldg and the food was cold when it finally arrived
347,1,Negative,Totally not cool how late this was and how delivery time kept being pushed back.  That is my biggest pet peeve about food delivery services. I definitely will not recommend GrubHub to my friends. 
348,5,Positive,Will try it again. Good vegetarian food!
349,1,Negative,Veggie grill is great. GrubHub's delivery service is terrible
350,4,Positive,"Thought I ordered roasted broccoli, but couldn't find it on the receipt or in my bag;  fries were cold; burger was awesome."
351,2,Negative,Disappointed that it took almost 90 minutes to arrive and was not warm even though restaurant was less than five minutes away.
352,1,Positive,The restaurant is great.
353,1,Negative,"Waste of money, was cold and didn't taste very good. The fact that the order was 2 hrs late really puts the cherry on top.How ever I will say that's probably nothing on the restaurant. "
354,2,Negative,30 minute delivery window consistently increased until over 1.5 hrs from order time. Food arrived cold after the wait. 
355,5,Positive,"Good food, hot, fast, and delicious."
356,5,Positive,I like that there is a place I can order and know it's plant based.
357,1,Negative,the order over 1 late the food come very cold and looks like it been eaten  
358,3,Negative,The food is nasty AF.  
359,1,Negative,Was it the restaurant though? It was an hour late and everything was cold!
360,4,Neutral,"Always great. My fries were really dry and cold today, but I guess it's to be expected with delivery 🤷🏿‍♀️"
361,1,Neutral,Restaurant was fine. The food sat for an hour and I had to eat it quickly
362,2,Positive,Great food love the vegan choice
363,3,Negative,"The food was ok, portions were pretty small, and we did not receive any cutlery or napkins, nor was anything marked so it was hard to tell what was what. The hot items were NOT hot, and had been placed with the salads, so yeah, not the best."
364,5,Positive,Really good food!!
365,2,Negative,Not the driver's fault. Came cold and rubbery.
366,5,Positive,One of my favorites
367,5,Neutral,my nashville hot chickin sandwich was delicious. I also really enjoyed the roasted yams. Perfect vegetarian dinner! 
368,3,Negative,"Restaurant is great, delivery was an hour after I ordered and, at order, delivery was quoted as 25 to 35 minutes."
369,2,Positive,I love veggie grill. The delivery was sub par
370,5,Positive,I like having vegan options
371,1,Negative,The delivery person was horrible
372,5,Positive,Generally very good
373,1,Negative,Why did it take an hour and 20 minutes to get my food delivered.  Idk whose fault
374,2,Positive,Restaurant is tasty. This time food arrived cold.
375,3,Positive,"The time expectation for Grubhub deliveries is usually fairly off, but this posted 20-32 minutes, but arrived over an hour after ordering. Either get rid of this function or fix it!
This order, the food was warm and normal delicious, but that’s not always that case."
376,1,Negative,The restaurant was fine it was the driver or Grubhub who took 2.5hrs to deliver. The food wasn't good only because it was cold after sitting at the restaurant for that long
377,5,Positive,Love veggie grill!
378,5,Positive,I love it! So glad it's available on GrubHub.
379,5,Positive,The food was amazing I got the delivery early which is great I was super hungry
380,2,Positive,"The food was great!  The order was over an hour late.  I have proof of when the restaurant order was prepared and ready.  The driver delivered it over an hour after that. The food was great, but my experience with delivery from this driver was NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!  He refused to get out of his car and walk to the front door, street-level house."
381,1,Negative,I ordered vegan lasagna. I received breadcrumbs and marinara sauce. Yuck 
382,5,Positive,Always really good food

391,3,Negative,Food was delicious except cold.
392,5,Positive,Driver very courteous
393,1,Negative,Restaurant was fine - a little cold.  It was delivered at 1255 although I put in a delivery time of 1215.  My lunch meeting was awkward because the food was not on time
394,1,Negative,"Food was cold.
 Veggie burger and Fries.
I live less than a mile from the Restaurant, so I’m assuming it was cold when Delivery Driver picked up."
395,2,Negative,"The restaurant replaced the “chicken” in my “BBQ Chicken Salad” with tofu. As a food service Dietitian I want them to know that’s not okay. Please do not make substitutions without alerting the customer. You do not know what allergies people have.

Also wish they’d add their desserts back to the app for ordering."

420,2,Neutral,Portion size and quality have both decreased significantly in the past year or so.
421,2,Negative,"The food was not that good. The avocado was in one big chunk and underripe. There was not enough dressing. And because I was not texted when my meal was ready, I waited to go get it, assuming it wasn't ready, leading to the lettuce being sad and limp. The only good part was the buffalo chick'n."
422,4,Positive,fake chicken is good
423,3,Positive,Foot was great.

428,2,Negative,"Food sat at the restaurant waiting for delivery for nearly an hour. Ice cold burger, ick"
429,4,Negative,The buffalo wings were missing the ranch and they are so hot its necessary and clicked the cucumber drink and they sent raspberry lime instead 
430,2,Negative,"Hi, my delivery driver was great. Veggie Grill on the other hand gave my order to the wrong driver and had to remake the meal. This caused a lot of distraction as the business meeting was planned around this order. "
431,1,Negative,My driver was awful. I would like to cancel her tip as I told her when she was rude to me. Our food was cold and mushy by the time it arrived. 
432,3,Negative,Restaurant is excellent.  Disappointed that the driver didn't bring it to my door.
433,5,Positive,Very good! Food was fresh
434,4,Positive,Nice place. The cakes were terrific.

"
438,2,Negative,"Food was mostly cold.

439,5,Positive,i love veggie grill! best vegan options
440,5,Positive,We love veggie grill!!! It’s become our go to!
441,5,Positive,"Literally the best possible experience I could have had. Faster than I expected and better than any other grub hub delivery I've ever gone through! Ordering was easier than it (used to be?) had been before,  I got a text about delivery when it was dropped off at my office right where I expected it and it was all correct AND warm! So Happy!"
442,2,Negative,The delivery was half an hour late.
443,3,Positive,I liked it but my food was cold

451,3,Neutral,"the food was a little dried out, but prompt delivery"
452,1,Negative,I haven't got my order and they offered me a 50USD coupon for my 60.32USD order. Unacceptable!
453,5,Positive,Love Veggie Grill! One of the best casual dining-style vegetarian options on the west coast!
454,4,Positive,The food wasn't really everything I thought it would be. I wasn't a fan of the flavor and the bowl seemed a lot fuller online than it was in real life.
455,3,Negative,"Neither of my salads had dressing on them, or in the bag :("
456,5,Positive,My favorite one

462,1,Positive,Restaurant is good. Except they didn't add the dressing to our salad.
463,3,Negative,"Delivery was on time and driver was great. We were really hoping the food would be delicious, but we’re disappointed.  The cauliflower bites were so greasy.  I can make better vegan Mac and cheese - this one I only took 2 bites of.  Tasted very fake.  The kale Caesar salad and cookies were very good. "
464,2,Negative,We were missing an item
465,3,Positive,It was great food! However three things I should mention the driver was friendly but late. The food was good but cold and the burger was was nicely assembled but the patty was undercooked....3 stars but will try again.

467,2,Negative,The restaurant was fine the delivery sucked
468,5,Positive,Glad for a yummy vegan option!

524,5,Positive,Best burrito I've had.
525,5,Neutral,"they put quotes around ""cheese"" and that's weird"
526,1,Negative,"I never received my order. I ordered a kids meal at 4:00. I was notified that my order would be delivered between 4:55 and 5:05. At 5:00 my order still hadn’t been delivered. I checked my e-mail and saw an e-mail from GrubHub notifying me that my order would be an hour late (ETA 6:01). I replied “above the line” as the e-mail instructed, requesting that my order be cancelled immediately as I had other appointments to get to and it was impossible for me to be there by the time my order was delivered. I received a response that my claim had been updated. A few hours later I checked my bank account and noticed that I was still charged for the order that I didn’t receive. I checked my order status online, which reflected something untrue; that my order had been delivered to me at 6:30. First of all, I left the delivery location at 5:10, so it’s not possible that my order was delivered to me. Second, it’s not possible to use the elevator to get to my office after 6pm, so again, it’s not possible that my order was delivered to me. Third, there is no receptionist in my office after 5:00 to accept deliveries, so the delivery person would’ve had to call me, which didn’t happen. Fourth, if anyone else in my office had accepted the order on my behalf, they would’ve e-mailed me, as is our protocol, and I have no e-mail notifying me that something was delivered for me. I don’t appreciate being charged for food that I didn’t receive and a tip for a delivery person who didn’t deliver anything to me."
527,3,Positive,I love the restaurant just not the delivery guy
528,1,Negative,you cancelled my order then told me I would get a $20 gift card for the mistake. I did not receive a gift card.
529,5,Positive,"Loved the meal, and the delivery guy was super patient in trying to find my exact location. I'll be using GrubHub again for sure."
530,1,Negative,Driver didn’t even attempt to deliver or get out of the car. 
531,4,Positive,"Good food, love that they are vegan"
532,5,Positive,Excellent quality and taste. Very impressed with food temperature and packaging.
533,3,Positive,"Not exactly what i was expecting or advertised but still good.  The food was advertised to be on a pretzel bun, thats why i assumed it cost more then the other burgers but it arrived on a normal bun. a notification or heads up would have been nice.  "
534,4,Positive,Good restaurant! Can't blame the guy for traffic
535,2,Negative,"Normally have better experience. Placed order early, food arrived half-hour late and cold."
536,5,Positive,Veggie Grill is the best.
537,4,Negative,Portion size for the adobo seemed small
538,1,Negative,The driver took an hour (from the time he left the restaurant) to drive .5 miles so by the time he got here my food was cold.
539,1,Positive,"She showed up with food, but it wasn't mine (my tag was on someone else's order).  So after over an hour, I got nothing.  I was told I needed to deal with it myself.  Thanks Grub Hub. "

546,2,Positive,My food was luke- warm at best because it was so late.
547,3,Positive,"Great food, and prices"

550,5,Positive,"Great service, especially on the 4th of July"
551,3,Negative,Poor quality salads
552,1,Negative,"Food was 40 minutes late, super cold, and one item was incorrect."
553,5,Positive,The good was delicious. One of the best vegan places we've been.
554,3,Negative,"Food was great when it finally arrived! The estimated delivery time continued to rise as the food was being prepared, and arrived about 30 minutes after the initial ETA (which was misleading). When the delivery driver arrived, he called to let me know he was on the 2nd floor and I said I was on my way to meet him. When I got to the 2nd floor, he had already left so I called back. He let me know he left the food with reception. Ultimately the food was great but cold, and the experience with the delivery was frustrating. "
555,1,Positive,They left off part of our order and it was late. A refund or free order is appreciated.
556,5,Positive,Everything was delicious. I will order from Veggie Grill again. Grub Hub service was great. 
557,3,Positive,Happy for vegan fast food
558,5,Neutral,Awesome!!!  It's the only place I eat out in Seattle anymore.
559,2,Positive,Love their food but don't bother with delivery.  Always arrives much later than it should and is cold by the time it finally does.
560,4,Negative,It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. A part of my order was missing 
561,3,Negative,"The small quantity of food was disappointing, and the taste was only ok."
562,3,Negative,Food was cold. Order was late. 
563,3,Negative,Veggie Grill doesn't always pay attention to comments.

571,5,Positive,I love it!  Will order again tomorrow!
572,2,Negative,food was freezing cold and soggy 
573,2,Negative,My order was missing my chicken so they should've checked it before they sent it out. I have let VG know about this experience Already. 
574,4,Negative,The delivery was good but some of the food is not what I had expected. Some clarification on lettuce buns would have been appreciated but over all it was delicious!

583,5,Positive,Good service and food 
584,3,Negative,"Half of my order arrived on time, the rest arrives in a second delivery. Part of the order was cold, but the food was OK. The driver did his best to make it OK, taking an extra trip to the restaurant and back. This is the third consecutive order Grub Hub has messed up. Not sure why I keep using this service."
585,3,Negative,The food sat at the restaurant for about half an hour before the driver even picked it up. The food was cold and most of it could not be reheated. I basically paid $30 and had to cook anyway. It was a near-total loss 
586,1,Negative,The food was never delivered
587,5,Positive,So happy they deliver; it's hard to find veggie/vegan options that are convenient

589,4,Neutral,Delicious but pricey 
590,5,Positive,My favorite fast food vegan restaurant.
591,2,Negative,"Their salads are very dry, unless ordered in-person. I always request extra dressing, otherwise the salads aren't edible. Today, less than 1tablespoon of dressing for the entire dish. It was very disappointing. I won't be ordering from them again. "
592,4,Positive,I love veggie grill!
593,1,Negative,"I love the restaurant however my delivery was incorrect and 30 minutes later, grubhub did not do a good job, not restaurant's fault"
594,5,Positive,"I'd never ordered from here before, but I definitely will again! Super tasty burger and fries, and a really great meatless patty!"
595,4,Positive,Good food. Great menu.
596,4,Negative,The dressing was bland and there wasn't enough

599,4,Positive,Tasty comfort food. 
600,5,Positive,I haven't ordered any that I don't like yet.  Everything is so fresh 
601,1,Negative,The food was cold when I got it. I got a notification it was ready to go at 11:50 and didn't get my food for an hour. So it was gross and cold. 
602,4,Positive,Really good food
603,1,Negative,"Food came ice cold, and fries were only filling up half the container. Not to mention it was 20 mins delayed."
604,5,Positive,Delicious fresh and fast

606,5,Positive,Delicious and amazing

609,2,Negative,Everything was ICE COLD!!!! Took almost 2 HOURS to get here but tasted like it was cooked 2 HOURS ago!!!! SUPER ANNOYED!!!!
610,1,Negative,"I ordered this at 2:30 and it still isn't here yet and it's 3:45. This restaurant is about a ten minute drive away, and I'm not sure why the initial estimate was 40 minutes. "
611,3,Negative,Food was cold. 
612,5,Positive,"Very courteous driver!



"
613,2,Negative,"Second time, from a different location, this restaurant delivered extremely late.  "
614,3,Negative,I asked for sauce on the side for both meals and one had sauce mixed in. The food was all soggy and not fresh. 
615,3,Positive,"Food was fine. They forgot the salad dressing, though. "
616,5,Positive,"I was a bit hesitant to order at first because of the negative reviews of delivery service. However, I took a chance. It was on time and driver was very very nice. Food was great as usual (“bacon” is surprisingly really good). Fries were lukewarm but not really a problem for me. I’d recommend. "
617,3,Negative,"Food is good and delivered in a timely fashion, but I regularly have items missing from my order. Disappointing."
618,2,Negative,Food was great.. delivery was not
619,1,Positive,Veggie grill is great!! I love the food. 
620,5,Positive,One of my favorite places to eat. All vegan is very important to me. 
621,3,Negative,"Veggie grill was great, but customer service from grubhub was rude. And our delivery person attempted to call, although I didn't get a call, and tried to cancel our order because of that reason."
622,3,Positive,"Food is kinda meh, but it's a good fix if you're a veggie and have a craving."
623,1,Negative,"This rating has nothing to do with Veggie Grill, as I've never had an issue with them at all. This experience with Grubhub, however, was awful. The delivery was 25 minutes later than the latest end of the window given, and the driver gave me another person's order. The delivery driver was really nice and professional, though. I will use Grubhub again, since this is my first bad experience, but they really dropped me ball on this one."
624,1,Negative,"You guys were great and very helpful.  The food is my one star here.  It was HORRIBLE, soggy and burnt."
625,4,Negative,"The minimum delivery went up which is annoying because now it's too high for one person, given their prices, so now I have to pick up which means I order less "
626,5,Positive,Delicious and cruelty free! Go Vegan!
627,1,Negative,Restaurant was great. Food was out for delivery for almost 45 minutes. Food was cold 
628,3,Negative,"Super tasty, but packaging doesn't keep food warm and they paid no attention to my request for no utensils and a side of bbq"
629,5,Positive,I love veggie grill its the absolute best!
630,5,Positive,In love with absolutely everything about it. I am from Rhode Island and where I live we do not have grub hub or food as good as this so I’m in heaven. 
631,3,Neutral,Vegan and vegetarian fast food. Was a vegan fix but I wouldn’t eat here if I wasn’t in a bind.
632,5,Positive,"Amazing, VG beyond burger was so good!"
633,4,Negative,"The beyond burger was awesome and insanely like beef- so much to the fact I couldn't finish and it made me feel sick. So, it did what it was supposed to do and my meat eating boyfriend liked it."
634,1,Negative,you lost me as a customer today.
635,1,Negative,"Not Veggie Grill's fault, but GrubHub let my food sit at the restaurant for over an hour and when I got it, it was cold and disgusting."
636,5,Positive,Love that it's all vegan!
637,5,Positive,Veggie Grill rocks!
638,4,Positive,Good as usual

642,5,Positive,Love all of the vegetarian options! Was very tasty.

649,2,Negative,Ordered no tomato. Came with tomato. Not happy.
650,4,Positive,I love Veggie Grill
651,5,Positive,"My order arrived 20 minutes earlier than expected... not complaining about that. Food was packaged well, so that's a plus. My sweet potato fries were a little cold, but who actually expects them to be piping hot? I would definitely order again!"
652,3,Negative,"Order was correct, so that's good. Food wasn't great, tho "
653,5,Positive,Excellent tasting Veggie Burger.
654,3,Neutral,"I like the food but the order doesn't always come right, i was charged for an additional item I requested but the item was not included when i received the delivery"

660,5,Positive,"Really enjoyed it!  Excellent food, excellent service."
661,5,Positive,Love veggie grill!
662,5,Positive,Good vegan food. 
663,1,Negative,"I watched the delivery person drive back and forth across the city, ultimately ending with them being 20 minutes late from the latest ETA. Then, they pretty much threw the good at me and ran after I opened the door, while mumbling “sorry for the delay”. Not surprisingly the food was cold, it looked like maybe they ate some of the fries when taking their joyride, and my salad was missing dressing. I’ve eaten at and ordered from veggie grill numerous times and they normally aren’t disappointing, but this delivery experience was horrible. "
664,3,Negative,"Great restaurant, but food was cold in delivery"
665,1,Negative,Food camw cold and fries were everywhere. Should probably not order from grubhub for a meal here.

667,5,Positive,I live the atmosphere very calming

682,4,Neutral,"Tasted great, but it was cold "
683,5,Positive,We love veggie grill!!!
684,5,Neutral,I really like Veggie Grill.
685,3,Negative,"Veggie Grill has messed up two of my online orders. The first one they left a veggie patty frozen, the second one they forgot to include an item I paid for and another item was charred beyond it being edible. I simply won't order from them again."

693,2,Negative,My order was missing items and arrived 20 mins later than expected.
694,2,Negative,"It's easy to get to my place but the driver decided he didn't want to park his car and had me Walk outside to meet him. I have two small children that I shouldn't leave unattended so I quickly ran down to meet him to find out he was at a building across the street. He handed me the food and immediately took off without a word. No apology, nothing"
695,4,Negative,Food was delivered late and cold. Would have been much better if delivered in a timely manor. 
696,2,Negative,The restaurant was good but the delivery driver was lost and having to go down and walk around the street to find him was not good especially when I have two young children in my home
697,5,Neutral,Will try again
698,2,Negative,Delicious but whole order never arrived

706,0,Negative,Didn't make order correctly
707,5,Neutral,Seal. Walrus lips. Goob 
708,2,Negative,The whole point of ordering delivery food is for the delivery person to actually bring it to your door.   This is the second time I've had a grubhub person ask me to meet them outside.  Unacceptable.
709,5,Positive,"Yummy, healthy, vegan food!"
710,2,Negative,"Delivery was late, food got cold"

723,5,Positive,I️ love Veggie Grill!
724,3,Negative,"I received half of my order. I ordered a salad also and didn't get it. I paid extra for the salad & it sucks that I didn't receive it. I'm not sure id want to order again just because I don't want to waste money if I'm not even getting the food I paid for, and paid to have delivered. "
725,1,Negative,"This is the second terrible delivery I've had using grubhub. Awful experience. Food came close to an hour later than the 40 minutes they told me it would take, food was soggy and gross. "

729,4,Negative,"When I placed the order it said I had to wait 1.5-2 hours, there was no ASAP option. So besides having to wait longer than we wanted everything else was great!"

738,1,Negative,My order was never delivered and the. Customer Service told me that I never received the voicemail I actually did receive and that there is no reason my order shouldn't be here. Thanks for the gaslighting.

768,5,Positive,Great food and plenty for the serving. 
769,2,Negative,Food was 35 mins late and ice cold upon arrival.  Driver wasn't very courteous. Only 2 cauliflower florets in the masala and the flatbread they sent me was just plain instead of being a garlic flatbread. Definitely not worth the $15

788,5,Positive,I love this restaurant and especially the chicken salad. Very tasty and well prepared.
789,2,Negative,"Meat was cooked correctly, but didn't give me enough sauce on the burger so it was pretty dry as big as the bun is. And I asked for no tomatoes but I still got two large tomatoes that I do not eat toast soak into my lettuce to my burger when I received it. Just horrible"
790,5,Positive,Always good experience. I also like the fact they staple the bag.
791,1,Negative,Late and cold
792,5,Negative,"Was slightly apprehensive given the reviews about late or incorrect orders, but they were from a few weeks ago. My order was perfectly as I ordered it and still warm and not soggy. "
793,3,Positive,"The food was excellent; I always enjoy food from Johnny Rockets.  This was my first time ordering delivery, it did arrive late and while the driver was polite and friendly, I would have preferred that he had come to the front lobby door of my apartment complex rather than parking across the street and having me go outside to him.  However, I suppose that is a mild inconvenience in the greater scheme of things.
"
794,1,Negative,"Instead of following basic instructions, my food was slopped on with sauce that rendered the fries soggy, everything arrived cold, AND my Bacon Fries were entirely without bacon."
795,3,Negative,Was not happy with the quality of mine meal. The order was late I had to call the restaurant three times to see if the order was picked up my sandwich was called and it did not have cheese on it
796,1,Negative,Delivery was over an hour late
797,3,Negative,"Burger was good, but everything else arrived cold and soggy. A few things were missing from my order"
798,5,Positive,Well packed and instructions followed!
799,3,Positive,restaurant was good! good food
800,5,Positive,It's delicious and good
801,5,Positive,Really good! We love ordering from here!
802,5,Positive,AMAZING AND YUMMY
803,3,Positive,"Good food, long wait"
804,5,Positive,"Food is good, very satisfied"
805,5,Positive,It was great
806,5,Positive,I love the food :)
807,5,Positive,I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!! FOOD IS DELICIOUS
808,3,Negative,food was not warm so a little upsetting 
809,3,Positive,Taste great. Definitely worth a try! Not sure If would go again? Definitely not with Grubhub. $6 for one rice dog? Lol.
810,5,Positive,"Love me some rice hot dogs, these are seriously the freshest and tastiest in the entire world. Always fast and friendly service. "
811,1,Negative,"Driver was right outside of driveway but insisted that he could not find the house, I gave instructions on location, I have also had other drivers find the house in the dark with no problem at all, I would like a refund. "
812,5,Positive,Delicious food! One of my favorite places.
813,4,Positive,"Not quite as described--no kale, no ""power greens"", just lettuce. But the chicken and the dressing were tasty and they didn't skimp on the cheese. 4 stars."
814,1,Neutral,"The lettuce was spoiled. Turning orange and wilted. I had not one but TWO of the dead/bad cut off ends of a stalk of romaine.  The salmon was hard as a brick. 

This appears like it’s a salad place called Molly’s Garden but it’s out of Shawn O’Donnels bar. That’s what the stickers on the salad bowl are from. "
815,5,Positive,"I love Molly’s Garden! My go to place if I want a fresh salad. Delicious every time and very well cooked/seasoned salmon. My favorite is the Salmon Caesar Salad, it’s huge! Or the wrap is really good too if you want something on the lighter side. "
816,3,Positive,The lettuce was rotten.  The steak was good though. 
817,5,Positive,The salad was delicious! Way better than I had anticipated. I would definitely recommend!
818,5,Positive,"Food was really good, salad was fresh and meat had a good sear"
819,5,Positive,"My first time ordering from Molly's Garden was enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis.  The food was phenomenal, and the delivery was spot on.  I will definitely be coming in in person, when we're fully opened again!"
820,1,Negative,Only bought a wrap and it took two hours lol 
821,5,Positive,The food was delicious!! Salad was crisp and steak was cooked perfectly 
822,5,Positive,So fresh! Very nice.
823,2,Negative,Maybe instead of replacing an out of stock item you actually call the customer and ask what they want. 
824,1,Negative,"I'm not sure if it was due to the restaurant being late or driver error but I got a call over 30 minutes past the requested delivery time, telling me that the driver could not find parking. They said they'd wait another 5 minutes but my co-worker didn't know where they were and the driver left without delivering the food. I've ordered from Grubhub many times and had no issue. A Grubhub driver in a city like Seattle should be used to finding street parking but this person just gave up and left. I even gave instructions for a loading zone they could park in and they didn't use it. I will be seeking a refund for this order since food was late, then not delivered at all. Paying about $25 for one steak salad that we didn't even receive is unacceptable."
825,4,Positive,"I really like some of the dishes, and some I haven't liked so much. I've enjoyed trying different choices from your menu."
826,5,Neutral,Love their food.
827,5,Positive,One of our favorite ones.
828,5,Positive,It is really a good place to eat but now because of Covid19 I just really depend on contactless delivery.Thank you
829,3,Negative,Ordered the egg foo young. Asked for vegetable only. What I got was loaded with chicken and shrimp both. Good thing I am not alergic to seafood. 
830,4,Positive,Asked for fruit punch drink but got Gatorade
831,1,Negative,"The driver was great, but the sandwich order was missing several items and added others that I did not request. Unfortunately I was not able to eat the meal based on dietary restrictions that were not honored. "
832,5,Neutral,Fresh salad. Would have preferred the plastic ware had been wrapped.
833,1,Neutral,Over an hour to get my 
834,1,Negative,Order took 2 hours to arrive. Food was cold. 
835,1,Negative,Your customer service and driver sucked
836,1,Negative,My sandwich was dripping with water and soggy
837,3,Negative,So mixed review. Delicious potatoes and chicken. But they gave me my main dish wrong. No cookies and the biscuits were rock hard! Not the usual case. But I was disappointed.
838,1,Negative,Same issues over and over with order being wrong and not getting what I paid for! 
839,5,Positive,Speedy delivery! A surprisingly good meatball sub. 
840,5,Negative,They gave me the wrong chips. 
841,5,Positive,Subway has always been my 1st choice for sub sandwiches
842,5,Positive,Never preferred a delivery from Subway before. It was fabulous! Fast delivery and super fresh. Great!
843,1,Negative,"I had utilized a promo code that should have given me a $12 discount. This promo code did not show up on the Checkout screen. I opened a chat with the Customer Service to understand how it works and was told that it would still apply, but they would have to manually refund me the value of $12. I said okay and ordered. It's been over 24hrs and I still have not received my refund."
844,1,Negative,"Paid for a bottled soda and never received.  Ask the driver and he states they (Subway) never gave him one.  Called Subway and they blamed the driver, so paid for food that I never received!  Will never order again!"
845,5,Positive,"Food very good, and delivery person very polite!"
846,1,Negative,Never again.... horrible 
847,2,Negative,MISSING EXTRA MEAT
848,1,Negative,"Never got h order. They stole my money, and I have yet t be refnded"
849,4,Positive,"Good food, good price"
850,5,Negative,They gave me the wrong chips. 
851,5,Positive,Subway has always been my 1st choice for sub sandwiches
852,5,Positive,Never preferred a delivery from Subway before. It was fabulous! Fast delivery and super fresh. Great!
853,1,Negative,"I had utilized a promo code that should have given me a $12 discount. This promo code did not show up on the Checkout screen.

855,5,Positive,"Food very good, and delivery person very polite!"
856,1,Negative,Never again.... horrible 
857,2,Negative,MISSING EXTRA MEAT
858,1,Negative,"Never got h order. They stole my money, and I have yet t be refnded"
859,4,Positive,"Good food, good price"
860,5,Positive,It was fine
861,1,Negative,"Both footlongs were made completely wrong. The one sub we wanted toasted was burnt and half of it couldn't be eaten it was so hard. The other was thrown together like they made it in a rush, super messy, some sauce I didn't request. Very disappointed."
862,1,Negative,I wish I had read these recent reviews before ordering. Both sandwich orders were way wrong. How do you make a sandwich with just turkey n lettuce and not wonder if you’re missing some ingredients?? 
863,2,Negative,Forgot parts of my order Left off extras that I had ordered more dressing than salad
864,2,Negative,Didn't get my full order
865,2,Negative,I like Subways
866,1,Negative,"I bought 4, 12 inch subs, none of the subs were correct. I requested items like cheese, lettuce and jalapeños, the basics. None of the subs had any of the items I requested including cheese and lettuce. Subs without cheese and lettuce was not what I wanted! They made my subs the way they wanted to. I won't be ordering from them again! Buyers beware! "
867,2,Negative,Wrong sauce and not enough toppings
868,3,Positive,Was fine. Sandwich was soaked in condiments
869,1,Negative,Ordered two Spicy Italian sandwiches. Got the toppings and bread right - but missing the meat entirely on both sandwiches. Delivery was 20-30 minutes later than estimated.
870,2,Negative,Sandwich was supposed to be toasted. It wasn't. It was mushy and not very good.
871,5,Positive,Very good. .will order again
872,5,Positive,Same great fresh food I get in-store; delivered fast.
873,1,Negative,"My total order was wrong. Wrong roll, missing tomatoes, cheese, vinegar, had green peppers and cumbers that  didn’t order. Also missed black olives and extra cheese and pickles.   NEVER AGAIN from this store.  Wrong cookie too!  "
874,1,Negative,"Food took over 2 hours to arrive, and they forgot the dressing on my salad."
875,1,Negative,They shorted me a sandwich and the other had completely wrong veggies. No response when attempted to contact the store. Hoping management corrects this behavior.
876,1,Neutral,I ordered 2 sandwiches and only received one
877,2,Negative,1 Sanwiche was not toasted and missing several items 2nd sandwich also missing several items including the double meat and cheeses. really poor. 
878,1,Negative,"Food took 2 hours, the order was wrong, food didn't taste like it should."
879,3,Negative,One layer of turkey and the cheese was wrong. I understand that there is traffic and a lot of delays but I only live a mile and a half away not sure why my food took over an hour and 15 to arrive. Dont think I'll be ordering from this location again.
880,1,Negative,The food wasn't made to order missing items also the ubiquitous wasn't cooked and I got sick from it
881,5,Negative,Just an average subway
882,1,Negative,"We put specific instructions to meet outside of the convention center and call with a number in the instructions, but the guy drove around and parked up in some alley where nobody could find him then hit delivered and drove off. Charged us almost 300 dollars for nothing. "
883,3,Negative,The driver should not cuss out my co workers and refuse to leave my order with them even when I grant them authority to receive my order since I am on the floor.  Which is exactly why I state to leave the order with them in the delivery notes.
884,5,Positive,Always good. Food came correct and the cookies were still warm!
885,5,Positive,"thank  you , will consider ordering again soon"
886,5,Positive,"My food was correct and my driver was great. He apologize for being late, but he wasn't. A+ rating on all fronts"
887,2,Negative,"I had watched my order go almost five miles out of the way before it came to me. When I got here, there were substitutions I was not asked about. This is not professional service. Regardless of what you feel your social cast and obligation to the world as far as your job is and doing it right does not make concerns on my side. I expect what I order. I expect it on time, and if there are issues with it, I expect to be contacted."
888,5,Positive,"This was my first visit to Pike's Market, I saw the restaurant online and couldn't wait to order. It was so delicious."
889,1,Negative,Driver refused to follow the instructions provided. Absolutely would give him 0 stars if that was an option. 
890,5,Positive,One of our favorites
891,4,Negative,"This is third or fourth time my order has been adjusted through a “no-reply” email. Every time I order honey-wheat bread loaf. If it’s unavailable, the menu needs to reflect that. Also- “no-reply” emails are shoddy customer service! I even called Piroshky main office and got absolutely nowhere. No explanation, no nothing. I love this place but really, get it together!"
892,1,Negative,"When I arrived at restaurant to pick my order.
They said its not there probably someone else had picked it up and they dont know what to do.
This is annoying specially because this was my lunch for a hike that i was headed to. Had to hike without lunch :/"
893,4,Positive,Everything is great.  The store clerks could've been friendlier.  Possibly the addition of pick-up signage or directions would be helpful.  I waited in the line to pick up my order when it appears that's not necessary.
894,3,Negative,"The beef and cheese was lacking a bit in moisture. There was a bit too much marzipan, as the chemically taste of the almond extract was overwhelming. "
895,5,Positive,"I had the potatoe & mushroom piroshky which was still warm on delivery. Perfect combo of shredded potatoes, mushrooms and spices. Ordered the beef/onion & cardamom for later."
896,5,Negative,Love Piroshky Piroshky. Food is amazeballs. Been craving them and did not know they had delivery. OMG so much yes yes yes. Been missing this.
897,3,Positive,"The food was good as usual, and the order was correct this time, but it was half an hour late, which for a bakery (the food is already made), plus a < 1 mile during no traffic, is disappointing. Then the food finally arrived but I wasn't actually notified. So, Piroshky = great; GrubHub = meh."
898,3,Positive,Delivered 2 hours late but delicious
899,5,Positive,"Loved the staff, and food is delicious!"
900,5,Negative,"Food not very good, will not order again. Too greasy"
901,5,Positive,"Holy maholey, these folks know what they’re doing!! Everything was super fresh and delicious. Get the dinner rolls (wish I got more than 4). Spinach, cheese and egg was a lovely breakfast. My roommate inhaled the chicken curry and raved about it! Delivery to Northgate was quick and driver was prompt and friendly. So glad they’ve joined GrubHub - will gladly order again (and again)!! "
902,4,Neutral,"Good fish and chips, deducting one star for lateness"
903,5,Positive,I love Ivar's and my family has patronized this establishment for decades. The food is always fresh and taste delicious.
904,5,Positive,My favorite seafood
905,1,Negative,"Arrived at end of the scheduled pick up time since I had not received a notification it was ready and they had not even stated the order and after informing them I was there,  they continued to ignore my order and completed at least 20 customers after me."
906,5,Positive,"Always fresh, always good.   Ivar's is one of the reasons why I like living in Seattle."
907,2,Negative,You guys were over an hour late. The normally great Ivars seafood was cold. Ridiculous.
908,2,Negative,The driver was very rude and dismissive.
909,4,Neutral,Same as usual
910,2,Negative,"The food was great but the delivery was horrible. I watched the driver on my phone take so many wrong turns, stopped in random places, and go wrong directions. I even texted him to see if he needed any help but he didn't text me back. I actually tried to cancel the order because I got so frustrated. He finally arrived 30min passed the expected delivery time which he could have easily achieved if he just went the right direction or excepted some help."
911,1,Negative,"Food had no seasoning, bland, cold, and late"
912,4,Neutral,"The food was great. However, the delivery guy refused to follow the delivery instructions that 99.9% of the other guys follow perfectly."
913,5,Positive,Outstanding.   Everything was perfect and piping hot.
914,2,Negative,I have to say we Love Ivar’s. Unfortunately we had them deliver to the hotel. And the bottom of the bag was wet. And my order was not Cajun but I paid for Cajun. Since we are in the middle of a pandemic and a lot of restaurants have takeout or delivery. But they are lacking in presentation. Food was smashed we had fish crumbles and stuck together fries. Ivars food is good. But awesome when it looks good. 
915,3,Negative,Love ur food but last night was mediocre at best
916,1,Neutral,Portions were very small and the food was cold when it arrived
917,5,Positive,Love Ivar's. Local institution.
918,2,Negative,"Ivars is usually very reliable,  It was very disappointing to only get part of my order"
919,5,Positive,great vegan hash!
920,5,Positive,Lost Lake is a great place to order from
921,2,Negative,The food was fine but they took so long to get my order ready. My driver was waiting at the restaurant for over an hour. I ordered biscuits & gravy and there was barely any gravy on them. Disappointing.
922,2,Negative,"the chicken fried steak was burnt, leathery, and not tender at all. even the toast was burnt. I couldn't eat it. Wasted the gravy on the inedible ""steak""..   the eggs, and notably small portion of potatoes, were fine.  Not ordering again. "
923,5,Positive,"Okay some of this is nostalgia, I used to go to Lost Lake late nights with some friends in the Before Times, but honestly, their food is solidly good comfort food. They were kind enough to accommodate my special order, and it turned out delightfully. 
They have a wide variety of things to order (even for vegetarians like myself), so I can do this again in other moods and get quite a different experience. "
924,5,Positive,A favorite. Good good.
925,4,Negative,Food was overcooked
926,5,Positive,They respected all the requests and the food was great
927,5,Positive,Lost Lake makes amazing food!
928,2,Negative,"Will not order again. No salt or pepper packets, no silverware and food was cold"
929,1,Negative,"Incredibly disappointing experience. Long time fan of Lost Lake pre quarantine, and was really excited for them to be on GrubHub. Ordered the chicken fried steak (which is usually FANTASTIC), but what was received was a hot mess. The chicken fried steak was so overcooked/burnt that the plastic cutlery that came with the order snapped when trying to cut it. The hash browns were still crunchy and raw. No gravy to make it remotely edible. Lastly, multiple side dipping sauces were ordered, but never delivered. All in all, waste of time and money. Bummer that such a classic joint massively under delivered."
930,5,Positive,Excellent Service. Tasty 🥞!
931,3,Positive,Eh was alright
932,4,Negative,"Love their sausages. However, French toast was lackluster in flavor and doesn't travel well.
"
933,2,Positive,"Mixed feelings. Fries? Great! Tots? Passable. Breakfast? Ok. Overpriced but, so are lots of things in Seattle (an Ex New Yorker) . So middle of the road.. until you get to the burger and the Ruben. Great burger. Contender in a very serious burger town.  The Reuben? OM*G. A disgrace to the concept. Bread was meh, the pastrami was like pulling shoelaces out with your teeth it was so full of connective tissue. This is not the Reuben you're looking for. "
934,4,Neutral,Food was cold
935,2,Negative,"The food arrived soggy and cold, could be solved with better, non-porous containers"
936,4,Neutral,lots of tots
937,3,Positive,We ordered a veggie burger and got a regular burger instead.
938,1,Negative,The chicken strips were so over cooked that they were I could not eat them.
939,4,Negative,"Decent food, but today was the second time they got my order wrong."
940,2,Negative,Driver was great - the food was meh. Hash browns were undercooked - some were raw - and not even browned. The English muffin for the breakfast sandwich saw a toaster for about thirty seconds and was flabby. The cheddar was simply shredded and thrown on top of the eggs to melt - which it didn't. I wound up having to recook things myself to make it edible.
941,1,Negative,Food was really bad
942,1,Positive,"Normally it’s all good and fine. But when putting together my order (for chicken fried steak) someone forgot to include the gravy which is half of the meal. If I could have contact someone about it and had received it in a timely fashion, I could be more forgiving."
943,4,Negative,Everything was great and as expected - lost lake is the BEST - except this is the second time having used grubhub to order a drink and it was missed/forgotten by the driver :( 
944,5,Positive,Love eating Lost Lake
945,5,Positive,It was really good!
946,3,Positive,"Food was tasty and good quality.  However, I had payed an extra $4 for Vegan Cheese and there was no cheese."
947,5,Positive,Very good food!
948,3,Positive,Lost Lake is great and the food is always good. I’ve been impressed with how they’ve pivoted to adding delivery since the pandemic started.
949,2,Negative,"there were hairs in my sandwich, completely unacceptable"
950,5,Positive,Love Lost Lake!
951,1,Negative,"My food was delivered wayyyyy later than what was suggested initially. My entire food order was literally cold when I got it. 

I never get cold food with UberEats and DoorDash. I wish I could have cancelled my order if I knew it would take over an hour to deliver. 

I want a refund."
952,4,Negative,Good food. First time ordering from here that the hash browns were barely warm upon delivery though. Usually they are still very warm.
953,1,Negative,"An hour after ordering, GrubHub still said ""in the works"". I'd been standing in the rain for 30 minutes, so I asked about the order for a second time. The kitchen said they'd already made it, but it was nowhere in the restaurant. Then, immediately after they said that,  the order status suddenly changed from ""in the works"" to ""picked up"". It was never ""ready for pickup"" at any point. And I know that no one picked it up because I was standing one foot from the GrubHub pickup table during that order status change. I wasn't going to wait in the rain while they tried again so I left without any food.

Lost Lake's kitchen has always been slow and unreliable, which is tolerable under normal circumstances. But in a pandemic, when you're going to be waiting outside in the rain, Lost Lake is a terrible choice. I learned my lesson."
954,1,Negative,"Food was good. Delivery was creepy AF. Got the below message from some rando that my driver gave my food to. WTF?! Then I find him waiting with my food outside my apt. Not cool.


Hi this is jason from uber eats your package was intercepted by another person because your drive from (grub hub) does speak english well... i have your package(food) if you text me your address i can meet you outside
"
955,2,Negative,They should pay more attention to the order and make sure any additional sides which they charge are actually there. And some of the food is incorrect.
956,5,Positive,"Awesome place, awesome food"
957,2,Negative,Undercooked and under-prepared
958,1,Negative,Terrible food. I ordered French dip. Meat was dried out and chewy. Virtually no cheese or sauce. Au ju way too salty and nearly inedible. I was starving so ate some of it. Will never order this again. 
959,5,Positive,"Solid restaurant, usually quality food, yummy."
960,4,Negative,Watch mixing hot and cold.  Plastic top of something melted off and some sauce spilled all over.  Melted plastic containers and melted butter do not inspire confidence of safe food.  
961,5,Positive,Amazing and perfect
962,2,Negative,Food was underwhelming.
963,2,Neutral,They forgot to include my other orders
964,5,Positive,I love them
965,4,Negative,Didn't receive my side order of bacon
966,5,Negative,"Order was complete, followed order notes, and no spills!"
967,5,Positive,"a bit salty, but that’s drunk food for you"
968,3,Negative,"Lost Lake has one of the best menus in Seattle! Make sure you have some room in your stomach, or another person, to help you chow down because the portions are HUGE! 😆 I just wish the delivery driver had followed my very-specific no-contact instructions that I had written. 😒 Not only that, but he called TWICE, and I very clearly explained to him exactly what he needed to do, but he still didn’t get it. Not the delivery experience I had expected."
969,5,Negative,There were missing some of the sides we requested
970,3,Negative,The delivery was fine but the food was inedible
971,2,Positive,I felt like picking up the food was a nuance
972,3,Negative,Really hard to eat French toast when there is no syrup to pour over it
973,5,Neutral,The food was already ready to be picked 5 minutes prior the time.
974,3,Negative,"driver took an extra long by route between restaurant and my place, delivered food while talking on the phone, shoved food aye and walked off."
975,5,Positive,French toast flavorable & it was nicely arranged so it looked appetizing. Eggs were good with the cheese added.
976,1,Negative,The food was horrible. Over cooked to a crisp!
977,3,Negative,"I was notified my food would be here late twice. 
The driver took detours and the food arrived cold enough that the package was soft and soggy, and there was condensation on the eggs and hash browns.
The gravy was so cold it had to be reheated. Biscuit cold and hard as a rock.

It was not Lost Lakes fault, they're food always arrives fresh and still warm at least.

This driver has been good in the past, I just don't know where he went today before. Hate to leave a review like this but I was just completely disappointed with brunch today. "
978,5,Positive,"Kick my hangovers butt, thank you!"
979,4,Positive,The mashed potatoes are LIFE
980,4,Neutral,There were 2 pieces of bacon on the blt. Could have used more honestly
981,2,Positive,The restaurant is great. Your driver? Not so much.
982,4,Negative,"Only complaint was food arrived lukewarm, which isn't good when you're ordering fresh toast and eggs. They didn't have sausage patty and substituted side of ham too thin and sparse."
983,4,Negative,It was good food! I think late delivery made the food a little soggy.
984,5,Positive,The food was so good that we called them to thank them!
985,3,Negative,Not worth the cost.
986,2,Neutral,Lost Lake was fine but the delivery people are just failures
987,3,Negative,"Food was alright, little underwhelming "
988,5,Positive,Fast and prompt 
989,5,Positive,I'm so glad Lost Lake is still open!
990,3,Negative,Sandwiches had way less ingredients than last time. Completely ignored my special requests
991,5,Positive,"French toast was flavorful and delicious, as was the sausage patty. A great Easter breakfast. Ordered a Cobb Salad for dinner and visually appears exactly as ordered (dressing on side as requested)."
992,5,Positive,Local fave of ours
993,3,Negative,The food is better in the restaurant.   Overdone dry burgers and cold fries.   Not that way in person.
994,4,Positive,"Great menu, good food, will do again for sure!"
995,5,Positive,Always great food and great service!
996,5,Positive,"One of the best 'greasy spoon' experiences in Seattle, hands down! "
997,4,Positive,Good food.  Needed more gravy.
998,2,Positive,"Mushroom Hunter omelette was supposed to be vegetarian but arrived full of bacon pieces.

Cheese curds and mac & cheese were accurate and a hit, though."
999,5,Positive,I usually order two things on menu...the grits taste wonderful but can be lumpy at times. Biscuits and gravy are delicious and the bacon is crispy
1000,4,Negative,"They only forgot the bacon last time, but it never stops me from ordering again"
1001,5,Positive,"Great food, seasoned perfectly"
1002,2,Negative,Do not post photos of your menu items if youre not even going to try and match it. I ordered biscuits and gravy with egg and sausage. Recieved a biscuit sandwich with an overcooked inedible egg and a small side of gravy. The gravy was okay but lacking in sausage so im glad i added sausage. Will not be odering from here ever again. 
1003,4,Positive,Restaurant is great. They just forgot the grits this time
1004,5,Positive,Delicious food made from high quality ingredients.
1005,5,Positive,Delicious food! Driver was great
1006,5,Positive,"Excellent concept, love the quality of ingredients!"
1007,4,Neutral,"The regular biscuits and sandwiches were good, but the gluten free biscuits appeared to be undercooked."
1008,2,Negative,"I should have loved it, but the metallic aftertaste of the baiscuits was horrid. "
1009,4,Positive,"The best! Am a return customer, but can no longer use grub hub as delivery method."
1010,1,Negative,Wrong food came
1011,1,Negative,the food was disgusting and not cooked well plus was cold
1012,2,Negative,"I’m not picky and I eat almost anything but the food was not good at all. The biscuits were not even close to being a biscuit; they were hard and had the consistency of plain bread. Also, the chicken was dry and flavorless and kinda chewy. The kale slaw was just gross and nothing close to a “Southern slaw”. Really disappointed and couldn’t even eat most of it; I really hate throwing food away. "
1013,2,Negative,Did not care for the food at all
1014,1,Negative,I didn’t like it ! 
1015,5,Positive,"Wonderful food. Seriously, the best hangover cure I've had in a long time."
1016,3,Negative,The biscuits were good but the gravy was thin and tasted horrible  
1017,5,Positive,Gimme all the biscuits!!!!
1018,5,Positive,Best gluten-free biscuits I've found! Yum!
1019,5,Positive,I just love biscuits. And am happy to order from/support what businesses I can during these times
1020,5,Positive,It was delicious
1021,5,Positive,Seriously one of the best biscuits I’ve ever had!
1022,5,Positive,It’s a favorite of mine.
1023,5,Positive,Very good! The biscuits were fresh and delicious 
1024,5,Positive,"Delicious food, prompt delivery, great brunch option while working from home!"
1025,5,Positive,We were stuck at home and this was an absolutely perfect breakfast to order in.  Would get it again any day!
1026,5,Positive,The sandwiches were fresh and still very warm. Excellent. 
1027,2,Negative,This food sucks 
1028,5,Neutral,They have the best gravy!
1029,3,Positive,"Order was missing multiple items. Recommending others not to get the grits or the lentil gravy and biscuits. The biscuit itself was good though. Giving it 3 stars, because the driver was nice and grubhub refunded me back part of my meal."
1030,1,Negative,The restaurant was fine. Grub hub not so much terrible service
1031,4,Positive,Love their food and the biscuits are huge!
1032,3,Negative,Food is good soda was bad and excessively expensive
1033,2,Negative,I get the same thing every time and this time my jelly came pre spread on only one half and put ontop of egg and bacon. no extra jelly for my other half. I have never gotten it this way. I am glad they didn't try to butter it before the jelly because I can't have dairy. 
1034,3,Positive,"So, this is the third time the restaurant has given me incorrect order. I asked for 1 biscuit/gravy and a biscuit/chocolate, but got 2 biscuit/gravy. 

I love your food so much, but I need to receive what I order. "
1035,3,Positive,The restaurant was great! Excellent breakfast sandwiches! They just forgot to add my extra egg
1036,1,Negative,The southern gravy is bland the orange juice is way too small for the price. Thanks for trying though.
1037,1,Negative,The order was original promised for delivery around 10:30 and then changed to more than an hour later. The biscuits were spilled in the boxes and the food was cold and inedible. We threw it all in the trash and would like to be refunded. 
1038,2,Positive,"For biscuits being their thing, the biscuits were dry and flavorless.  The pimento cheese sandwich was very light on the pimento cheese. "
1039,4,Positive,"You forgot the egg, but otherwise good"
1040,5,Positive,Delicious and always consistent
1041,4,Positive,It was good.  Didn't knock my socks off
1042,3,Positive,Delicious. Large portions
1043,2,Negative,"Food was great, delivery guy was not. He said he couldn’t find my name in the call box, which is not true, as a friend just used it this morning. Instead of calling me, he left my food on the ground outside... leaves and then decides to call me. Who does that? "
1044,5,Positive,My new favorite !!
1045,5,Positive,Such delicious Gluten free biscuits!
1046,3,Negative,"My only complaint is that the divers keep making me come down stairs. They call me on my cell instead of paging the box. This has happened all times except 1. Honestly, if I wanted to get dressed and put on shoes I would have walked down the street. 

I will admit our door is not “obvious”, but it isn’t hard to find."
1047,5,Positive,The best part of today’s delivery... the driver actually came up to my apartment instead of requesting me put shoes on and come down stairs... for the first time! 
1048,5,Positive,"Tasty food, very happy with order"
1049,5,Positive,Love their food! Especially the pimento cheese.
1050,5,Positive,"My driver was amazing. I accidentally put in my work address instead of home. I live 10 minutes from work, so when he dropped off other orders he brought mine to my house. It was super nice rather than making me cancel/reorder! "
1051,5,Positive,"Excellent, super tasty"
1052,1,Negative,"Burnt Biscuit , gravy wasnt that good either"
1053,3,Negative,Biscuit was cold and hard
1054,1,Negative,"Asked for butter and jam, for my biscuit. Was giving one tiny jam packet for very large biscuit. Grits, were the driest grits I've ever had in my life. I know this isn't the south but they were bad. Parts were even burnt.  "
1055,4,Negative,"Everything was great! I added some special instructions for delivery (just a different door) but they weren’t followed. That was kind of a bummer, but everything else was just fine. "
1056,1,Negative,My food was ice cold and bland 
1057,5,Positive,Excellent love the homemade biscuits
1058,5,Positive,"Fine eats at a reasonable cost, just like my grandma used to make. Maybe better (may she RIP and not hear this!). "
1059,1,Negative,"My order was missing the extra order of gravy I  paid for. The instructions were ignored and they forgot to put a fork, knife or spoon in my bag. Pretty much perfect on opposite day."
1060,5,Positive,Delicious comfort food on a Sunday lunch. Next time will try the sweet potato biscuit:)
1061,1,Negative,I ordered egg on my biscuit and it was left out. I dknt much like that I paid for something I didn't receive
1062,3,Neutral,The biscuit with the chicken biscuit was bland. And mustard was plentiful (had to scrape some off). 
1063,5,Positive,Yum! First time order. Great service and delivery guy was curteous. Will order again.
1064,3,Negative,It tasted fine but they really need to look at what customers put in the details. It's disappointing when your food comes soggy when you asked the sauce to be on the side. 
1065,5,Positive,"Honest Biscuits seems like a great place! The gluten free biscuits were soft and yummy, and prepared well. The grits were SUPER cheesy. "
1066,3,Neutral,It was okay.
1067,1,Negative,It took 2 hours for my food to arrive. It was cold  not well packaged. My worst experience so far. 
1068,2,Negative,"Food was cold. Biscuit was hard, chicken was hard and tasted bad. Grits were dried out and tough, rubbery. Salad was bland. Will not order again."
1069,5,Positive,"Tasty, fluffy biscuits! The kale salad was yummy, too, and allowed me to think the whole order was health food."
1070,2,Positive,Biscuit was so hard and almost burnt it wasn’t what I hopped for. Gravy was good .. but I won’t order again .
1071,2,Negative,Food was ice cold so hard to judge 
1072,5,Positive,FOOD GOOD. ALL FOOD IN BELLY.
1073,5,Positive,Good food reasonably priced.
1074,4,Positive,Their sirloin steak is always cooked n flavored perfectly!  
1075,3,Negative,Food was okay but arrived very cold.
1076,2,Negative,"They need to make sure everything is ready, half of my order wasn't delivered and I still got charged full price for the meal. Do better IHOP!"
1077,2,Negative,Omelettes were alright but that’s it. Toast was over cooked. No butter was included for all three orders of toast. Bacon omelette was supposed to have white cheddar cheese sauce and this was not included. We didn’t get hash-browns for two of the omelets. Doesn’t specifically say hash browns included but asks how you want them cooked and came with hash browns last time. The other omelette has hash browns in it. We asked for crispy hash browns and they were mushy. A lot of mistakes for an 80$ breakfast order. 
1078,5,Positive,Meals should Have came with juice
1079,5,Negative,Could of used a little more gravy for the steak but that seems to be a common thing from several restaurants.
1080,5,Positive,The food was excellent (fresh and hot).  My order was correct and on time.  The driver followed the correct Covid-19 guidelines and I was extremely pleased with this meal purchase.  Thank you! 
1081,3,Neutral,Try to deliver food that is warm
1082,2,Negative,IHOP is a big chain so depends on the night/staff. Sometimes great sometimes meh.
1083,4,Negative,"The website is easy to use but why do they have a comment section for delivery instructions to your driver when the driver doesn't even look at them? For instance I ordered pancakes from IHOP and when you do that they give you one syrup everybody knows that one syrup is not enough for 3 pancakes so I asked the driver to grab some extra syrup.... well he didn't . Too late for me, I had already tipped 30%..... At that rate I should at least get some extra syrup 😉."
1084,5,Positive,IHOP with joy when I eat at IHOP. 😂
1085,3,Negative,For some reason I always recieve less items than ordered. And no matter how many drinks I order I only get one.
1086,5,Positive,"My mom recently fell & hit her head on our cement patio incurring a concussion & subdural hematoma. My bro & I take turns sleeping in her room on the most uncomfortable couch.

So after a tough night, ordering from IHOP was a great reward to start off my morning. The food was perfect and I appreciate the driver following the no-contact delivery. I was able to ignore the sore neck and back while enjoying a yummy breakfast with my mom.  😍"
1087,5,Positive,"Consistent, delicious breakfast."
1088,5,Positive,Really delicious this time around.
1089,5,Negative,Can't replicate the same as getting it in person but it's as close as you can get.
1090,4,Negative,Food was cold!! 
1091,1,Negative,"Delivery was 30min late. By the time it arrived, pancakes were cold and soggy. Didnt eat them. "
1092,2,Negative,"Food was good, but the restaurant did not follow order instructions and my order was missing items. "
1093,2,Negative,Restaurant was fine but delivery was late so food was cold
1094,1,Negative,My kid's order was wrong and she didn't the right things like the pancakes was suppose to birthday cake but its wasn't and their was no whip cream barely any syrup.My drink was kid size but it was for an adult the food was cold and the bacon wasn't all the way cooked.
1095,4,Positive,I like ihop. This was the freshest IHOP I've ever had.
1096,4,Positive,"One of the best parts of the order was the steak tips, good flavor and very tender; I was pleasantly surprised! The milkshake was a liquid mess that had no flavor of ice cream in it, wouldn’t order that again. Everything else was cooked well."
1097,5,Positive,"IHOP IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT, THE FOOD IS GREAT, AND THE SERVICE IS GREAT! THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE."
1098,4,Negative,Grubhub and OR iHop need to provide a space to select side dips dressings syrups etc... as much office has no condiments- I tossed some of my appetizer today because I ran out of dips! Super lame.
1099,5,Positive,One of my favorites for breakfast food at lunch.
1100,5,Positive,"Fast, friendly, efficient"
1101,5,Positive,Consistently good food and quite the value!
1102,4,Neutral,Portions seem larger in store.
1103,5,Positive,The food was delicious and delivered hot. I would order again.
1104,5,Neutral,Order was to be expected
1105,5,Positive,It was goooood 
1106,3,Negative,Okay eatable nothing special!
1107,5,Positive,It was perfect 👌🏽 
1108,4,Positive,Oversll good experience
1109,5,Positive,It was good.
1110,5,Positive,IHOP via Grubhub cost a little less than DoorDash and I was able to enter special instr for my order. Good job Grubhub
1111,1,Neutral,It was cold when we got it
1112,3,Negative,I did not get any tartar sauce for my fish and chips. The menu said tartar sauce was included.
1113,5,Positive,Wonderful sandwich shop
1114,3,Neutral,Forgot my 2 orders of soup.  Sandwich was good.
1115,5,Positive,This place is great. Love it
1116,5,Positive,Great food love this place been eating there for over 10 years
1117,5,Positive,Best Reuben in Seattle. 
1118,5,Positive,best breakfast sandwich ever
1119,3,Positive,Restaurant's food was delicious
1120,5,Positive,Love it. Best sandwiches ever
1121,5,Positive,Hands down the best ruben and corned beef sandwiches I've EVER had!
1122,3,Negative,"Food was outstanding very good. Bad rating because my driver gave me attitude through out our interaction but hey what ever maybe hes having a bad day at the end when he was walking away i say thank you again have a good one and he says ""yeah what ever"" like uh ok man feeling some type of way today i see.... i then come out later to go shopping and my car which was fine before ordering food when i was outside earlier has now been rummaged through... My Order was 40 bucks i tipped him 7 i guess this wasnt enough to him idk or he was just mad. But my change for parking downtown and other things are missing from my car as it was ransacked and things thrown around in haste of looking for valuables luckily not much was taken as i dont have alot of valuables in general.. Didnt know if it was him or not until further investigation i am quite sure it was. Him and the mail man were the only ones who walked onto my property that day during the time frame of my car being closed to open and rummaged through alas nothing I can do as i have no real solid proof and objects stolen are quite petty just thought id mention publicly to let people know watch out because he is still working for grubhub or delivery services including grub hub so caution. I live with my grandma and she is now super freaked out and doesnt want to ever order from delivery again as iv also had a problem with a delivery driver hitting my car with a door when he was leaving and not saying anything when i saw hin do it then having to file a police report because he denied it. Anyway food is amazing but service... wack "
1123,5,Positive,The food is amazing tasty - will order a lot -- thank you
1124,5,Positive,Great sandwiches/lots of meat..yummy
1125,5,Positive,Absolutely wonderful! Best ruban I have ever had
1126,5,Positive,"So this is a landmark Seattle sandwich shop. Seriously. If you go there in person you will have your mind blown. The problem is that moist sandwiches don’t travel well. They are freaking delicious, but don’t order the wet sandwiches, which is unfortunately most of them. When Covid is over go in person and you will get a really tasty sandwich."
1127,5,Positive,Happy that this food is available.
1128,4,Negative,Meat was piled high. Packaging can use a little more thought. AU JUS spilled in bag. Overall food met ratings online
1129,4,Negative,"The sandwiches were delicious. The potato salad was mediocre. But the part that really got me down was the baklava. It was not as cheap, not as good, and not as big as from other places. Not worth the money at all when you can get a piece twice the size and better quality for less elsewhere. "
1130,5,Positive,Makes the most delicious sandwiches in Washington State!
1131,5,Positive,A Seattle landmark! Good food
1132,4,Positive,The best sandwichs in town
1133,5,Positive,The best Reuben in town and fast too!
1134,5,Positive,"So much food, delicious!"
1135,5,Positive,The food is always delicious
1136,5,Positive,Glad to have discovered it
1137,5,Positive,"Food is great, lots of meat in the sandwich. Extra bonus with potato salad, pickle and cookie that came with my soup and half sandwich order."
1138,4,Positive,Great food.  Quick delivery.  Needs more horseradish delivered with sandwiches.  I had enough for 5 bites
1139,5,Positive,Hard to find a parking spot were they are located. It's great to have it delivered.
1140,4,Negative,"The restaurant was excellent. The Reuben sandwich really was stuffed full of meat. Yum! However, the delivery driver didn't read the special delivery instructions. Did he think I wrote them because I was bored? No, I wrote them because there are special instructions for delivering to my office. Grr!"
1141,5,Positive,Been going there for years. First time having it delivered😊
1142,5,Positive,Amazing sandwiches!! Best in Seattle!
1143,5,Positive,"Address was wrong for the hotel in the app. Otherwise, food was great, driver was awesome, and I'm satisfied with this transaction"
1144,5,Positive,"Amazing, best sandwiches in town!"
1145,5,Positive,Great place. I  have going there since 1965. And great corned beef and pastrami
1146,5,Positive,"Delicious food, large portions, I like it."
1147,5,Positive,"Everything you read about the excellence of the sandwiches at Market House Meats is true. One of the best Reuben's I've ever had. Lots of meat on the sandwich. Very tasty flavorful meat. Sides aren't much, but you go to a place like this for the great sandwiches. "
1148,5,Positive,"Food was great . The soup was a surprise. It was posole which I wasn't expecting, but a pleasant surprise."
1149,5,Positive,The pastrami sandwich was fantastic!
1150,5,Positive,"Generous portions, nice sides, still warm!"
1151,5,Positive,"I can not recommend this place enough to people. It is hands down the best sandwich shop in Seattle. The order always comes intact, tasty, and good presentation. If you want a bbq sandwich, look no further than this place. Also be warned.. they make it more New York style so expect the meat to piled on!!!"
1152,5,Positive,Love this spot - the food is always SO good!
1153,3,Negative,The food just wasn't that great.  The driver didn't have a name -so no one knew to contact me.
1154,5,Positive,Always have loved the sandwiches there.
1155,5,Positive,"This is the third time I have ordered from here, and the second time I have ordered for the office. Each time we have more people try and everyone ends up loving the food!"
1156,5,Positive,"Great food, friendly staff."
1157,5,Positive,Best damn Rueben in Seattle period the end!
1158,5,Positive,60+ years of making corned beef and pastrami sandwiches they do it right
1159,1,Negative,The food was great and the restaurant was very friendly. Grubhub needs to fire that driver though! It took him an hour and a half to deliver food 10 blocks. If I wasn't at work I could have walked there and back in a quarter of the time. The worst part is he didn't even apologize for the hold up.
1160,5,Positive,Food is good 
1161,3,Neutral,"The BBQ sandwich was great, but the brat was not a brat, it was a hot dog. Also, both sandwiches came with things that were not listed, some of which I could not eat and thus had to throw away. Be more mindful of your menu."
1162,5,Positive,One of our favorites 
1163,5,Neutral,"Lots of meat, very tasty and filling"
1164,5,Positive,The food was fantastic 
1165,1,Negative,I want a refund
1166,2,Negative,The sandwich was very dry!!!
1167,3,Negative,I order a hot pastrami dip. The dip was missing from my order.
1168,5,Positive,Hands-down the best sandwiches in Seattle.
1169,3,Negative,My sandwich was super burned :( and the delivery fee was too high for what it was
1170,2,Negative,"Overpriced and under seasoned food arrived cold, and no utensils provided luckily the hotel I was staying at provided me with some.  Delivery driver wanted me to come down and get the food instead of delivering to my door. Less than satisfactory experience."
1171,1,Negative,Food was not good
1172,5,Positive,"Really good and not what we were expecting, better!"
1173,1,Negative,"Careless, sad, and inedible. Cold food. Missing items. Wrong items. Very expensive slop. Never again. "
1174,5,Positive,Great comfort food.
1175,2,Negative,Driver never dropped off order and confirmed it delivered. Didn't want to rate the food bad as I didn't have it.
1176,1,Negative,I asked for lots of condiments and received none
1177,5,Positive,"Food was perfect! Quality ingredients, flavor and preparation. Will try again."
1178,3,Negative,Good food but they forgot the toast I ordered with my omelette and the sides of bacon with both the omelette and the potato bacon pancakes so that was disappointing
1179,5,Positive,Very good food!
1180,1,Negative,It was horrible. Will never eat there again.
1181,2,Neutral,Food was cold
1182,4,Negative,"Food was good, only complaint was the missing side order"
1183,3,Negative,The chicken strips where just OK. More than likely won’t order from here again.  
1184,4,Positive,Good late-night food from a local staple
1185,1,Negative,"Bug in Grubhub app applied my order as a pickup and not a delivery.  I realized the error immediately  and contacted customer service.  You know what they did for me?  Nothing.  Took them 15 minutes to do it, too. I’m a 25 minutes walk away from the restaurant, and don’t own a car.  My DATE had to pick up the food because I don’t have car, which is WHY I USE THE APP.  Thanks for embarrassing me on an important day, Grubhub!  My fifty most regrettable dollars spent this year."
1186,5,Positive,It is one of our favorites here at the office. Excellent food and customer service
1187,4,Positive,It's a good restaurant is down the street from me
1188,5,Positive,"Wonderful!!!
Delicious food!
It was nice and hot! 
Our delivery person was super nice and friendly!!"
1189,5,Positive,The food was great and hot thank you
1190,3,Negative,Did not enjoy the chicken fried steak.  Was incredibly tough.  
1191,5,Positive,Great food and excellent customer service.
1192,1,Negative,Patty Melt was good.   Side (chili) was missing.   The potatoes and gravy tasted very odd.   too odd to eat more than a couple of tastes.
1193,2,Negative,"It took more than an hour, close to an hour and a half. Food got cold."
1194,5,Positive,"If ordering the country fried stake, might want to order some extra gravy, was not enough for the amount of steak. Still delicious."
1195,1,Negative,Food never arrived
1196,4,Positive,Presentation was off but food was good
1197,5,Positive,"Amazing packaging, very thoughtfully done. Will order again, it's my go-to"
1198,5,Positive,Very good food
1199,2,Negative,The driver mentioned i didnt anserr my callbox (there was no call) and left it in the lobby. The drink wasnt there and i wouldve mentioned that if they had dropped it off correctly. The sandwich was great though!
1200,3,Negative,My hashbrown is not fully cook.  Sooner of the potato is still raw.  
1201,4,Positive,Food was great but burger wasn't cooked to the temp ordered.
1202,4,Negative,"Our sons meal was not on the menu and there was no communication his order was taken off, no way of knowing we needed to substitute for something else. Our food arrived, we all sat down to eat and realized our son's food was missing. Took 3 calls to figure it out. "
1203,5,Positive,i like eggs Benny yum its good potato too yes please good restaurant i eat the food yum. side note: they use air cleaning machine and scifi glass booths so its safe to eat at which is cool
1204,1,Negative,driver left my food outside when it should go inside of the lobby 
1205,1,Negative,"They got my whole order wrong. They did this last time, too. They messed up literally everything that they could mess up, the only thing they got right is that I ordered avocado. Do not order here, at least for delivery. I'm pissed that I couldn't refund my whole order."
1206,1,Negative,"Who cooked this thing? Eggs were undercooked (over-easy does not mean raw). The Chicken Fried Steak... Where do I begin.  I wont be having a hankering for a few years. Overcooked would be a.. Kind way to put it. Burned to a crisp. Tough Shoe leather meat, and bland gravy. I took the first bite and remorsed on paying $25 for this dish. 100% wished I could send it back. "
1207,1,Negative,The food looked like they literally threw in the box. Dont order roast beef my godfather couldn't even eat it.
1208,2,Negative,Food was not good and arrived cold.  We are in a hotel with no way to heat it up.
1209,1,Negative,Food was cold and of the worst quality. Will never be ordering from here again. Any other option was better than this meal 
1210,1,Negative,"Cold, greasy food"
1211,4,Negative,"The food is fantastic!! We enjoyed what we did get. Sadly, we had an item missing from our order. We were able to get a refund on our missing item."
1212,2,Positive,"Food is delivered in a sealed plastic bag. That is great for ensuring that it’s tamper-proof and clean from the kitchen, but it also means that all the heat turns to steam and food is soggy. 

I ordered chicken strips and they were...meh. Fries were floppy and over-salted. "
1213,5,Neutral,"Solid food, quick delivery"
1214,2,Negative,Order arrived supe cold and cinnamon roll was rock hard. Major disappointment 
1215,2,Neutral,My pot roast was tough and dry. Disappointing this time
1216,1,Negative,"ordered corn beef benedict, recieved cubed beef, undercooked hashbrowns.

chicken quesadilla, burnt thrown together sloppy.
how they are still open, or should be allowed to stay open?
save your stomach and money.
only thing mecca has or should be is a bar...
r.i.p."
1217,5,Positive,Great home style comfort food!😛
1218,5,Positive,Damn food crispy chicken parts and excellent fries 
1219,1,Negative,The food was cold like it was not cooked to order!
1220,1,Negative,"This was a horrible experience. My order was delayed, it took so long that i called the cafe. I had to google the number because the one listed here was busy. No one even bothered to answer the phone. The cook decided to give my all bacon instead of the bacon/ sausage combo like the meal was suppose to be. Overall i will never order anything from here. Very poor service"
1221,5,Positive,It was good
1222,1,Negative,Cold food. Late delivery
1223,3,Negative,Food was barely warm by the time it reached me. 
1224,4,Positive,The curds were delicious. However my burger was incorrect. Had everything on it and I have food sensitivities. Actually one of my favorite places to eat and was craving it. Side was mush. Might swing by for actual take out since I rarely had trouble when I was able to dine in. If you don't have to customize I recommend hands down!
1225,1,Negative,"I'm not sure if one  five point Cafe is better than the other, I am talking about the lower Queen Anne location, the chicken-fried was really dry and semi crispy...  and the chili and cheese tater tots I had purchased came without chili and cheese. Yeah I'm pretty sure I won't be ordering from them anymore. aside from that another thing I can't stand is when your GrubHub driver picks up your food and then goes and delivers something else somewhere else while your food is getting cold😠"
1226,5,Positive,"There is no burger in Seattle that compares. When you envision the perfect diner burger, this is the one. Just bigger. "
1227,4,Positive,We love their food
1228,2,Negative,The driver texted to say he had dropped off my food when he had not. Which means he was perfectly fine with dropping off at the wrong address. My order was missing the add on I paid for. The fries were burned and disgusting. I will never order from that restaurant again. 
1229,4,Positive,"Food was fantastic-
Second delivery in a row where they said one time and ended up adding close to 30min to 90 additional min to the delivery time."
1230,2,Positive,There was so much grease from the hashbrowns that it poured out of the container. 
1231,2,Neutral,honestly probably the worst 
1232,5,Positive,Very tasty breakfast every time.
1233,2,Negative,"The GrubHub side of things were perfect. Very nice delivery person, excellent customer service. The food side was not good. Twice we have gotten wrong orders. Idk if that's GrubHub's fault...I'm thinking not. "
1234,2,Negative,Will not order from them again.
1235,5,Positive,"One of the best delivery experiences I have had! Also, 5-Point Café’s menu is AMAZING! Those potatoes they serve with their breakfast menu...💛"
1236,4,Negative,"Food was great, however they ignored my request of no jalapenos in the instructions box. Not a big deal to me personally just a taste preference but still"
1237,1,Negative,"The whole thing was just thrown together haphazardly, with really sub par ingredients, i remember them being much better than this...too bad i won't return and i wouldn't recommend "
1238,5,Positive,"The food was delicious, was still hot upon delivery. Could have used more sour cream with the potato bacon pancakes, but still was wonderful!"
1239,1,Negative,"Ordered 2 burgers, got 1. Wouldn’t deliver 2nd burger. All lukewarm due to inexplicable delay between “out for delivery” and arrival.SO unsatisfactory. Refund didn’t cut it. "
1240,5,Positive,It's was yummy
1241,5,Negative,Bruh stop reading this review and start ordering. Those hushpuppies will have you wishing for more...
1242,1,Negative,"Ordered breakfast from here, and in general it was pretty ""meh"", but the worst thing is that I ordered the California Benedict and it didn't have the advertised avocado or grilled tomato—it didn't even have any hollandaise sauce! The oatmeal also wasn't topped with raisins as advertised. Tried to complain, but they didn't answer the phone. A huge disappointment after paying so much, and I definitely won't be ordering from them again."
1243,4,Positive,"Delivery was early and still piping hot. The breakfast sandwich on a biscuit that my friend ordered was excellent, however I personally wouldn't go for the pancakes. They were VERY dense and not fluffy. Mine were on the burned side of cooked also. I would totally eat here again, just skip the pancakes in my opinion. "
1244,3,Negative,Forgot my pancakes.
1245,5,Positive,This place made my 30th birthday amazing period from talking to the gentleman on the phone ensuring that they were still delivering to getting the food and it still being piping hot. A very satisfied customer and will be a repeat customer from this point out.
1246,3,Positive,Food is great just took forever to deliver
1247,3,Negative,"Hit or miss. Sometimes the halibut is beer battered, sometimes it is panko crusted (and possibly just the cheaper fish and chips?). Garlic bread was burnt. When it's good it's great, and when it isn't, it is a really poor experience"
1248,4,Negative,There was some butter/grease substance in the bottom of my bag that got all over the soda
1249,1,Positive,"Service was great, food was sub par. "
1250,3,Positive,We love the restaurant
1251,1,Negative,Covid-19 price-gouging in their 'grocery' section at the bottom of their menu.  At first was happy to find a place that made grilled cheese sandwich with American 'cheese' which though not really cheese is a guilty pleasure.  Asked for ham and got tomato instead.  My friend found his turkey sandwich inedible.  His mashed potatoes were not mashed by any realistic standard of mashed potatoes.  Will not be ordering here again.
1252,2,Neutral,The roast beef was one large slab of fat. I’ve had this dish numerous times and it was amazing so I was co fused. Also the gravy tasted off. Maybe a new cook that day
1253,2,Negative,Because of Having Multiple Deliveries My Order Arrived Cold
1254,5,Positive,"Good food and happy to be able to support a local business, that has been around for a long time, during this Coronavirus time. Thank you to the GrubHub delivery driver too for going out and making deliveries during this pandemic. Appreciate you!!!"
1255,3,Positive,No bleu cheese with the buffalo bleu chicken sandwich but other than that everything was good
1256,1,Negative,Late and food was cold
1257,1,Negative,"Food arrived over an hour late and was really cold. 

Meat loaf was looked like the packaging was dropped at some point. 

I couldn't eat the pancakes because they didn't include syrup or butter. "
1258,4,Negative,Food was delivered over an hour after ordered. That was the reason I couldn’t give 5 stars however my French Dip was amazing and the Bacon Cheeseburger was excellent. I will order again from here... just be patient with the delivery time. 
1259,1,Neutral,Mecca the was cold and Grubhub had wait for them stop talking to make the not order.  I understand why the Grubhub driver or myself will not accept or order from them anymore. Positive was the Grubhub driver 🤗!That 
1260,1,Negative,"Order was late, cold and missing items. Never again ordering."
1261,1,Negative,Food was terrible and cold. 
1262,1,Negative,Food was cold . I think it would have been great if it was a little warm. 
1263,5,Positive,"Tater tots and the mess was so awesome basicly a sausage egg and tater scrambly but the hashbrowns are the big ones chorizo not overly seasoned and the perfect kiss of jalepeno,Mmmmmmm so good and they are local so yes i bought breakfasts for a while and plan on buying again."
1264,2,Negative,"Everything was cold. Pancakes were crammed into a container that was too small, so they were crumpled up and smashed."
1265,5,Positive,Great sandwich and fries!!
1266,2,Negative,prolly better in person. they gotta figure out their delivery. like how putting hot chicken in a box of salad isnt a good move lol
1267,3,Negative,"I ordered French dip and they forgot the au jus, so I really can't say if it good or not, I also ordered a $4.80 Root Beer that was forgotten."
1268,3,Negative,Cold and soggy food arrived after two delivery time updates 
1269,1,Negative,"Food was lukewarm, incorrect, very small portions not worth $27 😡"
1270,4,Positive,It was good
1271,2,Negative,"It says 5 point cafe but my order came from the Mecca Cafe, which is a block from me- I would've ordered from there if I wanted the MECCA cafe...but u was ordering from 5 Point. My bacon Burger didn't have that Juicy slices of bacon, it had a spoon full of bacon bits, also they forget two sauces... My bf and I work(Ed) in the industry and it's really not that hard...
Don't get me wrong- I wanna support local take-out/delivery restaurants- but this is was not what I was expecting- for paying $50+ for a burger and cheese steak and not getting it from the restaurant I ordered it from? I know its the same owners but NOT the same kitchen guys. Sucks. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
1272,5,Positive,I like it
1273,2,Neutral,"Ordered the custard French toast. I received the French toast, minus the custard. Left feedback for the restaurant, never heard back."
1274,3,Negative,Specifically asked for the food to be separated a  certain way and my request was forgotten. 
1275,3,Negative,I love 5 points. I just was missing a whole order
1276,5,Positive,"Quick delivery , delicious food, and even a thank you on the delivery bag for ""helping them keep the lights on""! Bedt dinner ever :-)
"
1277,5,Positive,Love this restaurant. Thank you
1278,3,Negative,It was ok but my order was not what I asked for and by the time it got to me it was kind of soggy
1279,5,Positive,Thank you 5 point❤️ Best ever. Our driver was awesome as well.
1280,5,Positive,Food was excellent!!
1281,1,Negative,"I really like this place, but they let me down today and missed part of my order:( I have to rate low for the price I'm paying"
1282,1,Neutral,Food clearly sat around for 2 hours before being delivered. 
1283,2,Negative,There was a note on my order box saying my coworkers order was not with tater tots and we were charged correctly so he just got a small burger and it says the burgers all come with fries or you can have a salad or tater tots also nothing on the bag like napkins silverware 
1284,4,Positive,The food wasn't as nicely presented as I thought it would be. They also forgot the aioli sauce for the cheese curds. The food was also cold but it was delicious when I heated it up
1285,1,Negative,"After speaking  with Aden and no Resolution  im going to use another company Aden was a big fat 
ZERO  0000"
1286,3,Positive,"I ordered blueberry pancakes. That’s it. So, 3 beautiful fluffy pancakes with ZERO butter and only one to-go syrup packet. The syrup was about the size of McDonald’s packets. Is that REALLY enough for 3 pancakes? Kinda stingy. Pancakes were dry because they don’t give butter with the order. 3/5."
1287,1,Negative,"Our food was 2 hours late, cold and wretched. The tiny scoop of coleslaw that cost $4 was warm, dry, shredded cabbage. No cheese was on the $18 Impossible burger. The fries were cold and soggy. I contacted the restaurant 1 hour after the originally scheduled arrival time, and was brusquely told the driver had not arrived yet. They obviously made no effort to provide safe food to the customer. So between them not caring about their food and the GH driver being incredibly late and then not being able to find the only condo building on our side of the block🤷🏼‍♀️it was a bummer meal. To GH’s credit, after a little wrestling, we did get a refund, but never again!"
1288,3,Negative,"The driver was great no complaints with him, but the food was awful. There was maybe a tbsp of hollandaise sauce on each half of the eggs benedict, the eggs were tiny and hard boiled, and the hash browns had zero flavor aside from tasting slightly burnt. I’m glad I got $6 off because if i spent $18+ on that meal I would’ve been even more angry. Not to mention there was very little food even in the box, which was messy when I opened it. Very disappointed.  "
1289,5,Positive,"Amazing Philly Cheesesteak! Since I don't get back east as often as I'd like, this is a decent substitute :)"
1290,1,Negative,"The worst order I have ever received.  It was Inedible. The meet was like a hockey puck, the potatoes were cold, I ordered a pie, but didn’t receive one (lucky me)!!! "
1291,1,Negative,I was given the wrong food by the driver. I opened and handled some one else’s burger in which it really sucked for the other person. I called grubhub and they could care less!!
1292,4,Positive,Ordered through GrubHub where I had explicitly written instructions for our salads. Not one of my requests was honored. The food was ok but it would have been better with the modifications I requested. 
1293,3,Negative,"Ordered a veggie sandwich with fries and coleslaw. Sandwich was extra toasted (really close to burnt), and the fries were missing. Even then the sandwich and coleslaw were great. "
1294,2,Negative,The food was very late and almost cold. 
1295,3,Negative,I didn't get my food!
1296,5,Positive,Best restaurant in belltown
1297,3,Negative,Coleslaw tasted really odd!
1298,2,Positive,"The French Fries were cold and hard like they had been sitting for a while. The meat and the au jus in the French Dip were very salty. All in all, if you like fat, salt, and grease, you would like this."
1299,2,Negative,One plate was cold. Cinnamon roll was inedible. 
1300,5,Positive,Good food and way too much for one meal.
1301,5,Positive,This is my go-to burger spot in my neighbourhood. Delicious burgers and crunchy fries. Yum
1302,5,Positive,I loved it!!!
1303,5,Neutral,Would order again
1304,4,Negative,Food is usually great but failed this time.
1305,1,Negative,"Food was great, but delivery was almost 2 hours and food was very cold"
1306,2,Negative,"Tasteless Philly cheesesteak. Dry meat, like 1 slice of cheese, a few sprinkles of onions."
1307,5,Positive,Great food. Breakfast done right
1308,5,Positive,It was excellent
1309,5,Positive,"Great variety and complete with condiments (jelly, butter, syrup, cream, and ketchup). Attention to detail!"
1310,2,Negative,My delivery driver took 40 minutes to deliver my food. It got delayed two times while it was on the way because my driver kept going to random places and not actually delivering the food. An hour and 40 minutes after I ordered my food is when I got it. Disgusting
1311,2,Negative,"I am a fan of huevos rancheros (bad spelling aside).  First the dish came, basically in a bunch of little containers. I understand the reasoning, but it just felt like they threw packages in a box after cooking the eggs. The tortillas where hard, in a bad way. The salsa was not great, and very little. It doesn't matter if that was their intention, it was not good. Overall, never order again, and its embarrassing that was let out the door. Doubt I will order again (i have in past too, was ok, nothing special, so a certainly bad dish means there are better options out there). Edible, just not good."
1312,5,Positive,fine and elegant style
1313,3,Negative,"Dry chicken, wrong sauce, and also very late. "
1314,1,Negative,Burned pancakes 🥞 😩
1315,4,Negative,"Food was good, but not very warm. Might've been sitting in queue too long for delivery."
1316,1,Negative,"saddest burger, dry as the sahara, would rather eat sand"
1317,3,Negative,Tasty but they got my order wrong. Asked for avcoado & tomato benedict and I got ham
1318,2,Negative,Make the food as specified on the menu. I ordered Tater tots with chili and cheese and there was no chili.
1319,2,Negative,Restaurant is AMAZING. the delivery driver forgot part of my order at the restaurant and they called to tell him and he was short with them.
1320,5,Positive,"Delicious every single time!!!!
"
1321,2,Neutral,Food was horrible and we got things we didn’t order 
1322,1,Neutral,Pan cakes had a long hair in it.
1323,3,Negative,Terrible food. Arrived cold. Wont order again.
1324,3,Negative,"Due to bad delivery routing, food was completely cold and soggy by the time it arrived"
1325,2,Negative,Forgot juice and left one granola out. :( 
1326,3,Negative,"The food was burnt. I probably should have order something different, like pancakes and sausage. Chicken fried steak may have been too complicated of a item to get right. Maybe it was a busy night in the kitchen. I tried to eat the food, because I paid a lot for it.
Ended up throwing it away."
1327,4,Negative,"Good, but no chicken in my salad"
1328,3,Positive,"The biscuits and gravy were good, but arrived 1.5 hrs after I ordered. The food was cold. Also the cinnamon roll I rolled, all the icing dripped off into the bag. If I ordered and ate at the restaurant, I’m sure it would have been a better experience. "
1329,5,Negative,The food was cold when it arrived. The Mecca needs a better packaging solution. 
1330,3,Negative,"I’m a huge fan of the Mecca, but not of this order. The chicken fried steak was burnt; the avocado on the bennies was gross and inedible. The browns were fine; the Holland side was pretty lame. Super disappointed."
1331,5,Positive,"Love this place, so many great memories. "
1332,1,Negative,My food was burnt and gross I called this place and was told bc it was so busy that was why the food was the way it was .... that doesn’t make any sense to a customer and he never said sorry just to contact grubhub for a refund 
1333,2,Negative,"Order wasn’t labeled so we had to dig around the burgers to see who’s who, which caused problems as one of us ordered med rare while the other two ordered medium. Ended up getting the wrong burger.  Please label your burgers, and have an option to remove Mayo as nothing states that Mayo comes on burger. "
1334,1,Negative,"The driver did not contact me upon delivery.  They somehow got into my building and dumped it at my door without knocking or alerting me it had been delivered.  Since I hadn't heard from them, I decided to go to the lobby and wait and upon walking out my door found the order sitting there.  Cold.  I want the 25% tip refunded.
"
1335,4,Negative,I understand that there were no mushrooms but any good replacement would have been better.
1336,3,Negative,food was not great
1337,5,Positive,Great restaurant and great service with Grubhub
1338,2,Positive,Didn't eat most of it and ended up tossing it. I ordered the fried chicken and it somehow tasted sweet. 
1339,4,Positive,Breakfast burrito was delicious the turkey I had was def not fresh though in my other dish with the mash potatoes. Gravy was good 
1340,1,Neutral,Food was cold. 
1341,5,Negative,Big portions. The food is good but not fantastic.
1342,3,Negative,"Mecca Café always has good food, but this particular delivery left a little to be desired. My food arrived earlier than expected, and the driver followed my no-contact instructions perfectly. However, I don’t know if it was the restaurant, or the driver, but my food came room temperature (I expect a little heat loss from travel, but not THIS much), and everything was tossed about in the container, like someone had gone on a run with the container before placing it in my lobby. I suggest a little more care when transporting. "
1343,3,Neutral,"Requested ""no sour cream""... there was sour cream

Requested to be met in the back... delivered to the front"
1344,5,Positive,Food was good with great options. Im vegetarian so I liked the options.
1345,3,Neutral,My food came cold
1346,5,Positive,I love this place! The food is amazing. Perfect greasy spoon food and is always spot on. All their breakfast food is delicious!
1347,2,Negative,"45 minutes late, couldn't follow simple instructions, food was cold"
1348,1,Negative,"Didn't get the right food, my drinks and any of my ranch! I also asked for no pickles and got pickles and I am very allergic!!!"
1349,3,Negative,"Ordered a cheesesteak with a side of onion rings. Received a cheesesteak with a side of tater tots. Sandwich was good, tater tots were very salty. Disappointed."
1350,5,Negative,The owner is a rapist
1351,5,Neutral,phenomenal food and adherence to special requests
1352,5,Neutral,"As expected, delicious!"
1353,5,Positive,"The driver was awesome, very professional, very Speedy delivery however it’s sad to see that the Mecca café no longer is as good as it once was the eggs were overcooked, the Hashbrowns were under cooked the bacon and the sausage didn’t seem to be fresh, it’s a shame that the new ownership has ruined what once was an iconic diner. It is at no fault of the cooks waiters and waitresses but all the fault of the new owner. "
1354,1,Negative,Food was cold and nasty
1355,5,Positive,Wow awesome breakfast we loved everything in our order ! 
1356,2,Positive,The steak appetizer was overpriced and meh. The chicken eggs and gravy was excellent. Prices are high since they have a delivery fee in addition to the already outrageous grub hub fee.
1357,2,Neutral,Took a long time for the restaurant to prepare the food
1358,5,Positive,"I absolutely love the Mecca Cafe. It’s the perfect greasy spoon, classic cafe food. So good! I’ve never been let down by their food. "
1359,1,Negative,They charge $10 for tator tots and they weren’t in the bag the steak was dry and rock hard. Choke on my balls
1360,2,Neutral,The food was real bad. For example the grilled cheese just had two pieces of bread and a slice of cheese. Not even melted. How do you mess that up.  A grilled cheese... it’s like you’re trying to make bad food. 
1361,3,Positive,"While the food is outstanding, the restaurant needs to change the packaging paper. The color of the food packaging paper smears on to the food."
1362,5,Positive,Absolutely amazing Monte Cristo sandwich and nice delivery!
1363,3,Positive,Pie was good.
1364,4,Positive,Doesn't put a lot of hollandaise on togo bennies only 4* otherwise great!
1365,5,Positive,It was very good
1366,2,Negative,"Some of it was good. But delivery was very late and did not include syrup with the pancakes, or butter or any condiments. "
1367,5,Positive,"Great food with good presentation, packed safely! Would order again"
1368,5,Positive,"It was tasty, the sausage a little spicy .. and the eggs were warm enough when it got here."
1369,2,Negative,"Hey, if you're gonna sell sodas through a delivery service, maybe you should have spill-proof containers for them. I paid over $4 for a Coke and it was sent in a 12oz coffee cup, which was lying on its side in the bag. The bag, napkins, and food container were all soaked and there was barely any Coke left in the cup. "
1370,1,Neutral,"Restaurant fine, eaten there before"
1371,1,Negative,The food was inedible. Unpresentable and made me sick.
1372,1,Positive,Place is great but it’s always late and cold
1373,3,Negative,New manager has ruined it.  Not the staffs fault
1374,3,Positive,Sent the wrong dish. I ordered hot turkey sandwich with gravy and mashed potato. I got a club sandwich with fries. Food was just ok.
1375,1,Negative,"Delivery was delayed 3 times, and by the time it finally showed up it was ICE COLD. Thew it away. Total waste of $27 I think I am done with GRUBHUB"
1376,5,Positive,It is a long time comfort food greasy spoon restaurant with great people working there! It is not fussy food but hits the spot
1377,5,Positive,Healthy and yummy food
1378,4,Positive,"Loved the waffles, roommate enjoyed her smoothie, but if you aren't expecting a soft texture on the muffins it's a surprise."
1379,4,Positive,"The salad could use some tomatoes, but the dirty chai was excellent.  The smoked salmon was good, but a little expensive."
1380,5,Positive,"Amazing green smoothie and gluten free protein waffles were excellent! Add peanut butter and too with maple syrup, so good!"
1381,2,Positive,"I ordered a turkey toast and they sent an avocado toast.

The green smoothie tasted like there was too much banana"
1382,1,Negative,I never got my ordered today. The driver said that the food was dropped off at the front door but I never got it.
1383,1,Negative,HORRIBLE. and I only ordered coffee. It was all milk. And even that was wrong. Ordered Oat and it was absolutely soy. I had to dump it down the sink. I will never order from here again. 
1384,1,Negative,Poor quality of food. 
1385,1,Negative,"Food was really bad, especially for the price. Açaí bowl was definitely not açaí. Mostly banana? The smoothie was so watered down. Really disappointing. "
1386,1,Negative,Restaurant great- Grubhub delivery estimate poor
1387,1,Negative,"The delivery was nearly 40 minutes, so I was stuck sitting around waiting for it. Not to mention the food itself was nothing spectacular, the picture of the waffles they have vs. what you actually get is completely different. "
1388,4,Negative,"The order was accurate, but the coffee was somewhat watered down and flavorless...but somehow still bitter. The waffles tasted great, but they were cold and a little rubbery in texture. Not terrible but a little disappointing."
1389,1,Negative,The amount of food you get for $8 is ridiculous. Overpriced and food test bad 
1390,2,Negative,"The waffles were delicious. 

I'm disappointed by the iced buttered coffee. The butter and coffee was blended with the ice cubes and the drink looked like curdled milk sitting on top of mud water. I ended up tossing it. The butter and coffee should have been blended together then poured over ice cubes. Will not be ordering from them again."
1391,5,Positive,Good place. Good food.
1392,3,Negative,Food was good - I'm sure it would be much much better fresher. It was cold on arrival unfortunately.
1393,5,Positive,I prefer this place over others for well made and tasty hamburgers. Good stuff! 
1394,1,Negative,The food was cold and they included something that was not cheese. It looks like some type of tortilla
1395,5,Positive,"Always a solid choice.  I get hungry for lunch around 10 AM or so. This is a really great place to get ""early lunch"" "
1396,5,Positive,Good stuff as usual 👍
1397,2,Negative,They forgot my soda. 😥
1398,5,Positive,I will order again. Food was excellent
1399,5,Positive,Tasty burger and onion rings
1400,5,Positive,So good! 206 burger everytime
1401,5,Positive,206 burger is sooo good!
1402,3,Negative,They miss 1 of my drinks
1403,5,Positive,"Great Driver...good communication 
food arrived hot and  ahead of time "
1404,5,Positive,Good burgers and onion rings
1405,5,Positive,Super tasty burgers
1406,5,Positive,good food. good portions
1407,5,Positive,"I love this place, the burgers are amazing and the house sauce is so yummy!"
1408,5,Positive,I love that they have a gluten free veggie burger
1409,5,Positive,Good food. Good driver
1410,5,Positive,"Good value, good food. Delivery person was patient."
1411,2,Negative,80 minutes was the time it took to get my food from the time I ordered. It was stone cold. The driver called me on his cell phone and made me come to the door of my apartment building to get my order. This is not what I paid GrubHub for! If you can’t deliver it to my door maybe I’ll have to start using another service
1412,3,Negative,Mixed up my orders the name of burger on wrapper was different from what was inside. I ended up not having a burger to eat when I was the one who ordered and paid for this delivery order. I suffered the consequence of not having anything to eat because of the restaurant's mistake.
1413,5,Positive,"Great food, good price, they always listen to my special instructions."
1414,1,Negative,"It was the wrong order. I asked for a lettuce wrap with caramelized onions on my burger. I did not receive that. I asked for balsamic vinaigrette for my salad, I received ranch. You guys are disappointing entirely. Won’t order again.  "
1415,5,Positive,Good food and great driver! Thank you 
1416,5,Positive,Best burgers on Capitol Hill
1417,5,Positive,They are consistent and good
1418,1,Negative,My burger was not cook fully. I took two bit and saw more pink than a pigs lips. Cut in half and the same thing. Never eating from there again. The Oreo shake was on point though. 
1419,5,Positive,This is the second tome we have ordered from 206 Burger and both times delicious food 😊
1420,4,Positive,Good burger. Fries were a bit too oily but still good.
1421,5,Positive,"I ordered The Bacon with Avocado 🥑 Burger and Onion Rings , they were both excellent ! I love the bun they used today , delicious, love thier Onion Rings ! Highly Recommended"
1422,4,Positive,"Great food, good price"
1423,4,Positive,Food is great
1424,5,Positive,Best burger and fries in Seattle
1425,5,Positive,Hamburger and fries heaven
1426,4,Negative,I asked for no Mayo and no cheese and got both. I also asked for ketchup and got none. The food was good but I was disappointed to get dairy on one of my burgers.
1427,1,Negative,The vegetarian burger was not avoid at all. It was like a wheat patty. Ordered a milkshake but it didn’t arrive.
1428,5,Positive,Awesome burgers & fries!
1429,4,Positive,Tasty and affordable
1430,3,Negative,"The food is okay, but ignoring my request to put the order in a bag with a handle made it very difficult for me to get it back to my room on my scooter. I know you have handled bags, and it would have made a big difference for me. Also, putting the salad on top of hot tater tots wilted the salad at the bottom of the container. Slimy salad is not good. "
1431,5,Positive,"206 knows what they're doing, most definitely!  I never finish an order of onion rings no matter how good they are, but I did tonight!  They're amazing.  And the salad I ordered had bacon ... real bacon, not imitation ... The ingredients are very fresh, and I couldn't finish it all!  Maybe 'cause I ate all my onion rings first 😋"
1432,5,Positive,"Delicious burgers and veggie burger, excellent fries, mediocre milkshakes. Overall very good"
1433,2,Positive,"I love 206! They made my order immediately. They are just down the street from my house and always deliver hot tasty food. 
Today I watched my order bounce between drivers and took an hour to deliver, when the restaurant is 10 minutes away. Grubhub drivers dropped the ball on this delivery."
1434,3,Neutral,The fries were a little undercooked and I had specifically requested no tomato there was tomato on the burger
1435,5,Positive,yummy food. consistent! cooked perfectly
1436,5,Positive,"Great food! Fast, good customer service."
1437,5,Negative,"I ate it so fast that I didn't realize I ate it so fast, and I spent five minutes trying to find where I left it. "
1438,3,Negative,"Driver is great!
Lunch not so much, mushy sandwich, cold onion rings and sandwich missing cheese."
1439,3,Positive,Missing item in order again second time. Food was delicious as always though. 
1440,4,Positive,"Had't ordered from this place in nearly two years. Miss the Parmesan fries, but the burgers still taste just as good. 
206 burger is nice and flavorful and also enjoyed the chicken club."
1441,4,Positive,Great but they forgot the ranch. 
1442,3,Negative,My order was missing an item and other things. Sort of disappointed usually I don't have this problem.
1443,5,Positive,Food delivered hot and tasty!
1444,5,Positive,Burger -- always wonderful
1445,5,Positive,One of my favorites! Rock solid
1446,5,Positive,"My BLAT sandwich was much larger than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, especially for the low price. And the vanilla shake was absolutely delicious and didn't arrive too melted down. I'll definitely order from here again."
1447,3,Negative,"Sadly, the food was not as hot and fresh as usual. The fries were pretty cold and seemed a little undercooked."
1448,5,Positive,Best food ever
1449,1,Negative,"Food arrived more than 40minutes late, and since it was burger & fries, everything was cold and soggy. Would not order again. Probably not the best type of food for late delivery. "
1450,3,Negative,Ok i just wish i had my onions.  The burger dont taste the same to me

1457,4,Positive,"On time, neat presentation. Tasty....bottom bun a little soggy. Might try serving condiments on the side."
1458,3,Positive,"It was a little blah for how much it cost. Like if it were a couple bucks cheaper it'd be fine, but for what I paid I expected a little high quality and larger sizes burgers"
1459,5,Positive,Great burgers at a reasonable price
1460,4,Positive,"The delivery was about 20 minutes late. But, when you're hangry, it seems like an hour.  Honestly, I was expecting a cold burger but it was nice and warm and exactly how I like it cooked.  The driver, Soloman, was very courteous so,  everyone helped turn it around!  I feel much better now and would definitely order again. "
1461,5,Negative,Not a very good burger.  Will not order from them again.
1462,5,Positive,Really yummy comfort food! The bean burger is amazing! Milk shakes with sweet potato fries hit the spot. 
1463,5,Positive,Truly great and patient.  Thank you!

1467,4,Positive,"Great place, Ikeep coming back"
1468,5,Positive,Excellent! Will order again
1469,1,Negative,There is nothing wrong with 206 Burger Co.  THere is something wrong with Grub Hub when my order sits for over an hour waitng for pickup and become inedible
1470,4,Negative,"The food was great, but two of the burgers were supposed to have bacon and they didn't.  Not the end of the world, but still a mistake."

1480,4,Positive,206 Burger is delicious!
1481,3,Neutral,"Good food, speedy delivery, nice driver. But I ordered onion rings and they weren't delivered. "
1482,1,Negative,I ordered an hour and a half ago - well enough ahead of my scheduled lunch break.  Horrible service and will NEVER use Grubhub again.  
1483,5,Positive,Satisfies your burger craving.
1484,5,Positive,"Well made, tasty burger with fresh french fries"
1485,3,Negative,Food was good. The delivery person had an attitude because he could not reach me right away. I work in Urgent Care and can't always get my messages right away
1486,2,Neutral,The food arrived cold. 
1487,5,Positive,Great! Will order again!
1488,3,Positive,It is always good but today my food was not very good. It was on the dry side.
1489,4,Neutral,Fries were a little too salty otherwise everything's great
1490,3,Positive,"The food
Is great but it was cold - and no ketchup --"
1491,1,Negative,"Worst customer service. GrubHub failed to send a driver on time so the food arrived 30minutes late, cold and mushy. When I tried to call GrubHub, the phone line was never answered. Resorting to the chat option, the agent when pressed for a refund for the epic service failure (seriously, grubhub only functions to pickup and deliver already cooked food on time; how can a company be so terrible at its only function?!?) I was informed that only the delivery fee, and none of the service fees or actual costs, could be refunded. It’s clear that GrubHub doesn’t care about quality or customer service, and a refund of $1.49 on a $40 order isn’t even trying to pretend you care. So, thanks for making it easy for me to never use your service again, and cautioning everyone else I know from ordering with you - I mean, unless cold, mushy, late food is their thing, in which case their your biggest fan!"
1492,3,Neutral,The burger was really small and dry.
1493,1,Negative,"Food was Cold, Burgers are not Fresh, McDonald's  Burger is 100 times better and Fries were soggy and oil soaked. "
1494,5,Negative,wrong burger but the food was so good I didn't even mind. 
1495,2,Negative,Did not get my order correct 😡
1496,1,Negative,The driver was a hour and a half late he didn't know where he was going and I my not order from them again
1497,5,Positive,"Great service, good food!"
1498,1,Negative,I never got my food. Grubhub's fault
1499,3,Neutral,"The food is great, I love this place. Unfortunately, the driver this time was somewhat rude and the delivery was delayed, causing everything to be cold. "
1500,1,Negative,Restaurant not at fault never delivered!!
1501,5,Positive,Burger Fries the best !
1502,2,Neutral,The restaurants fine I was just missing my burger.
1503,5,Positive,It was good food !  Always
1504,1,Negative,"Every bit of the food was cold and my granddaughter, who normally likes grilled cheese spit her single bite out - can’t blame her as the bread wasn’t toasted, the bread was soggy and as mentioned above, the cheese too thick and cold. Beyond dissatisfied and disappointed are the words that describe this experience. I’ll NEVER be back and I do not recommend this establishment. "
1505,1,Negative,"Missing item, cold food, and driver failed to follow the order instructions"
1506,5,Neutral,The hamburger buns were soggy and fried were over cooked
1507,1,Positive,"Ordered from here several times and loved it, but this time the order was an hour and a half late, ice cold and missing some things that I paid for. The food is good, but far too expensive to do this again. "
1508,2,Neutral,Food stone cold. Don't know if restaurant or Grubhub
1509,1,Negative,Delayed. Was supposed to arrive at 8:10-8:20 pm. Didn't receive meal until 9 pm
1510,5,Positive,"This place has the best burgers ever! The kiddos love their burgers so much they beg us to order more. 
Their onion rings are crispy and are a family favorite."
1511,2,Negative,Food came completely cold. They snuck in a “service fee” of almost $8 on top of delivery fee between that and tip it was more than the food. Will not ever order from them again
1512,2,Positive,"My burger was barely above room temperature, and was way too dry to be good. There was very little flavor. My milkshake was delicious though, so points for that."
1513,5,Positive,Love the food - always good
1514,5,Positive,It was very delicious and good the driver was courtesy and friendly
1515,3,Positive,Great however fries were cold
1516,1,Positive,51450972-5481860    My dinner never arrived although the web site says it did  Please refund.  Thank you.
1517,3,Positive,The food was fine tasting. But this is the second time I've asked for no tomatoes and they've put them on my burger. The tomato juice ran out of the burger packaging and got all over my other food and bled through the bag. Not ideal.
1518,5,Positive,Love the burgers and fries/tots/rings. Wish I could easily order sauce for the sides.
1519,1,Negative,Late. Over 90 minutes from order to delivery. Over 40 minutes to get less than 5 miles. Food was not warm and no condiments for tots or onion rings. Very disappointing. 
1520,1,Negative," Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but the food was late 2 days in a row. Its a GRUBHUB problem, not a restaurant problem. "
1521,2,Neutral,Food was late. 
1522,4,Positive,Love the food but they don't put ketchup  with the order-- and fries with out - not my favorite --  other then that I like the food .
1523,5,Negative,"As opposed to the driver meeting me at the door with my food like most drivers have previously; this driver stuck my food out the window of his car, and i ended up getting locked out of my building. Forgot my keys. Other than that the food was great they even remembered my request of no tomato's on my burger which i very much appreciated! 
"
1524,5,Positive,"The burger was very good, and the milkshakes were still frozen and very good."
1525,2,Negative,"Order was correct driver was great, but food was cold (probably due to the fact it came 30 minutes late) "
1526,5,Positive,The food was delicious and great
1527,3,Positive,"Tasty burgers, definitely. I don't know where the tardiness came from, but that was my major gripe."
1528,2,Negative,The restaurant is decent the food was cold because delivery took forever and was late
1529,3,Negative,Was missing Peanut butter shake.
1530,5,Positive,Great burger.great onion rings.
1531,4,Positive,It was good.
1532,5,Positive,Delicious food. Great ingredients.  Wonderful service.
1533,2,Negative,No Favor at all. It's as if they just used frozen patties with no seasoning.  Bread was not fresh and on top of that they forgot the salad. So my friend had nothing to eat. They should have delivered the salad  but nope just called for a refund  ... they were on first hill and I was on capital hill.  Not far away at all. Never again. 
1534,1,Negative,Food was cold there is no point in ordering food from you guys if I'm going to get cold food when I order hot food
1535,4,Positive,"Food was great, but the fries were cold."
1536,1,Negative,French fries and tater tot‘s were extremely cold. And so we’re both burgers. The buns were soggy and the lettuce was wilted. Was very disappointed
1537,4,Positive,Good - but fries with no ketchup -- not fun .. but other then that I love this place
1538,5,Positive,"The 206 Burger Co just makes great burgers. Nothing fancy, just a bun full of awesome!"
1539,3,Positive,My oreo shake was melted and my mushroom burger kind of tasted like coffee.
1540,5,Positive,Burger was amazing and full of flavor
1541,5,Positive,The food was e the driver was very friendly the food is really good
1542,3,Neutral,Asked for ketchup from restaurant and didn't get any. 
1543,5,Positive,Very good and fresh food.
1544,5,Positive,I absolutely love this restaurant
1545,5,Positive,The best burgers !
1546,3,Positive,A notch above Burger King.
1547,2,Negative,"Second time this has happened. I asked for no mayo and it came with mayo. Not sure why you include a field to put special requests if you don't acknowledge requests. Unfortunately I can't eat mayo and it's difficult to remove from bread and shredded lettuce. Enjoyed what was left of my BT minus the L and half the bun.

You know what they say. Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice... Strike three."
1548,2,Negative,"Missing an order of fries and the burger that said it would have grilled onions had fresh onions. When it comes down to it, it’s a burger it’s fine. But you’re rolling the dice it’s going to be what you ordered."
1549,4,Positive,"Excellent food. The driver however called a block away stating he was here, I had to come out my building and walk to the corner to flag him down. "
1550,1,Negative,They are serving food that sits for over one hour and feel that is acceptable.  Their food is average at best and their attitude is HORIBLE.  The order was cancelled after waiting 75 minutes after they shared that it was fine and not their problem if the food was cold or late....it was made and that is it.  NOT GOOD.
1551,3,Negative,Food was late and therefore cold. Less than desirable food products - I will say the non-oily tater tots and onion rings would have been good+ if they were warm. Burger - uneventful and unappetizing.
1552,5,Positive,Great food! Will definitely order again!
1553,1,Negative,They didn't receive my order
1554,5,Positive,206 burger never let's me down delicious every time 
1555,4,Positive,They were good!
1556,5,Positive,The order was right the driver was very friendly and the food very good
1557,2,Negative,The food is very low quality. My veggie burger was stale 
1558,1,Negative,The order was hella late I placed it at 11:20 I didn't get it until 12:30 very unacceptable Behavior when I order from your company ever again
1559,5,Neutral,The yam fries should come with a dip
1560,1,Negative,Order was over an hour late and when I called they seemed to have lost it
1561,2,Negative,Too much teriyaki...I vomited
1562,5,Positive,It was delicious. Will absolutely order again. So good!!☺
1563,5,Positive,Great food !!
1564,1,Negative,"Our order was wrong, I called the restaurant, and they refused to fix the order."
1565,4,Positive,Veggie bugers r amazing
1566,5,Positive,Always good food !
1567,5,Positive,Great job as always! 
1568,4,Positive,The food was good. I'm glad I ordered from there.
1569,5,Positive,"206 has been one of our favorite burger places for the last couple years, especially now with one of our other favorites (Wallyburger) being closed.

Tonight, they went above and beyond. I recently discovered a significant sensitivity to dairy, bordering on a true allergy. I mentioned this in my order, and they carefully labeled my family’s order, indicating what in the order contained dairy or was cooked in butter.

It was very thoughtful and helpful!"
1570,5,Positive,"They forgot the dipping sauce, but everything was delicious and the delivery driver was very nice."
1571,1,Negative,My food never arrived
1572,3,Negative,Didn't send all the food- but did refund the items not sent when I called. Still very inconvenient to not have full order
1573,5,Positive,love the Burgers --they Rock 
1574,5,Positive,"206 Burger makes a great chicken sandwich, and their sweet potato fries are perfect. Their service is prompt and friendly."
1575,1,Negative,"The burgers were doable but cold. The tots were not hot, warm, but slightly above room temperature. The overall lateness wasn't cool either. It would have been better for me to have ordered as a pick up and came to get the order. "
1576,5,Positive,Burger and fries  amazing and tasty 😁
1577,3,Negative,"My food was good once I warmed it up, it arrived cold. "
1578,5,Positive,"This was our first go with GrubHub. Went well. A little expensive, but also hassle free. Will do it again most likely."
1579,4,Positive,Everything was good except there were no condiments for v the French fries
1580,4,Positive,Good  need ketchup next 😁
1581,2,Negative,"Wrong order, food was  bland and cold"
1582,4,Positive,The restaurant is great. Good food and service.
1583,5,Positive,"The food was prepared really well and delivered ahead of promised time. The burger was good, but the fries and the shake were just extra yummy! "
1584,3,Positive,It was good food.
1585,3,Negative,Sucks when part of your order is missing. Fries were cold. Burgers were alright
1586,2,Negative,They need to step it up. The food was kind of dry and cold. A little flavorless.
1587,3,Negative,"The food was arrived in time, the burgers were tasty but cold and soggy. Fries were not tasty, overcooked and not fresh."
1588,1,Positive,I love the restaurant. I called them about my order and they immediately fixed me a new burger that I went to pick up. My food was delivered so late it was cold
1589,4,Positive,"Great food, excellent value."
1590,5,Positive,Great burgers 😁
1591,3,Positive,Soggy tasteless fries. Burgers okay. Packaging is frugal.
1592,5,Positive,Thats what i call great quality food
1593,5,Positive,Thank you so much! :) :) :) 
1594,5,Positive,First time ordering from here and it is so good!! Definitely saving this as a favorite place! 
1595,5,Positive,"My favorite place to get a burger from in the city. My orders are always correct, food is always delicious. This is definitely my go-to for a burger. "
1596,4,Negative,The tator tots were cold by the time they got to me. And they forget to give me ketchup for them.
1597,3,Positive,The food is good. The order was incomplete though.
1598,5,Positive,Good food .
1599,1,Negative,Burger was dry and tasteless. Delivery guy pretty much threw my food at my and was on his phone at the time of my delivery.  Wish I could take my tip back.  
1600,2,Negative,Food was not good the fries had no taste and they were premade patties
1601,5,Positive,"First time trying it, and it was delicious."
1602,5,Positive,Pretty yummy. Glad they were able to give me lettuce instead of buns :)
1603,5,Positive,The food was really good and the driver was a very nice person and he made sure that he gave me the right orde
1604,1,Negative,"The order took more than twice the estimate, and we were missing items. Food was cold."
1605,5,Positive,Food was hot and AMAZING. 
1606,4,Positive,yo this exceeded my expectations. got a sounders burger with cream cheese and it was fiiiiree. if they would've delivered it with the fries i ordered it'd be the burger in Seattle. will order again next sunday probably. Episcopalians represent! gave up delivery food for lent hollaaaa
1607,4,Positive,Pretty good. Shake was what I needed. I would order again. 👍🏻
1608,3,Negative,"First the driver acted like the order didn't come with a drink. Then it took him almost 5 minutes to bring the shake from his car. Food was cold. Put bacon on a burger that was requested to NOT PUT BACON ON BURGER, AND WRAP IT UP ON THE SIDE. 
Called twice now, and still nothing about a refund or delivering another burger without bacon. Will not order from here again. Burger could have been more flavorful, but wasn't. Shake was good, but the size of it was not worth 5 dollars. "
1609,5,Positive,The food was delicious and on time and the driver was very friendly and helpful
1610,3,Positive,Fries should be a lot better.
1611,3,Neutral,"Restaurant called and said the food was ready but the driver was late.
Fries were not hot any longer."
1612,3,Negative,The food was great but the driver was rude at the hotel. To the point that hotel staff asked him to leave before I even got down there to pick up my food.
1613,3,Negative,Food is great. Delivery driver left food in a random room at my office and told no one. I found it 30 minutes after it was supposed to be delivered.
1614,1,Negative,If 0 stars is an option I would choose that. My first time using it his company and I watched my driver go back and forth across town for an hour with my food and never called. It would help if we could contact the driver.  This has been a waste of time and money. 
1615,4,Positive,"Ordered 2x Onion Rings, a Mariners, and a Mushroom and Swiss. Got our food a few minutes earlier than expected. Opened the door and there was my food.
Expected some half soggy and small portion of onion rings, but we got crisp warm onion rings that tasted rather good.
Mariners was pretty good, love avocados. Bun wasn't soggy and the burger wasn't dripping. Overall a tasty burger nothing fancy just simple and good.
The Mushroom and swiss was also very good. Simple and tasty, was not greasy and or falling apart.  Definitely our favorite of the 2.
Will order again, this trying something different."
1616,5,Positive,206 Burger is the bomb!
1617,5,Positive,Great spot for a no pretentiousness damn fine burger. Good ingredients. Cooked perfect and just the right amount of a little messy. 10/10

1624,3,Positive,Food is great delivery was questionable
1625,5,Positive,Will use again I think new favorite
1626,2,Negative,"I've had veggie burgers here twice. Once was great, the 2nd time was soggy and the ketchup and mustard I asked for were missing as was the avocado I paid for. Very dissappointing."
1627,4,Positive,Good burger and fries
1628,4,Positive,"Burgers were amazing! The parmesan fries werent very good due to temp but still, great experience!"
1629,5,Positive,Typical Hamburger place
1630,4,Positive,"Got the wrong kind of fries, but everything else was fantastic"
1631,5,Positive,"Amazing breakfast burger, amazing onion rings!"
1632,4,Positive,"Really good considering it was delivery, tots were still super crispy!"
1633,3,Negative,"The burger was spicy, it was supposed to be a cheeseburger. The onion rings were way too greasy.  Everything was just OK.  Probably won’t order from here again.  "
1634,3,Negative,"I walk by this restaurant every day-twice a day! And I had a late shift at the hospital, and didn't feel like cooking.
The onion rings were delicious. Crispy and light. 
The burger was tasteless. There was absolutely NO seasoning in anything. The meat was dry, and without ANY flavour. 
I was incredibly disappointed."
1635,1,Negative,"I am extremely disappointed with this order. I order through GrubHub for ease while I am at work. When the driver calls and calls, texting me, asking me to come to the car - I cannot. I then have to sit on the phone with customer service, TRYING to find my driver. I basically had to take my lunch to talk to customer service..... Will no longer be ordering from you"
1636,5,Positive,206 Burger Co is always enjoyable and has the best burgers in Seattle! 
1637,4,Positive,"Food was awesome, but the fries arrived cold"

1645,2,Neutral,I asked for extra napkins but did not get any and the Burger bun was burnt.
1646,3,Negative,"My food was late. My burger didn't have all of the ingredients, and I got the wrong milk shake. I would not order from here again"
1647,3,Negative,I was missing the french fries
1648,2,Neutral,Food was fine but cold. Part of the order didn'tarrive
1649,5,Positive,"Great burger, and the hand cut fries were on point. Would definitely order from again."
1650,3,Negative,"Food was late. We got it about an hour and 45 minutes after placing the order.  fries were cold/soggy. bun, lettuce, and tomato was all soggy. Upon reheating the food it was pretty good. Definitely would not order delivery again but I'd probably go back to eat at the restaurant."

1658,5,Positive,Its my favorite!
1659,2,Negative,Restaurant is fine. Delivery made no sense. Order was over on First Hill which was really close to our house. However driver picked up our order and then went all the way over to Queen Anne and then back to our neighborhood. Food was not even hot!
1660,4,Negative,You forgot my tater tots!

1669,5,Positive,Food was amazing and overall everything was very good
1670,4,Negative,I'd rate the food a 4/5. But everything was correct and on time. Tots need more seasoning.
1671,4,Neutral,"fries were soggy and not good. burgers were great! prices too high, but whatever-its seattle. driver was polite as well."
1672,1,Neutral,"The food never showed up, but someone marked it as delivered. GrubHub did refund the order fully, but I was still hungry."
1673,2,Negative,"Cold soggy sad bland fries, cold soggy bland sad grilled cheese. Driver and restaurant claimed they had called me 8+ times, but I never got a call from the driver until the GH rep wrote it down and gave it to them."
1674,5,Positive,Those are some awesome burgers.
1675,4,Neutral,It was pretty good but nothing special and more expensive for just a regular burger
1676,1,Negative,FIRST TIME CUSTOMER WHOS ORDER WAS NEVER DELIVERED!! I called to ask for it to be resent and was told no and that it was my fault. My card was charged for 30 dollars and I received NO FOOD!
1677,5,Positive,"Love this place, friendly people, great food, always get the order right...excellent"
1678,3,Positive,Arrived slightly warm. Only complaint. 
1679,3,Neutral,Food was good portions appropriate
1680,1,Negative,"Buns on both the burgers were absolute liquidy mush by the time they arrived. Im not sure the solution but here is a suggestion: Dont place hot burgers off a grill and put them between a bun then wrap them in foil if the burger will more than likely spend 20 mins en route. All they do is steam the bread which makes for a super disgusting soggy mess. Perhaps toast them and package them separately? Also, the 1000 Island dressing I ordered was missing. Fries were bland and soggy as well. Onion rings were ok. Sorry guys, just letting you all know. Thanks."
1681,2,Negative,Food came an hour and 20 minutes after I ordered it and everything was cold and soggy. 
1682,4,Positive,"Everything was great, but the portions are a little bit small for the price.   The burger was a better value than Woody's, but you don't get very many fries.    The shake was also smaller than I expected a $6 shake to be.  Delivery was fast and professional.   All of my items were correct."
1683,5,Positive,I always love 206 Burger food and you are a very good service. I particularly appreciate the coupons on the weekend.
1684,4,Positive,Sweet potato fries were awesome!  Regular fries could use a touch of salt or seasoning.
1685,3,Neutral,It was good but the food was cold.
1686,4,Positive,Good good.  Forgot ranch dressing
1687,3,Negative,"Food was decent, didnt get my tater tots and food was 15 mins late"
1688,5,Positive,Excellent from special allergy requests fulfilled and clearly marked through the nicest delivery person ever. Will definitely order again.
1689,3,Neutral,"Pretty good burger, (peanut butter) shake didn't taste that great"
1690,3,Negative,They did not give me my complete order.
1691,2,Negative,Food was cold. Nothing like child soggy fries and a cold burger.
1692,3,Negative,"Didn't add any sauce as requested, no napkins and wrong orders. Not happy."
1693,4,Positive,Cheese burger was good. Large drink good also
1694,4,Positive,Good food. Missing French fries. But still happy. Didn't need the extra carbs
1695,5,Positive,"I really like 206 Burger because it reminds me of burgers from my childhood. There are times when only an old-fashioned double cheeseburger will really make you feel better. On days when I'm trying not to overeat, I skip the tator tots. Otherwise, they are really good too."
1696,4,Positive,It was great
1697,2,Negative,"Bun was soggy, lettuce wilted, and the fries were cold. "
1698,5,Positive,Great Burgers and even better Tots
1699,2,Negative,It hard to give an accurate assessment due to the fact that it he food was cold.
1700,5,Positive,Great good great burgers
1701,4,Positive,Excellent. He was a few minutes late but not too bad.
1702,5,Positive,excellent burgers and service!
1703,1,Neutral,The meal was cold and thrown together.
1704,3,Negative,Burger was soggy when it got to me and they forgot my shake.
1705,4,Negative,I was high and needed a burger delivered post haste. It was. I ate it. I would eat another. I’m still high. 
1706,4,Negative,Food was great but fries were soggy. Punching holes in the paper bags can help prevent this. Order arrived 10 mins late. Otherwise it was great!
1707,4,Positive,"Love this place, it's a bit of a distance away though so sometimes my total arrive warm and not hot, not a deal breaker. Food is great!"
1708,5,Positive,Still a fan of 206 Burger. I order there all the time.
1709,5,Negative,I really like 206 Burger. I wish they would have even more items to choose from.
1710,1,Negative,"Food was an hour late, cold, and smashed. "
1711,1,Negative,"Order was late.  Tried to contact the restaurant twice, was hung up on both times.  When food arrived, it was cold.  "
1712,4,Positive,"First time giving 206 lower than 5 stars, ordered tots, got onion rings, not a huge deal but unfortunate, im not a huge fan of onion rings, however, these were better than most places so they have that going for them. Their food was good as always though. gotta love that."
1713,3,Negative,Food was cold but good after reheating. Value was ok. Not sure if I'd reorder. 
1714,3,Negative,"Food was totally tasty; however, fries were pretty cold. Biggest issue? It took 2 hours to get the food."
1715,5,Positive,Good burger at a good price. 
1716,1,Negative,driver told my employer he was from burger king. refused to give me my order when asked multiple times after chasing him down. didnt even want to roll down his window. my bun was not gluten free as requested but they did refund me so that was good. food was very cold.
1717,5,Positive,Fries & shake great!
1718,4,Negative,"Good milkshake, but an unremarkable burger. Too soggy to eat easily."
1719,5,Positive,Best burger in town
1720,1,Negative,everything was ice cold
1721,1,Negative,"Got wrong condiments on burger. Tater tots and fries spilled everywhere and soggy/ cold. Driver could not figure out basic gate despite directions. So, frustrating"
1722,1,Negative,"Over priced & over done.  Spent $35 on a burger w/ fries, onion rings, soda (I was hung-over) inc. a $6 delivery fee.  Fries didn't come with ketchup and were soggy (fine it's delivery) but no ketchup?  Onion rings were pretty good.  But my 206 burger was cooked medium/well and tasted not even half as good as a Red Robin burger; I actually would have preferred McDonalds in every respect.  206 Burger Co prolonged my suffering - had the meal been under $20, I probably wouldn't complain but this is a rip off.  Beware"
1723,3,Neutral,Burger and fries arrived cold. Don’t think in was the restaurant: was probably the route the good took to get to me. 
1724,2,Negative,Food was cold
1725,1,Negative,"wrong order and messy, grubhub failed to get my money back and they said they would call me when finished dealing with my issues and i never received a call back"
1726,4,Positive,It was good
1727,5,Positive,"206 Burger is one of my favorite places. I do seem to have trouble finding a place to add mustard to my burger on it. It was easy to order mayo with my tater tots, so I'll try again with the mustard. "
1728,4,Positive,"Good! Sometimes they forget part of the order, but overall I'd recommend. "
1729,2,Negative,The delivery was extremely late and by the time it arrived the burgers and fries were cold and the shakes were melted.
1730,5,Positive,"I love 206 Burger, It reminds me of my childhood. I love the double cheeseburger w/dark lettuce and the tater tots. I think it's great that they have delivery from the one in 1st Hill since I didn't have a great experience with the one on 3rd and Madison. The food is great at both places though."
1731,2,Negative,The food was not what it says it was supposed to be
1732,5,Positive,Best burgers on grub hub
1733,3,Negative,"I have to say, when I place an order for delivery, I don't expect to have to leave my apartment to get it.  If the driver can call my phone to tell me to come down, he can just as easily punch in the building code I give him and come up.  There's nothing between him and my door that can't be operated with an elbow, if it comes down to it."
1734,5,Positive,love this place. deliver to my work and ive always got a good experience with them
1735,3,Negative,Burger was cold and didn't taste fresh. Shake was delicious
1736,5,Positive,"The driver was actually here a bit earlier than expected. He was very nice. I really love 206 Burger's double cheeseburger, especially with tater tots. I also appreciate having a choice of how much I give for a tip since I'm on a fixed income and I have to give less at the end of the month. Yours is one of the most reliable services I've encountered so far."
1737,5,Positive,"I enjoyed the burger/fries/ and onions rings, everything was very tasty"
1738,4,Positive,"With a delivery fee plus tip, I'd prefer if they brought it directly up to the apartment using the call box rather than calling me on their cell from their car. But that's true of most food deliveries. 
206 Burger has become a consistently good choice when we want burgers. I'll definitely keep ordering from them. "
1739,5,Positive,"Delicious burgers, tots, onion rings, and shakes."
1740,2,Negative,"I would probably need to sit down and eat there, as a opposed to order delivery."
1741,2,Negative,"food was cold, undercooked, and virtually inedible.
"
1742,5,Positive,Excellent burgers and great fries.
1743,5,Positive,Now this is a great burger!
1744,5,Positive,I like it but I dont like someone who works there so I prefer delivery.
1745,4,Positive,"Food is always good, but would be so much better even warm."
1746,4,Negative,"I’m annoyed that I paid $4.25 for literally seven onion rings. Really?
Other than that, I’m good. "
1747,5,Positive,One of our favorites
1748,4,Positive,"This place is great! Highly recommend for an awesome burger and fries, and the chocolate shake was amazing!"
1749,1,Negative,"The grilled cheese was probably the worst out of the two things I ordered.. honestly it's rather hard to mess up such a simple item I truly mean that. The burger I ordered was definitely not using fresh anything really the tomato was off and so was everything else. The fries were alright much better that the rest of the food. And someone made a mistake on my order. But both the driver and the restaurant wanted to blame each other for the mistake.. so I'm left with either the driver and his girlfriend drank my soda or the restaurant didn't actually give it to her. I was reimbursed and plan on never eating here again. 

Seriously guys if you need to know how to properly make a grilled cheese sandwich or even just a burger I'll gladly teach your cooks."
1750,2,Negative,Grilled cheese was soggy. Tater tots were over cooked. They come loose and invariably end up rolling all over the place. They did manage to cook my son’s burger correctly for a change
1751,3,Positive,You should list out everything on your burgers also your fries are good
1752,3,Negative,"Food is okay not great. They always mess up directions for specific burgers and tater tots are not wrapped so they roll over the place and the dog has a field day. It happens again and again so it is really inexcusable, and I think I have reached the point that I will not order again. Our shakes did not arrive spilled last night
I suggest trying other burger spots. Nothing special beyond repeat errors here"
1753,4,Neutral,Excellent but pricey 
1754,2,Negative,Food was cold and no ketchup for cold fries
1755,3,Negative,Usually this place us great but the driver was so late the food was cold.
1756,5,Positive,It was good
1757,1,Negative,"Terrible. Tater tots left from last night. Ice cold, cardboard like. Burger was greasy. My tummy aches"
1758,2,Negative,"Asked for sauce on side, but they put it on sandwich.
Order was early. Almost wasn't home to meet it."
1759,2,Negative,I don't know where the error occurred in my order.
1760,3,Positive,"
first off, the food was awesome. 206 always does me right!!!


Your delivery drivers need to actually deliver to the correct address. I left VERY clear Delivery instructions and your driver STILL delivered to the wrong address... Luckily the person at the address they delivered to know me and brought it over to me. INSTRUCT YOUR DRIVERS TO ALWAYS READ THE DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS!!! if i didnt know the people next door my food could have been as good as gone. "
1761,5,Positive,Great food! Highly recommend it.
1762,2,Negative,"I have ordered from here before and had no problem today I was disappointed my burger is soggy on the bottom of the burger and the onion rings were over cooked to the point of where there was no detectable onions in the ring. 

The driver was professional!"
1763,5,Positive,Excellent burger! I will definitely order from there again
1764,3,Negative,Kind of pricey for the product. But that may be because of all the fees 
1765,1,Negative,Food was cold and soggy
1766,1,Negative,The meal delivered was stone cold. :(
1767,3,Negative,"Like others have said, the food arrived cold."
1768,1,Negative,Driver refused to deliver to door.
1769,3,Negative,My shakes were melted and the food was cold
1770,1,Positive,"Waiting for customer support to deliver an adequate response
Waiting..."
1771,5,Positive,"The order was not on time, it was EARLY! The food was delicious and I really appreciated how fast they were. Est time was 40-50 minutes and it only took 30 minutes to get my food ♡ The burger was sooooo juicy and the flavors they use in their sauce pair so nicely with the burger."
1772,4,Positive,Was a bit too pricy for me but overall pretty good food And super quick delivery.
1773,5,Positive,"Quick service, good food"
1774,5,Positive,Fast service and good food despite being busy lunch hour!
1775,3,Negative,I ordered 2 veggie 206 burgers and 2 oreo shakes. I only recived one my my skakes.
1776,3,Neutral,I order only onions and 206 put lettuce on my burger
1777,3,Negative,"Good food, but the food was lukewarm when delivered."
1778,4,Neutral,I’ll let you know on the next order
1779,1,Negative,My tater tots were tasteless and cold and hard. My burger still pink on cheeseburger and bacon was off colored. Parmesan garlic fries a no show. Want refunded for them.
1780,5,Positive,Bacon cheeseburger got a thumbs up from my son.  My daughter loved the fries.
1781,3,Neutral,Food wasn't very warm but otherwise was good
1782,3,Neutral,"The food, though good, was fairly cold when it arrived.  It would be better if the food cooking was timed closer to the time it is scheduled to be picked up..."
1783,3,Positive,Fries cold but burger well. Would have loved some ketchup
1784,5,Neutral,This restaurant was the bomb diggity
1785,4,Negative,The food should be packaged better. Both the union rings and the tots were open in a bag and ended up being mixed through each other
1786,5,Positive,Love this place 
1787,5,Positive,"Amazing food as always, their veggie patties are kind of a quinoa/cornbread consistency, shakes are thick and delicious =)"
1788,0,Positive,"I really enjoyed my delivery experience, very efficient and the food was still warm and good. The delivery guy was great but I just wish the burger had more cheese. Otherwise great!"
1789,5,Positive,Loved the customer service
1790,5,Positive,Fast and delicious
1791,4,Positive,Fair food not the best I've ever had a little pricey but got it quick and hot. Not something I would order again 
1792,4,Positive,"My only complaint was the food was luke warm at best, other than that,  it was correct and on time."
1793,5,Negative,"Dang, that was tasty. 
...a little spendy for a burger.
But dang, that was tasty. :)"
1794,4,Negative,I did not receive my bottled water that I was charged for
1795,1,Negative,The restaurant was fine. The delivery sucked
1796,5,Positive,"That wonderful all beef and cheddar melt in your mouth flavor, customized burger, add pineapple, avacado, even cream cheese and jam."
1797,5,Positive,"Excellent milk shake, arrived thick and tasty."
1798,1,Negative,I never received my order!!!!!!
1799,5,Positive,Food was excellent
1800,5,Positive,Nice alternative to burger night.
1801,5,Neutral,Did NOT disappoint! The food was delicious! That Byrek.. so damn good. And the turkey sandwich? Yum! 
1802,5,Positive,Byrek and Baguette did Not disappoint! This food is damn delicious!
1803,5,Positive,This place never fails. So good!!! 
1804,5,Positive,They are affordable and fast
1805,2,Negative,"When I ordered two orders of Key Lime Pie, I thought I was getting at least two slices of pie.  Instead, I got two tiny cupcakes that were dry and just not good.  The other items I ordered were lukewarm and really greasy."
1806,5,Positive,I like to order ahead a few meals. I ask restaurant not to heat my sandwich & they'll send in parts so I can construct & warm up later myself. This works best with the pulled beef &  pork sandwiches. I'm also addicted to their chicken soup which comes with thin slices of baguette toast.
1807,5,Positive,"10 stars to driver!!! Restaurant forgot item, I said I would call & get credit but he ran back & got item for me. This was especially thoughtful.👍👏"
1808,5,Positive,Excellent every time!
1809,5,Positive,Friendly owners! Great food! Excellent service! Definitely eating here again!
1810,5,Positive,Great food and service
1811,3,Positive,"Byrek & baguette is an old love of mine. Their chicken apple salad and their ham and apricot baguette and just the bees knees (as long as they respect my ""no onions"" request) fresh, fast, healthy, what more could you want"
1812,5,Positive,"Delicious food. Arrived super quickly. Order was all correct. Didn't include utensils or napkins which was a problem, but the food was amazing."
1813,5,Positive,"I got the beef sandwich, and it was awesome.    Best sandwich I've had in a long time."
1814,5,Positive,Delicious lentil soup and chicken salad
1815,5,Positive,"Asked food be delivered cold for reheat later. They packaged each sandwich component separately so it will be easy to construct a fresh, hot sandwich when ready. Chai latte, breakfast scramble delish."
1816,5,Positive,"Excellent food, ready quickly."
1817,5,Positive,Pork very flavorful. Generous potions. Sandwich could easily feed 2 if you added small order of fries.
1818,5,Positive,My second time ordering. Their food is fresh and delicious and arrived hot both times. I will definitely order again.
1819,5,Positive,Fresh and scrumptious!
1820,5,Positive,"Amazing food, amazing staff!"
1821,5,Positive,"The chicken soup arrived boiling hot, jam packed with chicken & veggies in a flavorful herby broth. It was also accompanied by two little buttered toasts. Perfect for an Autumn day."
1822,5,Positive,Taste great. The food is always great. I haven't had anything I didn't like.
1823,5,Positive,Delicious and will order from them again!
1824,5,Positive,One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time!
1825,5,Positive,"The salad was large & a variety of lettuces with all the fixings as described, dressing on side. Perfect. The best was the cafe mocha made with real! chocolate. So yummy saving for desert. The byrek looks delicious but will have to wait for later. This restaurant always does good!"
1826,5,Positive,"My go to (too often). Use them when I need eggs & I'm out. Veggie scramble is my usual (healthy) choice but the scramble with ham was very good too (""meaty""). In fact for carnivores all meat options from beef byrek to the pork sandwich are great."
1827,5,Positive,"Fresh food, delicious coffees. Will be back again and again!"
1828,2,Negative,It took 45 minutes for a 10 minute drive so the food arrived cold 
1829,5,Positive,The food was excellent and delivery was on point.  The restaurant delivered on what was advertised!
1830,5,Positive,"FANTASTIC! The bacon breakfast sandwich was savory, and the macchiato & amaretto coffees were BOMB! SOOO Good!!!!"
1831,2,Positive,It was great but order was 1.25 hours late
1832,5,Positive,"Wow food was amazing I will definitely order from here again! 2 of us shared the beet salad, avocado baguette combo with lentil soup and we still have a few bites leftover for a snack! Sooo good. The 3 cheese byrek was delicious but a little soggy so going to toss it under the broiler later, I’m sure it will perk right up! "
1833,4,Neutral,Nice portion of eggs with lots of fresh veggies and accompanied by 4 nice slices of homemade bread. The byrek was a good size and very meaty.
1834,5,Positive,"I've never had a Byrek before and the meat filled I received was delicious. Arrived warm with a generous portion of yogurt (?) dip. The veggie scramble with potatoes was a moderate portion, good fresh veggies and topped with lovely avocado slices. Came with a side of 4 small pieces of sourdough toast."
1835,5,Positive,"Food was colorful, tasty, nutritious. Hooray for yum cakes with strawberries & blueberries. Lifted my mood"
1836,5,Positive,Food was tasty and the coffee was good. I'm happy with my choice
1837,5,Positive,Food was excellent and the entire menu was available unlike on other delivery apps. 
1838,1,Negative,"Food came ice cold and all soggy like it s sitting in the box for 2 hours late it came.

Byrek and baguette are great. My driver was terrible."
1839,5,Positive,"Great food. Salad was fresh, with high quality ingredients. Only challenge comes from ordering a cold dish with a hot one, the byrek. It was tasty but a little cold when it arrived. This delicate item is not the easiest to maintain over delivery. Still, I would order both items again."
1840,5,Positive,"Love Byrek! Great food, the best fries"
1841,4,Negative,"Restaurant was great, driver didn't follow the instructions to leave the food in the lobby and wanted us to get it from him directly"
1842,5,Positive,"Everything was delicious, fresh salads and sandwiches, good soup, byreks were flaky and tasty."
1843,3,Positive,The food was great
1844,5,Positive,(1/2)Great place to order team lunch - although one menu item (eggplant arugula salad) was slightly different on the GrubHub menu than the one on the board in
1845,5,Neutral,"Food was good, customer service was great"
1846,5,Positive,Great service. Delicious food. Will definitely order from them again.
1847,1,Negative,"There was a missing item in my order. I tried calling their phone number, but no one picked after trying for an hour to call them. "
1848,5,Positive,Food is always great!
1849,5,Positive,A delicious meal. Will order again 😉
1850,4,Negative,"I asked soy sauce and sweet & sour sauce on the side, I did not received it on my delivery order."
1851,5,Positive,Delicious and inexpensive dim sum with quick service
1852,5,Negative,It's my go-to for dim sum
1853,5,Positive,amazing dim sum! came warm and portions are large
1854,4,Negative,The steamed pork buns could use more filling with them. It really isn’t a lot or maybe add a sauce container with the filling sauce to Mack up for the amount of dough received.
1855,5,Neutral,Always my go to dimsum place
1856,5,Positive,Excellent dim sum!
1857,5,Positive,Every dish I ordered was delicious! I would definitely order from this restaurant again.
1858,5,Positive,Love it. 3rd time we've ordered
1859,4,Negative,Food was good as always. Just feels like our chicken feet order had wayyyy less than the last time we ordered despite ordering the same amount (orders). And the food was cold although we know we cant blame the restaurant for that. Despite all of this we will be ordering again.
1860,2,Negative,Some of the food was bland.
1861,5,Positive,Food was good!
1862,1,Negative,"The food was undercooked, and very late, an interesting combination. Not really edible. Ordered at 1437, did not arrive till 1550. Supposed to be 20 to 30 m. Totally soaked, doughy (i know bao texturr"
1863,1,Negative,Not good. During pick-up they insist of looking at the online order details before releasing the food even though i gave them the name of the person who ordered which was written on the order bags and theirs order list
1864,5,Positive,Food was excellent and fast delivery. 
1865,1,Negative,I totally DISAPPOINTED grubhub. I'm canceling GH+ member ship 
1866,5,Positive,It was good
1867,5,Positive,"The dim sum is delicious.  Love the shrimp dumplings, pork buns, spare ribs, and shumai"
1868,1,Negative,Burnt my food. Buns way too doughy
1869,4,Negative,Great delivery very fast. Though with the restaurant they get it right not every time . All items are included but the freshness is to watch for especially rice dishes and pastries as those can be dried and stale especially close to end of the day 
1870,5,Positive,This food was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely order again! 
1871,5,Positive,Always warm and delicious when it arrives
1872,5,Positive,Really good food - thank you
1873,5,Positive,"Food was good, arrived hot and modifications were accommodated."
1874,4,Negative,"Good food, well packaged, really late. The driver had to wait for 30+ min"
1875,1,Positive,The restaurant was great
1876,2,Neutral,"They need to have picture of all
their dishes on the menu so you know exactly what you're ordering."
1877,5,Positive,Food is fantastic!!!
1878,5,Positive,"This place offers the perfect dim sum comfort food. I am so relieved they exist! My favorite is their pork shumai, shrimp dumpling, and barbecue pork bun."
1879,5,Positive,We found Homestyle Dim Sum during lock down and are so glad we did. Food is always fresh and delicious. Everything we've tried has been great. Hope to dine in some day. 
1880,3,Positive,"Restaurant very good but delivery very slow, an hour from leaving the restaurant"
1881,5,Positive,Good portion and delicious
1882,5,Negative,The food was what I expected it to be. Haven't been to the location in person but plan to. Will definitely order from them again
1883,5,Positive,Food was great!
1884,2,Negative,The food was quality but totally the wrong order. No easy way to fix that. 
1885,4,Positive,"Food was great. Only issue I had was I only received 3 of my 4 chive & cilantro dumplings. Which was a bummer cause I got them hoping to share with my family. 
"
1886,5,Positive,"Delicious dumplings, highly recommended"
1887,4,Positive,"Pretty good.  Chicken wings very overpriced.  Meat underfilled in dumplings, they're clearly trying to boost $, but flavors good."
1888,5,Positive,"Great food, order was ready when I get there, would order again"
1889,4,Positive,"The Hong Kong style milk tea and the beef stomach is not for me.  The rice roll is good, it was I expected.  The custard bun was messy because of the size but I like it.  If you want to be unhealthy instead of beef stomach I would go for the chicken feet, this was the place I tried this for the first time, just skin and bones as expected.  Pork and century egg congee is the same as other places."
1890,5,Negative,Delivery time went from an one hour estimate to less than 30 mins. Driver was able to get here quickly and food was hot. Respected contact free delivery as asked. 
1891,5,Positive,"Delicious! And I'm soooo grateful they were open so early and that the driver was around to pick up! Will definitely order again. Since pandemic, I haven't been able to have dim sum , so this really made my day. Thank you so much!!!"
1892,4,Neutral,Food was cold
1893,5,Positive,"My first time ordering takeout dim sum, and I was not disappointed. I ordered enough to make 3 meals out of it- which was easy to do, since everything was so delicious! "
1894,5,Positive,Always hits the spot when craving for dim sum
1895,1,Positive,"Food was poorly packaged and spilled in transit. While the food tasted fine, the portion size is much smaller than Jade Garden’s. I will be ordering from Jade Garden moving forward to get my $/portion size value."
1896,3,Neutral,foods arrived cold
1897,5,Negative,Small thing:  Fried dumplings with pork filling (so savory!) should be packaged in plastic not a paper bag.
1898,5,Positive,Everything was very good! 
1899,1,Negative,"Never got my order. Driver left at wrong house. Called GH asking for a refund & was offered GH credits. GH rep kept saying “I missed my delivery”. What does that even mean? Delivery was supposed to be left at door, so that doesn’t even make sense. Lol. Refused to give me full refund on my card until I asked to speak to someone else. Didn’t like getting blamed for “missing my delivery” when it was an error on the driver’s end. "
1900,4,Positive,Food was alright but not great. A bit on the greasy side. Portions are big and well packaged.
1901,4,Neutral,The food was giod
1902,4,Neutral,Slow delivery word
1903,5,Positive,Very good food
1904,5,Positive,Arrived warm and delicious
1905,5,Positive,So so good!!!
1906,5,Positive,The rice dish is my favorite. Tates very good and still warm when it delivered. 
1907,4,Positive,Good dim sum.
1908,5,Positive,Great dim sum. The sticky rice in lotus leaf is especially good (it contains chicken and sweet Chinese sausage). The stir fry noodles are of the skinny type.
1909,4,Positive,Very good. Food came fresh and hot.
1910,4,Positive,I actually got all the food I ordered and still warm! This definitely satisfied my dim sum craving
1911,2,Negative,Some food was undercooked. Was missing one of the dishes in the order.
1912,1,Neutral,Food came cold and almost 2 hours after ordering (1:15 min later then stated) .
1913,5,Neutral,"Portions are large, food was hot and tasty."
1914,1,Negative,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HOMESTYLE DIM SUM. I ordered over $30 of food, and all the items were missing  with the exception of a single bun.  The driver drove 6 miles to deliver me a single bun!  Homestyle Dim Sum is cheating people out of their money and scamming grubhub customer. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM."
1915,1,Negative,"It was the worst order I ever had. The food itself is decent, however the order couldn’t be too wrong. Basically, they forgot and misprepared for more than 10 dollars of my order. I ordered one hot yuanyang and an iced milk tea, however they gave me too hot drinks. Also they missed the chicken feet and several buns. Please read this review before ordering, don’t order anything from them or at least check your order is correct before you picking it up. One more thing, the restaurant number is a fake one, you will never get through it."
1916,2,Neutral,Food arrived cold.
1917,2,Negative,Only half the ordered items actually came. Went through a very long process with Customer support to fix. Absolutely terrible 
1918,4,Negative,"Cockroach found in fried rice, stay away at all costs unless you’re in to insects in your food."
1919,5,Positive,I like the food
1920,1,Negative,"Restaurants need to describe the dishes on their menus.  I ordered a cilantro steamed dumpling and discovered it had shrimp in it.  Another order also had shrimp that was not mentioned on the menu.  Since I have a shellfish allergy, both orders went into the compost.  A third item was left out of my order.  What should have been a meal for three turned out not to be enough for two.  "
1921,3,Negative,Order was missing the chive dumplings
1922,4,Positive,"It is ok, I will have to visit in person."
1923,5,Positive,Best Dim Sum delivery so far.  I've ordered from 5 different restaurants.  This was by far the very best. And it arrived warm. So good!
1924,3,Negative,"Ok, we know that a Nanaimo bar should be kept cold, right? So I don’t appreciate having my Nanaimo bar being packaged with my latte!!!! Please, DON’T!!!! "
1925,5,Positive,Love this restaurant. Best caprese sandwich I have had in years.
1926,1,Negative,"Asked to see my order on the app (very rare that happens) and then questioned the authenticity of my order because it didn't have my name on it....?  Had to show the lady my id to even pickup my order, and no other customers were ordering. Rather not go back to be profiled and questioned like that."
1927,5,Positive,"Cream of tomato soup with herbs, very flavorful, latte hot & frothy. Appreciate they double wrap & seal their orders & use biodegradable bags which I can reuse."
1928,5,Neutral,"Completely amazing!!! I will order again, the first time was great!!! The restaurant sent me a message saying that they had to cancel because they had “a delivery issue,” I didn’t and still don’t know what it was but I thought I would try again a short time later, like 1/2 hour, and there was no problem. And the food was very delicious. Thank you very much. "
1929,5,Positive,"Delicate, flavorful pastries, hot & strong mocha. My delivery person was ""repeat"" & she always does an excellent job!"
1930,3,Positive,The restaurant is wonderful
1931,3,Negative,Ordered cake slice and got tiny cups of whatever that is. It’s not a slice or equivalent. 
1932,3,Negative,2nd time ordering from here...not great
1933,4,Positive,Good cake slices!
1934,2,Negative,"No, I did not receive the pink champagne cake that I had ordered.  It was substituted with another flavor.  It was for my daughters birthday and I placed the order from Ohio.  Disappointed that we didn't get what was expected.  I tried to reach them and can not get through."
1935,5,Positive,"Today's vegetarian frittata was loaded with veggies, eggs, feta, potatoes & perfectly seasoned. Delicious! Entire order arrived hot & carefully packaged. They always double bag for safety."
1936,5,Positive,Some of the best snickerdoodles ever!
1937,5,Positive,Love the restaurant
1938,3,Positive,"The bacon breakfast sammy is really good, but also too expensive.  I didn't think much of the turkey croissant."
1939,5,Positive,Some of the very best cookies in Seattle - try the snickerdoodle!
1940,4,Positive,"I walk past this place 3-4 times a week and have been fascinated with what I see, as I quickly glance, in passing, through the window. Memories of the years I lived in Europe, enjoying the cafe scene, are triggered from perusal of the cakes, cookies, pastries, sandwiches, and coffees. Alas, I ordered cake, crossaints, and coffee. For a brief moment, I returned, through these gastronomical delights, to my favorite European cafe. Merci, Sugar Bakery & Cafe!"
1941,3,Negative,My order was almost an hour late and the slice of cake was small for the price. 
1942,5,Positive,"The cake was really what I was in it for and it was good but that's about all I have to say. The croissants though were amaaaazing. The havarti was so good, and the plain was fresh and flaky!"
1943,5,Positive,"They are really good, excellent in fact!"
1944,5,Positive,The food was yummy!!!
1945,5,Positive,Great staff & great driver
1946,5,Positive,This bakery is amazing. Do yourself a favor and order the bulk snickerdoodles for the freezer. They cook to perfection. 
1947,5,Positive,Yummy desserts and always carefully packaged for delivery. 
1948,1,Negative,"I ordered champagne cake, chocolate cake, vanilla cake. I gave alternates in case they were out (per the instructions on their order site). I did not get my first, second or third choices - they delivered three slices of carrot cake (not a choice I picked) with nuts, and a post it that said “sorry we were out of your order” so it was intentional (not a mistake), but they did not call me to verify, to discuss preferences, or to acknowledge that they could not fulfill my order. I do not like carrot cake, and I find this terrible customer service. I do not think it unreasonable to expect to get what I ordered, especially when it isn’t cheap!

And imagine if I had a nut allergy!

Grubhub gave me a full refund, for which I am grateful. But I will never order from this bakery again."
1949,5,Positive,I'm always happy with this place!
1950,3,Negative,The price per slice based on portion size was lacking. If the cake was exceptional then that wouldn’t bother me but it was disappointing as the cake was super dry. I did love the frosting. It has a very subtle sweetness unlike what you’d get at a grocery store. Should our slices have been fresh then I’m sure it would have been better. Also I ordered a sandwich which was canceled for an unknown reason which sucked. 
1951,5,Positive,Great muffins!! I will definitely order from them again.
1952,5,Positive,The most delicious cake I've had in Seattle! Excellent service and the absolute best desserts.
1953,5,Positive,Cakes was amazing! 
1954,5,Positive,"We bought three different slices of cake from Sugar for my mom's birthday (the chocolate fudge, the pink champagne, and the cheesecake). All three cakes were fresh and extremely tasty. The cheesecake was especially good!! Would recommend!!!"
1955,5,Positive,I used to work near Sugar Bakery and the food was just as good as I remember! Can't wait to order again 😀
1956,5,Positive,"Amazing bakery, excellent service"
1957,5,Positive,"Veg and potato quiche was delicious, and turkey havarti sandwich good. I pre-ordered the food, and it came exactly on time. Will order again! "
1958,5,Positive,Awesome cake and cookies!
1959,3,Neutral,Cake slices were a bit smaller for the prices. But tasted pretty good. 
1960,4,Positive,Too much frosting but great cake
1961,5,Positive,They doubled wrapped the food so it arrived hot and delicious! I appreciated the extra effort. 
1962,2,Negative,"I placed my order before heading over to the bakery. I thought it would expedite my morning but there was no point in ordering ahead of time. I waited for about 20 minutes, ended up missing an important meeting. Also, the Grubhub prices are 1-2$ per item higher than the actual menu (just an FYI)"
1963,1,Positive,"Very very sweet and buttery. 
Almost un eatable. "
1964,2,Negative,Tried to contact customer service for grub hun because the entire drink was spilled all over the bag & undrinkable. Order was late by around 40min. 
1965,5,Positive,It was niceeeee! 
1966,5,Positive,It was goooooood ! 
1967,5,Positive,It was good !! 
1968,4,Positive,"Sweets good, Caprese sandwich was nothing but bread"
1969,5,Positive,This Bacon Breakfast Sammy is AMAZING. Best I've had in a very long time. 
1970,2,Negative,My latte was did not have the correct amount of extra shots. Basically just hemp milk
1971,5,Positive,"Food was hot and delicious, packaged neatly (even if a little over-packaged), and I was really happy to see that they use compostable plastic bags."
1972,5,Positive,Fabulous! Portions a little small
1973,3,Negative,"Food was good but EXTREMELY overpriced, especially the lemon slice. I expected something much larger, twice the size of what I got, based on the price. I've literally never seen a lemon slice cost that much, anywhere in Seattle, and it was smaller than any other I've had. Total ripoff."
1974,4,Positive,I like it.
1975,5,Positive,"100% happy with order!  This was my first time ordering with Sugar Bakery, but definitely not my last.
Soon after I placed my order I got a call from Alex saying they were out of one of the items I ordered and asking if I maybe wanted something else instead.  I was impressed with his thoughtful customer service even before I received my order!  The Lemon cake was very good. Very rich and decadent.  I wish I had ordered more than one of the Cheesecake bites, best Cheesecake I have ever had! Reminded me of my mother’s.  And oh my goodness, the Lemon Cookies!  How they managed to bake them so soft and chewy on the inside yet crunchy on the outside I don’t know, but they were delicious! My next order I will order extra to freeze.  Excellent Bakery."
1976,5,Positive,I tried the veggie breakfast sammie and very flavorful 38th lots of veggies & herbs
1977,5,Positive,AMAZING. The staff is so incredible. Sean/Shawn was super helpful and overall I am so extremely satisfied with this bakery. 10/10 would buy again.
1978,5,Positive,"In Wichita Ks looking for a next day cookie delivery to friend in Seattle.  Found your site, cookies looked delicious and Grubhub delivery offered so just what I needed.  Delivered on time - thanks!!"
1979,5,Positive,"They called me when out of an item to provide alternatives, the scone was flavorable & tender, coffee strong but smooth."
1980,1,Negative,"For $10 I got half of a small sandwich size piece of cake.  And the cookies smelt like it was burnt, but wasn't. And was too expensive for a small amount. "
1981,5,Positive,Good was flavorable and croissants flaky.
1982,4,Positive,It was fantastic. I will definitely order from Sugar again. The driver left my delivery at the wrong house though
1983,5,Positive,The driver was very courteous and polite making sure that there was no contact.  The dessert was amazing!
1984,1,Positive,"I ordered an entire cake to be delivered for my best friend during the shelter in place. Cake was confirmed at 1pm on the day of delivery, and when it was delivered (late) it was a single piece of cake. For $68. Grubhub was great about making it right but I’m incredibly frustrated by the entire process, especially after the confirmation of the order."
1985,5,Positive,"My sandwich was still hot & yummy (chicken, cheese & cranberry sauce)! Rest of order looks good but for tomorrow. :"
1986,5,Positive,Food was so delicious and the driver did a good job too. I got the food late but this is understandable given the circumstances
1987,5,Positive,"Great jam scones!
"
1988,3,Negative,"The cake delivered wasn't what I ordered. Maybe they were simply out that morning, but I expected a call or at least notification, though ideally they should've given me a choice for an alternative. This delivery was a gift for a friend. I ordered the strawberry champagne cake but instead she got a chocolate one, and she doesn't like chocolate that much :( so my kind gesture was disappointing for everyone and made me look like I forgot what food she likes. "
1989,4,Negative,Great food! I appreciate that the drink was still hot. Too bad it was 30 minutes late
1990,5,Positive,So far everything is great!  Having a quarantine birthday celebration!
1991,5,Positive,The driver was very prompt and followed the directions for arrival
1992,4,Positive,"we got the wrong cake, but we still ate it and it was delicious! i also like that they use compostable bags for delivery. that alone makes me want to keep coming back"
1993,3,Positive,"Their location is very close to my friend. Not sure why it wasn't delivered more quickly.  I should have included a second choice for the flavor of cake. It was a nice looking piece of cake, but not the flavor he would like.  If they would have sent carrot cake like I ordered, it would have been a home run."
1994,5,Positive,I've been a fan of Sugar Bakery under both ownerships and wish them the best of luck in this trying time.
1995,5,Positive,"Very good, nice for a quick birthday option"
1996,4,Positive,Ordered birthday dessert to be delivered to my son. Cookie was supposed to have Happy Birthday written on it. The picture showed a decorated cookie. It was not decorated. But he said the desserts looked delicious.
1997,5,Positive,"Fantastic baked goods, and absolutely amazing Nanaimo bars!"
1998,5,Positive,It was good
1999,4,Positive,I ordered a bacon egg breakfast sandwich.  I received a turkey blt on a ciabatta. 
2000,2,Neutral,They did not include sugar in their tea as I asked
2001,1,Negative,Over half of my order wasn’t available and I wasn’t refunded
2002,5,Positive,Appreciated their attention to detail and personalization!
2003,1,Negative,"I ordered a jam scone on 11/16 and my order was cancelled due to them being sold out. Bummer. Ordered because the first order provides a 25% discount.

Made the same order today, offered no discount because this wasn't my ""first order."" Ordered a jam scone but got a punkin treat instead, no jam, not a scone.

Disappointing. The staff looked flustered, perhaps they are new? "
2004,1,Negative,Terrible delivery experience. Half of my order for not show up and the driver insisted they did not receive it from the restaurant. Tried calling the restaurant several times but no response and it's just mind boggling how someone could forget half of a customer's ordered items especially when the total amount is obviously much higher than the 1 bag they actually sent could contain!
2005,3,Negative,"Overpriced and the delivery person made me come downstairs in my bldg, wish defeats the purpose of delivery"
2006,5,Positive,Really good cakes. Ordered it my husband's birthday and he loved it.
2007,2,Neutral,"Great food but I was forced to meet driver at curb
That is why I pay for grub hub not uber
Very disappointed"
2008,4,Positive,It was good very Gourmet... I love the sugar cookies
2009,4,Neutral,Jam scones are terrific!
2010,4,Positive,It's quite a mark up. But I get it.
2011,1,Negative,Restaurant was good. Delivery very poor
2012,1,Negative,"I ordered a medium iced latte and it was very small. When I asked, they said that their medium is actually a small because they don’t have medium-sized cups. They also forgot to include the breakfast sandwich we ordered. Won’t be ordering again. "
2013,1,Negative,The order has not been delivered.
2014,4,Positive,nice that they had cake
2015,1,Negative,Wrong food was dropped off. Food is expensive and it’s frustrating when orders are delivered incorrectly.
2016,4,Positive,It was a bakery. Ordered some birthday treats for my kids to our hotel. It was delicious..what we got..missed one item in our order & prices were more expensive than online menu we looked at. But we are still happy to have had the treat brought to us!!
2017,5,Positive,"I order from Sugar all the time and have never had anything bad, ever! They're always fast and friendly; the one time they called and didn't have what I had ordered, they gave me a free cookie as consultation. Love this place. "
2018,3,Negative,Took a really long time to.get food that was already cooked and prepared. 
2019,5,Positive,"The food was good and the delivery guy was polite and careful with my order, I ordered a coffee and he made sure it didn’t spill and the cake was still in it’s original state. Great job!!! Thank you!"
2020,5,Positive,They did an amazing job sending delicious desserts to my best friend. My friend loved all the cookies and cakes and would eat them again in a heart beat :-)
2021,5,Positive,It has great cakes
2022,5,Positive,Great food!! Everything was delicious.
2023,5,Positive,"Food is delicious, portions are nice"
2024,5,Positive,Great cake and delivery service.
2025,1,Negative,"I ordered four simple things: an Americano with an extra shot and creamer, two bacon breakfast sandwiches and a lemon cake. The coffee was 3/4 full (obviously spilled) without creamer (not sure if it had the extra shot), I received one bacon sandwich and one veggie sandwich (both cold) and the lemon pound cake was so burnt that the dog even balked at eating it. Very poorly done."
2026,3,Positive,The cake is dry and doesn't seem fresh. The sandwich and turkey pastry were very good. They missed my order completely the first attempt but the customer service was very good and I got my correct order the 2nd go around
2027,5,Positive,Loved the chicken salad sandwich!
2028,2,Negative,order was kind of rude over the phone. At the e
2029,5,Positive,It was very good
2030,5,Positive,"Will tell my friend, good"
2031,4,Positive,"I ordered a variety of items from this bakery. The cheesecake, croissant and Nanaimo bars were extremely yummy. The other items were okay (Almond Tart, Lemon Tart and two varieties of cookies). The coconut macaroon cookie was dry."
2032,2,Negative,"Ordet delayed twice, ordered at 9 am, food arrived at 10:40.  Plus i asked  for splwnda and creamer for 2 coffees, i received one creamer.  Not go9d at all"
2033,5,Positive,Love the lemon polenta cake!
2034,5,Positive,"Good cakes and pastries. Prompt delivery, everything well packaged"
2035,1,Negative,"I had my heart set on the jam scone. I didnt want to just order one thing so I also ordered a crossiant. 

Instead of the jam scone, I got a meh pumpkin scone with too much spice. I would have wanted my order canceled if they were out of the jam scone, not just a substitution without checking with me.

Disappointing."
2036,2,Negative,Half of the pastries were not that good. And my coffee was good but it was lukewarm
2037,5,Positive,"Really good, fresh and delicious"
2038,4,Negative,"Driver didn't pick up part of my order. Called him and he was clueless so had to call the bakery. The bakery staff was extremely polite and helpful, and what we got was delicious so it wasn't a total drag. Just annoyed that the driver did not pay attention to our order and we tipped them 20% beforehand."
2039,5,Positive,A pleasure to deal with Sugar Bakery.
2040,5,Neutral,The food and deserts were delicious.
2041,5,Negative,Oh man!!!! I got the burnt sugar cake and a cookie... both were FANTASTIC! It was so good I considered moving to Seattle 
2042,2,Negative,"Iced coffee not very good.  Delivery person was pleasant and order was correct.  He didn't come to the door, though.  I had to go outside to meet him.  Not what I pay delivery for."
2043,5,Positive,"This place is the best!!!
"
2044,5,Positive,Love Sugar Bakery! Excellent baked goods and great drinks!
2045,4,Negative,Not suitable for eat24.
2046,5,Positive,Love it will reorder
2047,5,Positive,It was sent as a gift but the person who received it was very pleased. 
2048,1,Negative,"Picture and description of item was of entire carrot cake, not a single small slice of carrot cake. Driver showed up and says he could not park and to meet him outside, even though there is a 3 minute loading and unloading zone that was empty. Disappointed."
2049,5,Neutral,The delivery driver was the best!!
2050,4,Negative,"Delivery was insanely fast. We love the quiche but we were perplexed to find all of the quiche with cold spots, and one was entirely cold. It's typically piping hot so we don't know what happened as the driver arrived faster than anticipated."
2051,3,Negative,"Mixed feelings about this. Deceptive pricing on the bakery's end that took a great deal of time to resolve ourselves-- they tried to charge sales tax on sweet baked goods (which are exempt under Washington state law) and pocket the difference. We felt this was an unethical business practice.

On the other hand, the cake itself was very well done and my partner enjoyed the product, so I had a mixed experience with this vendor."
2052,1,Neutral,Order was incorrect. I ordered a lavender soda and a scone but I got a coffee and sandwich?
2053,4,Positive,"Very, very good food. Customer service and delivery service fantastic. Although would be nice if Sugar Bakery kept their menu in stock since we’ve tried to order the crepe cake a couple times with no success, and it seems only certain flavors of cakes are made regularly. Very delicious nonetheless. "
2054,5,Positive,The food is always great!!  I had a mocha and ham n cheese croissant along with a slice of cake.  The real full meal deal!!  Not the first time and won't be the last!
2055,5,Positive,"Exactly as advertised. Pastries were perfectly delicate, flakey, and crisp. Right amount of sweetness. Still warm enough to enjoy as is."
2056,5,Positive,"Everything was so good and packaged so carefully in the bag, I loved it."
2057,2,Negative,Grub Hub customer service was terrible. They called to find the location which was correctly entered but the person who contacted me interrupted me as I spoke and hung up on me.  This made an excellent restaurant turn in to a very poor experience 
2058,5,Positive,"BLT was good, bacon was perfectly cooked. The curry chicken was amazing. Definitely will be ordering it again soon!"
2059,5,Positive,"Very tasty, quality food/drink items"
2060,4,Positive,"The potato quiche was excellent and overpriced. The German chocolate cake was ok, but overpriced. The Americano was also great. For a special occasion (my mom's bday) it was fine."
2061,2,Negative,One of the coffee boxes was completely soggy
2062,5,Negative,They provided a small slice of cake. Probably would not order from there again 
2063,5,Positive,The treats tasted really good. Fairly expensive.
2064,5,Positive,I had requested birthday candles and this store was sweet enough to send me some with their awesome cup cakes. That's definitely going above and beyond! Highly recommend them.
2065,3,Neutral,The pictures displayed aren't an accurate representation of what you get. 
2066,2,Positive,My food was under cooked. Chicken was raw
2067,3,Neutral,Incorrect pictures for some menu items.
2068,5,Positive,It was good
2069,5,Positive,Very tasty!! Definitely a get again! 
2070,5,Positive,"good food and very good perk discount, i otherwise wouldn't have tried the food"
2071,4,Positive,"Great food and fast, but I received the wrong item.  Customer service refunded me though so all good :)"
2072,2,Positive,"Falafel was a bit too salty for my liking... and the sauces were put on the food, rather than in little containers off to the side like other places tend to do."
2073,4,Negative,Not the best but ok
2074,1,Positive,"Driver was AWESOME.
Food was way, way, way too salty -- the falafel would have been awesome without an entire drum of salt in it."
2075,4,Positive,Good portion and well made.
2076,1,Negative,Falafel was VERY salty. Driver did not follow delivery instructions. Food arrived cold.
2077,2,Negative,"On the positive, the food was delivered on time. 
But that's where the positive ends. 
The food was haphazardly placed on driveway, and not neatly placed upon requested table. 
Either because of placement or handling during delivery, everything was dripping and leaking. 
Order was wrong. I did not receive any falafel, and instead received baklava. 
Other reviews say wrong orders apparently happen a lot. 
The fries were sad, soggy and flavorless.
The rest of the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great either. 
The baba ganoush had a strong chickpea flavor, and I suspect it was actually hummus. 
Even though I ordered falafel balls, and received baklava, the baklava wasn't bad.
The gyro was packaged in a way that it would have become soggy, even if the driver had been more careful. But it wasn't bad either. 
I will say that the pita had a nice unexpected but satisfying crunch in some places, and the rest a delicate softness that you would expect. 
All in all 2/5"
2078,1,Negative,Missing a lot items have there vegetable and small portion for the rest  
2079,2,Negative,The food was decent and the portions were reasonable I also appreciate the food was hot despite it being driven from fairly far away however it's extremely disappointing that the order was wrong completely it must have been somebody else's
2080,1,Negative,"Poor quality food, wont recommend"
2081,2,Negative,The food was really bad. I'd never order from them again. I threw most of it away
2082,5,Neutral,Chicken gyro plate was soooooo good 
2083,5,Neutral,Yummy and fast
2084,2,Negative,"This was not good.  Should have believed the recent reviews.  Order was wrong- and lots of pepper heat not flavor. Chili sauce on falafel?? After $80, I had to still cook dinner for my family."
2085,1,Negative,Didn't have my order right and worst Greek fries.
2086,3,Neutral,"Cold food. Salty falafel. The Beef shawarma was supposed to come with rice, hummus, etc. I think we got a beef wrap with fries.... Completely incorrect order. But the worst thing was that the food was cold."
2087,2,Neutral,"The delivery was great, the food was not. The order was incorrect, we were missing items and it was packaged poorly so the food was very messy and spilled everywhere. "
2088,5,Positive,Great driver! Courteous and prompt.
2089,5,Positive,Best med food I've had in awhile
2090,1,Negative,Restaurant was fine. Grub hub delivery driver left the 2nd bag so we were missing 2 meals
2091,1,Negative,Very upset. Cold food.
2092,1,Negative,The food was mediocre. Not good quality. The GrubHub customer service was terrible. I will not be using your service again
2093,3,Neutral,I'll get back to you
2094,1,Negative,Restaurant grubhub machine was not working. I had to wait 15 minutes for food. Food was not as tasty
2095,2,Negative,Below average for Greek food. Gyros so-so. Babaganouj was good. Greek fries were terrible. 
2096,2,Negative,Order wasn’t customized as requested and overall flavor was poor. 
2097,1,Negative,"Fries were packed with about a half a cup of grease, the bag and the container were soaked. The baklava had way too much cardamom, good cook just bad seasoning. The gyro was so so. We’re not going to order from here again. Our delivery driver was awesome, he went above and beyond getting us our food. "
2098,2,Negative,I did not get what I ordered.
2099,4,Positive,"Greek fries are delicious! Always fill me up. Chicken shawarma is good, but this place does not get the order right every time."
2100,2,Negative,Order was late and cold. 
2101,5,Positive,Exactly what I wanted! Very good. And delivery driver Laura was AMAZING. 
2102,3,Negative,They don't pay attention to the comments/ requests
2103,2,Neutral,One of the items was incorrect 
2104,3,Negative,The restaurant screwed up my order's special request and ended up giving me food that caused a reaction with my food allergies.
2105,3,Negative,Didn't pay attention to the notes.
2106,3,Negative,"Food was fantastic! Authentic Mediterranean cuisine at an affordable price. Only hiccup was delivery. The delivery time was estimated at about an hour after the order. After an hour and a half I called the restaurant to ask where the driver was, and the person on the phone said he was arriving at my place now. That turned out to be false and the driver did not arrive for another 30 minutes, bringing the total delivery time to two hours. 

It was fantastic food, but the communication was sub-par."
2107,2,Negative,I asked for no cheese on my salad and they put cheese on it making it inedible for me
2108,4,Neutral,"Ordered two orders of fries but received one, food was amazing though. Fries were hot and the driver was super nice. "
2109,1,Negative,Food was good.  There was total confusion when I called the restaurant to find out the status of my order...and it took too long when I called Grub Hub to follow up.   I will not recommend or use Grub Hub again.
2110,5,Positive,"Food was incredible, great flavors and fresh. He simply hadn't seen the order yet when we arrived but was immediately on it and made it quickly. Friendly nice guy. Would go here again."
2111,4,Neutral,Very good food
2112,4,Negative,"The driver was courteous and prompt.  Unfortunately, the food missed the mark greatly. It lacked seasoning and quality.  Had at least a dozen gyros in the past year and this one ranked as sub-par.  Very disappointed with the food.  The only reason the review in general is getting a 4/5 star was the driver"
2113,5,Positive,"Food was great! Hot, and arrived early"
2114,1,Negative,They completely ignored my dietary request to sub out rice for fries. If it wasn’t possible why not contact the customer to tell them so? I would of happily order something else. If the rice was separated it out from the meal that’s one thing but it’s like everywhere. Customer service tried to help but the restaurant would not acknowledge their error and refused my refund. Now I’m out $10+ and my friend had to share their meal with me so I could have something to eat. Very sad and we’re all still hungry.
2115,1,Negative,"I am allergic to red & green peppers so I carefully read menu descriptions. There was NO mention of peppers, but they were in EVERYTHING! Even the order of plain rice. I couldn't eat any of it. Menu descriptions must be complete! I will not order from them again."
2116,2,Negative,"Disappointing. My order was totally wrong. I ordered chicken kabob, however got chicken shwarma. I asked for extra pita bread but got none. Hummus tasted like toothpaste. Chicken and rice were pretty good. Overall not a bad place but nothing special"
2117,2,Negative,Mediocre should have read and trusted other reviews first. 
2118,1,Neutral,The beef and lamb euro tasted like cheap taco seasoning and the rice was incredibly greasy. 
2119,4,Negative,"Generally Stella Deli is good, this time they sent me the wrong order"
2120,1,Negative,Poor quality and flavor
2121,5,Positive,My sandwich was fresh and delicious :)  will order again!
2122,4,Positive,Great sandwiches. I'll definitely be coming back 
2123,5,Positive,"Yummy, well put together sandwich. :) remained intact even though it was delivered"
2124,5,Positive,"Love Stellas - friendly, great selection, good food"
2125,4,Negative,Driver delivered to wrong address
2126,5,Positive,Love Stella! They have fantastic deli sandwiches and customer service
2127,3,Negative,"Staff was friendly and did their best. They have adjusted hours due to Covid and did not actually come in until the time when my order was supposed to be ready. 
They were flustered and did not read order correctly and I had to clear it up and wait 30 minutes to be complete."
2128,3,Negative,"I asked for a sandwich without cheese on it, cuz I have a pretty gnarly dairy allergy where I'll pretty much end up on the ground shaking in pain. And they still put cheese on 1 of the sandwiches I ordered! Not the other one though. So I know they knew and could do what I was asking. I deconstructed the whole thing and still ate around where i could, since I had to pay for it. Not very happy though. Working in the field, you have to pay attention to these things. It's not something you can just be all care free about. What if it was more serious? The whole thing is that I'm not happy with the fact I asked for 1 thing and they still seem to mess that up. "
2129,5,Neutral,Wish they would offer soda and chips.
2130,5,Positive,"Great sandwiches, great price"
2131,4,Negative,ordering system not great. sandwich great
2132,5,Positive,"Quick, efficient, and just what I expected! A good, honest deli sandwich!"
2133,4,Neutral,"It would be nice if we could order chips, sodas & other items Stella sells. "
2134,1,Negative,The food was cold and they were rude when I called.
2135,3,Negative,Really disappointed my sandwich wasn’t as I ordered it. I’m not a fan of horseradish sauce... said to leave it off... got a bunch of horseradish sauce🙄. M’lady’s sandwich was pretty great I hear... better luck next time!! 
2136,1,Negative,"again with the spoiled food. Does anyone care about food safety these days?  Totally disgusting, had to spit out the first bite. I opened the sandwich with an overpowering stench of spoilage to find green turkey. For god's sake, stop trying to save a buck on your overpriced food and just throw it the funk away"
2137,2,Positive,The food was amazing!
2138,3,Positive,Restaurant was good
2139,1,Positive,We ordered a Caesar salad and the dressing they gave us was mayonnaise so we couldn’t even eat the salad. We would like a refund for the salad. Thanks 
2140,5,Negative,I only ordered sandwiches which were delicious. And it barely took more then 30 mins from the time I ordered to get to my house!
2141,5,Positive,We love Stella Deli
2142,5,Neutral,Would order from Stella Deli and Market again!
2143,5,Positive,"Food was delicious, as always."
2144,5,Positive,This place has really tasty sandwiches!
2145,5,Positive,Fast and delicious! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
2146,5,Positive,I wish I could tip after receiving my food! Great experience.
2147,4,Positive,Good sandwiches and sides.
2148,1,Negative,Poor quality. Unrecognizable Tuna salad
2149,5,Positive,Lovely people and delicious food
2150,3,Positive,The sandwich was VERY good but the macaroni salad tasted like Reser's brand.  Not a fan.
2151,5,Positive,"It was great - on time, accurate, and tasty!"
2152,5,Positive,"friendly place to get lunch. don't be in a hurry. they make right, not fast."
2153,5,Positive,Great sandwiches and salads.
2154,5,Positive,"Delicious sandwich, convenient neighborhood location, friendly and professional staff, lots of amenities and snacks"
2155,2,Negative,Not good tuna fish
2156,4,Positive,Salad was good. Sandwich was a bit spicy.
2157,5,Positive,"Really good sandwich, perfect on the taste buds, great potatoes salad!"
2158,5,Positive,Breakfast sandwich was great! And affordable!
2159,5,Positive,It was great. And cheap. Loved it.
2160,2,Negative,"I had a strange experience with this Deli. I placed an order for a Cesar Salad. Shortly after, the Deli called me to tell me they didn't have Cesar Salad today, and that I needed to order something else and to call them back. They called me twice, once leaving the previously mentioned voice message and once hanging up after one ring. 

Since I couldn't call, I contacted EAT24 Support to contact the Deli to cancel the order, as I wasn't able to on my end. EAT24 Support told me that the restaurant said they suddenly had my salad ready. 

The delivery was prompt, which was good. However, the Cesar salad had turkey, which seemed to be ripped by hand and in chunks. It was unexpected and didn't taste great. 

Short version: Delivery was good, food was not great, customer service was bad. "
2161,1,Negative,The guy from the restaurant was very rude and gave a terrible service. He just made promises couldn't fulfill 
2162,3,Negative,My food was not ready when I got there.
2163,5,Positive,Love Stella!!  Great neighborhood Deli with yummy sandwiches!! 
2164,1,Negative,I was disappointed that I waited over the estimated delivery time and then received the wrong side salad. I called and he explained that they were out of the other one and I expressed that I would have appreciated if they would have called and told me that rather then replacing it with an item that I didn't wish to have. The food was decent but considering my experience I won't be ordering from them again.
2165,3,Positive,"I ordered a large bowl and asked for salmon but got spicy shrimp instead, throwing off the taste of the whole bowl, it's still tasty, but not what I expected. 

Grubhub switched drivers on me so the food had been prepared for an hour by the time I received it. With the extra delivery time it was room temp by the time I got it, which makes me cautious because now there's room temp shrimp in my lunch. I put it in the fridge so hopefully it will be all right, gonna toss the shrimp though.

The presentation was great for a to-go order! I think next time I'll go in person."
2166,4,Negative,They are always consistent and the bowls are fresh. They unfortunately forgot the shrimp on my order this time.
2167,5,Positive,honestly build your own bowl option is amazing! I’ve added some new things and I would most definitely recommend this to anybody who likes poke
2168,4,Positive,"Good food. Spicy tuna quite spicy, okay for me but not for all in my family."
2169,5,Positive,Food was delicious
2170,4,Positive,Food wasn't amazing quality but was good.
2171,3,Neutral,"They did not include extra seaweed, as specified in order."
2172,1,Negative,It's a good restaurant I'm just really really upset about my order not being correct at all. Like completely wrong
2173,3,Negative,It was the first time my delivery was pushed back twice. I ordered at 11am and got it at around 1pm. Not the drivers fault at all
2174,3,Negative,"While the food was very delicious and fresh, it was was completely inaccurate from what I ordered. Included a few items I didn't even ask for. Left out many things I did want. Again, was super good. Just a little disappointed to not get what I had ordered"
2175,5,Neutral,"Absolutely delicious, will order from again!"
2176,1,Negative,Food order was not correct. Missing items
2177,5,Positive,"Always good. I hate the automatic ""go to"" designation grubhub gives to everyone you're ordered from, but in this case it's accurate. I have ordered from them several times and will definitely use them again."
2178,5,Positive,Food was excellent
2179,5,Positive,"I use them regularly... always good, always fresh, always good service"
2180,5,Neutral,Good poke in a generous serving at a very reasonable price. :)
2181,4,Negative,It's always good and I deliver lunch from SodoPoke regularly. The driver was not friendly or where he said he was waiting.
2182,5,Positive,"It was delicious! I never had it before, so I was pleasantly surprised. Could have used more greens in it, but I'm not complaining"
2183,5,Positive,Great taste and freshness!
2184,5,Positive,Love it! Poke is always good and fresh
2185,5,Positive,SoDo Poké is the best Poké spot in this area!
2186,1,Negative,The food tasted horrible. I've ordered many times before from them with no issue. Order was over 30 mins late and the food tasted awful. The seafood looked old and had a very weird taste to it. Really bad experience overall
2187,5,Positive,Good food as always
2188,4,Positive,Food always fresh and on point.
2189,5,Positive,Great fresh food
2190,5,Positive,"Great packaging, the food ""looked good"" when it arrived. Quality ingredients. Was exactly what I ordered and tasted GREAT."
2191,3,Positive,The restaurant is great!! Love their food and they are always so kind :) Grubhub delivery driver was late
2192,5,Positive,The poke was fresh. The toppings were great. Will order again for sure!
2193,5,Positive,Best place ever.
2194,5,Positive,"Absolutely great and the delivery actually came within 15 min amazing . The delivery guy very nice . The food was fresh and delicious though the portions are small especially for the soft tofu Korean soup , it was just a cup size for $13 . Poke is great and fresh and amazing fruit shake . The only thing with they provided chopsticks instead of plastic forks and spoons "
2195,5,Positive,Good Uncomplicated poke
2196,5,Positive,"Great food!  I had never had poke before, and it was delicious.  I could eat a bucket of the seaweed salad."
2197,5,Positive,First try. Good so far
2198,5,Positive,Very good food.
2199,5,Positive,Portions were big. Everything tasted fresh. Very good
2200,1,Negative,"I paid for tomato soup. It wasn't in the order. I paid for calamari. It wasn't in the order. There was fish in place of it, but id asked that it be taken off the bill when they called. "
2201,1,Negative,I was notified that the order would come by 6:50 pm but I had to call at 9 pm and was told that it would take another 50 minutes. I understand that the weather is bad but Grubhub should have notified me that a felay would be there especially if its more than an hour. I cancelled the order. I am extremely disappointed with Grubhub’s experience and was expecting better. This shows complete lack of respect for customer’s time. I hope I am reimbursed for this!!
2202,1,Negative,"Worst food order ever. Boneless Chicken Biryani smelled and seemed stale upon arrival. After two bites, felt sick after two bites and had to discard. Order contained two Tandoori Rotis but did not contain a Tava Roti as ordered. Sher E Punjab Grill was the worst take out experience to date via Seamless, will never again order from there."
2203,1,Negative,Delivery was a no-show after 2 1/2 hours. No communication.
2204,1,Negative,"Worst service,  bad food and irresponsible. "
2205,1,Negative,"DO NOT ORDER!! If I could I would give zero stars. Absolute worst food delivery experience that I've ever had. We ordered two tikka masalas with different spice levels and neither was labeled, but they were identical and tasteless. We also ordered tomato butter chicken that had less flavor than tomato soup and it was very thing. All of the chicken was poor quality and unflavored. To top it off, there was a giant bone in my brothers chicken that he almost chocked on. Naan was dry and plain and burned. I didn't think it was possible to have bad Indian food but this place proved me wrong. Driver was incompetent and couldn't follow basic instructions. He arrived and couldn't figured out the door code and couldn't understand the apartment number after it was repeated back to him over 5 times. One dish of food was delivered on its side and started spilling out of it. WORST RESTAURANT EVER! "
2206,2,Negative,"Delivery was delayed by over 30 mins. By the time, food ar"
2207,5,Positive,Wonderful food! Extended hours were very much appreciated for this celebration that I attended
2208,1,Negative,They delivered the food 1 hr 20 mins late and they missed the fenugreek naan was missing. Food is ok. Will never be ordering again. 
2209,3,Positive,Food was awesome! But forgot my lassis
2210,2,Negative,Food was very sub par. The naan was dry and simply dried spices added onto the bread. Really some of the worst I have had.
2211,1,Negative,"Delayed delivery of food. It took over an hour to get the food, I had to check with the restaurant at least 5-6 times for delivery. The food was cold and paratha was burnt "
2212,1,Negative,The food looked different than advertised tastes bad and old and was cheap food for how much I had to pay.
2213,1,Negative,"STOP BEFORE YOU ORDER BEWARE!!! Worse service, worse food. Never ordering AGAIN. Order was wrong and tried nothing to mitigate their mistake. "
2214,1,Negative,"Horrible service. Food showed up exactly 1 hour late and after repeated calls from these jokers promising it was “on the way”

Don’t order from these clowns."
2215,1,Negative,"The driver never arrived. I waited for 1.5 hours after the estimated delivery time, even then no order was received. The restaurant number on grubhub was incorrect when I tried to find out about the order."
2216,2,Negative,"Seriously , close that shop down ...."
2217,1,Negative,"The delivery was more than an hour late. When I tried to call the restaurant (9calls) to check on the status, the phone either rang through to voicemail or someone answered the phone and promptly hung up, with the exception of the one time I was able to speak with someone and the woman, before even asking the order number or any of my information, told me it was going to be a while and hung up. 

Awful communication from the restaurant, and the driver. 0/10 would recommend "
2218,1,Neutral,"Restaurant replaced lamb kabobs to shrimp as they were out of lamb I paid $15 for. They sent me two shrimp dishes the same. They missed one naan from the two I ordered. Rice was old, not cooked, and clearly microvawed. Please do not order from this restaurant as they are in business to defraud customers. "
2219,1,Negative,I didnot even receive the order and the restaurant people didnot pick up the phone. Would never order from grubhub again
2220,1,Positive,"Kulfi turned out to be lassi.
Biryani was over cooked
Pizza were okay"
2221,1,Negative,Order did not come at all. Restaurant did not pick up the phone. And support email said they were doing me a favor by returning my money. Will NNOT be using Grubhub again.
2222,1,Negative,Terrible place never even got my food
2223,1,Negative,"MAN NEVER EVER ORDER FOOD FROM THIS PLACE. THEY ARE SO RUDE. THEY DONT CARE ABT UR ORDER. AND IF YOU CALL THEM AND ASK WHY ARE YOU LATE THEY WILL THREAT YOU, THEY WILL YELL AT YOU. THE SOUTH INDIAN LADY OVER THERE START YELLING AT US. WHEN WE CALL THEM ABOUT 20 TIMES IT TOOK 4 HOURS TO GET THE FOOD DELIVERED. WE CALLED FOR UPDATE, WE HEARD THE OWNER CALLING THE DELIVERY GUY SAYING TELL THE CLIENT THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT ON HIGHWAY THATS WHY I AM LATE. FINALLY DELIVERY GUY CALLED SAID HE IS RUNNING HALF HOUR LATE. WE ASKED HIM CAN U MAKE IT QUICK HE SAID DO YOU NEED YOUR FOOD OR SHOULD I GO AWAY.  NEVER EVER ORDER FOOD FROM THEM, THEY ARE HORRIBLE, ON TOP THEY THREAT YOU SAYING OK WE WILL NOT DELIVER YOUR FOOD, DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO."
2224,1,Negative,Really bad Indian. There was food in drinks and horrible.
2225,1,Negative,The food was very late and never confirmed by a driver. We called the restaurant after the eta from grubhub. The lady confirmed our address and said the driver left 20 mins ago. When the food got here it was hot but poorly packaged with no silverware nor napkins. The driver had the nerve to ask for a tip too. Also the curry i ordered said it would have salmon scallops mussels prawns. I recieved no scallops and the salmon was actually catfish nuggets and the prawns were medium shrimp @ best and not worth the price. We took a chance now we will believe more reviews! 
2226,1,Negative,"The Order delivered was completely wrong. I am a vegetarian and Non-Veg Dish was delivered. Instead of Gulab Jamun, Samosas were delivered. Also, the kheer was very bad, it was water and half-cooked rice. Negative stars!!!"
2227,1,Negative,"Waited over and hour past the delivery time and food never showed up. Called the restaurant to see what was going on and they asked if I would call the driver because they couldn't get ahold of him. When I called the driver picked up and then hung up on me twice then turned off his phone. This place sucks, do not even give it a chance."
2228,5,Negative,"I was actually unaware that I ordered the food, my pocket decided I was hungry and ordered. "
2229,1,Negative,Food never came called once said it was on the way called a second time hung up on me. 
2230,1,Negative,Terrible food. The restaurant send it’s own driver who asked for an extra cash tip. When I told her that tip was paid with the order she said she deserved more coz she came from far. That’s terrible customer service. 
2231,1,Negative,"Worst Indian food ever. The rice taste like days old, the Togo container shouldn’t be carry hot "
2232,1,Negative,"Mango lassi and mango kulfi came solid frozen
?!?! So lame. 
"
2233,1,Negative,This restaurant astounds me. I never got my food that night... I don't know why they even bother to offer delivery or they are part of Grubhub. Don't expect to receive your order anytime soon or ever. 
2234,2,Negative,Missing items and naan was burnt
2235,1,Negative,Awful! Poor customer service.
2236,4,Positive,It was really delicious everything was correct except my drink was really warm and in a to go container for food. It wasn't good. But other than that all the food was delicious.
2237,1,Negative,was waiting for the driver but the shop never cares and still was waiting for hours but no one picked up the phone at store and so did the driver
2238,1,Negative,Never got my food 
2239,1,Neutral,The restaurant is closed but
2240,1,Negative,"The cucumber salad has no cucumbers... The curry they delivered was wrong... And no raita with the biriyani, plus it was late. Don't bother. "
2241,1,Negative,"Tonight I ordered food from Sher E Punjab Grill through Grubhub. Estimated delivery time was 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. A little long, but typical for the Grubhub restaurants.

At an hour and 40 minutes I talked to Grubhub. When they called the restaurant they were told the order hadn't even left for delivery, and it would take another 20 minutes to arrive.

I told them to cancel my order, and to ask the restaurant if making a customer in their dining room wait two hours for food would be acceptable. After some back and forth with Grubhub, they told me that the order was cancelled, and the refund would be applied to my credit card.

TWO hours for a two item delivery. Not one courtesy phone call to say they were running behind. And then, while reading the confirmation email of my refund from Grubhub, Sher E Punjab Grill had actually REFUSED to refund my money, and Grubhub had to do it. I can only imagine what the food would have been like if it had arrived. If they started making it when I ordered it, then the food would have been sitting for at least an hour and a half. Disgusting is the only way I can describe my experience.

If you can't do something right, either fix the way you're doing it, or stop doing it altogether.

Sher E Punjab Grill here's a tip. People order food for one reason. They're hungry. You make people wait two plus hours for food and they won't be back."
2242,2,Positive,I love the curries but my order was an hour and a half late and normally the pizza is great but this time I think they just gave me a store bought frozen pizza... I was very disappointed
2243,1,Negative,"Very bad food , I am not able to eat the food and throw it."
2244,1,Negative,"Please save your money and time, this is one of the worst experience I had on grubhub, worst food quality, worst taste, worst service, worst management, drunk people will do delivery."
2245,1,Negative,Delivery took too long and they forgot the mango lassi we ordered. Will never order from here again
2246,1,Negative,They never delivered my food.
2247,2,Negative,"Delivery was 20 minutes late, sag paneer had no paneer, and food wasn't delivered to our door."
2248,1,Negative,"As of now food is 4 hours late.  When contacted at 3 hours, they said the food would be delivered in 10 minutes."
2249,1,Negative,"DO NOT ORDER FROM
THIS FAKE
PLACE - THEY DONT BRING YOUR FOOD "
2250,1,Negative,"The delivery man did not come to my house and then asked me to walk down to another house a block away. then they didn't give us all of the order. I called three times asking where the rest of my order was. Each time they said it was on the way and it never came. She also didn't realize she didn't change up and yelled into the kitchen "" the old lady want her Naan"" lmao I'm 25! On top of that, the lassi was nasty! "
2251,1,Negative,I work at a business and they did not come into the desk.  They called from the car and then took off with $45 of food.  
2252,1,Negative,"It was worst experience. I ordered at 10:30 Pm and they delivered me around 2. They were not picking my phone for long time and finally when they delivered, food was terrible. If you are super hungry, then also avoid this place."
2253,1,Negative,very very very bad
2254,5,Positive,"Best samosas I've ever had! Great quality. Early delivery, very nice delovery person. Will order again!"
2255,1,Negative,"If garbage had a restaurant, Sher E Punjab grill would be it.
75 minutes after ordering on the app I call them up only to find out they haven&rsquo;t even begun my order. They ask for an additional 40 minutes for delivery because their driver doesn&rsquo;t want to deliver right now. 
Their rice smelled like rubber and their quantities are smaller than that if a michelin star restaurant.

They are not only sloppy, rude and inconsiderate, but also probably the worst cooks in the world. My dog could make better food than these trash cooks! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE EVER!"
2256,1,Negative,"Food was ordered at 430pm with a $5.50 tip on the order and the $3.50 delivery fee, and was expected between 530-545. At 610, I called the place and was told the driver was out on deliver and had 3 orders to take care of (mine included). He showed up at 8, and insisted I give him a tip because he claimed that no tip went to him. Person at the restaurant was not helpful with contacting the driver. Will never order from here again."
2257,1,Negative,if you pay for your food at least I should arrive full today I had the worst experience they only took half of the food I paid I did not even arrive on time and the food is not served as in the photo it is horrible the person of the very rude delibery It was the worst and I called the restaurant and did not even bother to answer the phone without the worst experience that this place had
2258,1,Negative,"Food quantity is very less in comparison to what you pay. Even the taste was not good. Only thing they have eatable is any dish with spinach/saag. I tried this restaurant multiple times because i'm searching for Indian food and there is a not lot of options in Seattle. But finally after last order where I paid approx 13-15$ for a chicken tandoori which had 3 small pieces. And 10-13$ approx for fish pakora which also had 2 piece only. I finally give up on this restaurant and writing this review.
If you still want to order - order anything with saag/spinach as it can't be made bad."
2259,1,Negative,The delivery person didn't knock on the door so I didn't hear them! I never got my order
2260,3,Negative,"Food at 5:30, it is 8 and our food still hasn't come. We called multiple times and they always said it was on its way but it never showed up. The last time we called they were closed. I'm so hungry :("
2261,1,Negative,"zero stars!!
ordered via Eat24 at 9:51pm, estimated time of delivery was 1 hour from the time of deliver. 
called after one hour, restaurant told food is out for delivery and i shall expect in another 10-15 mins as delivery boy has 4 deliveries to make.
called after 20 mins, same story
called Eat24 after another 20 mins, they contacted them and came back to me saying expect delivery in 10 mins.
after 20 mins, delivery man called me to tell that he will be at my place in another 25-30mins, i lost my patience - i asked him to take the food back to restaurant as it is highly unexpectable.
as i moved in this new city a day before, i had my kitchen totally empty and at mid-night Sher-e- Punjab left me stranded.
No food, no money refund - cant describe the torture i went through, not to mention that i had to sleep empty stomach."
2262,1,Negative,Did not receive order even after 2hrs 30 min
2263,1,Negative,Pathetic service. Pathetic people working at the restaurant. Pathetic phone ethic. Food was half missing and half of the order was wrong. Pathetic delivery. Never ever order from this place.
2264,1,Negative,"Ordered at 8:25, GrubHub said it would arrive 9:10-9:17. Email said 9:25-9:35. No updates, calls, or texts. It’s 10pm and I called the restaurant to be told, “oh, yeah. My driver is on his way. Maybe 10-15 minutes.”
I told him to cancel the order and I better get my refund. 

This is the first problem I’ve ever had with a GrubHub restaurant. All the others I’ve dealt with communicated everything very well."
2265,1,Negative,"I ordered around 2:30 pm. They said my order was in the works, then hours passed with no update. They called at 7:55 pm, but by then I had made other plans."
2266,1,Negative,Everything is horrible!!
2267,1,Negative,The worst nightmare. Ordered food 11:00 pm and it arrived 2:00am. Thought the food might be good but it was wrong order and the chicken tandoori was not even properly cooked. Worst Restaurant EVER. I would not even suggest an enemy of mine to eat from this restaurant. 0/10 
2268,1,Negative,"Food never showed up. Called repeatedly to ask what was going on, perhaps help the driver find the place, every time ppl answered w\ attitude like I was inconveniencing them with my call, then hung up on me. I had a friend call (to see if their poor service was just about me), but they treated her the same way.

Never got the food, didn't get refunded my money, never received a call from them.


WORST.  DELIVERY.    EVER."
2269,1,Negative,I never received my order. I called the restaurant twice and they assured me the driver was on the way but 2 hours later I gave up. Now I have to figure out how to get a refund cause I'm out 50 bucks for s meal I never ate.
2270,1,Negative,"It took two hours for the delivery to arrive. The mango lassi we ordered was warm and fermented so we couldn't drink it. They forgot to give us utensils even though we were at a hotel, so we had none and then hotel only had plastic forks. The food was not flavorful and we ordered a medium level of spiciness but it was just bland with no spice. Nothing was warm."
2271,2,Negative,"order was late, incorrect and the food was low-quality for the price."
2272,1,Negative,I never got my food .. 3 hours I had to wait till the time I gave up .. Had guest at my home .. Embarrassing ..Grubhub should take some action against this
2273,1,Negative,I never got my order and they started to ignore my call 
2274,2,Negative,After placing my order I waited the 70 min eta.  I then waited half an hour before calling to see where my food was.  After another half hour I received a call that the driver had a flat and it would be another 25 minutes.  An hour and a half late I finally got my food.  My hot food was cold my cold food was hot and frozen food was melted.  I understand flats but it shouldn't take an hour to be notified of a flat tire.
2275,1,Negative,My order was missing items. Rice was missing and my soda was missing. The appetizer was burnt. I’d like a full refund. I shouldn’t have to pay for food I didn’t receive and for poor quality. 
2276,1,Negative,It was delivered 2 hrs late and food was very bad
2277,5,Positive,Food was delicious and I will order again staff were friendly and price was good 
2278,5,Positive,Small place with pleasant staff. Samosa was crunchy and flavorful and liked the tamarind chutney and mint. Naan was soft and price was good Will definitely be going to order again 
2279,1,Negative,"We received order in 3 hours.  We ordered two dishes, received one dish and that one dish was incorrect.  The naan was burnt, and we did not eat the other wrong dish or anything delivered.  Kind of perplexed as to why the restaurant does not call to say they are out of a food item, why bother making the delivery with the incorrect order, fish instead of chicken.  I have allergies so they could basically deliver what they like - very dishonest and dangerous. I get the food industry is tough, but there should be some sort of standard."
2280,3,Positive,First of all. I ordered at like 1 am. Which is awesome that there is another food option for late night delivery that isn’t pizza. We got mixed grill and lamb saag and both were too much on the citrusy side making it hard to eat at once. I’ll try order during the day sometime and see if it’s any better but not for a while. 
2281,1,Negative,"I would say this was the worst experience I ever had with food and delivery. I ordered and was given a time frame of 64 to 78 mins delivery window. That time went, I never received an update. Finally I called after 40 mins of the estimated delivery time, I was told another 20 mins for food. Another 45 mins went by and then I called again to find out where was my food. Lady on the other end of the line was very rude and told me to take the driver's phone number and find out yourself. After 2 hours and 55 mins I finally got the order. The food was cold. One of the cold dishes was hot. No condiments or silverware as I requested. And to top that one of my order was wrong. This was a nightmare. I made a mistake to order food from them. So basically I paid for sleeping hungry and throwing the food away. WORST EVER...... STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRIBLE RESTAURANT...."
2282,1,Negative,"The order was not correct. It's too bad that I can't attach the picture of the bone that I found in my food or I think it's a bone. Mango Lassi, Think again it's just milk with sugar and food coloring. This order was a shame."
2283,1,Negative,Food never arrived
2284,1,Negative,Service was absolutely disgusting. They lied about delivery time. The driver wouldn't even come across the street to meet me at the door much less bring the food to the apartment.
2285,1,Neutral,Took 2 hours for delivery
2286,1,Negative,"I ordered my food around 10:30 and it's now 1AM and still no food.
My husband called the restraunt and a woman answered the phone and immediately put him on hold after he had told her my name and asked when our food would be arriving since it was already a half hour late. 
After a few minutes she said it'd be here in about 10, that was almost an hour ago.
I wouldn't have cared about her poor attitude and terrible phone service had my food actually arrived, but seeing as how I'm out nearly $40 and hungry, I'm a little upset.
I guess it's on me though for being dumb enough to give this place a chance, no wonder they have horrible reviews and ratings! 
Worst service ever!"
2287,1,Negative,I want a full refund. My order was incorrect and what they sent made me sick almost immediately.
2288,1,Positive,Never got a chance to taste the food! Amazing Service!
2289,3,Neutral,It took an extra 25 minutes to get my order and the food was okay.
2290,1,Negative,Worst food ever I ate in my life
2291,1,Negative,"They ran out of vegetable samosas and decided to substitute them for pakoras without telling me. Which they had the chance to since I had to talk to them about my order apparently being cancelled without my knowledge. 

Because of this I ended up getting food late (i.e. cold). 

I was also made to walk down the street to pick it up from the driver who delivered to the wrong house."
2292,1,Negative,"Worst Indian food I ever ate. Did they add katsup to the buttered chicken? I would avoid this place like the plague. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. 
I love Indian food and this place is an insult to Indian food."
2293,1,Negative,Food is over 30 mins late... On a weeknight... No word from the restaurant.
2294,1,Negative,Food just wasn’t up to par. I’d ordered from here before and it was fine but my food just felt like half-assed Indian food. They are the only Indian place open late so I imagine it’s probably not always the same cooks. My last order passed as Indian food but kinda just barely. My samosas were  rolled into balls instead of a samosa shape and didn’t have the flavor of an Indian samosa. My main dish felt the same way too. The paneer was good but the flavor wasn’t quite there. Perhaps they were low on their spices but also they are just perhaps really busy all the time since they’re open late and a delivery order or any order late at night if they are busy might not get the appropriate attention. 
2295,1,Neutral,food arrived after 2 hrs
2296,1,Negative,"Our food took almost 3 hours to arrive, and then the order wasn't correct! Also, the food was too salty to finish, AND  it was not mild, like we ordered. I don't think we'll be ordering from them again. "
2297,1,Negative,I ordered my food at 2:29. I received my food at 4. This is at least the 3rd time this has happened when ordered from Eat24 
2298,1,Negative,Terrible food. Food was not packed right. Curry was leaking all over the place. As an Indian I can tell that it is not even authentic Indian food.
2299,1,Negative,"I muted a phone call around the time I expected the delivery and immediately went outside to look for a delivery driver. Nobody was there, so I called back and got a recorded message saying that the call could not be completed. I waited for a few minutes on the front porch to no avail, then went back inside and called again a few times before getting through. The woman who eventually picked up said that she hadn't actually called me and then hung up. I called the restaurant's number and the same woman answered the phone, dismissively told me that my delivery was on the way, then hung up again. 30 minutes later and still no food. For all I know the food could be great, but the customer service was just awful. If you order from here, try to do it before midnight if you want to actually get food."
2300,1,Negative,My food never showed up! I sure was charged though .First time using grub hub and I will be deleting the app after I figure out how to get my money back 
2301,1,Neutral,"I ordered food late night, and it was an hour past the provided delivery window so naturally I was asleep and didn't receive any food at all, but the restaurant refuses to provide a refund even though I  was not contacted within the delivery widow to even provide an update. "
2302,1,Positive,"I never left a negative review on this app before, but unfortunately I must for this one. I gave them a chance, gave them several hours of time and even contacted the customer service who got me in touch with them. They assured me that they were making the food then. That was two hours ago, which is still 4 hours after I originally ordered. I will be requesting a refund. The GrubHub customer service was great, though. "
2303,1,Negative,"This is one of the word food delivery experience I got. Food is more than 2 hours late and evertime I called them back they kept saying ""food will be delivered in 15 min"". And I still havnt got the food and i am thinking of canceling it. I will never order from here again."
2304,1,Negative,Worst service I've experienced through any delivery app. Will not order from this location again.
2305,2,Negative,"Delivery was over an hour late, after saying they were on the way multiple times, as well as saying they were 5 minutes out, only to show up 30 mins after that."
2306,1,Negative,"Late night orders are a challenge, but 3 hours to deliver cold food is not an option in any world.  If you can't execute delivery, don't offer it."
2307,1,Positive,"Ordered Lamb and I got chicken. The rice was old and the delivery was almost an hour late. I ordered at 830AM, got here at 1010am
"
2308,3,Neutral,Food is a 4... delivery and followup regarding missing items is a 2... they still need to acknowledge and provide partial refund
2309,1,Negative,"20 minutes late.  Cold, soggy, flavorless food.  And incredibly over priced for the portions.  Delivery driver couldn’t follow the instructions to even get in the building.  This is the first time I’ve ordered from this place, I do honestly hope my order isn’t the norm, but I’ll never be ordering from there again.  "
2310,2,Neutral,the delivery time was way longer than the estimate and I had to contact customer service 
2311,1,Negative,Food never arrived. Waited for over 2 hours.
2312,1,Negative,"Food not received. Called the restaurant multiple times with a response of “its on the way, it’s on the way”- but never received the order. "
2313,1,Negative,Haven’t got order even after an hr from delivery window. Had to eat some other place and cancel this. NEVER order if you are hungry. 
2314,1,Negative,There is no option to give a 0 hence giving a 1. The garlic naan was completely burned and instead of goat curry I got lamb. The delivery was more than 1 hr 20 minutes late. Waste of money. Is there a way I can post picture of the food?
2315,1,Negative,"I ordered food a bit late which was delivered at 11.30 pm.
The food was smelling real bad even the rice was smelling as if a day or two old. I right away called the customer care to tell about it. I don't think I am going to order food from them ever.
"
2316,1,Negative,"What? Food was very late, called to check on it  - 'Oh, I'll check on it'. Then immediately hung up on me. 45 minutes after the outside estimate, still no food, no call back. "
2317,1,Negative,I got this request for review before I got my food. Its been almost 3 hours since i placed the order. It would be less of a hassle if they bothered to call to explain they were going to be late or something.
2318,1,Negative,Never received and still havent been refunded
2319,3,Negative,Food was delivered late and delivery guy did not even bother to step out of his car to deliver. 
2320,2,Positive,Tikki Marsala was sweet? I ordered medium spice but got no spice at all.
2321,1,Positive,Got a full refund .
2322,1,Negative,Food never arrived
2323,2,Positive,Ordered butter chicken and garlic naan. The naan was burnt and tough as a shoe. It resembled a black pancake more than a flavorful bread. The butter chicken was average at best. Would not order from this restaurant again.
2324,3,Neutral,"Not great, but open until 4am, so win."
2325,2,Negative,"Did not deliver the chicken & lamb skewer, sent a different kind of chicken, without asking if that's what I wanted. Delivered 30 minutes late, not that much of an issue, just wish I could have chosen, something different. Don't like dark pieces & that's what they sent."
2326,4,Positive,"Ordered delivery, was missing one order of spinach Naan, but last time it was insanely late, so it's getting better. We LOVE the food. Go ahead and try it yourself if you're thinking about it."
2327,1,Negative,"The order was incorrect, missing half of the items, and plastic countainers opened in bag during delivery and were inedible on arrival."
2328,1,Negative,Sucks. I had to wait 2.5 hour to get my food. 
2329,3,Negative,Won't eat again 
2330,5,Positive,Brilliant kadhi and alu gobi!
2331,3,Positive,"Good food, nice variety, extremely slow delivery"
2332,1,Negative,The driver did not come to the right location and kept calling but wasn't anywhere close. He seemed confused and disoriented when asked if he was following the address and using Google maps. Had to cancel the order and get fast food. This was after waiting 40 minutes passed the delivery time.
2333,1,Negative,"Food was awful. Chicken Tikka masala had bones and tated disgusting, though I'm pretty sure they gave me the wrong thing.  Regardless, I've never ordered an Indian dish that tasted that bad anywhere.  Veggie pakoras were also bad but at least edible.  Also forgot to give gulab."
2334,5,Positive,Good food n service 
2335,1,Negative,"These people claimed that they were calling me and did not call one time. On top of that, it was daylight savings so instead of correcting the issue which they still technically had time to do so, they decided to close early and tell me I had to wait until the morning to get $30 back. The driver stated that he spoke with ""me"" on the phone and was told that he had the wrong number---news flash, you obviously have the wrong number because you never spoke to me. I called 10 minutes passed the estimated wait time just to check on the status and this is ridiculous. "
2336,1,Negative,"Food arrived an hour after estimate (two hours total to get food). The lamb kebabs were about five bit sized pieces for the $10 (compare that to the picture). The lassi was watery and bland. On the upside, the daal was tasty. Not worth it."
2337,2,Negative,Just not very good food. 
2338,2,Neutral,Order was an hour late 
2339,1,Negative,"The order was wrong, got regular coke instead of sprite. Also papadi chat with channa masala with papad - oddest interpretation of papdi chat. The Andhra chicken was good though."
2340,1,Negative,The food there is expensive and it's not even worth it  I got cheated the food was not good. Deliverywas terrible they were over an hour late and they didn't even deliver I had to go pick up the food.. I will never order from there again.
2341,1,Negative,"The food was not good at all.
There was too much baking soda in naan.
My stomach started paining as soon as I eat that food.
Sorry to say but worst experience"
2342,1,Negative,Portions are too small for prices
2343,1,Negative,The order was an hour late.  The food was cold and two of the items I ordered were missing.  Do not order from this place.
2344,1,Negative,Food never came. I waited 90 min extra. Shut em down
2345,1,Negative,my delivery was 45 minutes late and my desert item was both frostburnt (i took One small sip) and completely melted the hot portion of the food was tasty at least
2346,1,Negative,"Worst experience. 
Throw your money away rather than order from this place. 

Could not even take a bite.  Had to throw all the things I ordered. Such a dreadful experience."
2347,1,Negative,Pathetic food. Burnt samosa. Delivery took 2 hours. Overall worst exp of Indian food...
2348,2,Neutral,"The driver was very polite but the food was not packed well, or prepared as requested "
2349,1,Negative,"Food showed up an hour late, and had clearly seen sitting out for some time. All of the food had to be either refrigerated or heated in a pan for quite some time. 
Hopefully it was a was a one off experience, but it was a poor one nonetheless"
2350,1,Negative,"1hr 20mins later than promised. Cold food. Tandoori platter was supposed to be 2 kinds of chicken and a 3rd type of lamb. It was all chicken - ZERO lamb, all had the same sauce and it was super dried out. Baba ganoosh had the consistency of snot and was equally difficult to stomach. Never. Again."
2351,1,Negative,Took 2 hours to arrive (an hour after the top estimate). Food was cold. 
2352,4,Positive,"Food was generally good.  The saag was too finely puréed, and the aloo gobi was similarly cut more fine than I usually like it.  Spices were well balanced and flavorful.  Feel free to order hotter than you might at other places.  "
2353,1,Negative,I have been waiting for 2 hours for mu
2354,4,Positive,"Biryani was not exactly biryani it was more like fried rice or masala rice or whatever you might want to call it 
Not to mention it took an hour from the expected time of delivery 
But the delivery man was very nice and polite!
Happy holidays "
2355,1,Negative,I never got my food.
2356,1,Negative,There was only guy working so it took two and a half hours before my food got here. Food was subpar and the rice was missing. Don’t order from here.
2357,2,Neutral,Need to be punctual
2358,1,Negative,"My order was 45 minutes late. Everything was Luke warm to cold to the touch upon arrival. The driver actually parked in the middle of the parking lot, making it impossible for our neighbors to drive past and he didn't know which order was mine. The food had great flavor tho. Will never order from this place again. Would not recommend ."
2359,1,Negative,  I NEVER RECIEVED MY FOOD
2360,1,Negative,Mixed grill only had chicken. The food didn't seem fresh or grilled.  The calamari didn't taste good nor did the chicken. The bread looks like it was a day old.
2361,1,Negative,"Leaving aside the 45 mins late delivery and incorrect items, what I did get that was correct was not well prepared, IE. kofta just thrown into its sauce to cook, papri which was actually soggy naan, chaat sauce which tasted like tomato sauce and sugar, just bad all around prepared by cooks who need to be retrained."
2362,1,Negative,"We placed our order at 5:00PM, to be delivered at 7:00PM. We didn't receive our food until 9:30PM. We called multiple times and kept getting excuses and that our food would be delivered in 10-20 minutes. Very disappointed in our service."
2363,1,Negative,"I'd love to tell you how the food is, but it's been more than 2 hours since we ordered and nothing has arrived yet. I keep calling to check and was just told that the driver is 30 minutes away STILL.  Ridiculous. Never this place again. Doesn't matter how the food tastes if you can't get the opportunity.  It would have been faster to drive across Seattle and back to pick anything else up. "
2364,5,Positive,Everything was delicious! Looking forward to eating here again. 
2365,5,Neutral,"They came through. 
"
2366,1,Negative,Very bad. Will never call them again.
2367,1,Negative,2 hours later and never came. They kept saying the driver was on the way. They finally told me they didn’t have a driver. I ordered at 10:30 pm and finally had to cancel it at 12:30 am. Horrible service! Can’t believe they kept lying and then still tried to make a plan to deliver food that has been sitting around for an hour and a half!
2368,1,Negative,Order was wrong. My juice was in tupperware. 
2369,1,Negative,"Pathetic food, paratha and naan were 2 inches thick, kofta was harder than rock. pathetic delivery service.. These guys doesn't know how to talk to customer. "
2370,1,Negative,Food is bland.  Can an hour late and was cold.  Customer service is terrible - at this establishment and Grubhub.  Be warned.
2371,5,Negative,Feels like home!
2372,3,Negative,The food was great but the driver was an hour late. I had purposely preordered because I’m working from home and in meetings all day but my meetings were interrupted by phone calls because the driver had difficulty finding my duplex. The first time she was in a shopping center nowhere near me.
2373,1,Negative,They delivered to the wrong address for some reason. :(
2374,3,Positive,Too far from my house...but good food when it finally arrived!
2375,1,Negative,The rice smelled and tasted moldy
2376,5,Positive,"Have a tough time finding me but its good indian food almost all the time, as in thier hours, thier foods been good everytime. Mild{2☆} is pretty hot. I'm going to try 1☆, hope it's not too hot. Good Food!!"
2377,4,Positive,"Good food, good communication with delivered 20 mins late"
2378,2,Negative,"Missing items.
Example: Order stuffed Naan, didn't get it. 
Ordered drinks ..nope.

HAD A PRINTOUT OF THE ORDER WITH THOSE ITEMS.

Took two hours to deliver.

No, will not order from them again."
2379,1,Negative,"Ordered twice in two days, both days waited for a delivery that the restaurant & app said was being worked on & out for delivery. Both times never showed up. Had to be refunded twice, doordash/seamless couldn't even contact them because they won't answer. Don't trust this place, they'll take your money while pretending to be open & never make anything. "
2380,1,Neutral,WORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRST SERVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVICE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER
2381,5,Positive,"Amazing Naan, super chicken Tikka Masala.  Food was wonderfully packaged and warm. 

Arrived within 5 min of delivery window and besides the rice being a little off the rest was perfect. 

Will be ordering again. "
2382,3,Positive,The food was great. Absolutely what we wanted. But the delivery was almost 40 minutes late and we couldn't even contact anyone to determine if it was even coming. It was almost two hours between order and delivery.
2383,1,Negative,"I kept calling and they said they would get back to us, when they contacted their driver.  Never heard anything from them and never got an order.  They promised my money back but we never received it back."
2384,4,Negative,They forgot the rice which in the reviews is apparently common.
2385,2,Positive,"The order was delivered over half an hour later then expected, due to the resteraunt not having the food ready for the driver. The food once we got it tasted okay, but overall felt overpriced for what you are getting.  We ordered chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan, and the aloo bonda. Don't bother with the aloo bonda they're like 6 dollars and we only recieved 3 little ones (almost felt like there were meant to be more and they didn't get put in the box). Overall there are lots of Indian food places in the area that are similarly priced and better quality."
2386,2,Negative,"My order was suppose to be delivered around 5:35 pm, but the driver from Everett did not arrive with my Indian food until 7pm!

I don’t know if your Company waits for another order before it delivered my $87.50 order, but for the price I paid and the MEDIOCRE food at Bombay Grill, it is not worth the whole price!

I definitely would not recommend your service or Bombay Grill even to my worst enemy.  The least your company can do is give me a $30.00 refund or credit for the next order, if that is all you can do!

I normally don’t issue such a blatant comment, but this one surpasses the worst service and food compared to your competitors!

For your kind and immediate attention.

Brenda H. at brendahaslett@gmail.com"
2387,3,Positive,Food was okay at best over cooked under seasoned 
2388,1,Negative,"An hour and 45 minutes late. Called half an hour after it was supposed to be delivered, said it would be here in 15 minutes. Another hour later, called GrubHub, they called the restaurant and said the driver was 5 minutes away. Another 15 minutes later the food was delivered with the drink in a covered bowl? Do yourself a favor and don't order from here."
2389,2,Neutral,"I almost never post reviews, but this was so gloriously bad I had to say something. Late, bad food and incorrect menu items delivered. Kinda funny actually. Order at your own peril!"
2390,1,Negative,"This is a money grab.  Food isn’t what I expected at all.  The appetizer was not right, the order was an hour delayed, and my rice was missing."
2391,1,Negative,"Thought I would be lucky and have better service. Ordered food at 11 pm for a 12 am drop off, restaurant called me at 12:40 am and it was handed to me at 1:10. Food was okay."
2392,1,Negative,The delivery was not contactless despite claiming to be. 
2393,1,Negative,"I should have read the reviews.  Everything that is being said was true of my experience: The food was an hour late, the portions very small, the food was bland and oddly sweet, one curry tasted like pumpkin spice.  Don't order from here."
2394,1,Negative,This is the worst place to ever order food from they rip me off 
2395,1,Positive,The samosas were unedible burned to a crisp I can even send a picture to prove it
2396,1,Negative,"Subpar on all levels. Did not follow order notes. Did not communicate to  indicate any delay. 40 minutes late, food cold and unexceptional. Avoid unless you are into over paying for incomplete others that arrive forty minutes late. Will not be ordering again."
2397,1,Negative,Took long to bring me my food they didn’t know what time they where bringing and was very rude when asking questions about my delivery 
2398,1,Negative,"I never recieved my order
"
2399,1,Negative,"Protip: save yourself some money and pour a bottle of expired ketchup on some soggy, undercooked rice, take one bite, then put the whole thing in the trash. You'll have had the same experience as if you'd ordered food from this  ""restaurant""."
2400,1,Negative,"Food was decent and slightly warm. However, the unexpected two hour delivery time (estimated delivery time was 40-50 min) was not so good. Not sure if it’s a Grubhub or restaurant issue. "
2401,2,Negative,The driver got lost and when arrived so me for a tip even when I gave her 7 dollar tip with my  credit card
2402,1,Negative,Probably the worst Indian food I’ve ever tasted. They’re serving garbage with garbage service. Please don’t support. 
2403,3,Negative,My order was over a hour late and I requested silverware and plates which were not with my order.
2404,1,Negative,"I asked for butter chicken very hot and I am not even joking, it was sweet. Oh God. Sweet as tamarind juice mixed with tomato puree with added sugar and absolutely no spices. And the garlic naan hardly had any garlic on it. Tandoori platter is no where even close to being tandoori . This is a rip off. NEVER in my life did I eat something as bad as this. I swear. I am sorry for such a bad review. I don't mean to disrespect anyone else but the one who prepared my order today..."
2405,4,Neutral,Need more season to the food to dry
2406,1,Negative,Delivery was an hour late. 2 of the 3 things we ordered we're just plain not good. Chicken Tika masala was the only thing that actually got eaten. 
2407,1,Negative,"It’s 1:31am. I’m still waiting. 2 hrs and 15 minutes after I ordered. Called. The guy said, oh, the driver broke down and he’s on his way. Called again just now and no one picked up. I need to go to bed. ALL the reviews you read are true. I can’t believe such a place does exist and is part of the GrubHub portfolio. I’m livid. I’m seriously and utter disbelief....  "
2408,1,Negative,food not good and not even delivered on time.
2409,1,Negative,"Multiple items in my order were wrong. I didn’t receive one of the items I ordered. One of my items was inedible due. They arrived on time, but the food quality was very poor. I ordered my curry very spicy and it arrived sweet. It’s all just so bland. A disservice to actual Indian food. "
2410,1,Negative,"Food was very bad! Would have preferred 0 rating, but had to give 1. Meat was partially cooked, base gravy was the same even for different menu items, naan was thick and alright, Biriyani was also extremely disappointing. I will never order from here again. 

Delivery was on time, so no issues on that front. "
2411,3,Positive,The food doesn't have as much flavour as other places but it's good.
2412,1,Negative,"By far the worst experience I've ever had ordering food. I will never ever use this service and order from this restaurant. Completely unacceptable. I don't understand how they are in business. Food never showed up and on top of that. They never ever called , I called and asked about the food and they hung up."
2413,1,Negative,"Bad food, bland and poor quality. Arrived 40 minutes late."
2414,1,Negative,Good food.  Stressful service.  Didn't get my entire order missing my drink.  Paid $58.00 to be told to meet at the leasing office because my unit number doesn't make sense. Unacceptable
2415,1,Negative,I never got my food and never got a call or anything to tell me. I contacted restaurant and they said the order was on the way. Never arrived. Will not order again.
2416,1,Negative,"Late, under seasoned, and didn't respect the contact less delivery. wont be ordering from here again."
2417,3,Negative,"Delivery was 30 minutes late

The tracking did not show my order leaving the restaurant, and how far or close the driver was

 The salmon I ordered did not get delivered"
2418,1,Negative,"Order was an hour late because they""missed seeing it,"" food was poor quality. The fried foods were lathered in salt and dry- we had to throw most of them out. The tomato soup tasted like it was from a can. First and last time ordering from here."
2419,3,Negative,"Sauce was spilled in the bag. The container was carried upside down.  Also, there was no cutlery.  Food was otherwise good."
2420,1,Negative,We did not get what we all ordered. Some items did not come. There was some black plastic in one of the food. I chewed on it. I want my money back.
2421,2,Neutral,Food took over 2 hours to be delivered.
2422,1,Negative,"YAAR ,KYUN MATALAB KYUN ,,ESA KHANAA KHAA KE MUJHE RONA AGEA ,THIS NOT F U C K I N G INDIAN OR PAKISTANI FOOD WAT THEY SERVING IN EVERYONE.

2423,2,Negative,"Delivery was an hour later than the given delivery time, food was cold."
2424,3,Positive,"Good food, just arrived an hour late"
2425,1,Negative,"The food was late close to 3 hours, it did taste good, I had to call three times for an update. I would not order again and I won't recommend this restaurant"
2426,1,Negative,"Apparently this restaurant is now in Lake City, please be aware before ordering. We ordered because the 1st Ave S location would have been very close to our house. We called multiple times, as the man on the phone when we called the restaurant was very rude, refused to even provide us with any info regarding our order, and hung up on us the first two times we were able to get anyone on the phone. When the food finally arrived 2 hours and 25 minutes after ordering, the driver asked for a tip . Straight. Up. Asked. This not entirely the fault of Bombay Grill, Grubhub bears a lot of the responsibility due to the out of date listing, but it’s enough of a gaffe on everyone’s part that I will never use either party’s services again."
2427,1,Negative,"It arrived almost an hour late, and tasted very strange - I am uncertain as to the quality of the ingredients (even the potatoes tasted off). Nobody ever picked up the phone when we called to ask about our order."
2428,1,Negative,Food was on time. They called 3 times while on their way. They then called again 3 hours after dropping food off. The food was horrible. I wouldn't even call it Indian food. Very dissatisfied.
2429,1,Negative,"my food came late , food was not good. in top of that missing item.  "
2430,3,Neutral,"Rice was standard white, not basmati."
2431,1,Negative,"The restaurant address is wrong; I drove to the listed location on Grubhub, and called them to find out they are in a completely different part of town. I did not go to pick it up there. Grubhub needs to update their database, and also insist on the same from their listings. Otherwise, remove them. "
2432,4,Positive,I did already
2433,1,Neutral,"I ordered 2 rice, 2 chicken Tika masala, and 2 nan bread. And all I got was two chicken masala and one order of nan. And the delivery was late by 1hr and 30min. I want a refund. "
2434,1,Negative,"The delivery was literally a full hour late, it was cold, the samosas were soggy, the rice was really salty (it seemed like they put half a salt shaker into the 8""x8"" takeout container). The naan, butter chicken, and saag paneer were alright, but like mentioned, cold."
2435,3,Positive,Overall food was good but I ordered garlic naan and got regular naan. 😥
2436,5,Positive,Address on the app said white center but the location is actually up in lake city. Takes extra time but great food.  
2437,1,Negative,My order was three hours late. 
2438,2,Negative,My order was over two hours late. I was not pleased.
2439,1,Negative,I never got my food
2440,1,Negative,My order was 2 hours late. And my food was cold. And my order was wrong. And when I requested a refund the restaurant said no.
2441,1,Negative,ordered food at 11:30pm. waited till 3:30am. never received food. was charged $50.
2442,1,Negative,I haven't received my order
2443,1,Negative,I want a refund.  The restaurant was not reminding the problem.  Call me
2444,2,Negative,"The food was decent, part of the order was missing, it was 45 minutes late, and not hot."
2445,1,Positive,Fire the cook
2446,1,Negative,"This restaurant is marked as permanently closed on Google and Yelp, not sure how GrubHub is still delivering from a closed restaurant.

The food arrived 2 hours later than expected, the Garlic naan was more like a pita bread, than a naan. Curries tasted stale and extremely tangy."
2447,2,Negative,"After an hour and a half of waiting, I called the restaurant to enquire about our order. The woman told me she had just got in an was only just making our food now. She told me that my food would arrive in under 30 minutes but it did not arrive until an hour after that. The food itself was not great. I ordered the saag paneer but they only included a few pieces of paneer. The bread was not made that day and my husband did not want to finish his butter chicken."
2448,1,Negative,"I ordered food at about midnight and they told me the food would be delivered in an hour and guess what happened?? They never delivered my food not even a text or call from the restaurant, when trying to sort out a refund of $37.09 they refused!! Will not order from here again, big rip off and they take your money without providing the service"
2449,3,Negative,"The stew was good, no two ways around that. Full of flavor and very hearty. However, the description made it sound as though it was chock full of seafood. 3 shrimp and 4 muscles do not a seafood stew make. Also, very small portion for the price tag. It came in a pint container. The rice is ridiculous. Just plain soggy white rice. No fluff, no flavor. Just soggy white rice. Not even basmati or jasmine. Gross. The naan was undercooked and $2.50 a slice! I'm staying at a hotel in the area, and they refused to deliver to my room. I ordered a mango drink and received what I believe to be a pint of orange rose water. Not great. "
2450,1,Negative,My food never came. I called said it would be on the way but still never showed up. Never again!
2451,1,Negative,BOO! HISS. AWFUL.
2452,1,Negative,"I've only ever bothered writing good reviews mainly cause I've never had any truly horrible experiences with an order...until now. This restaurant did not even come close to fulfilling what I ordered nor did what they decided to send me come close to being edible. I even called the restaurant to make sure there were no mushrooms in the lentil soup cause of an allergy and was assured there wasn't, what did they decide to send? Mushroom soup, not even lentil soup. There wasn't a language barrier when I spoke to guy who claimed he'd be preparing the food. Overall the worse culinary experience I've ever had on or off grubhub. "
2453,1,Negative,"worst food I ever tasted, chicken felt stale, and delivery took 2.5 hours - wish I could get my money back"
2454,1,Negative,Very long wait and driver was late. Food was not fresh. Too salty. Poured or drinks in a plastic soup container not cup with straw.
2455,4,Negative,"This food was so delicious. However, it didn't specify the amount of naan you'll get in the description and it was literally just ONE piece for my husband and I... that was annoying. 🙄 That and the fact that they were 30 minutes later than the original 70-90 minute window is why I'm giving a 4 star rating instead of 5. The food was definitely 5 stars."
2456,1,Negative,ordered food almost 2 hours ago.  called twice.  first time i was put on extended hold.  second time I was told its on its way. W.T.F.
2457,5,Positive,Good food friendly people I will Order again 
2458,1,Negative,"One time okay , when you really hungry otherwise don't recommend anyone"
2459,5,Positive,Food was good and staff was friendly and I will order again 
2460,1,Negative,"Delivery never showed up, and I was hung up on several times when trying to call the restaurant about it. I called Grubhub twice and was told the order was 20 mins away both times. I eventually canceled after it was over two hours late and Bombay grill kept saying it was still 20 mins away. It was a large order, i guess they were hoping we wouldn’t complain or try to get our money back from an order that NEVER showed up. Completely ridiculous and awful service and a rip off. They sent me a $10 off coupon which is completely useless bc I will NEVER be ordering from here again and I suggest anyone else considering it save the time and frustration and do the same. "
2461,1,Negative,"After calling numerous times, left a message and finally got a hold of them after almost three hours past my order, I called to cancel my order. They said “it’s no problem”, but really it was for me because I was hangry!!!! Not impressed."
2462,1,Negative,food took 2 hours 
2463,1,Negative,They were rude not helpful and the food was not that great
2464,3,Negative,"Good food, slow delivery"
2465,1,Negative,They were nearly 3 1/2 hours late. I received no apology and items were missing from my order. It will be a long time before I am willing to give Bombay Grill a shot again.
2466,1,Positive,"Food is good when they actually deliver the right thing. Took three and a half hours to get delivered. 

Delivery driver creepily waited outside for 20 minutes after delivery, and went on about how it was a half an hour drive from the restaurant. The restaurant is half a mile away."
2467,1,Negative,"Order was 2 hours late, very little food for high price. "
2468,1,Negative,It’s late. Period.
2469,2,Negative,My order was 2 hours late and while food was good. I was not able to eat during my scheduled lunch period 
2470,2,Positive,"The 'very spicy' lamb vindaloo was all vinegar, and almost no spice, I've had spicier mild butter chicken. The butter chicken itself was ok. The rice was bland. The spiced paneer naan wasn't as good as it normally is from this restaurant, dryer than usual, at least it was spicy"
2471,1,Negative,My food was not delivered after being 2 hours late and promised it would be. 
2472,1,Negative,"Never order from this place. Very bad customer service, it seems they are scum company. I ordered twice from this place and the place didn't even complete the delivery. I waited for 2 hours and later learned there was no driver even sent for the delivery. They are the worst, they suck. Don't waste your time here. "
2473,1,Negative,"Order was over 30 minutes late. The man that delivered our food was rude. Food was very cold and not good, drink was melted. I would like a refund for this terrible order!! I am extremely upset with this order!!!!"
2474,1,Negative,"The food was awful, it was late. The driver was nice."
2475,1,Negative,"My order was delivered over an hour late. When I called the restaurant I was told the food was on its way and would be there in 10 minutes- then got a call 30 minutes later from the driver telling me he was 25 minutes away in a different town. When food finally arrived it was packaged in Mexican themed bags clearly not from this restaurant and some the food was put directly into a plastic bag, instead of a takeout container! Pretty sure that is a food safety issue. The driver frantically returned a few minutes later trying to give me a pizza he thought I’d ordered- must be doing deliveries for several restaurants at once all over town."
2476,3,Neutral,"The food was good, but not everything we ordered (and paid for!) showed up."
2477,4,Neutral,It was ok. I would probably try something different and order early next time. 
2478,1,Negative,"Driver extremely rude, food was not even warm. "
2479,2,Neutral,"The restaurant was good, but it took over 2 hours for us to get our food delivered "
2480,4,Positive,"Good food, very nice staff. Will order again. "
2481,2,Negative,Didn't like the sweet taste and the lamb pockets I got were dry and empty
2482,1,Neutral,They were over an hour late with delivery but the food was very good 
2483,1,Negative,"Never arrived, restaurant did not answer phone. "
2484,1,Negative,"Terrible experience all around! The food took 2 1/2 hrs to arrive. It was cold and the order was completely wrong. I tried eating some but it was awful. While waiting for the food, I called the restaurant 3 times and they said “the driver is on the way, should be 15-20 minutes” every time. Obviously they had no idea what they were talking about. NEVER AGAIN

Grubhub did refund my money. Thank you for that!
"
2485,1,Negative,Poor food quality and flavoring. Lack of communication on delivery and order status
2486,4,Positive,Delicious! Wrapped up well. 
2487,1,Negative,Order was over two hours late and wasn't what we ordered also was not good food at all. Terrible restaurant
2488,1,Negative,1 hour late. Freezing cold and naan was damp.Raita was long past it's expiration and my order was wrong. Don't waste your 
2489,2,Negative,"I was told I would receive my delivery within 60 minutes, I was also under the impression per the app that the restaurant was only 2 miles away. Almost 90 minutes later I received a text from the delivery driver saying he was 20 minutes away coming from a neighboring city, I'm not sure if that was a reflection of where the restaurant was or where he was coming from having not yet picked up our food. The food ended up showing up almost an hour late, again not sure if that was reflection of the driver, restaurant or both. When the food arrived it looked like it had been delivered by Ace Ventura, the packaging was all smashed up. We also found that two of our food items had not been delivered, definitely a reflection of the restaurant. The driver was pleasant and professional at the door. This was not a satisfactory delivery and we would like a refund for the items that were not delivered."
2490,1,Negative,It took two hours for the delivery to get to us. I called at the hour mark and was told it will get there when it gets there. The order was missing sauces and the included no utensils. I ordered a gyros plate got a gyro. Overall a poor experience. Wont order from this restaurant ever again.
2491,3,Positive,"the food and driver were great, but i never got the kofta. It was a long wait, again food and ppl were nice, but I won't risk this again"
2492,1,Negative,Nothing arrived refund please 
2493,1,Negative,"I didn't get the food they said they would be an hour late then call me 2 hours later when I'm asleep with my food. Don't buzz or leave my food at the stoop.

Want my money back"
2494,1,Negative,I never received my order or was notified about any part of it. 
2495,2,Positive,The food was great but there is no communication from the restaurant throughout the entire delivery process and my order was nearly four hours late. Waking up to a phone call about a driver being lost at one in the morning is very surreal. The food is at least really good and cheaper than most but im not sure that makes up for having to walk outside in pajamas on a different date than you placed the order just to get the food. 
2496,1,Negative,"Food was late. Food was absolutely terrible, I threw half of it away. I would have thrown it all away if I wasn't starving. One star for the driver. Terrible. Save your money. You've been warned."
2497,1,Negative,"The order was completely wrong, over an hour late, and cold when I finally got it. I called the restaurant multiple times to ask about my order and when they did answer were rude every time. When I called to tell them my order was wrong they said they couldn't give me a refund because I had the food. And I told them the food was cold as well they told me that the chef was gone. This place is beyond awful. The treat their customers like trash and what they call food didn't look like "
2498,1,Positive,To call this an Indian restaurant is a disgrace to the Indian community... let me tell you about it.. when do you get it? 2 hours later!! raita? Sent 2 big containers of ranch!! .. chatni with the pkode? ALSO RANCH. Supposedly 4 different types of pakore.. what did I get? 1 type soaked in oil!! Shahi paneer? Threw paneer pieces into marinara sauce! Dal makhni? Lentils in just water!! Guess what then? I called them and he said... you’re a proper Indian aren’t you? I’ll surely have to refund you. Which was the only bright side of my entire night.
2499,5,Positive,"The food was hot, well wrapped and amazing. The driver was also fantastic. "
2500,1,Negative,They gave us what they wanted to give us it was nothing we even ordered 
2501,3,Negative,"They are decent in some dishes. really disappointed with a signature indian dish: Byriani. .
24/7 was awesome but I wont order from them again."
2502,4,Neutral,Appetizer was delivered without pita bread. Otherwise all was fabulous
2503,5,Positive,"THE OWNER WAS SO KIND TO ME. HE TOOK CARE OF MY ORDER.  THE FOOD WAS VERRRYY DELICIOUS.  Thank you so much.
I really do APPRECIATE it!
Sincerely, 
Jeffrey M."
