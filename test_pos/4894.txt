b"My Boyfriend and I came here the other day. He had mentioned to me this was something he wanted to try so I purchased a Groupon for the both of us. I called and made a reservation and advised them of the Groupon I purchased so it made check in that much easier.Danielle greeted us, checked us in and was our Range Master as well. Just wanted to say she was very friendly and didn't mind giving me some pointers to help my shooting! I appreciated her friendliness. There were also four others that made a reservation for the same time so we all enjoyed the experience together. Check in process:Everyone signs a waiver.Watch instructional video.Have fun & shoot some arrows!The environment is very laid back and I didn't feel pressured or uncomfortable at all. With it being our first time we shot some arrows over the targets, into each other's targets and we even hit the target haha. It was a lot of fun! We both agreed we'd come back and shoot again some time."
