b"We stopped by this restaurant on a trip to Las Vegas. The restaurant is mostly focused on take out and delivery, which means they don't have a lot of tables. That's actually a good thing. It has a nice intimate atmosphere, not crowded.Because they don't have tons of tables, they focus on making good food. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Wor Wonton Soup, and Egg Foo Young, which they make fresh, unlike other restaurants.I definitely recommend Golden Gate if you're looking for good, fresh Chinese food, either for delivery or to sit down."
