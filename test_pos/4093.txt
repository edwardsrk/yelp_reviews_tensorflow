b'Visiting Phoenix from Central Pennsylvania. Saw an advertisement in a travel magazine, was initially skeptical. Menu online looked good, plenty of gluten free selections for my wife (easy to read, well labeled). Made a reservation online, noted that one party had a gluten allergy. Arrived early, friendly staff who graciously accepted us early (we arrived about 15-20 minutes early). Did not pawn us off on the bar, but instead asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We picked inside. Outside had nice variety of tables and a nice open fire, great "foody" smell that really drew you in. Once seated, team member came over with glasses and poured water for us. Menu was great, server came over and noted the allergy and went through the menu with my with my wife and discussed substitution options. Great drink menu, good selection. Great timing of appetizers and entrees. My wife had the salmon rillettes, which were absolutely delicious. She also had the cast iron petite chicken (with mashed potatoes instead of the stuffing). Great presentation, chicken cooked perfectly, great flavors. Best mashed potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant. I had the beckett\'s table signature fork tender short ribs. Also got a side of the wood oven roasted bacon biscuit stuffing. All I can say is WOW... Truly fork tender, and truly awesome. I love stuffing, sad but true. This was the best stuffing that I have ever had. Presentation was perfect, stuffing side came in a small cast iron dish. Nice little aside, there are pig figurines throughout the restaurant. When asked, learned that folks have been ending them since they opened. Awesome little thing that is fun to check out all around the restaurant. I would definitely recommend, and hope to make it back sooner rather than later!'
