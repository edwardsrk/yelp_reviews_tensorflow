b"I visited this place with my friends last night. I didn't have much experience with Thai food before so I was a bit skeptical... However, the pad thai and the beef (can't remember exact name) was delicious! The jasmine rice we ordered on the side made a nice addition. Also, the waitress was polite and friendly. It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be going back!"
