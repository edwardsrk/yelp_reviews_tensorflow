b'Appetizer of cheese curds with a smoky garlic red sauce were good...very flavorful. Our 2 1/2 year old enjoyed her yummy PBJ and we were especially appreciative of the fact they offered seasonal fresh fruit as an option. The nice size bowl included mandarin and Sunkist oranges, Apples and strawberries. She also loved the corn and chicken chowder and ate half of her Daddies. My husband ordered the black rye IPA and the red ale. I ordered the porter. We enjoyed them all. Along with the cup of soup, my husband and I shared a half havarti and turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread. The avocado was very fresh and the basil pesto mayo was good too. Our waiter, Tanner was sweet and efficient. The booth was big and comfy. Overall we very much enjoyed lunch here.'
