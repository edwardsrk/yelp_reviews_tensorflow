b"Have really enjoyed this Starbucks lately because of the friendly and helpful staff. Seems to have lots of regulars by the way staff speaks to their customers. This location is consistently busy....all the time! But the line goes by pretty fast and the accuracy of the coffees are always right. It's nice to shop and drink a Starbucks.I would not recommend this location for meeting with friends or business because it's fairly loud and never any seats available. But that's what happens when you go to a good Starbucks."
