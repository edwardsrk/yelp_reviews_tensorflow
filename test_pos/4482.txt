b"After some extensive searching here on Yelp, my husband and I decided to try La Mestiza for dinner. The place is tiny, but we actually enjoyed the intimate atmosphere. The waiter was quick and responsive despite being the only server for all the tables. I order a margarita and was blown away. It was the best margarita I had ever had. The flavor was just the right amount of sweet and salty. For dinner we both had the enchilada special which consisted of 3 enchiladas in a red, white, and green sauce. The portions were smaller than what you'd usually see at a Mexican restaurant but I'd say they were perfect. I loved the dish and didn't feel like I'd over eaten. We will definitely be back!"
