b'Wow, just wow!! I saved the best restaurant for last and it didn\'t disappoint, in fact, the food and ambiance exceeded my expectations. It was really cool and fun to walk through the pawn shop into the restaurant. I loved seeing all the guitars on the wall.Based on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!Based on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that\'s artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I\'d go back for this dish alone it was so good.Next, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I\'d ever had.Sadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine "S" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below. The restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.Amazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I\'m already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.Make this your #1 restaurant pick in Las Vegas. It\'s pure heaven for foodies!!'
