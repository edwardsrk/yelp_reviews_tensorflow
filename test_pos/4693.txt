b"Chada Thai, Ocha, and Weera fans, you've got serious competition. This place has southern Thai food that rivals the best in town and beats street food in Bangkok. Thai beef salad is incredible. Soups are great, and the noodle dishes have complex and spicy flavors. Even their dry chili has a smoky taste unlike the rest. Of that's enough, this place has soul. It's a late night spot, often busy after midnight. And there is usually someone playing on stage."
