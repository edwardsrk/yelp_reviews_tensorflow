b'Back in Dec. 2014, I wrote a negative review of this store, and gave it a 2-star rating due to one negative experience. Despite my characteristic "you get one opportunity" attitude, I continued to patronize this store (because it\'s the closest location to my house), and I\'m glad I did! Since the one frustrating experience, the staff, notably Desiree and a couple of the male clerks (whose names I am forgetting but Austin is one, and the other guy has dark hair and a beard - sorry!) have been consistently professional, polite, good natured and efficient. I have been in the store dozens of times and have had nothing but good experiences since my original complaint/review. In the past 9 months, they\'ve more than redeemed themselves, IMO, and I\'m a harsh critic with high expectations. They have earned each of their 5 stars. Bear in mind, this is not a big store, but I\'ve been able to get all my printing, copying, and shipping needs met there.'
