b"I had a surprise dinner birthday celebration at Dressler's for my wife and invited her closest family members and friends. Many of the out of town guests arrived early. That combined with my wife arriving late created as much as an hour gap.  No worries, the professional staff made the guest feel welcomed and relaxed as they mingled waiting for my wife. As dinner began, perfection went to another level. The staff served our 21 guests with the same service as a private dinner for two.  Our guests kept asking what the appetizers were, because they were satisfied as if those could be an entree. After the salads, entrees arrived (ribeye, halibut, crab cakes). The flavor & presentation was perfection! All guests couldn't leave any on their plate. We even had a guest that requested a Vegan dish (not on the menu), the chef delivered and our guest enjoyed the custom service. Jon Dressler, Kent Voss, Brittany, MJ and the entire kitchen and bar staff made a lasting memory!"
