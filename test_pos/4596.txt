b"My partner and I work a lot of hours and sometimes we put in our most hours from home. We recently relocated to Fort Mill and decided to try Milano's for lunch delivery. The food was fantastic. Don't let t he minimum delivery charge ($35) fool you. We ordered two huge salads (the grilled chicken and the antipasto) and wings which we had with the leftover salad for dinner. So for $35 ($35.60 to be exact because we ordered an extra dressing) we had two fantastic meals and we didn't need to leave our home. Our food was delivered within the expected time frame, and the delivery guy was super friendly.If you live in the Fort Mill area, work a lot, happen to work form home from time to time and don't have the time or supplies in the fridge to make your own lunch/dinner, Milano's is great."
