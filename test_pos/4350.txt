b"Dr. J serves from the heart!  I hadn't received a chiropractic adjustment in more than a decade, and she took the time to learn about my health challenges & even found some that I was not aware I had.  I had severe weakness & pain in my right hand, and could barely grip, twist, or carry anything with it.  Within my 1st session with her, I immediately experienced relief & increased movement.Dr. J listens & treats according to MY needs, and not her own agenda.  I highly recommend her services!"
