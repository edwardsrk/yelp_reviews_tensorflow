b"Considering I just wrote a review about the horrible part of my Las Vegas trip, I might as well pay a compliment!I stayed at GVR on NYE for the first time, and it was absolutely gorgeous.  Our flight arrived way before our check-in time, but we were still able to check into a room - which was great.  The customer service is amazing, both in the hotel, casino, and the sushi restaurant I ate in that night.The room was clean, a decent size (standard room)... and had everything we needed in it.  It was nice to stay in a good resort, and not be on the strip!  Everything was clean, exceeded my standards, and was the ONLY positive thing about my trip to Vegas!The pool area outside is absolutely amazing, I wish it had been warmer outside!  I most certainly plan on coming back to this resort.The ONLY word of caution I have (which isn't a big thing at all)... is pay attention to their shuttle times.  Coming from the airport, I believe they only run once every 3 hours or so.  I had to get a cab over to the resort, which isn't the end of the world - but if you can book your flight properly so you have time to catch the shuttle, why not!"
