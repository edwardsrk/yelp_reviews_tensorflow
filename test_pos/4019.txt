b'If you are looking for absolutely gorgeous flowers and wonderful people to work with for your wedding or event then the Enchanted Florist team is the place to go. The first time me and mother in law met Moe and explained our wedding theme she knew exactly what we wanted and was able to explain how she would do it right on the spot. She was the first person that really helped us envision the wedding. Moe was delightful to work with and the flowers for my wedding were more than we could have ever hoped for! They were absolutely stunning. Moe is by far the best and I could not have envisions my wedding without her.'
