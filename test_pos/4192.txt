b"I was completely amazed by this place, as we opted for the all you can eat option for two. We were blown away on the quality & taste of the food. It was a great experience. Each roll contained eight servings, which I didn't expect. The variety and choices were countless. My favorites were the Vegas Lasagna, Tuna Poki and Lobster Crunch. It was a delicious and incredibly filling meal. Will totally return each time we're in Las Vegas. Loved it!!"
