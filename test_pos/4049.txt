b"This place is small and quaint,and has awesome food.The eggplant and tofu was close to authentic and they didn't add to much salt.Taste great just the way they make with there sauce.Awesome cooked and served hot  and right.The shredded pork and bamboo was great.I like the different added peppers to make it spicy.Dont see That to often in a Chinese dish.The spicy taste was great and flavor of bamboo and whole dish was great.Light on the salt was great also served hot and right.Refer this place to anybody.Service was good also."
