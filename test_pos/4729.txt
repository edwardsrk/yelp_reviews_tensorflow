b'Second time eating here, even better than the first time. While I did not partake in the AYCE, the staff was just as attentive and friendly. Sakana still has the best fish to rice proportion of nagiri I have ever had. The albacore nagiri with the garlic sauce is simply divine and the salmon was fresh. Same with the honey toast for dessert, my only minor complaint with the toast is that it stuck to the bottom of the dish (not a big deal though). Definitely planning a return trip soon.'
