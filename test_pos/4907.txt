b"Jasmine made my sweet doggie, Thoreau, even more cuddly! He's a Papillon-Dachshund mix. I didn't have much instruction for her, and she just made him look adorable with his ears and tail left long, trimmed just beautifully.It helps that there are plenty of cookies and bones to pick up to spoil the pup after his show of bravery (he's a nervous guy sometimes). Thanks everyone! Everyone was really friendly from my phone call to make the appointment to checking out."
