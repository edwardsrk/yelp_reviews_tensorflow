b"Love Miro's! Have been there several times and haven't had a bad meal. The paella is authentic and delicious. Good selection of wines. Great patio area-so if you can eat outside, do.Allergy Alert: I have had no problem with cross contamination here. I stick to what I know I can eat and I am fine."
