b'Atlas moved us from Oakville, Ontario to London, Ontario this past week and it was a great experience! The final cost was in line with the estimate provided. The crew was punctual, worked hard and quickly with an excellent sense of humour. Their price was extremely competitive with quotes obtained from other moving companies. Thank you!'
