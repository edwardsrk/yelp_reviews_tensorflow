b'We usually stop at Juniper Grill in Peters Township. Very glad we decided to go here today. I really enjoyed the rotisserie chicken tortilla soup as a starter but the special of the day was really spectacular. It was scallops over rice with a delicious lobster sauce and a very interesting coleslaw.My wife is enjoying the shrimp and crab enchiladas also.'
