b"This is my happy place. I love their Flan Patissier and the Parfait Chocolat. So much so that I cannot buy one without buying the other. But if I had to pick, I would consider trading in my lovely husband  for a lifetime supply of the Parfait Chocolat. I wouldn't actually do it because somebody has to do the dishes at my house, but I would CONSIDER it for a few seconds. There is something indescribably amazing about bitter chocolate mousse encases a spongy cake and topped with chocolate sauce. Everything I have tried here (most of the sweet stuff, haven't tried the bread) is just decadent and lovely. Go. Try. You will not be disappointed ."
