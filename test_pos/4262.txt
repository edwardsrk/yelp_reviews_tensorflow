b"Best breakfast burrito ever! I can't wait to come back to Phoenix so I can eat here again. I don't even like soy cheese but the country breakfast burrito rocked my world.. I would have loved to eat it with a fork and knife on a plate, but even in its basket the taste was amazing and I know I'll be craving it until my next Arizona adventure. Service was super friendly, my latte with hazelnut milk was on point, and the garlicky salsa that came with the burrito was pure magic. They only serve breakfast, and the menu isn't up on the board as that is full of all the bakery treats and beverages. I'd love to see a larger menu, or even some menus by the door for more accessibility. Luckily I knew about the food from yelp, so I just asked the people in front of me to pass a menu back. It's a little awkward to not be able to see a menu until it's your turn to order if others are in line behind you. Overall, great job Nami! You've got to taste it to believe it."
