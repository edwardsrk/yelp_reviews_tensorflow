b"This library is amazing. Brand spanking new. Presse Cafe on the main level serves up some decent stuff. Study rooms with plugs in the table for group work. If you are a student in Whitby or Durham and can get here, I would definitely recommend it! Totally trumps the libraries in Toronto when it comes to study space. Haven't had to get any materials but the space is amazing. Wifi available for everyone, just log in. If you don't have a card just ask for a guest pass. Unlimited access if you have your own computer; 30 minutes if you want to use a computer. Totally impressed!"
