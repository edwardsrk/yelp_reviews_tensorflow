b"I live in NYC and needed to purchase a couple of last-minute toiletries for my stay. I had a hard time finding them because of all the construction...and they had moved to another location. I had to ask several people for directions - better signage would help. I also didn't realize that there was a whole concourse level of shopping! Once I found them everything was fine. The store is brand new! Well lit, well organized, decent prices and good selection (for what I was looking for). Again, just had to grab a couple of things but I was in and out in 15 min."
