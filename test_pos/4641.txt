b"The BEST meal I had in Toronto or a tie to the Roti I had.We went during their Hooch Hour (5-7pm) to take advantage of the drink and shots specials ($5 drinks and $2 shots). You can't beat this as liquor is so regulated in Toronto. Its a happy hour to visit.My boyfriend and I split a lot of the food which is mostly made fresh and in-house...down to the dressing. We both got mixed green salads which were good but not the star. The Mac and Cheese was awesome - I like their twist on the cheeses and backed to perfection. The duck fat fries made us order another batch they were so good. I mean its fried in DUCK FAT! The pulled pork grilled cheese was awesome too and comes with a chutney. You can taste the effort they put into their food.Awesome place for date night or to meet up with friends. It got really packed on a Saturday around 7pm."
