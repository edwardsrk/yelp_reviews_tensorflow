b"I just came here for the first time last week with a friend and I'm bummed I waited so long! Don't be like me and put off coming because the menu seems too fancy. It doesn't matter if you don't know what it is, it's all delicious :p I loved it so much that I brought the boyfriend back in the same week for date night! Everything is top notch here from the food to the service to the ambience. It's low-lit, romantic and BYOB! What more could you ask for? The food is fresh and super flavorful and their menu changes often. First time I had the ramen noodle bowl that came with pork belly, shrimp and a soft egg. So good. The second time I got the wagyu meatloaf that comes topped with crispy fried onions on top of a bed of goat cheese whipped mashed potatoes. Out of this world. We also had the side of honey brussel sprouts which is one of the best things I've ever eaten!! The service is very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Never waited too long for anything. Our table was a little awkwardly positioned which led to our waiter bumping into us a few times so he gave us a free dessert as an apology, which was a nice touch and also so good! Excited to have a great new place in the date night rotation. Seriously go- you will not be disappointed!!"
