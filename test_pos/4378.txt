b"I have been fortunate enough to meet and get to know Matt on a personal level which is why I am posting this for all property owners that when you look for someone to manage a huge investment such as properties, there is no better person to entrust them to than Matt. He is a standup guy that truly understands the needs of a property owner as well as the needs of a renter and does his best to mitigate between the two. As a property owner, having someone rent your home is very personal because you invested so much plus the community and its residents will be affected by who rents in your property and Matt understands this and definitely someone you can entrust to put you at ease and make sure your properties are in great hands and same goes for renters, very professional and thorough and I look forward to giving him my business pretty soon and there's no one else I would feel more comfortable entrusting the proper care of my home than with Matt and his company."
