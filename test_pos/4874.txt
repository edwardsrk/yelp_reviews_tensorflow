b"Monica has been my counselor for 3 months and has really helped me . I feel more confident and at ease. She listens when she needs to and gives me feedback when it's appropriate. I feel excited at the possibilities. All of those issues that have been weighing me down may finally be resolved and set free. If you've ever wondered about talking to a therapist, you should go...and speak to Monica. :)"
