b'I went to this mall a few months ago while on a school trip. Really great mall! It may just be because im used to the ones in Pittsburgh, but there were some really unique stores. Being that it is a larger, older building i really wish that maps of it were more readily available. My friend and i got lost and were 15 minutes late to our check in.'
