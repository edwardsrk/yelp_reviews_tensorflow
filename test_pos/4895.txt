b"I was invited by my wife's gfs to enjoy this place, i was told it would be a Brazilian restaurant. I thought it would be something traditional, to which I wasn't expecting much.When we got to there, the environment got us on the first, cozy and great staff, all owners of this little boutique restaurant, they explain every detail you ask, it shows they care for their reputation and experience for the customer. You feel the Brazilian culture, but something more is there...The food is a fusion of brazilian traditional food, some other latin favorites, all with a special touch. We tried the beef chick poutine, with fried casaba. After we went for the lomito sandwich, that was unexpected, and delicious, imagine pork, with guava bbq, avocado sauce, on a potato bread, and on the side plantain chips! You might think where are the traditional Brazilian choices? They have feijoada, cheese bread, pasteis and others, but we're glad we went on the other side of the menu.Options of beer and wines, i went for the beers, which are no traditional brands, but good drafts.The downside would will be a bit pricy for the portions, but add the flavour and ambient, and the place is totally worthy. Opinion of a Brazilian that enjoys food with unique taste!"
