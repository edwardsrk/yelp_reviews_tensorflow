b"I've eaten here four times since this place opened. This is a fast-casual restaurant. You place your order, get a number, and the food is brought to your table. I can't say enough about what a good deal this place is. You could easily spend the same amount of money at a fast food place and not receive the quality of food or service that you do here.The portions are big. The food is fresh and made-to-order. The food is served on glass plates with real silverware. The service is excellent and very attentive. If you order hot tea or coffee someone is always checking to see if you need a refill.I've tried the omelet, breakfast bowl, and burger. They have all been delicious. I really like the giant zucchini spears and onion rings as a side option instead of french fries.I will be back for sure."
