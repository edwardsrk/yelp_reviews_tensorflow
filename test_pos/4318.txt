b'I was reading the reviews and just amused at some of the negative people and what they find to be negative about.This is a small family run place that serves very good authentic chicken with fantastic rice. All of it was very delicious and to make it even better the owners are there as sweet as can be. Hard working people trying to make a business work in this city is hard enough and also very costly.People that complain about cost know absolutely nothing about what it takes to open and survive in the restaurant business.Good luck to these owners and i will order their food often.Great to have them on this side of town!'
