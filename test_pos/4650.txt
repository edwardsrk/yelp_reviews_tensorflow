b"This place has the best nan bread, it's so good.  The food is authentic vegetarian Indian food.  I admit the sitting area is not too big and appealing.  But the food really triumphant that.  The value is really good too.  When ordering the Vege Thali, you don't have to order a sweet dish if you don't like it.  You can get another vege curry dish instead, no extra charge."
