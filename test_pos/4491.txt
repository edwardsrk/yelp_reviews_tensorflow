b'My friend lives in Las Vegas but I\'m from LA.I asked her to take me to do the best place that sells crepe and Wow!!! Amazing!!!! She introduced me to "what\'s crepe".All my friends love it so much! The crepe itself is so fluffy. Come and get it a try! You\'re gonna love it for sure.I wish you could open a new branch in LA!'
