b"My brother and I came here for lunch and couldn't believe my eyes!!! The whole restaurant has been remodeled, It used to be the courtyard Caf\xc3\xa9, but it's now the copper whisk. We ate here a lot when my brother and my dad would come here to visit and stay at the Orleans and the food was great. The food is still great, an the customer service is still on point. There wasn't very many people there when we got there so we didn't have to wait. Probably because it was the middle part of the day. We were waited on right away an brought our drinks. The food came out quick after we ordered and It was cooked perfectly  an very good. We both had a club sandwich an my brother had onion rings and I had fries. The onion rings were perfect. I'm glad to see that the food and the service is still the same even though the place has been remodeled. Looks like to me it's a little bit smaller but I'm sure it's just because I haven't been there in a while. Love the new look, will go there for lunch again in the near future. Might even try some of the other restaurants that they have there as well. Great memories made there."
