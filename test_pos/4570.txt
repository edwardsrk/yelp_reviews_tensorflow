b"I have only been to two classes so far but love love love Xtend Barre! The instructors have been really patient and helpful. I might have felt confused multiple times but never felt embarrassed by it like I've read happening at other places. And the workouts are tough. I have felt pretty sore so I can tell I'm working my muscles. Bottom line - try it!"
