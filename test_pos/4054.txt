b'I recently ate at Banderas with family members in for the Spring Season baseball games ( Go Giants). Bandera was as busy as any restaurant could be. Our waitress was excellent with so much going on. The chicken salad was the best I have ever had. It has an incredible light sweetness to it with their signature cornbread as croutons. The chicken flavor is very very good. We will return. All other entrees were equally enjoyed.'
