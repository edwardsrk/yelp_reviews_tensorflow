b'Saw another yelper writing that this stadium needs renovation.  NOOOOO!  Leave it the way it is.  I have been to many of the complexes in the area.  While they have done a great job with the architecture of most of them, Scottsdale Stadium rocks because that it is old, a bit disjointed and cozy.  I went to the Talking Stick and saw a game yesterday, but left in the 6th inning to make my way to the Giants/Padre game.  Whilst the other stadiums are sleepy and filled with snowbirds melting in the heat, Scottsdale Stadium is a party surrounding a baseball game.  Leave it the way it is!'
