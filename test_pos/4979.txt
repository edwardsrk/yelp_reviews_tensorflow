b'I have nothing but praise for the Chart House. For one, our waiter (I think Jeff) was totally on point. He was on his game all night. Secondly, when I made the reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything... I thought it was just a common question, but no! They put "Happy Birthday, Mercedes!" on the menu! All 4 of our menu\'s had that message on the top. What a nice, personal touch.Now the food... oooooooooooh the food. I wished I had 4 stomachs so I could eat it all. The lobster bisque was sooo tasty, so was the gazpacho! For my entree, I had the filet mignon with sizzling mushrooms. Everything was delicious. My mom got the stuffed shrimp and let me try - that was also incredible.And the pomegranate mojito tasted like candy!!I would definitely come back to the Chart House again!'
