b'I have always suffered from Acne and have tried many different products from over the counter to Seeking help from a Dermatologist. And I can honestly say that very few products that I tried worked but for a short amount of time before I flared up again, so I had booked a peel series with Kimberly and let me just say that my experience was amazing! She made me feel extremely comfortable and informed me that I would experience dryness and flare ups the first couple sessions due to the "gunk" being forced to the surface. Now that I have completed the series my skin feels soft, my scars are less visible and only have flare ups when it\'s around my monthly cycle. I definitely would recommend this place!'
