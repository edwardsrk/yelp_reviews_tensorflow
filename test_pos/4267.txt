b'Just purchased a 2017 RC 200t F Sport from Bell Lexus North Scottsdale.  Jack Stepler worked with me and did a fantastic job answering my questions all without pressuring me to buy a new car.  They also have a great inventory of vehicles to choose from.  After I decided to buy a car, the trade in process and new car negotiation was clear, direct, and fair.  Also had a minor issue with the new car and their Service Manager, Dieter Nickelsberg, was great to work with!'
