b"I am not quite sure what previous customers are talking about, perhaps they have the wrong company in mind (or they were just one of those people who cannot be pleased), because my experience with Jumparound Party Jumpers was the complete opposite. The bounce house was not only clean, it looked brand new! The snow cone mechine was very clean and I had absolutely no issues when using it. The delievery was on time, if not early. They were more than curtious and more than accomidating for us two overly exausted/stressed mothers with six kids between the two of us, who had been up all night trying to make the party happen. I could not reccomend this company more. And with our six children they will definatly be getting all of our buisness! I mean really, what occasion isn't made 2000% better by a bouncy house??!?"
