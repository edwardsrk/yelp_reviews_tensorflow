b'Today I went to dutch bros coffee to brighten up my day and i was not disappointed at the slightest bit. Soon as I arrived i was greeted by an employee named Riley , she had an AMAZING attitude and great service .... she was patient with me but still managed her time well.  She exhibited model customer service and deserves to be recognized.  The entire dutch bros team was great, and the drinks are absolutely delicious and made to each customers liking. I would recommend dutch bros to anyone,especially this location !'
