b'This place was so cool! We stopped in before dinner one night out for a friends birthday. They were describing it to us on our way there. The "bar in a house" concept was way cooler in person. The atmosphere is fun, we arrived before 6 and it was a bit tight, not much sitting room. But, we were told the upstairs opened at 6, so I am guessing there would have been much more seating. The drinks were excellent! They are known for their cocktails made with fresh ingredients and they did not disappoint.'
