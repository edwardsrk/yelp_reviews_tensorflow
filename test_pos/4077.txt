b'Our waiter, John, was great. There were plenty of reservation options available for dinner on Saturday night through Opentable.com. I started with a Cosmopolitan that tasted like a delicious, sweet candy concoction. John brought us some warm garlic knots that were soft little pillows of heaven. You could also dip them in olive oil and balsamic that were brought to the table. I ordered the pssta fagioli soup. It was hot and hearty. I appreciate when food is served hot... I then tucked into a bowl of pasta carbonara. The pasta was a little thicker than I prefer but cooked just right and the sauce was spot on. My dining companion enjoyed a white sangria thst was visually appealing with beautiful fruit followed by lobster ravioli. Needless to say, there were no leftovers. A great dinner option while in Vegas!'
