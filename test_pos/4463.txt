b"Morimoto Las Vegas is located inside MGM in Vegas. Ambience and decor was quite nice. Service was great. I ordered the prawn tempura, nigiri sushi, and doughnut. All the dishes were just simply, amazing. The experience overall was wonderful. Easily the best restaurant I've ever been to so far. Very expensive, but I don't care. It's that good."
