b"Discovered this amazing restaurant by accident, but I must say it's one of the best we tried so far!! It's fine dining at a reasonable price, I have had the opportunity to travel the world and taste different cuisines, here I ordered a dish with foie gras in it, which is delicacy in Paris, the chef did an excellent job with the texture! My husband absolutely loved the garden salad and the presentation. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and described every dish to us, also asked him recommendations on our drinks and loved mine. We will be definitely coming back again!"
