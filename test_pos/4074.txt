b"Out of all the places we ate in Vegas, this stood out as the best value by far.Not that it was cheap -- no, no -- but we really felt that we got our money's worth here.  Most Vegas joints are ridiculously overpriced and serve food that, while good, isn't nearly reflective of the benjamins you lay down.  (Look, I'm street!)So we started with the bone marrow and the p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9.  Oh, bone marrow, where have you been all my life when you could have been clogging my arteries?  The waiter (Michael, who was AWESOME) showed me how to smear it on my bread.  Yum.  The p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9 was tasty -- but eclipsed by the marrow.  I had a Sazerac and my wife had a Moscow Mule to accompany -- both top notch jobs by the bartender.The main courses -- a Lamb sirloin for the lady, and a kilo of mussels and truffle frites for me.  Both were amazing, fantastic, to die for good.  The mussels were steamed in wine, mustard, and garlic with some ham thrown in for good measure.  The frites were served in a cone that had some decidedly non-Euclidean properties to it -- no matter how many we ate, there were still more in the cone.Listen to the wait staff on the wine and/or beer pairings.  You're welcome.We didn't eat dessert.  Because we were full to bursting on the rest.  The portions are generous, so go hungry.Five stars, no reservations."
