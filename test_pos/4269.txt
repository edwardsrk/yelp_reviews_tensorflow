b"A new bakery that is absolutely delicious!! Stopped by yesterday and picked up a cheese bun (delicious), fresh cinnamon bun (divine) and a loaf of freshly baked bread. They also have kombucha and make their own granola & yoghurt - there is truly something for everyone here! (They even make homemade dog treats!) There are lots of free samples, and all of their baked goods look positively delicious. Bolo, I'll be back!!!"
