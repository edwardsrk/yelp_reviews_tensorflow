b"I've been going to this location on and off for the past couple months and I walked in to find the place reorganized and redecorated on the inside. Management has changed over the last few weeks or so and it's a HUGE improvement. Everything looks cleaner, well-organized, and it has a more natural flow. There's a new weekday manager who is just as knowledgeable and friendly as the woman who is there on the weekends and it is nice always knowing that any of my questions will be answered without an issue."
