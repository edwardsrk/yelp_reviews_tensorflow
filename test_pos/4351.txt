b"Being from California, our standards are pretty high for good traditional delicious Vietnamese cuisine. We've tried many places and some were better than others but nothing truly blew us away until Pho Leo!!!! Pho Leo is fantastic. The staff is incredible, very helpful and kind. The restaurant is spotless and spacious. The food is to die for! Finally I have a new go to pho place in Arizona! I'd give more than 5 stars if it would let me :) we will be back for sure!!!!!!! We had the P19 pho, pork eggroll vermicelli bowl, crab cream cheese wontons. And of course we didn't leave without our traditional Vietnamese iced coffee!!!? 10/10!"
