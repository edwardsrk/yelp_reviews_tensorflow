b"This shop is crazy cute and the family that runs it genuinely works towards the beautiful atmosphere they've clearly been able to create. I tried their jasmine green tea which was perfectly bitter (they do offer honey) and a croissant which had an omelette within it. Incredibly unique flavor and I definitely feel like going back for more. Most importantly the workers are perfectly pleasant, personal, and genuine. I'm a fan!"
