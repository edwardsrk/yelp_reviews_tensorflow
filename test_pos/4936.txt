b'Came here with some friends from northern India.We all got the lunch buffet with a side of naan (obviously) and some additional kebabs. Everything was delicious. My personal favorites from the buffet were the paneer and the butte chicken, but they did  also have lamb and some veggie samosas that others at the table liked. Prices were also extremely reasonable at around $11pp.'
