b"Best Mexican food in East Mesa, definitely would recommend. Everything it good, especially their salsa. Prices are very fair for the quality you get. Only criticism is sometimes the horchata is a little off but that's nominal to the quality, portion, and value you get. It's very hard to find good Mexican food in this part of town and I'm very happy I found them."
