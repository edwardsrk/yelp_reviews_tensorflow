b"Excellent service and food. Had such a nice time here. Tried the lobster croquet and shrimp tapas and both were delicious. The person who seated us (maybe owner or manager of the place??)was also very friendly and super nice. The waitstaff was also great. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking to grab a bite in this neighborhood."
