b'Best bbq I know of.  Moved to St. Louis 2 years ago but went to Black Dog many times before I left, and saw their menu and product evolve.   I continue to take meat and sauce home to this day when in the area.  If anything, they have created a monster, with waits (sometimes lengthy) at any meal time.  Go off-hours if you can.  I find their burnt ends, pork belly, chicken wing starters, beef brisket, and Carolina and Texas sauces some of the best things I have had at any bbq joint.  Given the crowds, service is good, but it can get hectic.  Not a place to linger and talk unless you get there at an off-time.  This space itself is pleasant with warm colors, and flatscreens have games going all the time.  Probably best bbq between the Chicago area and perhaps Murphysboro (17th St. Bar and Grill), some 5 hours south.  Warning - not sure who owns the parking lot to the north of the building, but it is in AWFUL shape.  Beware.'
