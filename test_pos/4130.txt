b"Black pepper chicken! It's the only place in town that has the perfect kind: real meat, real pepper, real tasty.I also love their egg rolls. The wrapper is crispy and not airy like most around town.Their rangoons aren't awful and the service is pretty speedy. This is my second fav place in Madison for Chinese. Do it, do it now!Try the Yangzhou fried rice. YUM"
