b"Great service and very nice people working there. They don't charge you for what you don't need and they're fast. I definitely will be back. My only complaint is whoever worked on my vehicle left oil on the passenger seat and my whole steering wheel when I got a cloth to wipe it down was BLACK. Thank goodness I wasn't wearing anything white because my clothing would have been covered in black oil and dirt."
