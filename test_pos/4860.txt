b"Why did you ever leave me Schlotzsky's? I wish you would come back to Chicago. You are missed here. This place has warm, fresh, soft bread. This place has delicious meats, fresh ingredients, and hearty helpings.I recommend the reuben or the original. This particular location has a larger, cafeteria style seating area. When I went there was a large crowd of blue-haired old-timers reading the paper and hanging out."
