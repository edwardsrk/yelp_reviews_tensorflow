b"I went to Biggs yesterday somewhat reluctantly because some reviews said it was hard to get waited on and the staff was arrogant. I was very surprised. Three people asked me if I needed help. They actually smiled. The person I worked most closely with was Brandee. She was very pleasant and helpful. Best of all she was patient with a customer (me) who wasn't quite sure of what I needed. She absolutely knew what she was doing. The rest of the staff did too.I went there on a Monday, mid-afternoon. It might be best to go there on a weekday. I was helped immediately but I suspect on the weekend the place is more crowded. If you want a patient and pleasant salesperson ask for Brandee!"
