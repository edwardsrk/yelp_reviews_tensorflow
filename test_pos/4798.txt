b'I drove to the two closest comic book stores actually looking for a Deadpool shirt to wear to the movie premier. I didn\'t find any shirts in here unfortunately, but I still walked out with two comics because I couldn\'t believe they had these two. "The Dark Phoenix" saga and "Days of Futures Past". I didn\'t plan on buying any comics but I couldn\'t pass up these two epic stories staring me right in the face. Both of them together we\'re only $33. They had a LOT of comics to choose from and I was welcomed to look around. It was a pretty small store but it was PACKED with comics. They had a lot of action figures and the guy who was there was friendly and complimented me on my choices. I could see myself going back here in the future.'
