b"These guys are awesome! Pleasant, friendly and professional customer service! I was able to be seen earlier than my scheduled time, which, as you know, never happens when it comes to urgent care. In and out in no time, yet still thorough. You can tell the entire staff truly cares about their work. I don't like complaining or giving negative reviews and fortunately, I don't have to with this business. Thank you!"
