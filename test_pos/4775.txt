b'I have to say I picked this place randomly, we are from out of town and we hit the jack pot!!My party of 4 was pleasantly surprised!!Service was great,  Chris (guy) our waiter,  was very helpful and attentive !! Food was even better!!!Some in my party had Amish chicken with Yukon mashed potatoes and veggies, also tried chicken sandwich and beef burger , side order of drunken black beans,appetizers , all of which were cooked just perfect and were very tasty.Very clean , staff very pleasant, great food for the value!!!If I am ever back in the area I would make sure to stop by.'
