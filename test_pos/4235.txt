b'My daughter is expecting her first baby and wanted to register for her baby shower. After a disastrous experience at Target ( NO ONE knew anything about the strollers or could answer any questions we had ) and Babies R Us wasn\'t much better. No one assisted us in any way and we were completely overwhelmed. We started her registry there and just figured we would finish it online as it was laborious and time consuming. We went into Buy Buy baby just to have a look see as we had never been in one. Soooo glad we did! We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and was assigned a "personal shopper ", Danielle , who was awesome by the way!! She knew all the products, NO upsell and helped us with all the necessities. She made it a fun experience! Deleting the competitors registry! We are instant fans! Love this police!!'
