b"My go-to place for dimsum whenever I'm back in the Burgh. The XiaoLongBao (little dumplings with soup in them) are absolutely AMAZING. As good as it gets. You really can't go wrong ordering any of the dumplings or buns. I also like their dry noodles a lot (DanDan, Sesame, etc.). Great texture - just chewy enough! The flavoring is also spot on.While the restaurant is quite small and always packed (it's that popular), I love that they allow you to watch the chefs make noodles. If you've never seen this before, I highly encourage you to go to Everyday Noodles to check it out. It really makes you appreciate the craftsmanship that goes behind the noodles in your bowl."
