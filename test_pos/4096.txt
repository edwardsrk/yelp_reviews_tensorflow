b"I use to work in the area and walked in on my lunch hour.  Best Jewish Bakery hands down.  The Baker and owner is amazing what he can do with his baking skills.  I love to bake as well, and know it truly is an art form.  A delicious one!!  The owner's wife is also great at recommending her favorites.  I love the Chocolate Babka!!  The best!!  Another favorite is the Almond bread that the owner's wife loves to make french toast with.  I personally love it sliced plain or toasted.  Absolutely heavenly."
