b"I have had the silliest and most beautiful times in this darn park. I'm a busy girl, but we all have those weeks where you just need to excuse yourself for fifteen minutes and stare at something lovely. You know, otherwise you might implode. I had one such moments last week, and I found myself on a bench overlooking the thawing leashless dog pit. An afternoon that began with painful doubt was suddenly twisted on it's head and full of possibilities. Puppy watching is. the. best. I also bought shoes. So maybe I'm giving the park too much credit. Nah, I'm not. Puppies!"
