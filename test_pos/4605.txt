b'So, I had this "milestone" birthday coming up... what better way to celebrate than to jump out of a perfectly good plane.The staff (every single person) was amazing and made me feel so comfortable right from the beginning.  I was nervous, but I knew I was in good hands.  Take my advice and spring for the video package - you\'ll thank me later!  I never leave reviews, but because this was such a "bucket list" thing, I had to sing their praises.You have a loyal customer who will send anyone your way!Thank you for this awesome experience!'
