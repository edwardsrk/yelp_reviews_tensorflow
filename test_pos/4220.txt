b"I REALLY like this store and it's staff. They were out of my cat's wet food once and the manager picked some up from another store on his way home and brought it in for me the next day. All so I wouldn't have to make the extra trip.  Now THAT is GREAT customer service. I don't know about the prices for anything that what I buy, but, I think the prices are very competitive. I've got pet's with special diets and the staff will help you read ingredients off the labels. They've got a good crew here. The store is always clean, they're always getting new merchandise to check out and the staff is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this store."
