b"Rami, absolutely gorgeous girl with the blue hair running the cash register totally made my night. She was used to the E-sports center but was at the register today, and let me tell you, it was stressful but she handled it with ease. She kept conversation and was mindful of my birthday and Groupon promotions and honored both. She was just a great conversationalist and honestly should be in management for how she handles situations. Definitely would want her on board with my business, that's for sure. Also, Manager Troy was more than accommodating with everything throughout the evening. He made sure my girls left with an even amount of prizes. Bless his heart, because that would not be a fun car ride home. There were a few games out of order, and I mentioned it to the front and they sent attendants out to fix the issue in no time. Excellent customer service. Tyler, at the bar, thank you for your understanding and outstanding customer service. My friend had ordered a whiskey smash, but it tasted more like a strawberry lemonade on the dollar menu at Del Taco. We mentioned it to Tyler and he apologized for the other bartenders error and remade a Jack N Coke, since that is what usually gets the job done. Tyler was very helpful and made adult time, much more enjoyable and worth it. Can't wait to come back, KID FREE!!"
