b"We headed in for lunch on a weekday, and were seated right away. Our server's name was Chris, and he was very prompt and courteous. We each ordered pizza and shared and it was fantastic! The Diavallo and the Boss were SO good. The Margherita wasn't bad either. I can't wait to go back and try some more!"
