b'Before ordering, I looked at all the reviews and I was doubtful. My friends and I decided "what the hell, it can\'t be that bad". I\'m glad we went against the grain here... Everything we ordered was great! Presentation might have not been the greatest but the food definitely had flavor. Fried rice, shrimp broccoli, spicy fried chicken, duck plate, noodles. What made everything better was the fact that we could use our Caesar\'s comps. Our server was also nice.'
