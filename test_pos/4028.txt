b"Found on Groupon. And had a great experience. I had a facial and a massage. Chong gave me 75 minutes and it was one of the best facials that I have had in a long time. Convenient to find and ample parking. I didn't feel rushed and Chong was waiting for me. I have made other appointments at other places and had to wait. Not here, I will be back."
