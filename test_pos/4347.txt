b"What a gem I've found over on the west side! They have got the best pad Thai noodles around and an awesome lunch special! It's over at 3pm so if you can make it, try this place out! You won't be disappointed! Valentine has been my lunch time waitress the last few times and she is a sweetheart! All the staff is amazing though, very attentive and kind. I am a Loyal customer for sure!"
