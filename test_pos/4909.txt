b"Walked in close to Mother's Day and was able to get a seat for a pedicure. Absolutely amazing service! Didn't rush through, but didn't take forever. Really wanted to please and made sure that the massage didn't hurt. The citrus scrub felt amazing, I also added paraffin wax, which was great and definitely recommended, I will definitely be returning!"
