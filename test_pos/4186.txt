b"Shrimp Tempura udon and Screaming Orgasm (yikes that felt awkward typing).  Shrimp Tempura great size for the price (9.95).  Only problem I found is the tempura is placed in the soup prior to arriving at the table, and therefore it was soggy and was falling apart.  Screaming Orgasm has a small and a large option, and comes on a bed of shredded radish (daikon).  Heavy sauce but it gives it a good flavor.  Overall the service is quick, but there were two times that the communication fell apart and two items did not make it to our table without a reminder that we were waiting for items.  If you get your items and are missing anything, it is best to just assume they may have forgotten or communication broke down, so give a friendly reminder.  They did not react rudely or condescending; very apologetic and moved with haste to get it to us.Pictured:  Jhonny's Special Roll (ordered by someone in our party.  And yes, the spelling is what was on the menu)."
