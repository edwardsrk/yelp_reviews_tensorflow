b"Visited the Veggie House today.   The atmosphere was pleasant,  the food was good.   We ordered the slightly smoked fish appetizer which we didn't care for as it was a cold dish.  I enjoyed the broccoli shrimp, however, it would have been better with a little more sauce.  I'll make sure to ask for more next time (we will definitely come back!) My spouse loved the Gen'l Tso chicken.   The menu is pretty extensive so a return visit is a must do!"
