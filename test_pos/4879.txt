b"This spot is truly a hidden gem. The hand crafted foods / pastries / honeys in the market are addictive; the juice bar is healthy, organic, and delightful; the restaurant / cafe menu is delicious. Plus it's all set outdoors next to an idyllic lake, green grass for miles, and some winding pedestrian / bike paths. Absolutely loved it. Will bring the dogs and the bicycles next time."
