b"Man, oh man, do I love this place. All you have to do is combine goat cheese and guacamole for me to love you. Does that make me easy? Probably. But really, this place lives up to its hype. I've been here twice, and both times have just been extraordinary. Their taquito entrees are delicious, and their sides are to die for. For the taquitos, I had the remolacha. A bunch of different flavors and textures that will amaze you. Regarding the sides, the smoked gouda tamales and the sofrito green beans will leave you wondering what you've been eating your entire life. It's like an explosion of flavor enticing your taste buds. Yes, my mouth is currently watering.Be warned-if you get the guacamole trio, like we did, be prepared to take the rest of your meal home. It's more than we bargained for, but oh so delicious. The goat cheese guac, pineapple guac, and blue cheese guac are all excellent. I've also tried the jalapeno bread pudding for dessert. Simply amazing. You get the flavor of jalapeno without all that heat, and it just makes for a very unique dish. If anything is the downfall, its the wait in general. Waits to get a table are long, but nothing going next door to Johnny Mango's for their super strong mojitos won't fix. We had a wait a bit for our server the second time, which was a bit of an annoyance. However, this place is worth it, trust me."
