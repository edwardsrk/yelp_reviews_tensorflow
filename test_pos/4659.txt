b'The crew here takes great care of the customers. I have very ticklish feet and they know just how to treat them.     The place is clean and the prices are fair. Get your loved one a gift certificate because you care and it makes a wonderful "takes up no space" gift to have them treat themselves.   If I\'m ever going to have my feet taken care of, Sunset Nails on Stephanie is my first choice.'
