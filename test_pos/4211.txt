b"Just went to eat prime rib with my boyfriend yesterday. I normally go here a lot to get steak. But then prime rib I got yesterday was amazing as usual. I'm a big fan of prime rib and trust me I've been eating prime rib at different place for a long time. So far nice been to Lowry, Ellis Island Casino restaurant, And many other places. But I'm going to be honest and say that out of all the places I've eaten prime rib Jackson is my favorite. For only 12 bucks I get an inch thick prime rib. The prime rib was very soft and juicy. And it's not tough like most prime rib I've eaten at. I would highly recommend this place. The down side is that prime rib is only available on Monday staring at 5PM."
