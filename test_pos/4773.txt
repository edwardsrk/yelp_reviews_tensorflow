b"We just finished an amazing dinner at the Outback. I'm surprised at the 3 star rating of this restaurant when we just waited 50 minutes to be seated on a busy Friday night. I never want to eat at the restaurant that is not busy. Besides a great meal we had a fantastic server named Coady. He offered great advise on the menu, served us in a very prompt fashion and check back with us frequently.Thank you for a relaxing end to the week. Janet Thebarge"
