b"I always go to Basch's for my jewelry and watch repair needs. The staff is extremely friendly and goes out of their way to get to know you. The inventory is full of very unique watches, clocks, fine, and fashion jewelry. There is even a dog who is in there frequently and he is the sweetest! Highly recommended."
