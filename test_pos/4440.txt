b'The place doesn\'t look the best but food is excellent and the service is fantastic!  My husband always gets pizza or open face roast beef n gravy. I get lasagna (which gives me 3meals) or a sandwich. My granddaughter\'s love to go there. They get there own personal pizza which is huge. Big Jim\'s was also on "Diners, Drive in and Dives". Guy showed the spaghetti being made, he gave the recipe. Also, I forgot to mention they have the best wedding soup in Pittsburgh.'
