b"Well done! I love a good store with a niche, and this one has it all! It's fun, it has a great design and the merchandise is more than the average! The colors of the decor, signage and displays is playful and whimsical. The candies and novelties are awesome and the mix of old and new are perfect! I stumbled upon Smeeks on Yelp, just before a New Year's trip to Phoenix. Traveling with a toddler, you have to be able to find the fun for them too. New Year's was quite different with a little one, so we chose to road trip to AZ and see what there was waiting for us there. I looked up stores, since I am a retail junkie. I have worked in specialty retail for over 20 years (not giving away my age too much) and this little gem was a good find! Smeeks has old-fashioned candies, sodas and many novelties to share with kids of any age! I loved it! They host birthday parties, offer party favor options that are out of the norm and they even have a photo booth in the store! It's a fun and exciting shop! Check it out if you haven't been! There are also two other cool stores next door. Frances is a women's men's and children's store that carries shoes, jewelry, bath and body products, gifts, toys and clothing. It is owned by the same owner as Smeeks and it is also a great store! Stinkweed's is next door too. It's a record store with a lot of soul!"
