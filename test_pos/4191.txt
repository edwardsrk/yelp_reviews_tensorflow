b"Hell yes! I love this place. First tried it in SF and was ecstatic to learn they were opening a location in Mesa (and very soon in Tempe!) The menu is giant! Look online before you go. I get the Barry B, my gf likes the Spiffy Tiffy. Don't skip the dirty sauce and although they're famous for the Dutch crunch bread, I opt for the Sourdough because it's phenomenal.Fries are great, onion rings tasted great but I made the mistake of taking them home and they ended up a bit soggy. Obviously not their fault but just a warning to those who want to take out onion rings.I can't tell if they moved I to a struggling shopping center or if all the restaurants around them closed because Ike's is so awesome.I have been here 4 times now and will continue to drive 15 minutes for my new favorite sandwich shop!"
