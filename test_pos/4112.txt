b"I've always loved ZuZus location and their food is always stellar. It can be a bit overrun with kids but hey what do you expect when you're directly across from the zoo. The staff is always friendly and service is prompt. The spooner is hands down my favorite sandwich. Regarding a previous reviewer who objected to being called out for brown bagging it. To walk into a restaurant and order coffee and then sit and eat food you've carried in is just plain rude. If it were my establishment I probably would have asked you to leave."
