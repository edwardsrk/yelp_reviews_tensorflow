b"We travel between Idaho and San Diego a few times a year and because our dog is way over 40 lbs, most nice hotels on the strip don't accept her. Found this place on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. Super clean, very big indoor/outdoor facility, friendly/helpful service. I didn't worry about my dog at all for those 3 days. Will definitely use them again in the future and will recommend them to my San Diego friends who travel with their dog('s)."
