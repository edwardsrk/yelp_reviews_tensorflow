b'so i\'m greek and every time i go here, i get yelled at for not coming in all the time.  honestly, when i want greek food, either i make it myself or i go to mom\'s house and just have to say, "ma, i\'m hungry." and boom, there\'s a plate in front of me.that aside, this place is about as family style greek cooking as it gets.  it does taste like what i grew up eating.  the spanakopita is flaky, buttery and moist as it should be.  melts in your mouth.  the dolmathes are very rich and with a good splash of lemon juice taste great.  i havent been there in some time so i\'m not sure if he\'s still serving falafel but when he did, damn it was good.  some of the best i\'ve had, period.  but the gyros are where it\'s at.  i can only have one of these every so often or i think my heart may come to an arresting halt.  there\'s just a ton of lamb falling out of the pita and there is no sexy way to eat it so you end up looking like a bulldog eating a jar of mayonnaise.hit this place if your an ethnic foodie.  you wont be disappointed.  even when the owner yells at you for not coming in all the time.'
