b"Our dinner at the Chart House tonight was excellent. Paul was our server, and he knew the menu inside and out. I have never had seafood prepared as perfectly as these guys did it. Scott's blackened fish was his perfection, and my swordfish was as moist and juicy as I have ever had it. Crab cakes were incredible, and the chocolate lava dessert left us craving more. Great job, guys..."
