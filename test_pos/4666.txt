b'KLC nails is the best!  Charlie and Lee are amazingly talented and some of the nicest people you will meet.  They ALWAYS remember your name and what you like.  Their new location on Odana is beautiful and clean and BIG.  You never have to wait more then 10min on a walk in (of course no wait if you make an apt!)  KLC nails is the only place I get my nails done.'
