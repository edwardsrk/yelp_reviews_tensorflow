b"The food was fantastic. We ordered two hard shell tacos a la carte with shredded beef and two california burritos.The tacos were big, not like most places when you order a taco and it shows up all teeny tiny. These were topped with shredded lettuce, cheese and sour cream. This is what I'm used to having and it hit the spot! I actually wish I had just ordered more tacosThe California burrito had asada, cheese and French fries! \xe2\x81\x89\xe2\x81\x89 I've never had a Mexican burrito with French fries.. And I'm also from CA so the name was odd to me. I assumed a CA burrito meant there would be lettuce and avocado or something. Anyways, I digress, the burrito was pretty good. The tortilla was super fresh and the ingredients just made sense. It was different for me and I like trying new things! I'm just happy I went with it.Also, keep in mind we went 30 minutes before closing and on a Sunday. We were literally the only people in the place besides the ones who were running it. So my initial thought was-- umm, they are probably closing, it's a Sunday and they want to go home so our food might not be that fresh. I mean, I'm already trying something new and given the time and day, I was going into it mentally prepared that it might not be that good. Boy was I SO wrong. The tortilla chips with totally fresh, nice and hot in the bag.  We are looking forward to coming back!"
