b"We were looking for somewhere new and came to Yelp for help. Visited here based on other reviews and, I must say, food, service and atmosphere were excellent. There's currently a storm rolling through town (remnants of Hurricane Bill) so their outside seating was partially closed. The inside was alive and full of energy. We placed our reservations via their website, when we walked in and our reservation was right there. They are on their game. Our waitress, Cathy, was very friendly, professional and attentive. Appetizer of small sampler platter and grape leaves were incredible. For our main meal, I had the chicken sampler over rice with grilled pepper, while my wife had the Turkish lamb chops over rice, both were wonderful; there were no leftovers. For dessert, we split their rice pudding (and I'm a sucker for rice pudding). Near the end, the owner stopped by to see how we enjoyed dinner. He asked if we tried the baklava, and when he heard we hadn't, he went back to the kitchen and brought out two small pieces, perfect for sampling. Needless to say, it, too, was amazing. If I had one complaint it would be the fact that parking is at a premium in that location. We found a spot around the corner on a residential street.  Just take care not to block a driveway or park in front of a hydrant. Not that big of an issue, I was able to walk off the baklava after dinner. Thank you for a great experience and an even better dinner. We'll definitely be back... I already miss the sampler platter."
