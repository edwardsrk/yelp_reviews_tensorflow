b'We came thinking it was Kabuki and boy was I surprised when I walked in and there was Ryan, my favorite Sushi Chef (from another place which shall remain nameless)! I was extatic!I love the choices, the sauces, and how friendly the chefs are. If you like spicy tuna, you have got to try the "Crispy Rice" roll. Yummmmmm! And their Japanese Lasagna, made with crab stick....that\'s always my dessert! Ummmm, did I mention the baked green muscles....oh now I am getting hungry again! With their prices just right, their drinks keep flowing, the fish is OH so fresh, and then the staff being so awesome! You just can\'t go wrong.It\'s a little hard to find, nestled in on the right hand side of Target, but its worth looking for! I have found my new Sushi spot!'
