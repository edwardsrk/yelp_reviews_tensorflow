b"High quality food, we always eat every bite, AND we still get to watch all the NFL GAMES!!! I recommend their Charcuterie Board, and the Spinach Artichoke Feta Dip at the bar with Austin's drinks;) Austin is our fave bar tender!!! When we  get a table, we ask for Sam or Tom's tables, because they are super attentive and funny, so the service is great. The restaurant is a higher end sports bar, and the atmosphere is fun, and totally belongs at DC Ranch."
