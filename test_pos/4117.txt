b'Wildflower, THANK YOU! Whoever reads & handles customer comments really cares about their customers experience and satisfaction. I\'ve made various observations and complaints and they\'ve obviously been talked about. Greg, the manager has done a great job implementing things. I couldn\'t believe when I walked in he said with a smile "Hi Glenda" Whoa!!!! Impressive! The staff is very welcoming and accommodating, "I\'m particular" so if you want the best cooked eggs and bacon Daniela is your girl, consistent!!! If you want a dirty, dirty Chai Tea Latte have Iskim or Desiree make it! Great atmosphere, great food, great service. Kudos! Staff who cares and wants the customer to leave satisfied. Thanks for starting my mornings off with a smile! I know I can be rough! I\'ll be back!!'
