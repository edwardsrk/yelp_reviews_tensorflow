b"This is my first time at not only Yogurtland, but this type of place where you get your own Yogurt from a machine! At first I was intimidated but my friend helped me through the process of creating my own frozen yogurt treat. The best way to not be shuffled along a line is to just go right for the flavor you want; why be held up behind a person who is getting Vanilla when Peanut Butter (my current favorite) is all the way near the end? Just go get it! Don't wait! But be polite if you're squeezing in between someone!!The flavors rotate everyday - you never know what will pop up unless you go to the http://www.yogurt-land.com/ website to view all their flavors and hope they have the one you want to try when you arrive *lol*! The toppings at the end of the station usually change but not as much as the frozen yogurts! The staff is great to chat with, the atmosphere is great also - it's always busy with college kids and families, and I love it because they're open so late on the weekends! You can also eat outside which we love to do because we can be as loud as we want!So if you're by ASU or in the Tempe area, you defiantly need to give this place a try if you're in the mood for frozen yogurt!"
