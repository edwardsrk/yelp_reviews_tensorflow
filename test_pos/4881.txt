b"I have been waiting for a pho place this good in my area for a long while and I couldn't be happier!I ordered the pho normal on doordash and even though the delivery said it would take over an hour on a busy night, it got here in around half if not less that time.Minus delivery costs, the pho itself cost $7.25!!! What!! So filling too.Wow. Just wow. I am pretty picky with my pho and have high standards, but this was soooo good.The 'pho normal' still has a spice to it, it has a nice peppery kick and the broth is truly on point. Clean, well done and flavorful broth. I got the well done beef even though I always order rate, as I worried it may not cook in the winter cold on the way here. It was still good but my assumption was very wrong and I would get the rare beef next time lol. I just found the well done beef to be too chewy but that's my general preference when it comes to pho. The meat itself was tasty.It also came with bean sprouts, a lime, basil, and some hot sauces.This is bound to be my regular pho spot. Soooo happy!"
