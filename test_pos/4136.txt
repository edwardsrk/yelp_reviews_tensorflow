b"It was a drab & extremely rainy day Saturday when i went to visit Montreal. I'd looked up Juliette's before heading out, stopped to ask the directions at the visitors center. The girl (AND the guy's) reaction when i mentioned the name had me sold. It was a must try the way they were almost swooning by the name... I am so glad i trekked out to this small but lively little cafe, because i sure as hell was in for a treat :DMy friends and I ordered the chocolate fondue (my fav was dipping kiwi fruit pieces in dark chocolate) and the extreme brownie( intense semi-sweet brownie with icecream and hot chocolate sauce) was to die for. I regret not having enough time to go back here again and am totally planning my next Montreal trip, based on the fact that i want to go try more of the chocolate yumminess! If you are serious about chocolate and are in Montreal, this place is somewhere you MUST go."
