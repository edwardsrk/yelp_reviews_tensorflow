b"Been here twice and it did not disappoint! It is located in the worst area of the city, Cabbage town. A place where you can probably get stabbed walking down the crazy streets. A little hard to get to commuting via subway but maybe it's because I'm spoiled by car rides. This place offers UberEats along with some other delivering services, so if you do, I would suggesting ordering over the phone for pick up or UberEats. The restaurant is quiet small to dine in but it offers a comfy and authentic feel. On the menu, I have ordered their seafood deluxe or something similar. It was wonderful. Their ribs are also great, fall off the bone type of meat. If you are not a pork or seafood type of person, or any person, DON'T skip out on the jerk chicken and fried chicken. It is so juicy and tender, perfectly cooked along with some coleslaw. I believe this place is vegetarian friendly as well. And don't forget that brownie !!!!"
