b"Being located inside the legendary silver snail comic book shop I should have expected greatness.  I didn't - all I expected from this caf\xc3\xa9 was convenience. I was blown away.  Not only was there a great variety of beverages and baked goods but specials were named after and inspired by comics,  making for some pretty unique menu items.  A perfect place to escape the cold,  draw,  or read."
