b"Is it really necessary to review a chain restaurant, aren't they all the same?  They should be, they should all be like this Outback on the South Strip.  The menu is familiar, the prices standard, the difference is in the level of service.  Conveniently located for both tourists and locals, this familar steak house has something for everyone.  I found my favorite steak, perfectly cooked, and that tasty ranch dressing the is better at Outback than anywhere else.  More importantly, the staff was very friendly and efficient.  The manager/owner came by our table at least once just to see if everything was perfect.  Despite the busy crowd, we felt the service, food, and atmosphere were top notch."
