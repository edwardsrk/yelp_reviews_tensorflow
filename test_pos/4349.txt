b"I've been here twice and each time I was utterly impressed. The first time I got the ramen which was so tasty, the meat so tender, and the noodles fresh and delicious. I also got the infamous pork belly tacos which lived up to their hype, and are a no brainier. The second time I got the bahn mi duck sandwich that was the perfect size, rich, and filling. Can't wait to try their brunch and sushi!!"
