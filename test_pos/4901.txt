b"The best Guacamole I have ever eaten!!! And those tacos weren't too bad either. Had pork, chicken and beef tacos on the corn tortillas and they were delicious! All fresh, shredded meat, very well seasoned and juicy. The waitress was knowledgeable and kind- really made our first experience a great one!"
