b'Came to Vegas and brought some customers and had to stay for a day, on my way to Vegas down the hills did not feel good about my brake performance, on my off parked day in Vegas thought to check in to a Mecanic to look in to my brakes, I called one of my friends who has been doing mecanic job in Vegas but is working in LA now,he gave me ARCO auto repair phone number,I called ARCO auto center and talked to Ron and from first contact on the phone he took care of me, when I got there,he put my 33 feet Limo right away on the jack and did a 100% customer satisfaction job, as I have mentioned in most of my reviews,due to my job and always working with auto repair shops unfortunately I do not see to many auto repair shop who really care for customers but Ron and ARCO auto center are one of the auto repair shop who really care for customers and do their best.Thank you Ron,I appreciate your perfect work customer service.God Bless you'
