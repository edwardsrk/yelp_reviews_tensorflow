b"My fiance ordered my stunning custom engagement ring from Schubach based on an antique ring I already had. It was amazing. After the inital awe, I decided I really wanted the ring width tweaked to be just a bit narrower, so I could fit a wedding band with it. Beth was outstanding to work with, and they did the revisions at no cost. I am (im)patiently waiting for my new and improved ring in the mail (will update with a photo), but could not be happier with the quality and service received at Schubach. I already have plans to order my fiance's custom wedding band from them as our wedding date gets a bit closer. 10 stars if I could!"
