b'OMG, this place is fabulous.  Had a Groupon that was due to expired so ran there to cash it in. First the place is quite quaint and very clean.  The service is outstanding and the food is delicious.  Love the fact that you can control the level of "hotness/heat" that you want in your meal.  I ordered the Salmon Drunkin Noodles...DELICIOUS!!!  I know one reviewer wanted the noodles to be crispy, but to me, the soft noodles was the perfect way for me.  The fried basil leaves added just the right amount of succulent goodness to the dish.  The salmon was seasoned and fried perfectly.   My mouth was jumping with joy with each forkful.  Grab a date, or a friend, and head over for lunch or dinner.  You will not be disappointed.   I\'m heading back real soon myself.'
