b"Serious five-starness, to the point that my eyes are burned by the brightness of the five-stars.The food here is slobberific, the service personable and AWESOME. Wine-pairing dead on. I pity the fool who doesn't utilize the knowledgeable staff, and all they have to recommend.Unforgettable:  1) Lobster fritters on a stick w/ creme fraiche (like fancypants corn dogs!)2) Sublime skirt steak, the ultimate test of a steak place, this one was incredible in texture and flavor3) Trio of duck fat fries, mmm animal fat=flavor4) Trio of potato purees (lobster, corn, &  horseradish), a great creamy smear to dollop onto your steak while you eat itAfter a delish dessert, and an aperitif, bfriend and I were warmly sent on our way with a little bag of fiddle-faddle. How cute it that?MAD PROPS to my fellow yelpster Ms.Elizabeth B.  for insisting that I eat here."
