b"Looking for a great Mexican grocer or a place that sells some pretty dern good carne asada in the south phx/tempe area? Look no more! I've been searching for a lil spot like this for a while now! They have a great selection of fresh meat (btw the butchers are super friendly and informative), fresh cheeses and check this out, they also sell raspados! And everybody knows that if you're spending anytime in phx (let alone a summer) then a good raspado is definitely in need! :)"
