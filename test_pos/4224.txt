b"Bought a Groupon, called in and got a same day reservation. Was worried that they'd be booked up on a weekend. We did wait a bit, but I didn't mind. There were a lot of things to look at in the waiting area, plus you can watch people shoot off the 50cal. The girls at the desk were really helpful. Our 'instructor' was Zach. He was super sweet and did not rush us at all. *MUST*: You HAVE to shoot the 50cal while you're there!!! What an experience!"
