b"We realized last night that our tires were not in great shape. After reading the Yelp reviews, we decided to give Discount Tire a try. I am so glad we did. We got there right at 7:15 am and were the first people in the garage. We were out by 7:30, and would've been sooner if I'd realized that our car had a wheel lock. We got four tires installed on our Jetta for less than $275. We will absolutely be back the next time our car needs tires. Thank you so much to Discount Tire for being so quick and friendly!"
