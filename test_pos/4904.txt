b"The bread is amazing! I like taking out, and we order the hummus with meat and extra bread. Always delicious! It seems family friendly and the service was polite and prompt. Update: We have ordered from Sinbad's using GrubHub twice, both times my order has been incorrectly delivered I'm not sure if it's an issue with the restaurant or with GrubHub. The food is delicious but if you want it served correctly go to the restaurant."
