b'If you\'re like me, nothing makes you more angry than getting a ticket. There I am minding my own business and the car next to me makes the same turn I do at the same time (two turn lanes mind you) and the police officer decides to give just me a ticket.  How do they decide who they pull over?  I heard of this company through a friend at school and the whole process couldn\'t be easier. You don\'t have to complete it all in one session so it won\'t suck your day and life away. Helpful "need help" tab on the side where someone is there to help you out with the registering process. Scanned and emailed my info and I was enrolled in minutes.Hopefully, you don\'t get a ticket. But if you do. This company made it painfully easy to take care of it!'
