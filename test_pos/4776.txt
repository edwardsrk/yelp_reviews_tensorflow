b'Stopped in for the 1st time afternoon to try Sidestreet Pho & Grill. Let me start by saying this place was Phenomenal! None the least the service was A-1 and will continue to come back as a regular for more Of there Delicious Pho. I highly recommend if you are in the Area of Spring Valley/Summerlin. Thank you for the great service and quality of food.'
