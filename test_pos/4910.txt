b"New India Gate's buffet offers a variety of dishes for a very reasonable price--perfect for anyone who wants to sample a bit of everything. I have little authority on Indian food, but in my opinion, all the dishes were fantastic. My only complaint, is that I wish it was slightly spicier. Very friendly service and complimentary Chai tea."
