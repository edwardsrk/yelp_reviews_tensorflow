b"Maria's had good ratings and my girlfriend loves fry bread so we gave it a shot.  I had two green corn tamales and a shredded beef taco. My girlfriend had two beef enchiladas and a plain fry bread with honey and cinnamon & sugar. The tamales were really good but what blew me away were the salsas. The tomatillo salsa had a really good flavor and like most just a little kick. The hot salsa was just hot enough to remind me I was eating fresh made authentic salsa without over powering the senses. It has a lot of flavor which goes out the door with a lot of hotter salsas. The other red salsa was amazing. I couldn't get enough of it, think it had about half the bottle. The gentleman working told me it was picked jalapenos and tomato.  The fry bread was done very well. It was fried perfectly, had a nice tanned color and was not greasy at all. After our meal it was big enough that we could both split it."
