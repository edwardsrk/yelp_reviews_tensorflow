b"I have been going to Sparkle Nail Bar since they opened in May 2015 and I refuse to go anywhere else! I absolutely love Roben & Eva, they take care of me every time I go in there and I never have to wait. Roben always does such an amazing job & he never fails to impress me with his work. I've been going to Roben for over a year now, he is very sweet & cracks jokes all the time and he always gives me exactly what I want. Love ya Roben! thanks for always keeping my nails beautiful!!"
