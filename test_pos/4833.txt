b'Findlay Chevrolet has provided me the best new car purchase experience. Their service was excellent and they really take care of you and also the local community as well. I felt good making my purchase there and the staff is great. I definitely recommend that you check out Findlay Chevrolet for your next car purchase or service department. Plus I feel I got a great deal! Special thanks to Newell, Matt and Mike for their assistance in my purchase!'
