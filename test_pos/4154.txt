b'After having not much luck with my dining options during the entire week, I hit jackpot at Casa Imperial on Saturday for lunch. Casa Imperial is a fine Hong Kong style Dim Sum restaurant in Scarborough. The decor is traditional and you will find large chandeliers, lots of mirrors, large round tables and beautiful table cloths. It is a beautiful house and is frequented mostly by Chinese families. The service was attentive and they speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. We ordered 7 dishes for 3 people and I think we ordered too much food. It was a feast! The quality of their dumplings is stellar. I was eating and feeling grateful for that experience. It was not my first time at Casa Imperial but it was another fantastic experience. I would recommend anyone to try this restaurant.We ordered seafood dumplings with spinach, veggie dumplings with thread moss, meat dumpling with crab meat Shanghai style, snowpea leaf and king mushroom dumpling, cuttlefish tentacle with salted spicy,  fried tofu, steamed noodle roll with snowpea leaf and preserved pickle, and fish noodles with mushrooms. My favorite dishes were the seafood dumplings with spinach and the fish noodles with mushrooms. Mind you that the fish noodles were not in their menu. It was a special on that day.They currently have an anniversary menu for 10 people for 490$. I think is worth the try!Anyway, I cannot say enough thanks to Casa Imperial for providing the best Dim Sum experience in GTA!'
