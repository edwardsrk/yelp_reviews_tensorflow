b"So this was my first time here. Always in their paking lot for other businesses and a co-worker said they had great food. So came in tonight to try them out. I ordered the Phily and fries, one of favorite meals, and I have to say it was perfect. Even the fries were perfect. And when I said no mushrooms they got it right. The server Shari was professional and friendly. On time with refills too, one of the biggest things to me as I don't like running out of drinks. The place has a great vibe, good music, great food, and great service. And very clean. Typically this is where I sum up the pros and cons on every place. In tge event of this place I did not find as single con. Bravo to Jackson's bar for a job well done! You now will have a loyal customer since I live close by. I look forward to becoming part of the Jackson's family. See you soon."
