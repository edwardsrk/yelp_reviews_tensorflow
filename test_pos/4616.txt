b'Wow! Took my son there tonight on a buy one get one free bowl. We both had spicy chicken with brown rice and veggies.  First the chicken, perfectly char grilled with crispy goodness, tender with just the right amount of spice.  Next the rice, brown I might add, sticky just perfect for a chicken bowl and easy to use chop sticks with.  Finally the veggies, crisp but not crunchy, soft yet not mushy. Great combo, and great interaction with owner/manager.  We will be returning soon.'
