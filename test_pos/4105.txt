b"So last tues . I had a tooth extraction done by dr. Colson in Maricopa in the offices of dr. Tim Taylor. I haven't been to the dentist in 7 1/2 years so I was pretty nervous but Dr.Colson, and her 2 associates really made me feel comfortable and the actual procedure took under 30min(with just a few novacane shots) . Im finally eating somewhat on my right side(nothing hard-lol) but its almost 100% healed. I just wanted to thank dr.Colson  and her associates for her making me feel at ease and talking to me thru the procedure(i actually didn't feel a thing)."
