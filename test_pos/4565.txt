b'My college roommate lives in Cleveland, so I try to get out there every ~18 months.  While his wife was not in the mood for Mexican, they like Momocho so much that she capitulated.They were spot on.Service was on point and the food was delicious.  Standouts were the smoked gouda tamale balls (legit heaven...and $3.50???) and the brisket taquitos.  Oh.  And a fig (?!) margarita? Ridic.  Momocho is known for its guac, and that was the part I thought missed the mark a bit (fresh, but a bit gummy...and could have used more salt).  But what a meal...'
