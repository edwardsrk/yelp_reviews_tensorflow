b'This was the best bar we hit in Vegas. We came twice and both times was amazing. The first night James G helped us and was great. He mad a special drink for my picky wife and even wrote the recipe for her so we can make it at home! You must try any of the smoked drinks as they are a great experience. James recommend a boulevardier for me which is now my favorite drink! We were so impressed with our first visit that we came a second night to eat! Just as perfect as before. We sat at the bar again and Corbin and a second guy named James we there. You can tell this place trains their bartenders well. They are all fantastic. We had the lamb shank and chicken parmigiano as recommended by Corbin and both were amazing! As had a couple apps and an amazing Coca-Cola cake with dry ice meringue drops which were really cool! Cannot stress enough to visit this place!'
