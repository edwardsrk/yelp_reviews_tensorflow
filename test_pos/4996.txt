b"This was a wonderful experience! We rode public transportation to get close to the track, then walked a little ways to get there. Great view of the strip from here! I used to work at a go-kart place in Pigeon Forge, TN, but these are definitely the fastest go-karts I've ever driven! What a thrill-ride! We had a Groupon, and everyone we met was friendly and helpful. This is a highly recommended attraction!!!"
