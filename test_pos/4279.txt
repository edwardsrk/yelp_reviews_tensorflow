b"Pieces Unimagined is a shop not to be missed- they offer a wide array of gifts, decor & furnishings for any budget. My husband and I had a custom kitchen island built with them, and it turned out beautifully! We were able to design it to best suit our needs, which included some unique & complex features. The end result was solid, precise and full of detail. Working with Ky was fun, and communications were always prompt and clear. PU focuses on incorporating salvaged and vintage materials into their designs, giving each item a story of it's own. Their furnishings are true works of art, and their pieces are reasonably priced considering the high level of quality in which each is crafted."
