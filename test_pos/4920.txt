b"Came for lunch with my friend. We sat at the bar and ordered the blackened fish tacos and shared a side of black beans. Both entrees were DELICIOUS. The beans were spicy and were so tasty and the fish tacos tasted fresh and light. I ordered a Bloody Mary and our bartender made it spicy for me. It was definitely the best Bloody Mary I have ever tasted. Next time I'm in town I will most likely be back."
