b"The TACO's here are simply mouth watering, I usually stick with the basics and just get carne asada, but the lady talked me into trying all of them and they're the tacos that are about the size of a silver dollar maybe a little bigger, nonetheless I ended up trying a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and a carnitas, as well as a carne and let me tell you the flavor is powerful, the onions and cilantro are fresh, the salsa has just enough heat to seal the deal and bring the flavor all together, this place is now one of my top five to get tacos from!"
