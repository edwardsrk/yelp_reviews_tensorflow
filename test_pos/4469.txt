b"Really good price point for healthy bowls , tasty sauces and a smiling face when you order. What more could you ask for. I got the vegan bowl and just asked them to make me whatever because I've only been here one other time and I really have a hard time ordering food most of the time so it was really nice to get home and enjoy my food!"
