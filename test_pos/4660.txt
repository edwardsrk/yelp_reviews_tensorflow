b"Got the whole house special which included carpet and tile cleaning. And I must say that I got a steal of a deal. Very happy with the work they did. They are very professional and allow you to walk through the house and you just tell them if they missed a spot (of course they didn't miss anything). Opted to come back when they were done. They texted me 30 minutes prior to being done, which I appreciated. Tiles look nice and clean and carpets are too. Definitely will use them again in the future."
