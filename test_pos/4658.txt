b"Time to update our review!We have been coming to this family owned gem since it opened. They care about their food and it shows. They have the same guys in the kitchen most of the time we come. This place is not big and fancy but it's not a dive. They serve quality food and they make it to order. Check out their original store Bella Luna on Litchfield and Indian School for amazing Italian fare."
