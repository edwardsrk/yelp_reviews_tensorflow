b"Today was my very first threading experience. Julie made me feel comfortable with her 12 years of experience. The salon was clean and she sanitized right before working with me. It wasn't nearly as painful as I expected and Julie was sure to check in with me regularly. I'm extremely happy with the results and intend to see Julie many more threadings to come. Thank you!"
