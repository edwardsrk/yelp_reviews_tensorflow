b'I learned of Dr. Bond from Dr. Grace Savage who referred me after seeing that all four of my wisdom teeth were impacted. Being in my early twenties, it was the perfect time to get my teeth extracted and I\'m thrilled that I chose Dr. Bond to perform my procedure.It was easy to get a consultation appointment and the front desk staff is always cheerful and helpful. The location was easy to find with ample parking. My consultation was great and the insurance coordinator worked with my father to ensure that my procedure would be correctly filed with a new insurance policy. Even during a typically busy week (college spring break) I was able to schedule my surgery quite easily within my stringent schedule.  I was given four prescriptions - nausea pill, two types of pain management (one for morning of surgery) and an antibiotic. The morning of the surgery I was welcomed by Dr. Bond\'s warm candor and put under general anesthesia which made the procedure go by instantly. I woke up and had hardly any bleeding, no pain, and I wasn\'t drugged up " a la" the infamous youtube videos you see these days. The staff explained the next steps to my father and off I went to recover. Recovery was simple and I had absolutely no side-effects. No nausea, no chipmunk cheeks, no swelling or bruising. It was honestly as close to a perfect recovery as possible and I attribute that to Dr. Bond\'s talent and finesse with his craft. Post op appointment was again, easily scheduled, and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. I am thrilled to have found the practice of Dr. Bond and if I ever need another procedure done in his specialty I know who I\'ll be using!'
