b"Who doesn't love Joe's? It goes without saying that this place is great. Their garlic fries put Gilroy to shame, the onion rings are devilish, all of their shakes are top-notch. Then there's the beet salad and grilled veggie pizza...I could go on forever. This quaint farm house turned restaurant really has it figured out. And I always go next door to the Coffee Shop for an after-lunch/dinner latte."
