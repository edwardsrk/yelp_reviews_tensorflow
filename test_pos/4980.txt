b'Nick and his assistant Alan were prompt, courteous, and exceptionally knowledgeable. Not only did he very quickly diagnose and repair the problem, he shared a lot of general knowledge about irrigation systems and he also showed my husband and I how to repair a secondary issue, as well as offered us multiple possible solutions to the problem so that we could choose a solution that worked with our budget. He also took the time to have us review his work before leaving so that we could be certain it was what we wanted.I was also particularly impressed by how myself and my husband were both treated. Although Nick clearly had exceptional expertise, he spoke to me directly and courteously, showed me what he was working on, and never talked down to me. Fantastic customer service!'
