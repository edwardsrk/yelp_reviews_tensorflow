b"Favorite coffee shop in Bay Street Corridor. I am definitely a regular at this coffee shop (if not daily). There are three floors of seating, with a mix of sofas and tables. Given the convenience, affordability and quality of the coffee shop, Jimmy's is definitely a favourite amongst a lot of the health professionals and students within the area. Coffee is fresh, with a fragrant aroma and no staleness. The service is also phenomenal. All the baristas are adorably friendly and caring. The downside to this coffee shop is that it is sometimes really difficult to find seats, especially in the early afternoon. Just goes to show how popular the place is!"
