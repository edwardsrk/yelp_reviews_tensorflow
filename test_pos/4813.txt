b'The food is great! I especially love that they deliver. So hard to find someone who delivers sushi and it is good sushi too. I absolutely love the sushi burrito and volcano roll. That calamari is awesome and the pot stickers and spring rolls are good as well. Great price and great service they are always quick.'
