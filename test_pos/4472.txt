b"Keto & low carb people - YES!Not only do they have a huge selection of tacos to choose from, free salsa and chips, they also have the option of ordering your tacos in lettuce. I was doing keto during our trip and this was amazing. Also, ordered the 'Panty Dropper' and it was delish, real cotton candy in the cup before the alcohol hits it, SOO good."
