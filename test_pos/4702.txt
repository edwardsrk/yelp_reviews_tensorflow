b"Saw a wonderful, not to be missed magic show featuring a great magician and juggler Craig Davis, his bird Peaches, and beautiful assistant/belly dancer Myryka!  Mr. Davis' wife Jeanette also sings for the show, but wasn't able to be there singing tonight.This show is G-rated, so you can bring the kids.  Great for all ages, and worth the drive to Scottsdale!"
