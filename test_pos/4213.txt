b'I ordered a dozen roses at 11:25 a.m. and they were delivered to my wife by 1:30 p.m.  Talk about fast "Only Roses" delivered, literally.  My wife absolutely loves the roses and I couldn\'t be happier with the arrangement they sent.  Thank you "Only Roses" for making our day special on our 10th anniversary.  Great job and I will certainly be back to order more flowers in the future.'
