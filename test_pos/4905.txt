b"I am at the Sun Prairie Costco location almost every day. The location is great, in one of the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. (2017.) Their quality is outstanding, and their staff is a friendly team that always seems to genuinely enjoy working together. This location moves a LOT of merchandise and rotates their inventory continuously, so it goes without saying that if you see something you think you might enjoy owning and don't grab it immediately, you may not get a second chance. There's very little risk of buyer's remorse thanks to Costco's very liberal return policy. I don't relish chances to return things, but the handful of times I've been legitimately unsatisfied with the quality of a product, they have taken it back, no questions asked. Lastly, Costco has absolutely, hands-down, the best crab legs you will ever have the chance to buy. They put grocery store crab legs to shame, and I've found them to be of better size and quality of meat than even specialty seafood retailers in Elm Grove and Downtown Milwaukee, as a comparison. Like nearly everything, Costco's seafood has increased in price over the past year, but is still well worth splurging for."
