b"This is my new favorite coffee shop! The moment you walk in, it feels like you're somewhere special. From the lovely decor to the AMAZING food and drinks (with ingredients from places like France) this makes Starbucks feel like a McDonald's. The lemon cake was hands down the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and check it out!!"
