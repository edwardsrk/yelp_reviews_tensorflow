b'Stopped in here for a quick meal + was really impressed with the service. In addition to the chips + salsas, we ordered the side of guacamole, a jalape\xc3\xb1o cheese tamale, + the quesadilla (which we made vegetarian). Everything was fresh + filling. The space is open + bright. Service was very fast + friendly, would definitely return.'
