b"This place gets 5 stars because it's the BEST full-set and pedi for the price.  I know you can get a classier atmosphere in a chic-ier spa, but you're going to PAY for that one hour and when you leave, you're nails and toes aren't going to look any better than if you'd gone to TDN!  I just took my daughter there on Tuesday for a full set and a pedi and it cost me $36.00 (not including the tip)!  I was paying $80.00 for the same thing down in Tucson.  I only wish you could set appts but I won't ding them a star for this due to the affordable prices!"
