b'My son and I have been going to Infinity Dental for the last few years; everyone is super nice and very attentive.  We have never waited longer than 5 minutes to be seen, appointments are very easy to make-His office staff does an excellent job with customer service, office is really bright and clean. Doug himself is an amazing dentist, funny, professional, and patient. He is very knowledgeable and always takes the time to get to know you and answer all your questions. I have been to some other dental offices here in Las Vegas, and Infinity Dental is the only Dental office that always makes the infamous dentist visit AWESOME!'
