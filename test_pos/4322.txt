b'Beautiful hotel, nice clean rooms and super comfy beds!Was selected as the guest of the day and got a complementary room upgrade, valet parking fee waived and a bottle of champagne with chocolates sent to my room.Felt like a true VIP!They do share a gym with the Sheraton so it was always pretty packed and hard to get on some equipment.Will def stay here again in the future!'
