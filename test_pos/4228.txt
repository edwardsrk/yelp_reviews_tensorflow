b"5 stars. Just like that. BAM! Listen to me, I have an obsession with sushi. I have tried sushi in Europe, sushi in Oakville, in Toronto, Vaughan, Richmond Hill - you name it. Actually, my goal in life is to find the perfect AYCE place. This might be it...First of all - the sashimi pieces are the size of a small child. I can honestly say I ate a whole salmon and a whole tuna to ma face. They also have talapia sashimi and talapia tempura - YUMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE GALBI DOESN'T STOP FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the staff is so nice - I ask for 40 pieces?? Sure! Anything I want - I AM THE KING OF THE SUSHI WORLD!!!!!!!!!They have mussels - garlic butter and wasabi mussels, which is hard to find in a lot of AYCE places.They have coconut shrimp - MASSIVE coconut shrimp. It's deep fried to golden perfection and not overly battered. Their maki have ONE layer of rice. Max 2. So little rice that I can see the seaweed through it. The pieces are exploding with fish. AMAZING!!!Spider rolls and Kaze roll are my favorite. I think the Kaze roll is the one with 3 fish in it (salmon, white tuna and red tuna? maybe talapia) - ask them when you get there, some of the rolls have weird names but they are deliciousoooo.I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! ANYONE AND EVERYONE! PLEASE GO - don't listen to overly critical reviews. People have unreasonably high expectations for AYCE sushi. Kaze is quality and quantity and FREE POP. And it's relatively cheap - 20.99 for weekday dinner and 22.99 for weekend."
