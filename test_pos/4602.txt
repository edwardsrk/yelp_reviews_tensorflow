b"Simply awesome....we need more independent restaurants like this in the city.  Less emphasis on the peripherals and more on the food.  Basically they don't waste time making a nice sit down restaurant because it is not necessary for this kind of food.  So far I've only tried the Manwich because it is so deadly, but I'm definitely going to try the ribs next time (only a buck each).  Its busy for lunch but they seem to be pretty much prepared for the rush so don't let the long line fool you.  This will definitely be a regular haunt for me."
