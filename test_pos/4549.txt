b"The baguette cafe is one of my new weekend favorites for a breakfast sandwich or lunch time sandwich & a coffee.  The owners are French & their cuisine is unmistakably so.  It's nice to have a simple French bistro that is reminiscent of the croissant shoppes I visited in Paris.  Vegas valley needs more quaint mom & pop shops just like this.  I am keeping this one on my repeat list."
