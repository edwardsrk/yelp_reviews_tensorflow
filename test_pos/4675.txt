b"AMAZING!!. Great service. great premium meat unlike subways processed meat. the customer service and friendliness at CHACHI'S is beyond perfect they sure know how to keep a customer coming back!!.the spicy Italian is by far the best seller and best sub I've ever tried at a sandwich restraunt. highly reccomened going and bringing the family!. reasonable pricing for a perfect sandwich!.only negative thing I can think of is they don't serve bacon at all. not much of a problem but I think the subs would be even greater with some good old bacon!!"
