b'We absolutely love the appetizers. Salmon Rillettes is a must! I saw the onion soup and could not stop myself from ordering one as well. The oysters were really fresh and started our evening with a bang. I was a little overwhelmed with the size of my entree, which was a trout. It was basically half of a trout. The cauliflower puree with white truffle was amazing with the fish though. Our server was really nice despite the fact that it was super busy that night and there were some rude diners crowding the walkway by the tables. Overall, a great experience. I want to come back!'
