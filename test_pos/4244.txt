b'Perfect spot. We came and stayed three days in the nice clean city of Toronto. This was our perfect relaxation coffee shop each day. Coffee is delicious! And cheap. The croissants and chocolate and cookies are awesome. The people are super nice. The eggs Benny looked amazing and the salads, quiches looked delish. I would come here every week if we lived in TO. Nice music, too.  Loved.'
