b'This restaurant will forever be known now as the restaurant that popped my Yelp Check-in cherry. Kim who runs the show in the front is extremely hospitable and makes you feel right at home so I finally checked-in somewhere for the first time, against my personal weird privacy philosophy, for the 10% discount but mostly for hoping to do something nice for her.This place is not only seemingly a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-basement wall, that i would not have volunteered myself to go down save the wonderful Yelp reviews for this place. And Yelpers were right, the food here is as good as it gets.I ordered the oxtail that fell off the bone with the delicious rice and peas. Next time, I need to have me some of that jerk chicken and some waffles. Yum!'
