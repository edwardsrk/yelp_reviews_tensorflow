b'Service was exceptional. The food was great. Coming all the way from Maryland on a Canadian family visit, we started off well with the food part. I had the Chicken Adana and my husband the Lam and we both loved it. Our server was the best. My oh My , can we get that in Maryland? Jk jk. Lol We will definitely come back'
