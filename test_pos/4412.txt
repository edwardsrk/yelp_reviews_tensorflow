b"I can't think of a reason to take any stars off of this place. It's a great breakfast! The service kept our drinks filled at the height of a Saturday morning breakfast, AND our delicious breakfast choices came out surprisingly fast! I had a scramble/skillet and my date had a little of everything. It was all yummy. There's a patio as well when it's not too hot out for ya - always a nice feature in the Phoenix area."
