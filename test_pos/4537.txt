b"We had a great breakfast this morning at Egg n Joe. It was clean, bright and friendly staff. We got lucky by getting Alissa B. I have never had a server smile as much as her. That's nice. My ice tea always stayed above half a glass. She was on top of everything. The food was hot, fresh, beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. Can't wait to go back."
