b'This place was across the street from where I was staying when in town for a wedding.  A group of us came to dinner before going bowling and the guy who helped us was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The ambiance in this place is really nice and I loved the fish tanks.  The tea we ordered was delicious.  I believe it was jasmine.  The sushi was good and many at our table got the flaming phoenix and that was very cool to see brought to the table.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal and our service was outstanding.'
