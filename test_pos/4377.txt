b"I'm giving this place 5 stars not because it's perfect, but because I love it.  I have been there twice, and both times I had a great experience.  To be fair,  both times were during a quiet time (sunday evening), but I found nothing lacking.  Since the place is indoor/outdoors, there is no air conditioning, but the server was happy to point a fan in our direction when we asked, and kept our water glasses full the whole time.  She was attentive without being annoying, and as I former server I am hyper aware of the quality of service at an establishment.  Food was timed perfectly and the portions were great - I kept some for lunch the next day.  The sangria was lovely - clearly made with good wine - and the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender.  My companion had a tikka masala pizza and I had the Madras chicken.  It was great - it had just enough heat to be flavourful without being overly spicey.  This was the perfect place to have dinner after seeing the Picasso exhibition at the AGO, and I'm really glad we chose this place."
