b"The food was off-the-hook delish! We had family combo #3 for two people! Thinly sliced pork belly, marinated beef . . . and great quality meats.The sides were delish and generous! I really am starting to believe the kbbq you get at ayce places don't have the best quality because they are focused on serving quanity!We had a great ice cream sandwich at the end that was made by the house. Although I had no room leftover ! The service was good and the guys came by to cook for us. Which was very nice because they cook well and it helps us relax.We took an Uber there so they gave us 10% off and an additional coupon for 10% off for another visit! A+++!"
