b'I had a stripped screw on my Nikon D40 so I called and asked if they would be able to get the screw out. I spoke to Tre and he said I could bring it in to see if they would be able to remove it. I brought it in and Tre was able to remove it for no charge! I will definitely keep these guys in mind if I ever have any issues with my electronic devices. Thanks again Tre!'
