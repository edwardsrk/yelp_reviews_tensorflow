b'Every time I stepped foot in this store I felt as though I had entered Stephen King\'s "Needful Things". I just knew between all those books there would be an item I wanted more than anything else and would sacrifice everything to have. Luckily for me the store closed and I never had to kill anyone. I fondly miss the discounted and quirky book selection. This was a fun place to waste an hour or so..'
