b'Awesome little dive bar and billiards. My friend is a member so we went on a Wednesday night. It was not crowded, and there was a nice selection of liquors and bottled beer. We were not charged for a pool table, its first come, first serve. We played pool for about 3 hours and had several drinks during that time. The bill was so reasonable, I had to check to make sure that everything had been put on our bill. This is a place I would come back to whenever I am in Charlotte.'
