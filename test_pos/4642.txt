b"I'm a fairly healthy 28 year old that doesn't take a lot of medication so I can't say anything about the other review. I do know that the three visits I've had with Dr. Sadowsky have been great! She listened, asked for my input and genuinely gave me the impression that she cared.  Its tough finding the right doctor so her holistic approach might not be for everyone but I appreciated her thorough consultation and hesitation to make medication the first option."
