b"A favourite stop every time I visit Toronto and has become a gathering place full of great memories with family and friends. Cocktails are sensational, the menu always reminds me of Sophie's Choice, I will have to leave at least one loved one behind. The Rajah's Dry Ribs usually win the day (as well as a place on most best of Toronto lists) order a bit of sauce on the side. The tile is ample and delicious and treat yourself to a side of onion rings, they are darn near perfect. When the mussels are available, they are spectacular. Portions are over the top substantial but try to save room for dessert. Never a disappointment. Fresh quality ingredients all, combined with uncommon skill and attention to detail. And a delightful low key atmosphere, a bit out of the way and better for it I think. I've never felt rushed. Fine service. My number one go to in Toronto,or did I mention that already?"
