b'Food. Drinks. Service. This place has it all. From the beginning they have something for every one whether you want to play it safe or try something new. That applies for both food and drinks. Now let me say this in no way is authentic but rather a fusion style of food. A rotating menu and bar program may stink at times because you might loose your favorite item but is an opportunity to find a new favorite. We have been going for several years and always come back. I insist on trying new places and using Clever Koi as my bench mark and nothing beats this place. Even one of their bad days still outshines many other places good days.'
