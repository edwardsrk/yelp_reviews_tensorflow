b"Purchased a Groupon for waxing and booked my appointment with Eleen. She was gentle, thorough and quick. The atmosphere was relaxing and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. She clearly had lots of experience and knew exactly what she was doing. The price I paid was great and I expected it would be too good to be true but I was wrong! They also offered me a discounted rate for the next time I go in. Great staff and facility. Definitely recommend.. also snag those Groupons if you see them!"
