b"This is a great neighborhood family friendly restaurant.  They don't just sell coffee and tea.  It's a full service breakfast and lunch place.  And service was great from the moment we walked in with our 3 year old.  The oatmeal, bagel, and lobster omelet we had were all excellent.  Everything from coffee, orange juice, and ingredients used were very fresh.  What a find!  The only bad part for us is we can't visit as often as we'd like since we live out of state."
