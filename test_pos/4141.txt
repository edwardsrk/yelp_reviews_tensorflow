b"This sports bar is absolutely awesome. The chicken wings and Philly Cheese steak were very good. The service is second to none. There were TV's everywhere and the place was packed. We sat on the patio and still had a great view of the games on TV. I already mentioned the service, but need to mention it again. They were prompt with getting us our order and always check on us with a smile. I will go back whenever I'm in Phoenix which is about a dozen times a year."
