b"My car was taken to Ultimate Collision Repair after I was rear-ended on the freeway.  When I went there to meet with Dennis, I was blown away at how clean it was!  I was worried about using genuine BMW parts and he explained the entire process to me and addressed any concern i may have had. Dennis was fantastic, keeping me in the loop throughout the entire repair.  I just got my car back and it looks like new.  I'm thrilled with the quality and service and highly recommend Dennis at Ultimate Collision Repair on Pyle Road."
