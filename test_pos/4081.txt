b"We just really like this place.  There is something for everyone, so long as you're looking to have fun.  I've seen adults by themselves, families, teenagers, etc.  Even the little ones have a good time.  And you can't go wrong with a full bar.  I just wish I could take alcohol into the theater.  But still a great place no matter."
