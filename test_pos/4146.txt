b"My family and I had such a nice experience here! I'm not one to try new foods and this wouldn't be my first choice. However, this place was so great! The servers were so nice and very helpful with the menus and always checked on us. The food was good! And it was served on a big platter for all to share. It was beautifully displayed and over all, I think all 4 of us left happy. The best part...the bill came out to $23!! So shocking! I recommend people to try it! :)"
