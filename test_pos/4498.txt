b"I get my eyelashes done by Kylie and she is amazing! The eyelashes last for at least 2 weeks before I need a fill. I usually come in the 2nd or 3rd week! The membership is also a great deal for discounted prices and 2 lash fills per month! People ask me where I get my lashes done all the time and I recommend all of my friends to Ashley's Beauty Bar. Erika also did a great job on my nails. They haven't chipped at all and it has been weeks!"
