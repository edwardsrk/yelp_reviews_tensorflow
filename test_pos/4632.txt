b'This is our 3rd time here.  This place has an Asheville vibe.  The staff are all happy & ambitious.  The food is delivered fast, accurately, & is better for us than at most other places.  Homemade apple butter on the tables, honey instead of high fructose corn syrup jams, meatless alternatives, creative entree choices, breakfast potatoes that are baked rather than fried, very good grits, good portion sizes, and chicken sausage that is very good.  My husband typically hates chicken sausage, but actually loved it at Flying Biscuit!  Their bacon is turkey bacon & it too, is good.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!'
