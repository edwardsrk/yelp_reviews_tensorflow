b'I\'ve gotten a blowout here by Tomomi, and a haircut twice by Kazuma and Nuri. Everyone is very detail-oriented and I particularly like that they not only go for styles that suit your face shape, but also what kind of general "vibe" you prefer (such as cute, chic, etc.). I\'ve had long hair for over 5 years and wanted a change - Kazuma did an outstanding job making into a bob and then styling it afterwards. In between, he gave me some general tips on how to maintain and style short hair at home.Overall, this is probably the most noteworthy hair salon I know in Toronto, at least for Asian hair. It may be higher-end in terms of price but it\'s always worth it given the reliable and friendly service.'
