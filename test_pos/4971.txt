b"These are the best shoes on the planet. The man knows how to cut a stiletto- a stiletto that you can probably actually walk in. Your legs will look hot and you won't walk like a baby fawn on drugs. I try to restrain myself on the Blahniks, but it's worth the price to have those perfect evening sandals that work with everything. Price per wear, ladies- price per wear."
