b'This place is awesome. We have been coming here for over a year. The students are well trained and massages are at a much friendlier price than private places. The only drawback is that since they are students the same person will only be available for a limited time (usually a couple months before graduating). They also have pre-paid cards which get you an additional discount as well. We cone here on average 2x/month.'
