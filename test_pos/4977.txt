b"Our server, Lauren, was awesome.  She had great recommendations for beverages and dinner.  We were there celebrating our anniversary and had a great time.  We had the Filet feature with mac and cheese, creamed cheese (a must order!), gnocchi and mushrooms (there were too many great sides to choose from!).  We have eaten here many times and it has never disappointed.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!  They brought us a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating.  Can't wait to go back again!"
