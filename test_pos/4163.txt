b"We were in Las Vegas for a few days, and ran into this small (but expanding to next door, according to the owner) furniture store in a nice shopping area. The first thing caught our eyes was a king size mattress set for $200. It is firm, just the way we like it, & looks luxurious. We lay on it, it feels great. Similar sets at department stores would cost over $800 or $900 even on sale. Next is a leather sofa set. Nice and soft leather. Good workmanship. I forget how much it is, but very inexpensive as I remember commending on it. The rest of the store has some good quality furniture at unbelievable prices as far as we can tell. Many more choices are in several catalogs. The owner Juan Carlos was very nice to talk to, fluent in both English and Spanish. We didn't buy anything that day since we were not prepared to buy, but will certainly return for something. It looks like a family own business. Juan Carlos promised to give us a good deal when we are ready to purchase. Also, he says he will beat others by a major (don't want to commit him here) percentage. Will see. But just looking around we got a good feel at this place."
