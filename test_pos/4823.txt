b'Went here for my birthday lunch on April 12th. It was perfection...the best Asian buffet I have EVER had all for $8.95. They have a wide variety of sushi, Hibachi grill, traditional Chinese dishes, great desserts. I even ate SHARK!  I love squid. They had squid salad, stir fried squid, Chinese type squid. They had peeled shrimp, crawfish, oysters, clams, muscles....it was fabulous!'
