b"This pub is a thoroughly good time. I haven't seen the first floor, but the second floor is large. There is also a patio in the back. The stairs are carpeted with the British flag. The place has a nice laid-back vibe to it.. I haven't been to another pub which had music that knocked my socks off. They played Notorious B.I.G, Eric Clapton, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Queen, Led Zepellin, Ellie Goulding, OutKast, Daft Punk, back to back. It was as though the playlist was custom handpicked for me. The wall mounted big screens were airing NBA highlights. Night was made. My bf and I had Butler's Pale Ale, and also ordered nachos. Both were really good. The service is pretty good. We stayed here till 3 in the morning, and didn't get kicked out even though their official hours are till 2 am. Great pub-  will return if in the neighbourhood."
