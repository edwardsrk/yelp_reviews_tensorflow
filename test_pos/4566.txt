b'Literally one of the nicest and genuine people. Let me tell you, this woman took the time to stay late itln the night to fix my canary yellow hair the day before my wedding. She is awesome and the results were way more then i expected with the condition my hair was in. Very good at her trade and super nice. I even received a congratulations card for my wedding. Simply amazing!'
