b"Seriously the best! Super cheap compared to what I pay in CA. You seriously never have a bar tab for 5 people under $40, it's like not possible. So that's one reason I will forever be in love. Another reason is the food is awesome! Specifically the Pizza! Alcohol selection is limited , but they have enough to get the job done. Great local watering hole."
