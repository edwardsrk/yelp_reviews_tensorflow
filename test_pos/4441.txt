b"My best friend and her hubby brought me here with very high expectations and I can definitely say that this place had exceeded my expectations. All the toppings were superb especially their Speculos ice cream. The waffle is the big secret and it's amazing how perfect the consistency is. I will definitely make this my Pittsburgh habit."
