b"Best happy hour near me!! I come here all the time and usually get a beer, a large hot sake and the 777 roll. The rolls are always on point but the appetizers are hit or miss. I've learned to avoid the tuna poke and seaweed salad. The poke tuna is always gray, off-colored and squishy, like they just barely defrosted it and threw it into a bowl. The seaweed salad is always dry so I've stopped ordering it. BUT I still love this place and the service is amazing!! Probably gonna come here for lunch today to be honest haha. Love you guys!!!!"
