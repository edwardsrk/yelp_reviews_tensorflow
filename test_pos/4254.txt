b"The customer service at this place is ridiculously awesome. I will forever keep coming here in Vegas because of that. This place is owned and operated by a family. They do a great job of getting you in and out quickly while still being thorough. The son's foot massages are out of this world and you can keep your own personal pedicure box ( free of charge ) at the salon which is a great way to stay sanitary. They also bring you bottles of free water if you are thirsty and the prices are great! It's next to LEE'S LIQUOR if you have a hard time finding it."
