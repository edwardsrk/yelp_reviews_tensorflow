b'Great atmosphere, and best of all, great price. We were a group of 9 and we played with 2 tables (we were casual players) for 3 hours and we took out some soda drinks, the bill came down to less than 10 dollars per person. Pretty good deal for the chance to hang out with friends and play some pool.'
