b"This Starbucks is actually located inside the Albertson's grocery store.As far as Starbucks go, this one is the best I've been to. I frequent this one and pick up coffees for my office from time to time when I need to get out and get some fresh air. The drinks come out fast, have yet to be made incorrectly, and the staff is always friendly, courteous, and helpful. Not much else I could ask for in a coffee place!I think the coolest and most unique thing about this Starbucks, otherwise I probably wouldn't have written a review at all, is the location. You can find this Starbucks inside Albertson's right next to their magazine aisle! So grab your coffee, a magazine that looks interesting, and tuck in. Just be sure not to spill on it and return it to the shelf!"
