b"My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by not only the amazing service, but the super fun decor and attention to detail. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the beef and pork combination #3 and we're completely stuffed! The dessert was fabulous as well. Everything about this place is 5 stars. Even the bathrooms were kitschy and fun like the rest of the place. Highly recommend!"
