b"Finally! A place for good tacos! I'm from southern CA and love Baja style tacos and finally found some here in AZ. Homemade refried beans were yummy too and good rice! I had a prickly pear margarita with my meal which was a bonus. It's in a strip mall and it feels fast-foody (you order at the counter) but I didn't mind that. Will definitely be back when I want Mexican food."
