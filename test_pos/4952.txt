b"Fantastic!  They hit it out of the park.  Such a great vegan selection to choose from.  Everything was fresh.  The soy chicken satay were a great start to our meal.  The peanut sauce was amazing.  The drunken noodles and panang tofu were excellent.  We can't say enough good things about this place.  Definitely coming back very soon!!"
