b'Delightful new restaurant in Fountain Hills.  Had an enjoyable dinner here last evening with my husband.  Intimate atmosphere without be stuffy.  Food was excellent.  We shared the charcuterie platter which was more than enough for two people when you are ordering other items.  My husband had the Cuban panini and I had the Apple, Brie, and Avocado salad. Nice wine selection offered.  We will definitely return when we visit Arizona again in the fall.'
