b"I booked this place for my wedding. They did an amazing job on my nails and the gel nail polished stayed on until after the honeymoon! I liked the service so much I went back after my wedding for a new pedicure. I was kind of a 'difficult customer' with both appointments, so for me that speaks a lot to the staff that they did not give me any crap and assisted me professionally. I'm really appreciative of that.P.S. The only 1 star review for this place on Yelp is kind of untrue. While I was getting my second pedicure I noticed a diverse range of people. This place does not discriminate."
