b"What can I say, oh wait, I got it. I live in Washington state. I'll let that sink in. WASHINGTON STATE. A state renowned for its Apple's. And I have never had a better cider than at red clay.  This just after touring Asheville and South Carolina tasting the best local cider available. Let me provide some prospective, my wife and I love cider, we have tried all of the commercial ciders and reaserched and paired and WASHINGTON STATE! Anyhow, all of their ciders are what cider-lovers like us have been searching for. I CANNOT stress enough how good their cider is compared to any and all competitors. I CANNOT wait until they bottle so I can enjoy premium cider in Washington. In addition the staff are super friendly and willing to make any drink concoction of their available beverages that you can imagine. I suggest you try it, you will be amazed. All of this in a relaxed (dog friendly) atmosphere where I would have no problem watching a game or just hanging out. If you are reading this review, you must go and let your own tastebuds be the judge. I can write no more, I just wish I were going back . . ."
