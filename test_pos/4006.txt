b'Surprised my boyfriend for his 30th birthday by taking him here this morning! Price was fair (we even opted for the photo/video package which is totally worth it), staff showed excellent customer service, and the process was very smooth and well-timed. They allot for 4 hours, but we were there just under 2 (probably because we were the first group of the day). Highly recommend these guys!'
