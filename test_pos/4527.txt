b"Going to start off by saying this is hands down my favourite place to order Chinese food in the whole city! No doubt the prices are amazing and the people who work there are all really friendly and love their customers. I always order the same items:Chicken fried rice - simple and amazing, the rice never sticks and is always delivered hot warm and so delicious. Egg rolls - they are really proud to serve them and they make them in-store I believe! Really delicious. Chicken balls - OMG without a doubt the best chicken balls! The batter is not too heavy or too light. The chicken to batter ratio is about 50/50 which is perfect! The chicken inside is always juicy and seasoned!Chicken wings - simply deep fried and delicious. Lemon chicken - chicken is a must the batter is thick BUT very very crispy tasty batter, the sauce is decent but the chicken itself is legendary. This place is a Westernized Chinese food place, yeah it's gonna be greasy but coincidentally this place just nails it. Never have I received an order where there was a tone of grease in the boxes.  It is hands down the best in Toronto for your Chinese fix. Also they have 5 cent specials where you can order a whole dish if you spend a certain amount. Enjoy!"
