b'I really like this place, it was cozy. The decoration is very nice and reasonable price as well. I also like the employee who works there, mostly owner of the store.  She was very nice enough to have patience with me as i told her that i am too sensitive,  although i get my eyebrows done all the time.  This place is going to be my fav place from now. I would suggest this place to my friends and family.'
