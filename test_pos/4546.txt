b"I am lactose intolerant and love ice cream and I couldn't truly get behind the ice cream alternatives, then I found Nami and their delicious vegan soft serve. I come probably twice a week and take extras home to eat throughout the week. Amazing place to go to. They have really good vegan pastries as well. Have not had their coffee or brunch but if it is anything like their sweets it is going to be phenomenal. The staff is always very friendly as well. Wish I lived closer then I would be here all the time"
