b"Came here with a couple friends and we got the 6 course meal, and it was amazing. Very fresh and delicious. I don't remember the names of all the dishes, there were a few hot dishes and nigiri/sashimi plates. I loved the dessert, I got the matcha cheesecake with strawberry sorbet, my friends got the chocolate mousse with black sesame ice cream."
