b"A cafe with a shop up front, this place serves up some serious brunch food. There are a lot of brunch plates that come in cast iron skillets, as well as bagel breakfasts (get the famous Montr\xc3\xa9al bagel!) and other small items. I got the brunch with ham, sausage and bacon, complete with scrambled eggs, duck fat potatoes and baked beans on the side. It was scrumptious and delicious! The bacon wasn't the thinly sliced kind, but a hunk of pork belly, which had a hint of sweetness and was very tender. The portion was quite large and I couldn't finish it - plus by the end I really wanted some veggies to go with it. Sort of my fault for ordering the meatiest item on the menu, really. The service was ok (bit slow but similar to other places in town), and the shop in front was lovely and sold a lot of local foodstuff - perfect for a tourist to take back home!"
