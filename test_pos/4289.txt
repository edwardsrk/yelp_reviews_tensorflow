b'Being from LA where they have a lot of good sushi joints it tool a while for me to find something good in Vegas but here it is at last. I have been going to I Love Sushi for about a year now and never have i had a bad experience. Its always busy so you know the food is always fresh. My favorite roll is I Love My Ass and Spring Mt Roll. Another good item is the Screaming Orgasms and i usually ask them not to sear the tuna I think its a lot better that way.'
