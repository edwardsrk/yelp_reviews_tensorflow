b"Murdock Meals has been cooking for myself and my family for over 5 years.  When I was on the HCG diet, the food was amazing and all meals were made to follow the strict rules of the diet. I never knew 500 calories a day could taste so good.   My boyfriend has diabetes and needed a low carb low sugar menu.  She accommodated his needs and helped get his diabetes under control.  Then he had his jaw wired shut after a medical problem, and she made all the diabetic meals into liquid that could be eaten through a straw.  I joined a gym called Raw fitness that gave you a meal plan consisting of healthy proteins and lots of vegetables.  I am a terrible cook and I did not want to fail on this fitness program.  Again, Murdock Meals came to the rescue and cooked for me per the instructions.  Finally, my boyfriend is currently in the hospital and cannot stomach the hospital's food.  I called Murdock Meals and he is now getting the nutrition he needs to get better.To conclude, whatever your diet requirements might be, Murdock Meals can accommodate.  The food is cooked to order fresh, delicious, and affordable.  Even if you can cook (unlike me) and do not have enough hours in your day, I highly recommend Murdock Meals."
