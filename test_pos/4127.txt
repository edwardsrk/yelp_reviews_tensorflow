b'My dear love and I arrived just as the sun was going down for a quick bite after the Arizona State Fair. I was prepared to be frightened and off put by a to young too hip crowd but I was more than pleasantly surprised. Windsor is a delightful venue, comfortable and spacious and pretty with an interesting menu. We had a specialty cocktail featuring orange water, rum and marmalade and it was de-lish-es.  We also had a nice brown pag chicken sandwich and a side of mac and cheese which is almost always too ironic for me but it was very tasty. All in all an excellent experience. Parking was a hassle and an annoyance-valet parking is probably the only bad thing that the owners of this place inflict on the customers (here and at the other stores they own). That said, despite the parking annoyance we will be back. I enjoyed the entire experience and my dear love was very happy. Just remember no day but today.'
