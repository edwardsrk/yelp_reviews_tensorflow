b"You get to a certain age and beer just doesn't cut it anymore. Don Draper has changed the drinking lifestyle to look cool when having a cocktail. This is the place to get the best whisky and scotch drinks. Plenty of choices with some exclusively to Whiskey Down. Old fashioned and Sazerac drinks with good music played by a DJ. No cover. Close restroom and nice chairs, tables and barstools. Don't pass this place up on your way from the valet to Hakkasan. You won't regret it"
