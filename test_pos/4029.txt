b'I was a patient here when they were An Elegant Smile and was very happy with them. The only reason I left was bc they weren\'t open on the weekends. I went to Dental Depot and that was a mistake. I came back and am just as happy as I was when I left. Now they\'re Gentle Dental, Rio Vista. They explain what is going on with your teeth, what treatment plan needs to be done, and schedule you while you\'re in the office. The staff is always friendly and very good at putting you at ease. On the opposite, Dental Depot (Greenway) barely gave me anything more than "You need thousands of dollars worth of work", but I could never seem get them to go into detail about what was needed and why without playing 20 questions. They were always confused that I was ready to schedule my next appointment in the office and would tell me to just call when I was ready... I\'m... I was... I\'ve missed An Elegant Smile/Gentle Dental and I\'m so glad to be back! If there were to be any "complaint" it\'s that when I tried to establish them as my dentist with Cigna, their information was difficult to find in Cigna\'s system. Perhaps they\'re listed by a corporate phone number.'
