b'Great overall service!!!  From the sales person (Larry) who drafted a perfect pool for us to the project manager (Kory) who was fantastic!!  He constantly kept us informed on the status of our pool being built at the same time as our home was being built. Kory went out of his way to satisfy and exceed our expectations. We had a negative issue at pool dig time, but after it was discussed with company owner we came to a solution to our satisfaction. They have also done a fabulous job responding to a couple issues AFTER THEY HAD ALL THEIR MONEY. They continue to satisfy our expectations now doing some follow up work. Good pool company.'
