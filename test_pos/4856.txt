b"My go to hair salon.I had a hard time getting an appointment here for a cut and color but it was well worth the wait. They don't overbook their stylists so they concentrate on only one customer at a time. I've never had to wait around for my stylist. The stylists there pay close attention to detail and I always leave satisfied. However the store is very small and a little bit cramped and they do have a 15 dollar minimum for the card machine."
