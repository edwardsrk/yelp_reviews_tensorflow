b'SLC Realty was a great place to rent from while I was at Pitt. Scott went out of his way to help with any issues we had. Maintenance request were always taken care of within 24 hours. They kept their properties in great condition and rent was affordable. All bedrooms were fully furnished which took a lot of stress of moving into and out of the house. I would definitely recommend them to anyone moving to the Oakland area.'
