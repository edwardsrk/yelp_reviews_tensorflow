b"This folks are the best!!  Let me tell you how I found this gem!  Traveling to Scottsdale for family visit, recently had major repairs done on my Subaru.  Upon arrival from Salt Lake my wife smelt coolant!!  Next day I called my mechanic and they referred me to Tech Net for national referral.  They provided two numbers some beemer place that never returned my call and Richard's Auto Clinic.  Called Richard's and Lori was friendly and was way helpful, got an address and directions.  Headed over, got us in rapidly.  While we waited we're provided drinks and a comfortable waiting room.  Their customer service is top notch!!! Lori took time to help me figure out a different auto related issue!!  Very kind and thoughtful.  All said and done two loose hose clamps!  Thank God!  Invited us to friend them on Facebook and also asked we let them know when we make it home!  On top of that she let me know that if anything else happened to get the car back and they would get on it first thing Monday.  Let's hope that doesn't happen but having piece of mind that there are kind and thoughtful mechanics out there is outstanding!  Richard's Auto Clinic on the outside is unassuming but inside... the reception, attentiveness and genuineness is incredible!  If you need a mechanic THIS IS YOUR PLACE."
