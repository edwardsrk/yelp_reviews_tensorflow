b"Wow! I remember seeing this place open up near my apartment. Didn't look like much but me being the way I am insisted on trying it. Apparently it's everything I ever dreamed of: asian buffet (good quality food as opposed to the crap you find on most asian buffets), and ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI!When I found out about the ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI I kinda felt unnerved at the idea, presuming it would most likely be pretty gross. Man was I ever proved wrong. I have eaten in a lot of Toronto's sushi joints and this place definitely has some of the best sushi in town.As for the environment it is very clean. Washrooms are beautiful. Servers are all very nice when you can get their attention. Though they have gotten better. When we first started going in we were some of their first customers so we got astounding service. When the pace started to pick-up though we noticed the quality of service diminish. But they have made some good improvements. They're a new business so I'll give them a break this time I guess.If there were any quirks about the place I'd have to point out it would be their hilarious selection of music. Some nights you will go in and it will be good ol asian music straight through. But other times we have been in there you get the classic asian music mixed with unbelievably random songs ranging from forgot about dre (Dr. Dre and Slim Shady) to what I think was a bootlegged Iron Maiden song. All in all one of my favourite spots in the city if your looking for a good meal for an awesome price.Speaking of price, lunch is from 1100-1600 and costs $10 for the buffet. After 1600 its $14. On weekend add $2 to both of those prices.Also, Oishi Sushi was just recently licensed to serve liquor and their beer is dirt cheap at less than $4 a bottle (domestic)!!!If your ever up in the Downsview area be sure to hit this place up. Would recommend over any Wasabi and maybe even over the Mandarine with Oishi Sushi introduction of Crab Legs to their dinner buffet!"
