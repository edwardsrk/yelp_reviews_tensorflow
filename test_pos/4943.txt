b"Jed was amazing.  I am currently looking to buy my first house, and have had a few inspections done by other inspectors on potential places.  Jed was by far more thorough and technologically advanced than anyone else.  He spent over 3 hours inspecting the 1000 sq foot condo I was looking at!  He didn't miss a thing, and his report was emailed less than 24 hrs later, with pictures and explanations of everything.  It was because of him that I was made aware of extensive water damage in one of the walls, and I decided to walk from the property because of it and potential mold issues.  I'm still house hunting, and I will definitely use Jed every time I need an inspection!"
