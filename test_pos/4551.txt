b"I ate here today with some trepidation because of previous reviews. I knew the food would be great - and it was. My friend had the shrimp rellenos which was superior. Another friend had the chicken salad - superb. My cheese enchiladas reminded me of home - San Antonio! Contrary to other reviewers I have to commend the management on the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our waitress spoke fluent English and the service was good. Don't miss an opportunity to dine here - you won't regret it"
