b"Cheese, chocolate, meat, wine... need I say more? What's really nice about The Melting Pot is the consistent high quality. Every time we come we have a great experience. Great service too. We're big fans of the Thursday night specials for cheese and chocolate, not to mention half price glasses of wine!"
