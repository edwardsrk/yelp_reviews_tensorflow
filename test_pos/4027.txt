b'This was my first time going and I can say that I am not disappointed and will be returning for sure I ordered the Chicago style deep medium pie and it took around 15 minutes to come. As I was waiting the owner Paul came out to talk to me about how I heard about his restaurant, and overall he was a super friendly person which made the dining at the restaurant that much warmer. Overall my experience with the restaurant was a 5 out of 5 as my experience there was good with the owner and the food was excellent.'
