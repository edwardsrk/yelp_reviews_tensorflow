b'They tested out a new breakfast menu today! I ordered the French Toast Sammich, which is a bit out of my comfort zone because I tend not to mix my food up. The thick slices of bread were cooked perfectly, nice and french-toasty on the outside yet soft and somewhat dense inside. Add a sausage patty, crispy bacon strips, a fried egg and cheese and it was a fantastic balance of savory and sweet, crispy and soft.My guy ordered the Hatch Green Chile Tri-tip breakfast, also very good. Served on a bed of hashbrowns with tortillas on the side too. As for my sons, they both got the breakfast biscuit sliders with gravy. While they were tasty, the homemade gravy really hit the spot!'
