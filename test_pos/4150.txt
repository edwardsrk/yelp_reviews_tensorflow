b'Talk about "Johnny on the spot"!!  Our A/C went out last night.  We have two units.  One is down and the other is on its last leg.  They are 17 years old.  Our home warranty company (Old Republic) connected us with AMI.  It\'s Memorial Day Weekend, 3-day holiday, the unit went out on Saturday night.  It\'s 100\xc2\xba outside and was 85\xc2\xba in our house and climbing.  Very bad situation.  I called John and left a message.  He called me back in 15 minutes and had one of his techs (Joe) out here in another 20 minutes.  The AC that was not working well is now fixed and our house is cooling.  They gave us a great quote to replace one or both units.  I HIGHLY recommend John and his crew!!  They were our saviours today!!  :)'
