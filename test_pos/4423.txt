b'Rob and his crew are professionals. Pricing is fair and the quality of work is top notch. Took them 1 1/2 days to complete a paver/turf project for 600 sq ft of what was once dirt and rock (before and after pictures to follow). Being a smaller business than many other landscaping companies in Vegas, it might be a challenge to contact them, but I advise you guys to stick with it and be patient. Your patience will be rewarded with excellence and pride in work. Once the work began, their crew spent as much time required to make sure everything was perfect. I have nothing bad to say about Rob and his team. Highly recommended!'
