b'Great food and service! We ordered the shrimp appetizer and got the pretzels on a kitchen error as well. Both were incredible!Dinner was the burger and beet salad for us. Pro tip: get the burger with bacon, avocado, and a friend egg. Extremely satisfying and filling.Drinks and food came out quick and the service was great. Anthony checked in with us just the right amount and was quick to get us what we needed.A great place to stop when downtown - close to the stadiums if going to a game or concert.'
